1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,922
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday January 13th 2016.

2
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:15,393
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:19,528
Speaker 1: instead of talking about hog hawks We're talking about my little pony.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:29,498
Speaker 1: friendship is magic in its continuance since we talked about it once a long time ago and More ponies to come out since then and I did a long opener just now.

5
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,506
Speaker 1: Cuz Scott doesn't like it when I do that.

6
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:33,153
Speaker 1: It's not good Burma shave.

7
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,699
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:51,451
Speaker 1: So I made a vow that I wouldn't talk about my bicycle commute at any point for 2015 in the beginning of geek nights and it's now 2016 and someone reminds me I can totally talk about my bike commute again and In some sort of gift of the Magi bullshit.

9
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,339
Speaker 1: It's winter and I'm not biking to work.

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,627
Speaker 0: Why don't you bike to work in the cold?

11
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:55,392
Speaker 0: I see people doing it.

12
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:56,639
Speaker 0: I thought it's not snowing.

13
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,748
Speaker 1: I've actually thought about it a bunch of times.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,520
Speaker 0: you like buying fancy equipment that I refuse to buy.

15
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,808
Speaker 1: I already have that equipment because it's the same kind of stuff.

16
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,713
Speaker 1: I use when I ski sometimes.

17
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:13,620
Speaker 1: The only reason I haven't is That I usually wake up and it's kind of too late to get all that shit together.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Speaker 1: Like it's a it's a production to put on the stuff to be able to bike in the cold like that.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,592
Speaker 0: Sure, but I mean if I bike to work I get there sooner than taking the subways these days.

20
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,074
Speaker 1: Yeah.

21
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:22,515
Speaker 1: Yeah.

22
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,224
Speaker 1: Yeah That's fine though.

23
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:25,967
Speaker 1: Cuomo's got a plan.

24
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:29,080
Speaker 1: They're gonna shut down like half the subway for multiple years.

25
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,989
Speaker 0: That'll make the train go faster except no won't?

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,575
Speaker 1: it's all cosmetic work primarily.

27
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:33,996
Speaker 1: Yeah.

28
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,331
Speaker 0: No, it'll make the train go faster Skipping those stations.

29
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,660
Speaker 1: Oh in the interim At least they're not shutting down my station.

30
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:45,760
Speaker 0: So and they're shutting down only one of the two stations that are equidistant from me on the same train.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,460
Speaker 1: So they might shut down the L into Manhattan, which actually might be a disaster.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,840
Speaker 1: I think more humans commute on that subway then live in most counties in the US.

33
00:01:55,302 --> 00:02:00,120
Speaker 1: Good like I think I think more economic harm will happen by that one subway line being down.

34
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:04,640
Speaker 0: Then if multiple cities got nuked in the US, I mean, this is a person who's on the way out, right?

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,479
Speaker 0: You know, it's like he's basically just fucking everything up on the way out like aha

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you

37
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:14,140
Speaker 0: wouldn't do this at the start of your term because then you get unelected the next time

38
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,135
Speaker 1: He's doing all this stuff and then he's doing all this PR saying hey, New York.

39
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:23,779
Speaker 1: I got your back I think the regular old Democrats not to get into New York State politics too much.

40
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:38,580
Speaker 1: We're worried that yeah Cuomo won the governorship But Zephyr teach-out got like the majority of the vote in New York City Of course cities starting to turn against upstate real hard because upstate can eat a dick.

41
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:40,391
Speaker 1: But I digress.

42
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:41,558
Speaker 1: that's my opening bed.

43
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,527
Speaker 1: That's what I got for the first part.

44
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:48,179
Speaker 0: They're all the most all 99.9 percent of listeners who don't live in New York.

45
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:49,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

46
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,396
Speaker 1: You guys should live in New York.

47
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,253
Speaker 0: You should even if they did live in New York.

48
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,469
Speaker 0: if this is the New York podcast No one wants to hear about are you getting?

49
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,153
Speaker 1: that's all guy.

50
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:58,280
Speaker 1: I subscribe to the Gothamist.

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,258
Speaker 1: That's all the Gothamist is is stuff like that?

52
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,090
Speaker 1: It's just like hey, no, look at this thing.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,180
Speaker 0: I subscribe to the Gothamist for pizza rat stories.

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,946
Speaker 1: Do you see how pizza rat was fabricated?

55
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:10,438
Speaker 1: That's fine that same person you fabricated all those rat videos.

56
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:10,980
Speaker 0: I don't care.

57
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:11,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just.

58
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:12,972
Speaker 0: I mean I see I have.

59
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,180
Speaker 0: that's the level everything.

60
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,286
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't trust any.

61
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,700
Speaker 1: get you guys probably heard about our pizza rat.

62
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:21,340
Speaker 1: You have no idea that there was a conspiracy to create pizza rat.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,588
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I don't believe anything.

64
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:26,740
Speaker 1: I read the internet anyway, so yeah, I mean it did happen.

65
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,934
Speaker 1: It was just contrived.

66
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:32,300
Speaker 1: Sure It's like when you see two cosplayers do a funny skit in the middle of an anime con.

67
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:33,995
Speaker 1: They plan that shit ahead of time.

68
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:34,580
Speaker 0: No kidding.

69
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:42,980
Speaker 1: So, uh in other news bunch of Anna Twitter was sort of talking about how Netflix changed the way categories work and how?

70
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:47,557
Speaker 1: Anime just shows up in its normal category instead of in the anime category.

71
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,220
Speaker 1: Hooray.

72
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:52,600
Speaker 1: So I thought hey, that'll be good news for geek nights cuz I get a lot to say about that.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,303
Speaker 0: But is it true?

74
00:03:53,323 --> 00:04:01,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I went poking around and there was no article saying that this happened and I basically had to do some investigative journalism.

75
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,240
Speaker 1: So I logged into Netflix actually forgot my password for Netflix.

76
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,100
Speaker 1: So it took me a minute and I logged in and sure enough the anime category is still there.

77
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:21,880
Speaker 1: But if you go to sci-fi Sci-fi anime just show up with everything else like they're normal like they're just popular media alongside some cartoons.

78
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:34,880
Speaker 0: I really like to see that data on whether some animes get more watched or how many people who've never watched anime before watch One and things of that nature and what pages people click on anime series from to begin watching them.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,596
Speaker 0: Like our anime is only getting watched by clicks from the anime category page.

80
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:39,560
Speaker 0: or are they getting watches?

81
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,919
Speaker 0: You know from the sci-fi page?

82
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:52,558
Speaker 1: because frankly we've talked about this like tangentially on a bunch of other gig nights episodes and pretty much anyone who knows about the anime and comics industry knows about this.

83
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:59,224
Speaker 1: but Basically anime and manga are crazy popular in the u.s Mad popular.

84
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:05,369
Speaker 1: yet the press talks about comics like they sell at all Like they're like, oh they talk about.

85
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,485
Speaker 1: oh some Superman comic sold You know 10,000 copies.

86
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:09,926
Speaker 1: crazy.

87
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:20,080
Speaker 1: Holy shit, and they kind of forget that like any given shit Oh manga sells more than like the sit like number two through number nine in the top ten lists.

88
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:25,053
Speaker 0: I mean attack on Titan out sells like Batman and Superman and all that stuff.

89
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:25,474
Speaker 1: Yeah,

90
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:25,876
Speaker 0: so

91
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:37,900
Speaker 1: the media coverage of American comics Makes it seem like they're very popular But in reality they pretty much get outsold by random shoujo manga number four

92
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:46,720
Speaker 0: The New York Times has two as two lists, you know, because they manage all these bestseller lists and you know This is the main, you know, New York Times bestseller list of books of novels, right?

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,108
Speaker 0: but they have a whole bunch of other ones way down there and they have a graphic novel bestseller list and then they have a separate Manga bestseller list.

94
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,174
Speaker 0: and why do they have this?

95
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:56,199
Speaker 0: because they didn't have it.

96
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:58,574
Speaker 0: It would just be the manga bestseller list.

97
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:04,660
Speaker 0: because you know Even the top things on the not manga bestseller list like don't come close.

98
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like what's near the top of the graphic novel bestsellers.

99
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:12,520
Speaker 0: good stuff really great stuff Like I think Kate beaten princess and the pony was up there.

100
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:13,599
Speaker 1: That's good stuff.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,835
Speaker 0: But as much as I love Kate beaten and bought that book and you should do and buy the stuffed animal But I didn't buy that.

102
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,629
Speaker 0: It doesn't outsell attack on Titan.

103
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:35,596
Speaker 1: So I think this is a really big deal because Most people I know who got into anime from nothing who aren't just ultra nerds Get into it either because a friend tricks him into watching some anime and they're like, oh shit.

104
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:41,080
Speaker 1: That was good or They stumble onto it because they were looking for a sci-fi movie.

105
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:46,690
Speaker 0: Well, it's also you know people when they think of the popular of anime They try to think of like the number of anime fans.

106
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:53,074
Speaker 0: and first of all that number is a lot bigger than people think They're just not paying attention to the fact how big like anime Expo is.

107
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you're talking about comic cons.

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,652
Speaker 1: All right, there's two or three comic cons that are big most comic cons.

109
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:00,860
Speaker 1: I have attendance in the thousands.

110
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:09,160
Speaker 1: Meanwhile Otacon if you count the way comic cons do has like 90,000 plus people at it and no one talks about it, right?

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 0: So you also had to consider the fact is all these people who aren't anime fans, right?

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,805
Speaker 0: They wouldn't say that they're an anime fan.

113
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,891
Speaker 0: They don't go to anime news network.

114
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,640
Speaker 0: They don't follow anime people on Twitter, right?

115
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,394
Speaker 0: They don't go to anime convention, but they watch an anime.

116
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,600
Speaker 0: They watch a lot of animes.

117
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:28,888
Speaker 1: I know I run into a lot of people who've seen my mom My mom watches animes.

118
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:36,817
Speaker 0: all the kids at the high school know what Dragon Ball is Right, even today high school kids like kids who are 16 right now watch Dragon Ball know what it is, right?

119
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, they know that Soul Leaders Like, you know.

120
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:46,460
Speaker 0: now if you ask them if they're an anime fan, they'd be like no, but you know They're into like video games or something.

121
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,940
Speaker 1: Maybe they're right but but this is a big deal because the anime ghetto has to go away in certain like in Netflix and everything.

122
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,766
Speaker 0: All ghettos need to go away.

123
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,794
Speaker 1: No, yeah, that's the whole point of gig nights.

124
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,600
Speaker 1: geek, you know broaden your horizons.

125
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,444
Speaker 1: you should listen to all the gig nights and be into games and anime and Politics even though Scott's not into politics, but I am I'm a nerd about politics But anyway time.

126
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:12,000
Speaker 1: so I yeah, I'm right here in the sci-fi and fantasy on Netflix.

127
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:19,257
Speaker 1: So there's that old live-action He-Man Masters of the Universe Jules Verne center Jules Verne center of the earth like the old.

128
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,030
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Center the earth is a good book.

129
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:26,290
Speaker 1: the forgotten berserk Oh that anime berserk is just hanging out right here.

130
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,631
Speaker 1: next to all that shit some Star Trek Full metal alchemist is in here little witch academia.

131
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:33,134
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

132
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:34,337
Speaker 1: The little witch academia is here.

133
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:38,196
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I forgot that came out like we should watch that like real soon.

134
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:43,339
Speaker 1: Yep uh, I cannot stress to you enough how important it is that Netflix did this.

135
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:48,336
Speaker 1: and Also how don't subscribe to crunchyroll just subscribe to Hulu.

136
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,400
Speaker 1: most of the anime is in there.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,693
Speaker 0: That's where most crunchyrolls adding a bunch of new animes recently.

138
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:55,905
Speaker 0: I mean new to crunchyroll anime Yeah, but it's like.

139
00:08:56,266 --> 00:09:00,280
Speaker 0: Hulu has all the anime you actually want to watch right now and you can get the ad-free version.

140
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:05,340
Speaker 0: I guess if you finish watching everything on Hulu Then you could sign up for crunchyroll and watch the other stuff.

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,036
Speaker 0: The one thing I miss from the crunchyroll who doesn't have are the weirdo anime.

142
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:16,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Like folk tales from Japan, which is still one of my favorite shows our news Our news.

143
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,614
Speaker 0: You know the weirdo ones, but that's okay.

144
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean she by denial, yeah that one.

145
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:41,649
Speaker 1: so in other news we were talking about this before the show, but there's an old penny arcade comic where one of the characters like is off and there's two characters sitting there and suddenly a weird clock rings and the stars align and Someone's like that clock.

146
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,820
Speaker 0: never you don't remember what that comic was about.

147
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,656
Speaker 1: And then Gabe jumps in being like hit points.

148
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:52,139
Speaker 0: mana Right because basically, you know at that time period right?

149
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,200
Speaker 0: Mike Krahulik right Gabe was a person who did not play the RPGs at all.

150
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,375
Speaker 0: He was not didn't play didn't play the Final Fantasies or the dnds, right?

151
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:03,880
Speaker 1: So he wasn't paying attention.

152
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,539
Speaker 0: the Jerry Holkins.

153
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,566
Speaker 0: You know the tight the bald taiko In the comic.

154
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:21,807
Speaker 0: he was the D&D dice-rolling type of person and You know at that point in time is when you know the clock rang For the first time.

155
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,260
Speaker 0: and now Mike Krahulik is like making RPGs and shit.

156
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,220
Speaker 1: He's like the D&D master, but that you know, I feel like the Lupin clock might be ringing again.

157
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a clock that never rings.

158
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,520
Speaker 0: It's a clock that hasn't rung in a while.

159
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:41,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he had played RPGs other RPGs in the past just kind of stops Like them and we want to play.

160
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:41,310
Speaker 0: that.

161
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,319
Speaker 1: I mean remember when PC gaming was dead Yeah, and then suddenly there was a tolling in the distance and gave in.

162
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,559
Speaker 0: well You know Lupin is one of those things with the people in charge of it.

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,300
Speaker 0: So wisely, you know bring it up and hide it away and then bring it up and hide away.

164
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,247
Speaker 0: It was always there.

165
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:56,851
Speaker 0: you'd get old.

166
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:58,361
Speaker 1: thing is it is always there It's just.

167
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,855
Speaker 1: there's a lot of shitty Lupin's that came out for a long time.

168
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:16,520
Speaker 1: Not like not recently though Yeah, so pretty Fujiko Mine came out and it was crazy good and it brought a style of animation and storytelling that Deeply rustles my jimmies in a good way and that shows fantastic.

169
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:22,100
Speaker 1: So a bunch more Lupin came out after that in a similar style like the grave of jig and dice.

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Speaker 0: There's a brand new Lupin likes the fourth season or whatever.

171
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:32,349
Speaker 1: So Emily and I are actually going through from Fujiko Mine Onward of every Lupin that's come out since then.

172
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:34,015
Speaker 1: we're just watching them as fast as we can.

173
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:34,517
Speaker 0: why not?

174
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:35,340
Speaker 1: because they're great.

175
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:40,860
Speaker 1: So there's a new Lupin the third TV special coming out.

176
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:46,519
Speaker 1: I guess it came out in January 8th, so it just came out real recently called Lupin the third the Italian game.

177
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,989
Speaker 1: and My thing of the day is just you know when we get to?

178
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,960
Speaker 1: that is just the trailer for this TV special.

179
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,980
Speaker 1: But holy shit did that clock just ring so hard that it exploded?

180
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Speaker 0: I hope that this trailer that none of the things in the trailer are actually in the movie.

181
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:10,180
Speaker 1: I hope that all but one of the things in the trailer are in the movie, but happen in the first five minutes.

182
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:19,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the tree if this TV special the trailer is just a flashback Lupin has during the movie.

183
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:25,960
Speaker 1: yeah, holy Shit, did I forget how much I love Lupin when Lupin is good?

184
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,532
Speaker 1: Also, this is the rare blue jacket Lupin.

185
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:31,923
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah Not green.

186
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:48,879
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about it any further because this is the kind of thing if you're an anime fan at all just watch It and if you're not an anime fan, and you like anything even remotely vestigially similar to James Bond watch some Lupin.

187
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:55,620
Speaker 0: So if you want to talk about bells that ring and ring and ring and ring and never stop ringing and never will stop ringing Even after we die.

188
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,912
Speaker 0: Pokemon is 20 years old.

189
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:00,386
Speaker 1: God damn it.

190
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:16,374
Speaker 1: That means when Pokemon came into existence in Japan I was like 14 or something which is weird because it's kind of like that Preferage farm remembers where you kind of forget that things didn't exist forever Like I remember when Pokemon came into existence.

191
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,620
Speaker 0: I saw it in a game Pro magazine.

192
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,539
Speaker 0: I was like oh, there's some kids game why they making a big deal out of it.

193
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then my brother got it on his Gameboy pocket And then I played it a little bit and I was like, oh I didn't realize this thing.

194
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:31,889
Speaker 0: that looked like garbage from a few pictures of you know Pikachu was actually earthbound.

195
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,840
Speaker 1: see no one near me got into it in high school.

196
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:40,651
Speaker 1: So when I was at RIT, I bet like I knew what Pokemon was I didn't really care about it or think about you where I was.

197
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 0: we were poke battling in high school.

198
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:43,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was not.

199
00:13:44,027 --> 00:13:51,647
Speaker 1: so I when I started paying attention to Pokemon I just had this sense that it had been around Forever like as long as I'd lived like.

200
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,614
Speaker 1: I couldn't think back to the origin of it.

201
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,059
Speaker 1: I can yeah you can.

202
00:13:56,281 --> 00:14:07,300
Speaker 0: So, uh, so it's 20 years old and to celebrate this 20th anniversary They're re-releasing like 3ds's that have Pokemon red or blue installed and they're doing stuff with the CCG.

203
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,860
Speaker 0: They're basically going all out for this arbitrary number.

204
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:14,638
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine what they're gonna do five years from now for the 25th anniversary or the 50th.

205
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,902
Speaker 0: I hope to see it.

206
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:16,264
Speaker 0: You know what?

207
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,688
Speaker 1: So the 25th anniversary?

208
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:21,080
Speaker 1: because by then that Pokemon ingress AR game will be in full swing.

209
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:26,383
Speaker 1: so on the 25th anniversary what's gonna happen probably is Everyone's.

210
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,240
Speaker 1: pokédar is gonna start going off to set up some giant event.

211
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:39,540
Speaker 1: Yeah and then every kid in the world is gonna converge on like these Monoliths in the centers of cities and then the message will come in there is a gun taped to the bottom of your chair.

212
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,970
Speaker 0: So there's a Pokemon p-cross.

213
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,104
Speaker 0: I'm playing a lot right now, by the way I like p-cross.

214
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,730
Speaker 0: Why what's wrong p-cross?

215
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,914
Speaker 1: boring Sudoku?

216
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,857
Speaker 1: It's the same as Sudoku.

217
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:49,740
Speaker 0: It's better than Sudoku.

218
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:49,941
Speaker 0: How?

219
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,244
Speaker 0: so you get a picture at the end?

220
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:51,766
Speaker 0: Yeah.

221
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,533
Speaker 1: Okay, you get a a one-bit picture.

222
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,255
Speaker 1: Well, I guess not one.

223
00:14:55,355 --> 00:15:04,946
Speaker 0: also unlike Sudoku You can get really really big ones that are much more complex and interesting without making them like, you know Impossible and unfun.

224
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:11,900
Speaker 0: if I may if I give you a Sudoku that's like enormous with really tiny squares You know that goes to like one to a hundred in each row and column.

225
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,703
Speaker 0: You're like fuck that.

226
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,635
Speaker 0: but if I give you a p-cross, that's like 30 by 15.

227
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,760
Speaker 0: It's like that's doable.

228
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,392
Speaker 1: They fuck that and just play Advance Wars.

229
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:30,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So one other thing that they're doing that's really fascinating is they have paid for a Pokemon 20th anniversary Superb owl commercial.

230
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:33,546
Speaker 0: Oh I want to see this commercial.

231
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:34,470
Speaker 1: What are they gonna?

232
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,013
Speaker 1: is that gonna?

233
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,439
Speaker 1: are they gonna launch something with that?

234
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:37,523
Speaker 1: I don't know.

235
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,007
Speaker 1: gonna be some big launch announcement.

236
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:43,079
Speaker 0: a live-action commercial will air during the Superb owl on February 7th.

237
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:46,059
Speaker 1: I I'll bet it's for the AR stuff.

238
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:52,080
Speaker 0: I don't know if I will promote the 20th anniversary's train on motto train on.

239
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:56,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, as it as in keep on training Pokemon not get on the train.

240
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:57,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe it is.

241
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,664
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll introduce a train.

242
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:00,769
Speaker 0: I know it's train on like keep training.

243
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,457
Speaker 0: go for it trainers Pokemon training.

244
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:11,784
Speaker 1: Yeah Things of the day, like I said, my thing of the day is the opening to Lupin.

245
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,390
Speaker 1: the third the Italian game.

246
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,055
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

247
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,450
Speaker 1: Do I want to watch this real bad?

248
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:26,370
Speaker 1: I also want to watch it pretty bad Like if you can imagine a video designed to make me filled with determination to see something.

249
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:29,585
Speaker 1: This is like when we saw the beginning of project blue earth cheeky.

250
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,001
Speaker 1: Oh, we were like, holy shit This has everything and then we were let down.

251
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,166
Speaker 1: so I hope this doesn't let me down.

252
00:16:34,186 --> 00:16:45,330
Speaker 0: Hmm This is YouTube channel, I discovered by someone linked to one of their videos, which is the one I'm gonna talk about Which is called retro blasting and they basically just review really old stuff, right?

253
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:56,769
Speaker 0: Like, you know Ninja Turtles cartoon spider-man amazing friends and you know, Indiana Jones toys from back in the day You know nerdy 80s 70s stuff, whatever.

254
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:06,252
Speaker 0: But the videos are well produced actually and they have this one video that is about the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon the old Now.

255
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,329
Speaker 0: that's a cartoon that you know.

256
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:14,970
Speaker 0: My memory of seeing like one and a half episodes was not positive because it was also it was kind of before our time.

257
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:15,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

258
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:17,980
Speaker 0: it came out basically when I was zero right ish.

259
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,730
Speaker 0: So, you know, I was not a fan of this thing.

260
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:31,285
Speaker 0: I thought it was you know bad, you know, just old bad stuff lumped in there with he-man, but this review of it Really sort of makes a good case for why this was a good cartoon.

261
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:37,370
Speaker 0: good like relative to Contemporary cartoons or legit good legit good like they're making a case for it.

262
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:43,097
Speaker 0: ah, and I kind of want to go back and verify whether that's True, but I also don't.

263
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,009
Speaker 1: that's a dangerous direction to go.

264
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:55,754
Speaker 0: I think your best bet is to just instead of actually watching the D&D cartoon from back in the day Just watch this YouTube video that's actually like 26 minutes long and you'll learn everything You need to know about it.

265
00:17:55,794 --> 00:18:01,494
Speaker 1: and see everything you need to see might give you a false impression though What if it's wrong?

266
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:02,938
Speaker 0: they're pretty convincing.

267
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:06,490
Speaker 1: yeah, I could make a pretty convincing video about a thing that I made up.

268
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,204
Speaker 0: I'm not a hundred percent saying that they're right.

269
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:10,270
Speaker 0: I'm just saying they're convincing.

270
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:14,883
Speaker 1: Nah in the meta moment pecs out coming up real soon.

271
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,046

279
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:56,550
Speaker 1: I found such a deep treasure trove and no multiple people.

280
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,638
Speaker 1: It's not the Russian anime opener treasure trove.

281

Speaker 1: Okay, I died Scott.

287
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:16,110
Speaker 1: I went too deep that that dramatic reading might be one step below hitting the bottom.

288
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,769
Speaker 1: There's things coming out Balrog's killing everyone in the panel room.

289
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:22,717
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's gonna be good times.

290
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,105
Speaker 1: The mag fest schedule is looking pretty good.

291
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:28,338
Speaker 1: We're on like seven panels But we were split up.

292
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,085
Speaker 1: So like we're not both on all the panels.

293
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:30,909
Speaker 1: So we'll see how that goes.

294
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,174
Speaker 1: Book club book.

295
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:33,636
Speaker 1: I don't know.

296
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,339
Speaker 1: I'm still reading though.

297
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,453
Speaker 1: I'm like book eight of the wheel of time at this point Patreon.

298
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:47,424
Speaker 1: I go twice on book club since you're not going but then I'll have to stop reading the wheel of time which is continuing in its steady pace of being average quality.

299
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:50,412
Speaker 1: fantasy book the novel, okay, and Pretty much.

300
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,104
Speaker 1: I'm just in a holding pattern until the our Scott backer book comes out.

301
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:53,927
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

302
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,375
Speaker 1: That's coming Patrons going strong.

303
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,205
Speaker 1: We're not that far away from the beta episodes thing.

304
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,249
Speaker 1: We put up the December Q&A.

305
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:05,807
Speaker 1: So dog, I'll submission form for backers to submit questions for the January Q&A.

306
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:06,429
Speaker 0: Don't do this.

307
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:13,210
Speaker 1: However, people have said that they really like the Q&A episodes and some people really like the rims-rants things that are in there.

308
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:16,950
Speaker 0: You could have spent your money on something good or spent your time watching something good.

309
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,250
Speaker 0: Like I don't know even that D&D cartoons probably better than geek nights.

310
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:23,122
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what, if you got spare money send it to Child's Play.

311
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:27,402
Speaker 1: if you still have spare money Send it to Neil Cisarenga's patreon.

312
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:30,117
Speaker 1: and if you still got money Maybe put a little bit in our.

313
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:30,842
Speaker 0: buy some food.

314
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,009
Speaker 0: get a better lunch.

315
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,404
Speaker 0: You know if you're eating like a peony B&J for lunch get a steak instead.

316
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:40,646
Speaker 1: and oh, yeah The t-shirts are still selling like one or two a week.

317
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,139
Speaker 1: So It's a good t-shirt.

318
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,075
Speaker 0: so you go get a nice t-shirt from threadless It's a pretty nice t-shirt.

319
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,039
Speaker 0: or go to Tepedo Co.

320
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,550
Speaker 0: any any shirt on all of Tepedo Co is better than the night.

321
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,729
Speaker 1: So guys, I'll tell you what.

322
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:59,472
Speaker 1: I have an Amazon merch account for us and apparently they're hard to get for some reason like there's a long Backlog.

323
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,716
Speaker 1: really invite only.

324
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:01,940
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't know this.

325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,030
Speaker 1: so I can sell up to 25 shirts at a time.

326
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:12,016
Speaker 1: So I'll tell you this if you want to sell a t-shirt that gets a cool one through geek nights I'll give you like.

327
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:13,483
Speaker 0: you're better off selling it anywhere else.

328
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,539
Speaker 0: The profit margin is so bad Yes, but the effort level is so low.

329
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,710
Speaker 0: You could just open your own web store with like a Shopify for you ever.

330
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,573
Speaker 1: No, I've done that.

331
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:21,914
Speaker 1: Do you know what?

332
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,058
Speaker 1: you're fucking pain-in-the-ass?

333
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,824
Speaker 0: that you could just make up PayPal.

334
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,329
Speaker 0: one link for PayPal put.

335
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,130
Speaker 1: no No, that's not what they're saving you.

336
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,130
Speaker 1: The thing is they print on demand any size any style multiple t-shirt colors.

337
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:34,434
Speaker 0: If you make it a geek night shirt This makes sense.

338
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,950
Speaker 0: if you want to make send us a design and we'll give you the profits.

339
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:38,843
Speaker 0: But if you're making a shirt for your own shit, don't.

340
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:39,770
Speaker 0: why would you do this?

341
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:46,320
Speaker 1: No If you're just if you just have a cool shirt that you want to let us sell for you with no So many other people that will sell it for you better.

342
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,110
Speaker 1: They'll take more of a cut than this takes.

343
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,439
Speaker 0: No, you can go like thread lists to pay to go save a.

344
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,190
Speaker 1: yeah to pay to co is invite only and there's minimum requirements.

345
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,963
Speaker 0: I'm just saying if you can't meet those requirements your shirt isn't with mine.

346
00:21:58,565 --> 00:21:59,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see.

347
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,150
Speaker 1: We're about our level.

348
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:01,537
Speaker 1: We're not to pay to co.

349
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,964
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know if we get to pay to go.

350
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:04,090
Speaker 1: We never tried to to pay to co.

351
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:09,365
Speaker 1: No So you may recall a time back in 2011 a heady time where?

352
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:17,110
Speaker 1: Someone posted in our forum saying hey guys the new my little pony show is really good and we were like what what why?

353
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,430
Speaker 0: Well, and then I saw it posted a bunch of other places and then it turned out to be true.

354
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,193
Speaker 0: So we watched it.

355
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:21,554
Speaker 1: Yep.

356
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:30,042
Speaker 1: So we didn't even get in on that pony craze until about halfway through the first season and Many of you who are close to us may remember that it hit pretty hard.

357
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:32,875
Speaker 0: it hit hard and then it faded but it didn't Completely fade.

358
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:36,154
Speaker 1: but it hit hard for like two years Hard for a while.

359
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:41,290
Speaker 1: there was a time a period of about two years where we pretty much just wouldn't fucking shut up about ponies.

360
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:45,342
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and I still really like ponies, but I don't talk about it every day.

361
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:54,532
Speaker 0: I have every single issue of the pony comic series released by IDW and that comic series is Fantastic.

362
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:55,134
Speaker 0: It's so good.

363
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:55,797
Speaker 1: It's the.

364
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,383
Speaker 1: it's better than the show right now.

365
00:22:57,624 --> 00:22:59,684
Speaker 1: Yes other than it doesn't have music You can listen to.

366
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:02,619
Speaker 0: no But yeah, if you want ponies you're not getting enough.

367
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,863
Speaker 0: get the comics.

368
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:10,050
Speaker 0: they made this two main series which is You know friendship is magic, but there's also main like ma ne.

369
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:18,010
Speaker 0: There's also friends forever Which is like they have multiple pony comics the same way that there's spider-man an amazing spider-man and spectacular spider-man.

370
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, and spider-man is amazing friends spider-man 2099.

371
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:27,171
Speaker 1: But especially if you really like the first two seasons of my little pony and then you're a little bit disappointed in like season 3.

372
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:39,530
Speaker 0: Quality you know as ponies is good, but the quality has varied wildly right even within the first season Which is still the best season, you know The sonic rainboom episode and they visit the dragon on the mountain episode far surpass.

373
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,168
Speaker 1: Oh my god that dragon episode might have been one of the best episodes ever.

374
00:23:43,611 --> 00:23:48,357
Speaker 0: They far surpass all other episodes and all the other seasons Right a list of all the.

375
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:50,347
Speaker 0: the quality goes from high to low, right?

376
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,909
Speaker 0: But recently I caught up on every single episode through the newest season which is completed.

377
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,276
Speaker 0: rim I think is a little bit behind.

378
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:57,658
Speaker 0: isn't that?

379
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,790
Speaker 1: I've seen most of the current season But I've seen all those like rainbow rocks nonsense that I didn't see any of the ones where they're not ponies.

380
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:06,686
Speaker 1: So I know some stuff.

381
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:06,808
Speaker 1: well.

382
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,590
Speaker 0: So and I know that they have no they never came into play in the actual cartoon.

383
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:18,050
Speaker 1: So our ponies other way around they do and both worlds exist side by side and there's some back-and-forth stuff going on.

384
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,230
Speaker 0: But anyway, I didn't see any back-and-forth stuff in the show.

385
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,910
Speaker 1: You don't need to you do not need to see that garbage, but I digress.

386
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,132
Speaker 1: So my little pony and this is about a pretty long run and we haven't talked about it It's still running.

387
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:36,617
Speaker 1: there's gonna be another season as season six is confirmed for this year All right, and season five just ended.

388
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:45,410
Speaker 1: so much like we did with adventure time when a show is long running You can't just review it once and be well can't do a final thoughts cuz when's the final thoughts gonna be?

389
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, let's do Flintstones final thoughts.

390
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's like yeah this thing didn't it's the honeymooners But more family-friendly, right?

391
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:57,110
Speaker 0: I mean, you know that people don't remember that show ran for a fuck ever right, you know?

392
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,301
Speaker 0: So it's like if we if it was still running we would might not.

393
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,830
Speaker 0: you know, when can you do a final thoughts on it?

394
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you get the thoughts on things that are limited like anime 26 now.

395
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:12,627
Speaker 1: They're like 117 episodes of my little pony friendship of met as magic not as many as fist of the North Star.

396
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:17,306
Speaker 1: that is a Little over half as many as Sailor Moon's run.

397
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:27,510
Speaker 1: Yep Sailor a lot happened in Sailor Moon like if I was gonna review Sailor Moon based on season one Very different thoughts from if I've seen s or stars.

398
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:37,982
Speaker 1: So I still really like my little pony and I actually think like season four especially the recent season five The quite the average quality has been rising from.

399
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:45,510
Speaker 1: I think the season three kind of had this Deep not deep Pete look drop, but not the best episodes like you could definitely see.

400
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:52,200
Speaker 0: I agree that the if you average each season's total episodes together that yeah That third season was definitely the weakest season.

401
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,906
Speaker 0: Well, but it still has some good stuff in it.

402
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,296
Speaker 0: I wasn't bad It didn't make you want to stop watching.

403
00:25:56,336 --> 00:26:00,798
Speaker 1: season one was Lauren Fowles like a hundred percent and season two was Lauren Fowles.

404
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,189
Speaker 1: direction is still there.

405
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:10,452
Speaker 1: Yeah season three was when they started having to go off on their own and they made a lot of decisions that made the show a little less Good.

406
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:11,396
Speaker 0: Hmm.

407
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,870
Speaker 1: It's hard if I had to describe what bothered me about it.

408
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,010
Speaker 1: It wasn't that the show got like simpler or anything.

409
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,030
Speaker 1: It was more than the in the first two seasons.

410
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:29,495
Speaker 1: What I liked about the show was that they were very careful to release like little bits of information about the world Tangentially like something.

411
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:34,793
Speaker 1: you'd see something in the foreground or you'd see a character do a thing and it would imply a bunch of stuff Of the world.

412
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:39,230
Speaker 1: but they wouldn't then zoom the camera on that and try to explain it all with a giant flashback.

413
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:49,168
Speaker 1: And as the show goes that got on they've really started to say hey you want to know the deal about this let's zoom in on this and do a huge flashback and tell you the story.

414
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:58,944
Speaker 1: and they also stopped paying attention to the like Rigid idea that the ponies have hooves and can't just hold stuff.

415
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:07,890
Speaker 1: Hmm because in more recent episodes They increasingly kind of just ignore that and just yeah that ponies holding the cane because well, we just animated it that way.

416
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:09,219
Speaker 1: Sorry guys.

417
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,702
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

418
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:12,136
Speaker 0: Oh Well, but yeah.

419
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:19,261
Speaker 0: and the more recent seasons the average quality has been going up But you know the I think the variance has increased right?

420
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:27,524
Speaker 0: there's some episodes in the newest season that are like so so good And there's some that are so so bad like probably some of the worst episodes in the whole show.

421
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,370
Speaker 1: the fan pandering is what's doing it?

422
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was an episode.

423
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:31,465
Speaker 0: item was the title of it.

424
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,009
Speaker 0: Do you have it there?

425
00:27:32,394 --> 00:27:36,257
Speaker 1: Pulling up the list it was The best episode of this season.

426
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,180
Speaker 1: far and away.

427
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,503
Speaker 1: was rarity investigate.

428
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,007
Speaker 0: No, that was the same.

429
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,919
Speaker 0: It's tied I think with the moon dancer episode.

430
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:51,688
Speaker 1: I can't believe just because their rarity investigates is so good Yeah, especially because at the end of the oh and his disingenuous smile.

431
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:57,428
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, there was an episode in the newest season that consists of life.

432
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,280
Speaker 0: Right, it consisted of nothing.

433
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,630
Speaker 1: is this episode have its own Wikipedia page?

434
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,344
Speaker 0: Because it's so much fan pandering references.

435
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,469
Speaker 0: They have to explain right?

436
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,245
Speaker 0: So the whole episode was nothing but taking the fan in right and making it canon.

437
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:21,206
Speaker 0: every single thing that the online pony community right like created like all these personalities for characters and relationships between the characters

438
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,469
Speaker 1: and names in some cases,

439
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:29,090
Speaker 0: you know, Doctor who jokes and it was basically like watching tumblr on TV and I was like, oh my god kill it with fire.

440
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,053
Speaker 0: Yeah with fire.

441
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:39,809
Speaker 1: there is a way to cater to your fans and their theories Without just taking all their bullshit and cramming it into your show.

442
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:49,524
Speaker 1: The ponies just kind of did the opposite of what they should have done in this regard But at the same time I say should have The fans of my little pony loved it.

443
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,510
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell.

444
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:59,916
Speaker 0: I mean if you're the person the kind of person who writes a you know, Sherlock pones fanfic and then suddenly, you know You like that you're really into that.

445
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:04,030
Speaker 0: and then suddenly it's real and you got acknowledgement from the people who make the pones.

446
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,410
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, that's like if you go to some beaver concert and he touches you, right?

447
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

448
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:13,188
Speaker 1: I liked it more when it was subtle like the show had a lot of cameos of like.

449
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:20,615
Speaker 1: hey That's obviously a character of a famous person, but they didn't zoom in on it quite like they do With this fan stuff later.

450
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:25,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, that episode was just so bad, but thankfully they left it out of further episodes.

451
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,629
Speaker 0: They contained it within that one beast.

452
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,409
Speaker 0: Yeah I didn't let it leak into the other episodes some of which are quite good.

453
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:41,179
Speaker 1: What actually the thing that has been most disappointing about the episodes that weren't great is that they had that conceit of well Twilight's too powerful now and we need this plot of.

454
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:47,869
Speaker 1: let's just take these three characters and send them off on an adventure So we can write a story just about them.

455
00:29:48,110 --> 00:30:01,370
Speaker 1: yeah, which I don't know just from a production standpoint makes sense because I heard of a rumor and an anecdote that Teen Titans go is Apparently really hard to storyboard and put together because every shot is all the characters all the time.

456
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:09,042
Speaker 1: Like there's a bunch of characters and they're always there always in the shot always doing their thing They're all involved in every plot and the same thing goes.

457
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,490
Speaker 0: you read x-men comics, right?

458
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:18,250
Speaker 0: And when I was a kid I buy an x-men comic and on the cover would be gambit and you'd read that issue And the only x-men who would be in that issue would be like gambit rogue.

459
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:22,489
Speaker 0: They talked to Professor X once and maybe Wolverine was there because he's in every issue.

460
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,171
Speaker 1: Where's beast?

461
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:30,270
Speaker 0: always working on the sandwich and you'd only see all the x-men at once and like, you know x-men number one.

462
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,970
Speaker 0: Here's a shot of them all in the planning room deciding on what to do.

463
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,510
Speaker 0: But then they'd only be in this, you know, two-page spread.

464
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:44,350
Speaker 0: You just see them there and only a few of them would actually you know be talking and directly involved in the plot of that issue.

465
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,614
Speaker 0: Right, you can't.

466
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:49,427
Speaker 0: you can't write a story with like a hundred characters all actively doing everything all the time.

467
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:53,410
Speaker 1: Yep Pretty hit or miss though how well they did this, right?

468
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,709
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't use it as often I expected them to.

469
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:02,715
Speaker 0: well the thing I liked about it was that you brought back to the thing that made me like the first season so much which is The fantasy adventure.

470
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:06,729
Speaker 0: It's like there's a magical table that tells you where to go on a magical quest.

471
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all these magical questions about elements of harmony and stuff that were you know.

472
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,510
Speaker 0: It's like the real reason to watch the show is for epic fantasy stuff and they brought that back.

473
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:25,099
Speaker 0: but occasionally it's like the table tells up only Applejack and and Pinkie Pie should be going this way.

474
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,390
Speaker 0: No, no one else can go on this quest.

475
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,818
Speaker 1: yeah, which Could make sense like you could make like.

476
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,450
Speaker 0: oh if the rest of them went then like the table knows who needs to go to Solve the problem if anyone else went the problem wouldn't be solved.

477
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:44,497
Speaker 1: Okay, if the table itself became a plot point Allah quantum leap Mm-hmm, but it doesn't.

478
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:45,240
Speaker 0: I think it will.

479
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,626
Speaker 1: I don't think it will.

480
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:47,349
Speaker 0: I think it will.

481
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:58,098
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's more than the table every although all of the previous table equivalents in the show were plot points Such as writing letters to the princess and such.

482
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:16,421
Speaker 1: but the plot points in the first few seasons were much more Subtle or much more Open-ended and these plot points that have been introduced increasingly as the show goes on Become very little literal and direct and are spotlighted and solve a specific problem Immediately and are fully explained at some point.

483
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is kind of boring sometimes.

484
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:23,910
Speaker 0: Another thing I like is that because the show is sort of expanded the ponies are like getting around, right?

485
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,311
Speaker 0: It's not.

486
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:25,396
Speaker 0: it's not just Ponyville.

487
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,163
Speaker 0: It's like we're going to Canada.

488
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:33,365
Speaker 1: We're going to you know, Clowsdale Griffin town and it turns out all Griffins are just like horrible people.

489
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:34,550
Speaker 0: We're just going to Manhattan.

490
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:36,766
Speaker 0: We're going on a quest into the scary place.

491
00:32:37,027 --> 00:32:38,453
Speaker 0: You know the Manhattan.

492
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:39,478
Speaker 1: they're going back and forth.

493
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:39,980
Speaker 0: We're riding.

494
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,528
Speaker 0: We're riding that train all the time.

495
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I hadn't.

496
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:47,879
Speaker 1: kind of often and like coming and going and doing so like where you opens a business there We're super important ponies.

497
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,650
Speaker 0: We got to go around Equestria doing stuff.

498
00:32:49,691 --> 00:32:51,129
Speaker 0: We can't just be sitting Ponyville all day.

499
00:32:51,290 --> 00:33:02,427
Speaker 1: But I like that aspect that like rarity like tries to open a shop there and the resolution is kind of like yeah Shop still there like stuff happens like she's she'll live there for a week in an apartment doing something like it's.

500
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:06,983
Speaker 1: it's more like a Real show that has a bunch of stuff going on like Seinfeld.

501
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,910
Speaker 1: They're going places and doing things.

502
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:11,659
Speaker 1: Um, I mean, I still like the show a lot.

503
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still good.

504
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:16,840
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, so the let's just talk about the really good episode.

505
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,910
Speaker 0: So the Moondancer episode right Harkins back.

506
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:24,456
Speaker 0: It takes a reference from the very first episode Some Simpsons quality.

507
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:28,350
Speaker 0: back reference is a part in the first episode of the whole show season one.

508
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,796
Speaker 1: What about Moondancers party?

509
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:33,693
Speaker 0: right spike is like hey, you know Moondancers having a party Do you want to go?

510
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:35,121
Speaker 0: and so I was like no I'm busy.

511
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:42,330
Speaker 0: and then twice, you know They even make a note in that first episode that spike about Moondancer a present that never got delivered or anything.

512
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:46,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in this Moondancer episode basically Twilight remembers that.

513
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:53,830
Speaker 0: you know that for that Had friends before Ponyville sort of she had friends, but she was super close.

514
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,826
Speaker 0: He wasn't close to them because she was just studying and she realized she's the.

515
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:03,182
Speaker 0: you know He's the princess of friendship and she really used to really suck at friends Which is part of why she became the princess of friendship.

516
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:04,570
Speaker 0: So she goes back.

517
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:07,766
Speaker 0: It's like her old counterlot house, which I guess she just abandoned.

518
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,590
Speaker 0: who was paying for it?

519
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:12,630
Speaker 0: I guess it was princess territory like it's federal territory part.

520
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:19,481
Speaker 0: It's part of the palace and like no one had ever bothered to go there or clean it up or look at it since the first Episode where she just ran out and got in a balloon.

521
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:24,750
Speaker 1: Well because she was special I remember she was elevated that position because the dragon thing works usually.

522
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:28,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if I just if I just leave my house and don't come back someone's gonna go in.

523
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,909
Speaker 0: Maybe but everything's still there including the president for Moondancer and everything.

524
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:37,268
Speaker 0: And then the episode is all about like who is Moondancer and you know.

525
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,775
Speaker 1: Oh There's a problem with that episode.

526
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:41,400
Speaker 1: that happened in a couple other episodes to.

527
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,605
Speaker 1: that bothers me a little bit.

528
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,330
Speaker 1: that a lot of times.

529
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:50,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was that one flaw with the episode Solution to the prop through the problems of a person.

530
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:54,399
Speaker 1: Well, I guess a pony Tend to be really simplistic.

531
00:34:54,498 --> 00:35:06,064
Speaker 1: Yeah and tend to have kind of a bad message for like a kid who might be watching the show because a lot of moon dancers episode was basically She became an introverted shut-in because of that incident.

532
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,907
Speaker 0: and that's not true.

533
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:07,570
Speaker 0: There's no way.

534
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it one incident is gonna make someone like that.

535
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,610
Speaker 1: It would have been a lot better if the gift and that if she is just an introvert and that's fine.

536
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:17,669
Speaker 1: And they resolved it a much more subtle way.

537
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:24,662
Speaker 1: but on the other hand with some of the Fluttershy episodes They did that really well because I thought the scary Halloween one.

538
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:25,123
Speaker 0: Yeah.

539
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:25,866
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

540
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:26,750
Speaker 1: She's so bad.

541
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,422
Speaker 0: That's probably that's right underneath those other two of those those animals that she made.

542
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:32,444
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

543
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,276
Speaker 1: I Love how she's.

544
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:36,589
Speaker 1: you know that she's totally a weeb.

545
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,055
Speaker 1: Well, I like I like that also.

546
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:38,677
Speaker 0: is they how they?

547
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:42,676
Speaker 0: they sort of giving you a some sense of time and that they're reselebrating All the holidays.

548
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,069
Speaker 0: there was another grand galloping gala.

549
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,643
Speaker 0: There was another, you know all spooky Eve.

550
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,070
Speaker 0: There was another heart swarming, right?

551
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,370
Speaker 0: It's like another year has gone through, you know, the seasons changing it.

552
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,575
Speaker 0: They didn't do another winter wrap-up.

553
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:52,977
Speaker 0: they should.

554
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,785
Speaker 1: but I look at the moral of that episode.

555
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:55,850
Speaker 1: was Fluttershy.

556
00:35:56,111 --> 00:36:00,105
Speaker 1: It's totally okay that she's not good at or into something like fine.

557
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:01,390
Speaker 1: Cool the end.

558
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:04,479
Speaker 1: They didn't fix her and make her love the holiday.

559
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,790
Speaker 0: She just did her own thing, but they did show her being awesome at it.

560
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:16,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did the same thing with Fluttershy in the the one with her singing Mmm with the lip-syncing thing and now she got really into it.

561
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,815
Speaker 1: and then the moral at the end wasn't oh now she's over Her stage fright.

562
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:25,219
Speaker 1: it was yeah, she's still into singing But she still has stage fright and that's cool.

563
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,466
Speaker 1: and I feel like half the episode.

564
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,670
Speaker 0: wonder she became a model.

565
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, I don't want to be a model anymore even though I was famous.

566
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:40,310
Speaker 1: But half the episodes of the new seasons have a good complex or at least nuanced moral like that Harrison Bergeron episode.

567
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:45,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't see the final episode of the season where the Harrison Bergeron pony comes back.

568
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:46,778
Speaker 1: I didn't know she was gonna come back.

569
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,757
Speaker 0: I didn't know either cuz they were talking about someone I'm like, who are they talking about?

570
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:54,609
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh the Harrison Bergeron pony Is it done well and have a nuanced point or is it?

571
00:36:54,669 --> 00:37:01,439
Speaker 1: well It's a little bit Little bit simplistic again.

572
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:17,029
Speaker 1: No, I mean it's okay Alright But see that's the quality of individual episodes has been kind of inconsistent and it's getting I think more swingy But at the same time the average quality is still slowly increasing again.

573
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:21,790
Speaker 1: Hmm just nothing's quite as good as that season two season one.

574
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:25,728
Speaker 1: Yeah season one season two had a lot of good stuff going on there.

575
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:26,050
Speaker 0: Why not?

576
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,559
Speaker 0: You know didn't have a rainbow thing.

577
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,270
Speaker 1: No, but it did have that hearts and hopes day episode.

578
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:35,988
Speaker 1: Also Dragon Quest was season two really.

579
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:41,386
Speaker 0: no Oh Dragon Quest is the one where there's a bunch that spike goes to sparkle crackle.

580
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:42,710
Speaker 0: Yes, that's Dragon Quest.

581
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:50,708
Speaker 0: Yes, that was a good episode sure But no the good dragon episode was season one Which is the one with Fluttershy going up the mountain and talking to the dragon.

582
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:58,510
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, so pretty much if you've been ignoring cuz you know There's a lot of cartoons that you can watch right now that are probably better than ponies actually.

583
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:09,813
Speaker 1: But like the wide set like all the stuff that I watch and I kind of go through phases like I didn't watch a lot Of ponies for a while because I was watching a whole bunch of gumball and Steven Universe and Adventure Time and I sort of rotate In and out.

584
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:17,543
Speaker 1: so if you're rotated ponies out because you're watching all this other stuff It's actually a pretty good time to rotate it back in one punch man is done.

585
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,069
Speaker 1: Yeah ponies is done.

586
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,860
Speaker 1: now You can just catch up until season six.

587
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,270
Speaker 0: That's how I did.

588
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,197
Speaker 0: I just watched all like the ponies I missed.

589
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:28,150
Speaker 1: like recently Adventure Time is just starting up again after stakes.

590
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,170
