1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,578
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, November 23rd, 2021.

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:11,718
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:14,949
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,135
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:22,191
Speaker 0: It is the Geek Nights Holiday Gaming Gift Guide 2021.

6
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,228
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,489
Speaker 0: See, I almost got straight up hit by a car walking home from the subway today.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,509
Speaker 1: I mean, that happens all the time.

9
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, so walking across Queens... the light was red.

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:49,310
Speaker 0: Walking across the pedestrian area, across Creston Street, right at the base of the bridge, and a gigantic truck, like just a regular truck full of bros, just a giant one, is barreling down the bike lane at very high speed.

11
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:54,710
Speaker 0: One biker literally like jumped out of the way with his bike and like fell over.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:02,370
Speaker 0: Another guy jumped into the road, traffic stopped, horns are screeching, and the guy just barrels down the bike lane, runs the red light, and drives off over the Queensboro Bridge.

13
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:05,449
Speaker 0: Literally had to jump out of the way or get hit by him.

14
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:06,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's normal.

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,797
Speaker 0: Yep, I got video and everything.

16
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:11,229
Speaker 0: I did call the cops and they didn't seem to give a shit.

17
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,349
Speaker 0: No, they didn't care.

18
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,190
Speaker 1: It probably is a cop off duty.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:28,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually got very clear photos of the faces of the guys because they were forced... After they barreled ahead through the red light, they stopped in the intersection for a second because there was a car like blocking their way onto the bridge, and I right over got a picture of their face.

20
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,370
Speaker 1: People were saying, I didn't see any evidence, obviously, that a lot of the fart cars are cops.

21
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:35,710
Speaker 0: I wouldn't doubt it.

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:35,951
Speaker 1: I believe it.

23
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:40,050
Speaker 1: It could be, you know, judging by how little they do to, you know, stop the problem.

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,490
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I did have that experience where I got to sit and listen to a bunch of fart car guys talking about their fart cars.

25
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,710
Speaker 1: Well, the thing, you know, I pointed out, you know, during the marathon, right, the cops went out and they towed mass towing.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,670
Speaker 1: They towed every single car that was parked along the marathon route, right?

27
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,294
Speaker 1: Overnight.

28
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,450
Speaker 1: Tons and tons of cars, right?

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,728
Speaker 1: Just towed them all.

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,429
Speaker 1: It's like, well, if you can do that, then you could just go through like the whole neighborhood and tow every fart car.

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:15,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if you have video and audio, you could have records of which cars are the fart cars that are undisputable and then just go find them.

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,170
Speaker 1: But you could just look at a car and tell if it's a fart car.

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,819
Speaker 1: You get under it with a flashlight.

34
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,409
Speaker 1: You're like, "Oh, no cat, tow

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:20,490
Speaker 1: it.".

36
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,133
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

37
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:30,330
Speaker 0: So a few days ago, Emily and I were on Citi Bikes looking at apartments over in Vernon Jackson, which, spoilers, while they're very expensive, they're not really nicer than the apartment we're in now in a lot of ways.

38
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,383
Speaker 1: No, I mean, you know, when I looked at apartments two to three years ago, I guess, I don't know, when did I move here?

39
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:35,930
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,449
Speaker 1: But yeah, there were fancy apartments we looked at that were kind of, they were fancy, but they were new, but they were kind of small and meh.

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:51,109
Speaker 0: Yup, the bedrooms in all those fancy Vernon Jackson buildings are way smaller than what we got right now in this place, paying thousands of dollars less.

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,690
Speaker 1: It's quite like two bedroom, but it's actually two tiny bedrooms that are actually one bedroom.

43
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,979
Speaker 1: They just put a wall in between.

44
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,289
Speaker 1: You're actually getting less square footage.

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:58,739
Speaker 1: Yup.

46
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 1: You know, it's hard to find places that actually have square footage unless you pay for three bedroom or, you know, one bedroom.

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,550
Speaker 1: It's like basically the same as the two bedroom, only that wall's missing, so you get more space.

48
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:11,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

49
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:16,809
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah, all that aside, let's get right into this because we probably got a lot to say in this show.

50
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:21,949
Speaker 0: And we can start with the Nintendo Game & Watch, which might be a hot gift.

51
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,373
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

52
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,768
Speaker 1: So I got the Mario one, right?

53
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,569
Speaker 1: And now I got the, here's the Zelda one I got.

54
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:29,628
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, look at that.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,870
Speaker 1: So the Zelda one is, I mostly got this, like why would I get this, right?

56
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,170
Speaker 1: To play Zelda that I've played a million times, right?

57
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,823
Speaker 1: It's like, what, 50 bucks?

58
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:39,569
Speaker 1: Why would you do this?

59
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,930
Speaker 1: So the reason I got this is because it makes a really nice desk clock, right?

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,970
Speaker 1: You put it on the desk and I had the Mario one, but the Mario one, you know, first of all, you get a little tired of it.

61
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,125
Speaker 1: It's the same Mario one over and over, right?

62
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:53,609
Speaker 1: Switch it up.

63
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:58,950
Speaker 1: The Zelda one compared to the Mario one is vastly superior.

64
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,090
Speaker 1: Number one, you can run the clock and disable the auto sleep.

65
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:05,749
Speaker 1: So you don't need to have it plugged in.

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,130
Speaker 1: The Mario one had no auto, the auto sleep was just locked in.

67
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:09,926
Speaker 1: You couldn't change it.

68
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:15,989
Speaker 1: So if you wanted it to run as a clock all the time, you had to keep it plugged into USB-C all the time or else it would turn off.

69
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:26,550
Speaker 1: The Zelda one, you can tell it, don't turn off and yeah, you're going to have to charge it, obviously, because the battery doesn't last that long, it lasts hours.

70
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,050
Speaker 1: But if you just do it continuously, but you can just use it as a clock on your desk without having it plugged in all the time.

71
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,528
Speaker 1: So that's nice.

72
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,069
Speaker 1: Number two, it's got a lot more going on than the Mario one.

73
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:43,810
Speaker 1: This one's got Zelda one, Zelda two and Link's Awakening, complete original games.

74
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:49,809
Speaker 1: It plays much nicer, the screen is much nicer, you know, everything about it is nicer than the Mario one.

75
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:58,110
Speaker 1: It has a better Game & Watch game, which is the vermin game, right, the one with the two hammers, right, and you move left and right.

76
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,287
Speaker 1: Only they put Link's head on the guy instead of Mr.

77
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:01,830
Speaker 1: Game & Watch.

78
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:08,770
Speaker 1: It's got a little countdown timer you can use if you need one, I guess, for some reason.

79
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:15,750
Speaker 1: So would I buy this as a gaming device to play the games, right?

80
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,469
Speaker 1: Probably not, but you got to think about it.

81
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:30,170
Speaker 1: If you don't already have some sort of portable gaming device, like a Game Boy Advance or a DS or something, this is smaller.

82
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,970
Speaker 1: And it's three, like these are to S tier games, right?

83
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,869
Speaker 1: All the games are, well, the second one, Rymn likes it.

84
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,350
Speaker 0: I think Zelda two is good and important, but it is not as good as Link's Awakening.

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,310
Speaker 1: The other two games are S tier regardless, but this is better than playing the games on your phone.

86
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,909
Speaker 0: Oh wait, you can play the English or the Japanese versions, so that means Zelda two is the harder version with the different leveling up?

87
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bet to check the music.

88
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,950
Speaker 0: There are big differences between those versions.

89
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:10,370
Speaker 1: Right, but yeah, you know, if you want to play some Zelda one on the go, like this is smaller than a GBA or a DS or even an SP kinda, right?

90
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,090
Speaker 1: So it's way smaller than a Game Boy Pocket.

91
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:18,070
Speaker 1: So it's not a bad choice actually for playing the games.

92
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:23,269
Speaker 1: So yeah, 50 bucks, I guess, you know, still that's a little bit steep.

93
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:30,890
Speaker 0: You know what it makes actually, it makes a good gift for a gamer who's around our age.

94
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:44,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's a lot of novelty, a lot of, you know, some amount of collector's item, shelf display item factors going into it, but it's just way better than the Mario one.

95
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:50,249
Speaker 1: And I hope that on like the 35th anniversary of like, you know, Metroid or they make a Metroid one or a...

96
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,790
Speaker 0: Ooh, a Metroid one could be real good.

97
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,470
Speaker 1: Kirby one, give me a Kirby one, you know, hook me up.

98
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:04,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in some news, I think this was announced today, so we don't have a lot to go on except the press release.

99
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:05,310
Speaker 0: basically.

100
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,010
Speaker 0: Epic Games has acquired harmonics.

101
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:15,270
Speaker 0: You may remember harmonics from the era that was shorter than people realize of buying plastic instruments.

102
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:32,850
Speaker 1: Right, so if you don't know the whole story, you can read it online, but the summary is that Guitar Hero is made by harmonics, but then I think after Guitar Hero 2 or 3, I forget exactly when it was taken away from them because they didn't like, they were developers, they weren't the publisher, they didn't own the rights, whatever.

103
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,730
Speaker 1: And another company kept going with Guitar Hero, so they went and did Rock Band.

104
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:48,050
Speaker 1: And then they also did, they basically started a game company that only made rhythm music games of various types, right, after Rock Band.

105
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,170
Speaker 1: They had the DJ one, the card, the card thing.

106
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, that card thing, I remember that card thing.

107
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:59,969
Speaker 1: And they were actually, they were a big deal at PAX East because they were a Boston-based, you know, game developer.

108
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:00,789
Speaker 1: There weren't too many.

109
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,109
Speaker 1: They were probably the biggest Boston-based game developer there was in terms of the success of their games.

110
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,990
Speaker 1: But music games have gone out of style.

111
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:13,010
Speaker 1: They didn't really, you know, get any more hits after a while.

112
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:19,390
Speaker 1: And so they got acquired by Epic who makes Fortnite and has the Epic store.

113
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:23,530
Speaker 1: And now all those people are going to presumably be working on Fortnite.

114
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:27,370
Speaker 1: Presumably on some music thing for Fortnite.

115
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,309
Speaker 0: They've officially announced, they did a little FAQ already.

116
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,109
Speaker 0: So one, what does this mean for Rock Band DLC?

117
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:34,950
Speaker 0: Nothing.

118
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,250
Speaker 0: All those plans continue.

119
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,070
Speaker 0: What about Fuser events?

120
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:39,688
Speaker 0: No change.

121
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,748
Speaker 0: I don't even know what those are.

122
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,490
Speaker 0: Does this mean more Rock Band?

123
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,349
Speaker 1: Fuser is the DJ game.

124
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,049
Speaker 0: Oh, that's it.

125
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:46,423
Speaker 0: Okay.

126
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:47,510
Speaker 0: Anyway.

127
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:50,350
Speaker 0: Does this mean more Rock Band instruments will be made?

128
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:50,777
Speaker 0: Nope.

129
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:54,670
Speaker 0: What about servers for insert harmonics game?

130
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,690
Speaker 0: Will those be taken offline?

131
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,246
Speaker 0: Nope.

132
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,369
Speaker 0: And the last one, what will the harmonics team work on?

133
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,890
Speaker 0: Quote, our team will work with Epic to create musical journeys and gameplay for Fortnite.

134
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:06,906
Speaker 0: That's it.

135
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:15,269
Speaker 0: They're definitely going to make music stuff inside of Fortnite, which is, there's probably a topic here for like a full Geek Nights or a panel at some point.

136
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:33,190
Speaker 0: But Fortnite, much like Minecraft and other big games that have a lot going on, younger kids increasingly will play almost degraded forms of other bigger dedicated games within these games.

137
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:34,070
Speaker 0: Like it's a thing.

138
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,650
Speaker 1: That's basically what's, that's basically the model, which I think is partially Minecraft's fault, right?

139
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:43,610
Speaker 1: Or Gary's mod, I think was the first, not, maybe not the first, but it was a big deal.

140
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,189
Speaker 0: But Fortnite really pushed it too.

141
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,150
Speaker 0: Like kids will play hide and seek in Fortnite or role play in Fortnite.

142
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,128
Speaker 1: Kids will play capture the flag and VR chat.

143
00:09:53,011 --> 00:10:04,423
Speaker 1: AOL chat room had that going on, but yeah, it's like rather than make more games, you know, they've, they've just create this, you know, play room platform, like Minecraft or Roblox or any of those.

144
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,710
Speaker 1: And that's, that's the big hit these days is get kids into your, into your play room platform.

145
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:18,250
Speaker 1: And now when they buy microtransaction hats, they have the hats no matter what game they're playing in Fortnite world.

146
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:22,489
Speaker 1: And it's way cheaper than developing a bunch of different games.

147
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:24,550
Speaker 0: You have a built-in audience.

148
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,150
Speaker 1: And it's way cheaper and it's what has a longer staying power than say making an Overwatch.

149
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,570
Speaker 1: And then if people get tired of Overwatch, it's like, well, it only plays Overwatch.

150
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,786
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything else.

151
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,510
Speaker 1: Right.

152
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,950
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's the way that mods can keep counter-strike alive or whatever.

153
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,150
Speaker 1: Cause it's like, okay, I'm bored playing regular counter-strike.

154
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:44,367
Speaker 1: Well, here's here.

155
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,890
Speaker 1: We're going to play.

156
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:45,230
Speaker 1: Wow.

157
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,190
Speaker 1: We're going to play zombies in counter-strike, right?

158
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,463
Speaker 1: They're just been taking that idea so long.

159
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,928
Speaker 0: The people who were playing that level up role play heavy world of Warcraft mod in counter-strike.

160
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,437
Speaker 0: Like that was the peak of.

161
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,310
Speaker 1: people play all sorts of different things in world of Warcraft.

162
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:10,569
Speaker 1: But I think that's the model of today is create a game that is also a games platform, which, you know, and so it can last long.

163
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:15,229
Speaker 1: People can just fully invest themselves in that one thing and put their money into it.

164
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,050
Speaker 1: Your developers can keep working on the one thing, but then that person, the people who play your thing don't need other things.

165
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,387
Speaker 1: Yup.

166
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,888
Speaker 1: They're good.

167
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:33,489
Speaker 0: Another part of it is that those spaces are almost primarily social spaces as opposed to dedicated games in terms of how kids tend to interact with them.

168
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:42,128
Speaker 0: So these are starting to be a lot like what the early social networks that tried to be like interactive spaces all failed to be.

169
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,650
Speaker 1: It came around like second life, right?

170
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,130
Speaker 1: It's like, no one was going to go to second life cause it was just second life.

171
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,730
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you're here to play counter-strike, but we'll add some second life.

172
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,028
Speaker 1: You're already, you're already here.

173
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:59,490
Speaker 1: You know, but you're not going to make a special trip to install this second life thing.

174
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,050
Speaker 1: Just to do some concert, but it's like, I already played Fortnite.

175
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,609
Speaker 1: Well, there's a concert in the Fortnite you already have.

176
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:06,990
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

177
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:12,890
Speaker 0: I highly doubt they will at any point start making plastic instruments again, though.

178
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,990
Speaker 1: Plastic instruments are done.

179
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,150
Speaker 1: I think the, as much as I'm the, you know, the exact opposite on the VR spectrum, right?

180
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:25,830
Speaker 1: I think the future of pretend to be in a rock band, pretend to be.

181
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,620
Speaker 0: It's gotta be VR.

182
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:27,950
Speaker 1: Right.

183
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,490
Speaker 1: Pretend to be a dancer, right?

184
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,950
Speaker 1: Any of those are all going to be VR, AR type things going forward.

185
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:37,065
Speaker 0: Actually, MR.

186
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,750
Speaker 1: The specialized plastic thing is gone.

187
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,350
Speaker 0: The ridiculous killer app would be, you have the ridiculous plastic, but it doesn't fucking do anything.

188
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:48,450
Speaker 0: It's just like an inert, unintelligent drum set that just sits there.

189
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,430
Speaker 0: Like it's just pads on poles.

190
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,590
Speaker 0: But when you sit down in front of it and put on a VR helmet, you still hit the pads.

191
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,170
Speaker 0: But everything is tracked by the VR stuff.

192
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:04,749
Speaker 0: And it's just a mixed reality experience where you're literally on stage playing with the band, with all the nonsense.

193
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:13,330
Speaker 1: Like that is where you could do actually, that would actually probably make, uh, enough money to sustain the lives of a few developers.

194
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:16,190
Speaker 1: If you could make it, you could make it today.

195
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:22,310
Speaker 1: You could make a VR software where you just, you don't forget all the stuff you just said, right?

196
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:25,690
Speaker 1: Just you get any two stick like objects.

197
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,288
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter what the hell they are, right?

198
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:28,349
Speaker 1: Just two sticks.

199
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,568
Speaker 1: You can be six from the yard.

200
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,070
Speaker 0: Something in front of you to hit.

201
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,190
Speaker 0: It could be a table, right?

202
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,929
Speaker 1: You don't even need something to hit.

203
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,090
Speaker 1: You just need two.

204
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:36,310
Speaker 1: You just need two sticks.

205
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:38,990
Speaker 1: And then there's a cameras in the VR helmet.

206
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,830
Speaker 1: They see the sticks, you swing the sticks.

207
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:42,870
Speaker 0: Scott, that already exists.

208
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,650
Speaker 0: There's like 20 games like that.

209
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,230
Speaker 0: They're all pretty good.

210
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,480
Speaker 0: There are.

211
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,210
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

212
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:50,610
Speaker 1: And the camera sees the sticks and then it just makes drum noises at the right moments.

213
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,349
Speaker 1: And now you can play the drums in the air.

214
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,350
Speaker 0: There's a million things like that already.

215
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,330
Speaker 0: The killer app here would be not making the better game.

216
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:04,830
Speaker 0: It would be making the immersive experience using that VR as an MR as opposed to an AR.

217
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,769
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a lot going on here and we'll, we'll see.

218
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,590
Speaker 0: But yeah, don't, too many nerds.

219
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,726
Speaker 1: Maybe what you could do, maybe what you could do, right?

220
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,890
Speaker 1: Is go to like a big concert, right?

221
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:17,090
Speaker 1: Say a Metallica concert.

222
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:17,258
Speaker 1: Yeah.

223
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:20,830
Speaker 1: And you know, the piece of shit drummer, right?

224
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,270
Speaker 1: Lar, whatever his name is, Lars.

225
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:22,748
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

226
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,409
Speaker 0: You record, you have to replace it, right?

227
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,610
Speaker 1: You put, you put a helmet, you put a head cam on him, right?

228
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,010
Speaker 1: Or three 60 head cam on his head during the concert.

229
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,769
Speaker 1: And now anyone can pretend to be him.

230
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:41,510
Speaker 1: You subtract out all the drum sounds from the mix and you subtract out the video of his arms.

231
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:47,170
Speaker 1: And now you look around and like, you know, you're, uh, you are him, right?

232
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,889
Speaker 1: You're on stage playing with drums with Metallica.

233
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,109
Speaker 1: You can play whatever drum you want.

234
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:58,008
Speaker 0: A big aspect of people playing rock band was just the experience of listening to the song while doing the thing.

235
00:14:58,553 --> 00:15:00,230
Speaker 0: And this would be just that on another level.

236
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:06,246
Speaker 0: And the technology is actually there now for that kind of experience where it wasn't even a couple of years ago.

237
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,030
Speaker 1: So that, you know, that's not, that's not a bad, uh, it's not a bad experience.

238
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:11,546
Speaker 1: I would do that.

239
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:15,889
Speaker 1: I mean, I wouldn't buy a whole VR set to do that, but I would enjoy doing that.

240
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,510
Speaker 0: Yeah.

241
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:21,927
Speaker 0: I've had some great VR experiences, but that alone would not be enough for me to buy VR if I did not already have VR.

242
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,229
Speaker 0: But if that existed today, I would buy it immediately and play it.

243
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,669
Speaker 1: That said, that would be a fun thing.

244
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:29,050
Speaker 1: All right.

245
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:35,890
Speaker 0: One last little news, cause we're probably, we're very unlikely to do a show on Thursday cause you know, Thanksgiving holiday, but a wire cutter, which I don't use.

246
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:39,081
Speaker 0: Like I don't do wire Friday shopping or wire.

247
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,909
Speaker 1: So if you go online and you want to know the best X, you can't trust reviews on Amazon or anything anymore too much.

248
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:55,350
Speaker 1: And you consumer reports, sometimes you can figure out what they recommend, but they're usually behind a paywall.

249
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,208
Speaker 1: You don't want to pay for that.

250
00:15:56,931 --> 00:16:00,790
Speaker 1: And you know, other ones like America's test kitchen also kind of a paywall situation.

251
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:02,940
Speaker 1: It's not always easy to find, right?

252
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:12,570
Speaker 1: Like reliable reviews, even though we have a whole fucking internet full of, you know, unless you have like a specialized Reddit or something like headphone Reddit, you could find headphones.

253
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:13,250
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

254
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,747
Speaker 0: Like I can go to Sweetwater and get reviews of like professional audio equipment, but guess what?

255
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:20,279
Speaker 0: That does not exist.

256
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,030
Speaker 0: for like regular old stuff, right?

257
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,710
Speaker 1: If you want to know, for example, in my situation, best humidifier, there's not a lot of options.

258
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:27,125
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

259
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,510
Speaker 0: Also the answer is there are no good humidifiers.

260
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,429
Speaker 1: There are, is true.

261
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,429
Speaker 1: It's I'm trying one out and I'm going to find, if it sucks, I'm going to return it.

262
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,530
Speaker 1: So I expect it to not be perfect.

263
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:47,849
Speaker 1: The, um, so wire cutter is a division at the New York times that does real product reviews for real and posts on their website for free.

264
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:53,150
Speaker 1: Uh, the rankings, like I want to know the best, you know, bedsheets here they are right.

265
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,890
Speaker 1: Ranking best one, you know, other good one.

266
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:56,190
Speaker 1: Right.

267
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,450
Speaker 1: And it, you know, they're actual real recommendations.

268
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,570
Speaker 1: They're not just like Garbo top 10 lists, uh, like most sites are.

269
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:15,810
Speaker 1: Uh, but all the links on their website are affiliate links, which means if you go to wire cutter and they say, this is the best bicycle and you click buy, then you get taken to a different website to buy the bicycle.

270
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,470
Speaker 1: Cause it's not like New York times sells bicycles.

271
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:21,949
Speaker 1: And then if you end up buying it, the New York times gets money.

272
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:28,430
Speaker 0: Now I'll admit, even when I choose to buy something based on research, I did on a thing like wire cutter.

273
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:37,850
Speaker 0: Like that can happen when I'm doing research, uh, I always strip or, uh, any affiliate links or go to an independent site or buy directly from the manufacturer.

274
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,930
Speaker 1: Anyway, I agree up until now I've used wire cutter many times to get recommendations.

275
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:47,250
Speaker 1: I don't always go with the recommendation, but whether I do or not.

276
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,010
Speaker 1: I re I realized that those are affiliate links.

277
00:17:50,470 --> 00:18:00,788
Speaker 1: And if I see, and I decide I want the product, I will then separately open up a website of a store and type in the product model number into the product.

278
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,630
Speaker 0: I go DTC for everything.

279
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,650
Speaker 0: I go direct to consent.

280
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,870
Speaker 0: I go to manufacturer and buy it directly.

281
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,329
Speaker 0: Right.

282
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:13,570
Speaker 1: If they say the Scott brand, whatever is the best I'll go to scottbrand.com and buy the thing right there.

283
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,910
Speaker 0: If, if, if it's not before any of you say that, how can a wire cutter make money?

284
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,270
Speaker 0: That is not our problem.

285
00:18:18,551 --> 00:18:19,350
Speaker 1: That's not my problem.

286
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:19,767
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

287
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:28,750
Speaker 1: But the point is they're mistreating the workers at wire cutter who were doing reviews, doing real reviews is hard, like time intensive work.

288
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:29,028
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:32,490
Speaker 0: We only review a video game like once every month or so on geek nights.

290
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,710
Speaker 0: It takes a lot of effort to be able to review one.

291
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,370
Speaker 1: We're not doing it properly with journalistic integrity.

292
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:37,661
Speaker 1: Right.

293
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:39,829
Speaker 1: So it's not our job.

294
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:45,449
Speaker 1: So it's like, imagine having to review, you know, and actually figure out which a humidifier is the best.

295
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,430
Speaker 1: You got to get all these fucking different humidifiers.

296
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:50,529
Speaker 1: You got to see how they all work, test them all out.

297
00:18:50,950 --> 00:19:05,890
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, measure them all, do all kinds of, you know, really like get to know each one of them very well to figure out which one, you know, what's good or bad about each one, you know, pick the best one, you know, and then write, do actual writing, um, about it.

298
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,729
Speaker 1: It's like, that's hard work.

299
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,430
Speaker 1: So though people who work at wire cutter on strike, they're like, fuck the New York times.

300
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,330
Speaker 1: They're not treating us well.

301
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:12,369
Speaker 1: We're doing all this hard work.

302
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,684
Speaker 0: They announced the strike today at 10 58 AM.

303
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,289
Speaker 1: So what are the striking?

304
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:29,970
Speaker 1: And they said, what they want you to do is not use wire cutter, which means even if you do use wire cutter, make sure you block all ads and don't use the affiliate links.

305
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:34,310
Speaker 1: And that way you can just, you know, mooching off of it is basically the same thing, right?

306
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,390
Speaker 1: Cause what they need to see or just don't go to the website, then you're really safe.

307
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,529
Speaker 1: You won't go across the picket line that way for sure.

308
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:47,767
Speaker 0: But the key is we got to make sure that the New York times sees that they make almost no money from their affiliate links this year.

309
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:48,809
Speaker 1: Yep.

310
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:49,628
Speaker 1: Or a lot less.

311
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,069
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,110
Speaker 0: Hopefully a lot less.

313
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,640
Speaker 0: So that's why I get the word out about.

314
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,202
Speaker 0: the other

315
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,929
Speaker 1: thing is that, you know, even if the,

316
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:56,752
Speaker 0: uh,

317
00:19:57,214 --> 00:20:13,630
Speaker 1: cause if, if the affiliate link strike doesn't, uh, influence the times enough to, to, to strike a better deal, what they're going to probably have to do is whole keep striking for long enough that, and hope there's no scabs and that the reviews get out of date.

318
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:16,370
Speaker 1: Cause once the reviews are out of date, then the whole thing is done.

319
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:16,889
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,489
Speaker 1: But as long as the reviews are still timely, they're asking for so little too.

321
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:30,170
Speaker 0: Uh, I imagine though, if there were scabs, they're being paid so little that you do a shitty job and ruin the reputation of wire cutter.

322
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,969
Speaker 1: And thus you, you'd be like, well, fuck this.

323
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:34,770
Speaker 1: I don't need, this isn't helpful anymore.

324
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:35,128
Speaker 1: Yep.

325
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,210
Speaker 0: As soon as you become no better than an Amazon review, you're just done.

326
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:46,230
Speaker 1: I do want to disclose that, uh, you know, for, for example, a geek nights book club and some other things, right?

327
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,030
Speaker 1: I have an Amazon affiliate account.

328
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,009
Speaker 1: You just basically click to get one.

329
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,770
Speaker 1: I just had it forever.

330
00:20:52,411 --> 00:21:01,149
Speaker 1: And so, uh, when I linked to those things, I use the affiliate link cause it's like, well, if someone clicks this, I get free money instead of Jeff Bezos getting free money.

331
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,029
Speaker 0: I still urge you to strip those out.

332
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:04,330
Speaker 1: Yeah.

333
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,649
Speaker 1: But also I think we're going to just get rid of those.

334
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,568
Speaker 1: Cause why?

335
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,570
Speaker 1: Basically don't make any money on them.

336
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,963
Speaker 1: So why?

337
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,630
Speaker 0: I think we make more money from like the YouTube ads that you should be blocking.

338
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,890
Speaker 1: I think what we're going to do, actually look into these stats.

339
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,510
Speaker 0: Almost all our YouTube ad money is actually YouTube.

340
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:21,449
Speaker 0: I almost said YouTube red.

341
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,430
Speaker 0: It's almost it's YouTube premium money.

342
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,890
Speaker 0: If people are paying for the real YouTube.

343
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:25,970
Speaker 1: Okay.

344
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:37,202
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think what I'm going to do is, you know, coming up soon with the new website, we're going to be just, I'll just close the affiliate account and we'll get rid of all those links and you know, probably not link to him.

345
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:46,270
Speaker 1: I'll go to through the book clubs and I'll link to like some other site for the books, The original publisher or a different bookstore or something.

346
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,510
Speaker 0: Problem is any book I buy, I'm still buying an Amazon ebook.

347
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,830
Speaker 1: You can read on my Amazon to buy the book from wherever you're going to buy.

348
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,529
Speaker 1: That's up to you.

349
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,149
Speaker 1: But you know, on the website, we don't gotta be, be doing that.

350
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,319
Speaker 1: Yeah.

351
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,730
Speaker 0: We can link to like goodreads or something.

352
00:21:59,074 --> 00:21:59,890
Speaker 1: That's owned by Amazon.

353
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:00,370
Speaker 0: Crap.

354
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:00,810
Speaker 0: Right.

355
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,610
Speaker 0: They'll figure something out to link to there.

356
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,330
Speaker 0: There used to be more websites.

357
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,144
Speaker 0: I say that a lot.

358
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,290
Speaker 1: Goodreads is highly integrated with the Kindle.

359
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,470
Speaker 0: I say that a lot, but there used to be more websites.

360
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,649
Speaker 0: And the fact that there aren't enough websites is a big problem right now.

361
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,700
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

362
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,380
Speaker 0: So I played doom and doom 2, like when they came out, I got those shareware disks.

363
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:28,778
Speaker 0: I was all in on doom.

364
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:32,600
Speaker 0: And doom 2 was notable in that one.

365
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,639
Speaker 0: It, it had multiple double barreled shotgun shotgun.

366
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:39,479
Speaker 0: It was a fantastic goddamn game.

367
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:45,420
Speaker 0: It was better than, and different from doom 1 without just replacing doom 1.

368
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,899
Speaker 0: They're both worth playing cyber demons.

369
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,345
Speaker 1: Yeah.

370
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,860
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on there, but, uh, doom 2 had four different versions.

371
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:54,858
Speaker 0: Like they updated it.

372
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:59,419
Speaker 0: Remember this was before most people had access to the internet.

373
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,280
Speaker 1: You couldn't just, you bought, when you bought doom 2, that was the version you got.

374
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:07,540
Speaker 1: And you weren't, if there were patches, you weren't getting them easily.

375
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,749
Speaker 0: Uh, only would go and get these patches.

376
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,016
Speaker 0: You had to like know what to do.

377
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:27,240
Speaker 1: But I mean the same thing existed, you know, look at people talk about like, Oh, you know, if you play a link to the past randomizer, you need, you know, link to the past 1.0 Japanese version because all the American versions had patches and there were even patches beyond that.

378
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:37,040
Speaker 1: Now they tested those games so thoroughly before release that no casual player would really ever encounter almost any of those glitches.

379
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,879
Speaker 1: Um, but there were still lots of them.

380
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,381
Speaker 0: Not like.

381
00:23:40,422 --> 00:23:48,019
Speaker 0: there's the Pokemon game that sets out now, one of the recent ones, and people have discovered multiple permanent game ending soft locks in it.

382
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:48,860
Speaker 1: Right.

383
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,812
Speaker 1: But it's like, nobody's gonna, you know, missing.

384
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,988
Speaker 1: no, it's like, you need a guide to find missing.

385
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,320
Speaker 1: no in the original Pokemon, right?

386
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:01,080
Speaker 1: You're not getting any glitches as a casual with the amount of testing they do, but they still patches.

387
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,160
Speaker 1: And your point is you could never upgrade because you got a cartridge.

388
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:07,739
Speaker 1: You couldn't upgrade your cartridge and tend to didn't take the old one back and send you a new one.

389
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:25,760
Speaker 0: Total aside as a kid playing Final Fantasy 4 as Final Fantasy 2, the US edition on a cartridge that we bought like near when it came out, I accidentally did some sort of glitch and got two items, a summon and one of special items in my inventory from a random encounter.

390
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,759
Speaker 0: And none of my friends believe me.

391
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,299
Speaker 0: And I like took photos of the TV to prove that I had them.

392
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:34,777
Speaker 0: I had like the imp summon and the bomb some, all this weird shit that I found.

393
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,200
Speaker 1: Anyway, one time I was playing a mega man too.

394
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,220
Speaker 1: I was fighting bubble man and accidentally there was some kind of glitch.

395
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:47,780
Speaker 1: and you know, cause you go into a boss room in a mega man and you know, the little boss door opens like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, and then it closes and you can't go back.

396
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,977
Speaker 1: You can only, it's a one way door.

397
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:53,740
Speaker 1: One time I was fighting both men and somehow by X, I don't know what I did.

398
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,358
Speaker 1: The door opened up in reverse and I left the room.

399
00:24:57,882 --> 00:25:00,419
Speaker 1: And then I came back in and it was a fucked up glitch room.

400
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,140
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

401
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,959
Speaker 1: And I could, I could never replicate it.

402
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,680
Speaker 1: And I've never seen anyone on the internet replicate it.

403
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:06,860
Speaker 1: It was just a random glitch.

404
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,999
Speaker 1: Might've been, who knows what, but the boss door opened backwards.

405
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,779
Speaker 1: You can believe me or not.

406
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:12,976
Speaker 1: I was a kid.

407
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:21,061
Speaker 0: So Doom 2 had four versions, version 1.666, 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.

408
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,000
Speaker 0: I was, and this was over the course of like between 1994 and 1995.

409
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,060
Speaker 1: There's no way for me to know which version I played.

410
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,499
Speaker 0: I intimately knew these versions because I was deep into the modding community of Doom 2 back in the day.

411
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,900
Speaker 0: Like I was playing with dehacked and wadded and windu and all that crap.

412
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:42,959
Speaker 0: I made all sorts of weird mods and teleporter guns and me and Ken and a bunch of our friends were like deep into that.

413
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:45,432
Speaker 0: And there were a lot of important, like.

414
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:50,875
Speaker 0: you had to know which version you were targeting and you needed older versions for certain kinds of weird hacks you wanted to do.

415
00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:04,359
Speaker 0: What I did not know somehow until I saw this video a couple of weeks ago is that there were a lot of differences in specific parts of the maps in these versions.

416
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,099
Speaker 0: All the differences I knew about were in the engine, in enemy behavior, in like the way some triggers worked.

417
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:30,839
Speaker 0: But there were differences in the maps and this video explained a weird mystery as a kid where I had this memory of a secret door being in a spot and I remember very specifically like going to find it because I wanted to do something with it for a mod and I couldn't find it.

418
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,960
Speaker 0: And it was fucking me up to the point that as a high schooler I literally thought I had dreamed about this secret door and just like assumed it was real.

419
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:45,619
Speaker 0: Nope, it was only in like version 1.8, which I didn't bother playing because that was like the worthless version.

420
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:47,899
Speaker 0: So yeah, there you go.

421
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,279
Speaker 0: This video is fascinating.

422
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,839
Speaker 0: It's like 13 minutes long.

423
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,100
Speaker 1: I did watch this video before you even brought it up today.

424
00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:00,220
Speaker 1: I watched it like maybe a while ago and they pointed out a lot of the map changes were like just straight up design improvements.

425
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,839
Speaker 1: They're just better.

426
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:08,920
Speaker 0: Like move an enemy slightly to the left or fix the pegging of a texture so it actually lines up with the rest of the level, that kind of stuff.

427
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:17,980
Speaker 1: So speaking of old PC games, right, people often think of Quake as the first like actually 3D FPS because Doom was mostly 3D, but not really.

428
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,158
Speaker 0: Doom was a 2D game that had a third dimension implemented via interesting mechanisms.

429
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,022
Speaker 0: Most people call it.

430
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:29,860
Speaker 1: the first actual, for real, 3D game was Descent.

431
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,228
Speaker 1: And Descent was a game.

432
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,539
Speaker 1: that was the first game that I played on DOS where I got nauseous the first time I played it.

433
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,257
Speaker 1: Then I got used to it.

434
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,879
Speaker 0: Descent was so fucking good.

435
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:56,580
Speaker 1: But so there have been some more recent games made by like the people who originally made Descent to try to bring back, you know, the old times, but not so successful because a game where you can move around like that is like not an accessible game, really.

436
00:27:58,062 --> 00:28:03,038
Speaker 1: It's understandable why it's not popular now, but you can get Descent 1 to Descent 2 on GOG.

437
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,660
Speaker 1: And I was in a mood to play some Descent.

438
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:10,760
Speaker 1: So I went and I downloaded GOG because I own them on there already.

439
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:14,680
Speaker 1: I tried to run them and they run, but they ran really kind of meh.

440
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:18,979
Speaker 1: And I tried to mess with the DOSBox configs to make them less meh.

441
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:22,917
Speaker 1: And then I discovered, oh, wait, there's a thing called.

442
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:23,649
Speaker 1: what the hell is it called?

443
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,972
Speaker 1: DXX Rebirth.

444
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, DXX Rebirth.

445
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,497
Speaker 1: It's basically just like ZDoom, which is an engine that you load Doom wads into it.

446
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:35,260
Speaker 1: It's way better than regular the Doom game, right?

447
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:36,838
Speaker 1: At least for the current day.

448
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,400
Speaker 1: DXX Rebirth.

449
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:50,940
Speaker 1: If you have legit copies already of Descent 1 and 2, you copy some files over from your, you download the games in GOG, you copy some files over, and then you run DXX Rebirth.

450
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,860
Speaker 1: And now you can play Descent 1, Descent 2 only.

451
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:55,460
Speaker 1: Everything's modern.

452
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,380
Speaker 1: I'm running it at 4K resolution.

453
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,919
Speaker 1: My GPU is helping out.

454
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,060
Speaker 1: It's not everything's all pixely all the time.

455
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,759
Speaker 0: There's a lot of Doom mods that did a similar thing to the point.

456
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 1: I can use my mouse wheel for the controls, you know, all kinds of good stuff.

457
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,760
Speaker 0: Back then, if you were lucky, your mouse had three buttons.

458
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,800
Speaker 0: Scroll wheels were not really a thing yet.

459
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:15,648
Speaker 1: No.

460
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:21,400
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you want to play Descent, DXX Rebirth is definitely the best way to play.

461
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,537
Speaker 1: And also, I highly recommend playing Descent.

462
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:27,760
Speaker 1: Pretty much any game that says Descent on it is a good game.

463
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Speaker 0: I feel like I got some time off, too.

464
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:39,820
Speaker 0: I could play this because I was thinking about after you mentioned it, I was thinking about playing Descent again, because I literally have not played that since the era I was running DOS.

465
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 1: Descent is really like, you know, you think about like FPSs, but like basically.

466
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:49,440
Speaker 1: imagine Quake, but, you know, where your mouse looks, right?

467
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,799
Speaker 1: Your WASD moves.

468
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,800
Speaker 1: And but in Quake, the problem is this gravity.

469
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:58,780
Speaker 1: So up is like jump, but it's only a little bit up and down is like crouch.

470
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,738
Speaker 1: It's only a little bit down.

471
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:01,900
Speaker 1: Descent is the same exact thing.

472
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:03,440
Speaker 1: Only it's zero gravity.

473
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:04,659
Speaker 1: So jump.

474
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:06,639
Speaker 1: It's like you don't move up and down.

475
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,120
Speaker 1: You just stay put and you press jump.

476
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:13,339
Speaker 1: You go up and when you let go of jump, you just stop wherever you are.

477
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:13,711
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,739
Speaker 1: You know, and you crouch, you go down and you let go.

479
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,820
Speaker 0: And this is not like flying.

480
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:21,458
Speaker 0: I don't know, a Star Wars squadron ship through a building like it.

481
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:23,179
Speaker 0: No, you got to play it.

482
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,360
Speaker 0: There are not many games that control this way.

483
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:25,867
Speaker 0: And it is.

484
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:26,779
Speaker 0: it is neat.

485
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:28,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's.

486
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,040
Speaker 1: it's not too different from any other FPS, right?

487
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,960
Speaker 1: You should set up your controls exactly the same as the way you play quake.

488
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:37,860
Speaker 1: Just remember that jump is not jump.

489
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,900
Speaker 1: It's up and crouch is not crouch.

490
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:40,558
Speaker 1: It's down.

491
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:40,788
Speaker 1: Yeah.

492
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,779
Speaker 1: And you'll be very if you set your controls up like that.

493
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:50,460
Speaker 1: Oh, and I guess you also have to use a, you know, Q and E for roll for roll, right?

494
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,040
Speaker 1: Because, you know, you can't roll in quake, but you can roll in descent.

495
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,118
Speaker 1: So because you're a ship, you're not a.

496
00:30:56,342 --> 00:30:58,680
Speaker 0: I actually played it with a joystick.

497
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:01,138
Speaker 1: That's also a good way to do it.

498
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,079
Speaker 1: Perfectly valid.

499
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,540
Speaker 0: I had a flight stick pro plugged into my sound card.

500
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,683
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's.

501
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:13,920
Speaker 1: it's like and you know, you think, oh, instead of being free, you know, the other difference between descent and say X wing is that, yeah, it's your fraud.

502
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,700
Speaker 1: You're flying freely in space, but you're trapped in a maze like you are in Doom or Wolfenstein.

503
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,760
Speaker 1: You're not just out in the nowhere.

504
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:26,099
Speaker 1: If you want, if you want that experience, play descent free space, which is a different game.

505
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:28,820
Speaker 0: All right.

506
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,160
Speaker 0: In the moment, the geek does book club book, Taylor Genji.

507
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:34,180
Speaker 0: We'll do that show shortly after the new year with steamrolling through.

508
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,118
Speaker 1: Uh, I read some.

509
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read some too.

510
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:37,840
Speaker 0: I read.

511
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,599
Speaker 0: So I was, I had to go to work today and, uh, at a poop that was about long enough to finish a chapter I was on.

512
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:44,658
Speaker 0: So, uh, we'll keep going.

513
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,820
Speaker 0: This is Genji story.

514
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:55,020
Speaker 0: Knowing what I know, I'm probably going to stop at the points where it is debated whether or not it's the same author onward.

515
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,600
Speaker 0: It's a spoiler.

516
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
Speaker 1: You're going to cut short.

517
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,400
Speaker 1: I'm going to keep reading anything that is a chapter.

518
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,516
Speaker 0: All right.

519
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,259
Speaker 0: My question to you is Genji still alive?

520
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,238
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

521
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:05,717
Speaker 1: Okay.

522
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,960
Speaker 0: You know, I plan to stop reading.

523
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:08,358
Speaker 1: I know.

524
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,020
Speaker 1: I know he bites it because I saw it at the museum.

525
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:11,440
Speaker 0: Yep.

526
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:19,899
Speaker 0: I plan to stop reading when Genji is no longer alive unless I feel compelled or I finish in like the next week and a half or two.

527
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,340
Speaker 0: I'll just keep going until we do the show.

528
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Speaker 0: But anyway, otherwise, while I will be live, probably very likely without Scott at Pax Unplugged on Friday at 1pm in the Crab God Theater with a rebuild of a panel.

529
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,120
Speaker 0: We did a pilot version of once called Rare Game Mechanics.

530
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:46,960
Speaker 0: If you're not already going to Pax Unplugged, you do not need to go to see this panel because I plan to come home, edit it together and put it on YouTube before Pax Unplugged ends that weekend.

531
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,300
Speaker 1: You know what?

532
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Speaker 1: That's Friday, December 10th, not this Friday.

533
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:49,620
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

534
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,860
Speaker 0: December 10th, not this Friday.

535
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,960
Speaker 0: There's some con this Friday, but not what we're going to know.

536
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:58,340
Speaker 0: Otherwise, yeah, let's get right into the gift guide.

537
00:32:58,623 --> 00:32:59,439
Speaker 0: I don't have anything else.

538
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,400
Speaker 1: So yeah, a lot of websites out there as we discussed, affiliate links, right?

539
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:15,000
Speaker 1: There's a lot of websites out there that, you know, either a are just SEO spam where they put together a website, they go on Amazon, they find like the 10 best X, right?

540
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:26,459
Speaker 1: Or they put together some gift guide for X and they just take a bunch of affiliate links that they know that have good Amazon reviews and look like they didn't put any research in to figure out what's actually best.

541
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,458
Speaker 1: They just got a site to show up on your Google search result and hoping that you click those links.

542
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,595
Speaker 1: So they make free money.

543
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:46,516
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of journalistic outfits, like real journalistic outfits, even nerdy ones where in the holiday season, they'll post articles to their website that are like holiday buying guide for X, right?

544
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:54,993
Speaker 1: And it's like you're already reading their website and so you're the target audience and now they can post a list of things for you to buy.

545
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:57,419
Speaker 1: that are all affiliate links and they make some money.

546
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:04,932
Speaker 1: But that's not really like actually helping you choose to help, you know, find things to buy.

547
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:09,400
Speaker 1: It might, maybe, but yeah, there was a lot of effort put towards those.

548
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,431
Speaker 0: It is very easy to get money looking at a list like that because you know what those, uses those lists.

549
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:26,083
Speaker 0: People who are trying to buy a gift for someone they don't know that well or for whom they are not willing to put in that much effort and they're just they're trying to fulfill the unit of.

550
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:30,659
Speaker 0: I have given a gift and this is a really easy way to abdicate that responsibility.

551
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:32,100
Speaker 0: Oh, I know he's into gaming.

552
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,900
Speaker 0: I'll buy him the what's the top game Metroid.

553
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:36,639
Speaker 0: That's the game that came out on the Nintendo.

554
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,739
Speaker 0: He has a Nintendo, right?

555
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,695
Speaker 0: You buy that gift.

556
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:42,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm like, hey, what if we do, right?

557
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,159
Speaker 1: It's a holiday season now, right?

558
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:52,900
Speaker 1: We can do sort of a no personal capitalist interest, but also no capitalist interest whatsoever.

559
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:56,080
Speaker 1: Gift buying guide, right?

560
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,300
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it's like, so I guess today is Tuesday, so we'll do the gaming one.

561
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:11,399
Speaker 1: So there is a person that you need want or need to get a gift of some kind or give a gift to for holiday times.

562
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:19,778
Speaker 1: And you know that this person is a video game and or tabletop game enjoyer of sorts, right?

563
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:25,680
Speaker 1: What gift should you get this person now?

564
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:31,287
Speaker 0: Of course, we can give a lot of suggestions and such, but remember, you actually have to know about them.

565
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,880
Speaker 1: saving my best suggestion for last.

566
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:33,820
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I got some.

567
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:46,179
Speaker 0: I got some radical ones because games are a minefield for buying gifts, because if you look at video games, a lot of people, if they want a video game, they just buy that video game.

568
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,640
Speaker 0: A lot of people have access to a lot of video games they haven't even played yet.

569
00:35:50,301 --> 00:36:01,400
Speaker 0: And in fact, often being bought a video game can be social pressure by someone who likes that video game to try to get the person who's receiving the gift to play that video game with them.

570
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,915
Speaker 1: It's also, you know, in terms of giving gifts, I still feel like giving digital gifts is, you know, kind of meh.

571
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like that's.

572
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:10,780
Speaker 0: I've thought about that a lot.

573
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,278
Speaker 0: Like there's on one hand, people who give me steam gifts before, like, hey, here's a free game.

574
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:20,120
Speaker 0: But that's usually incidental as opposed to like, it's your birthday.

575
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,640
Speaker 0: I bought you Half-Life 4 or whatever.

576
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:25,000
Speaker 0: It's more like I had a bunch of gift codes.

577
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,577
Speaker 0: Here's one.

578
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:32,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, I don't really most games are digital, so I don't really like buying a game.

579
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:35,240
Speaker 1: Also, if there's a game someone wants, they probably got it.

580
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:38,617
Speaker 1: So you if someone's a Smash Brothers fan, you can't really get them.

581
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:39,280
Speaker 1: Smash Brothers.

582
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:40,720
Speaker 1: You can't get them a switch.

583
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:41,740
Speaker 1: They've got it right.

584
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,180
Speaker 1: You need to get something else outside of that that zone.

585
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,845
Speaker 0: You got to separate between.

586
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:54,436
Speaker 0: is this a gift for a person or this is this a gift for a child who does not have control over their own finances and cannot get?

587
00:36:54,476 --> 00:37:00,014
Speaker 1: children are easier to buy gifts or because, yeah, even if they're a child with rich parents or something, they're well off.

588
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,200
Speaker 1: There's children don't have the ability to purchase things for themselves.

589
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:13,360
Speaker 1: So there's probably things that they want that their parents haven't bought them yet that they probably made some sort of gift list of.

590
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,000
Speaker 0: These are the things I want.

591
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,240
Speaker 0: I want Smash Brothers.

592
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,879
Speaker 1: Or you just know what that kid likes.

593
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,280
Speaker 1: And the kid probably doesn't also read the news.

594
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:25,360
Speaker 1: So they probably don't even know that like a new thing is that exists.

595
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:25,709
Speaker 0: Yeah.

596
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,148
Speaker 0: Right.

597
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,240
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the Pokemon Diamond Pearl remakes just came out.

598
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,600
Speaker 1: Rim was talking about the soft locks.

599
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:35,459
Speaker 1: It's like there's probably Pokemon fan kids who don't even know that those are out.

600
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:41,955
Speaker 0: But for kids who don't control their own finances or for gamers who have

601
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,639
Speaker 1: money or

602
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:59,534
Speaker 0: buy the things they want, if you're going to get a gift that is a game in a digital world, the best possible way to do that is to figure out what ecosystem that person primarily plays games and get them some sort of gift card in that ecosystem.

603
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:00,960
Speaker 0: that is effectively cash.

604
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:08,939
Speaker 0: Nothing makes a kid's day more than having 40 dollars in like Roblox or whatever ecosystem they give a shit about.

605
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,860
Speaker 1: If there's a if there's a Roblox kid, giving them Robux is going to make them thrilled.

606
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:19,300
Speaker 1: But you have to consider for yourself how you feel about giving money to an immoral system.

607
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:19,799
Speaker 0: Yeah.

608
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,820
Speaker 1: But similarly, it would be a Roblox kid is going to be super happy to get a pile of Roblox.

610
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,534
Speaker 1: Let me tell you.

611
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:37,459
Speaker 0: But a non Roblox, a Roblox kid who owns the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo dollars, Nintendo coins are extremely valuable to those kids.

612
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:38,380
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:40,140
Speaker 1: Also, you know, someone's got an iPhone.

614
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:42,340
Speaker 1: You can't go wrong with some Apple dollars.

615
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,359
Speaker 1: It's like, so I get their kid.

616
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:45,940
Speaker 0: All right.

617
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,940
Speaker 0: So you want to go through video game enjoyers first or tabletop enjoyers first?

618
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:50,740
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

619
00:38:50,940 --> 00:39:01,280
Speaker 1: So my first idea, and this is something I got for myself recently, but I think could be good for anybody really, is that almost any video game player has controllers.

620
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:02,980
Speaker 1: Now, they already got controllers.

621
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:07,240
Speaker 1: If there was a fancy controller, they needed like a fighting game person or something.

622
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:07,516
Speaker 1: Yeah.

623
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:07,920
Speaker 1: Right.

624
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,035
Speaker 1: It's like they already got that.

625
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Speaker 0: Sometimes the hotasses are hard to get and expensive.

626
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:23,800
Speaker 0: So that is the kind of something that is a niche gift, but a controller that is actually hard to get that you somehow are able to get with your connections and resources.

627
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,820
Speaker 0: Absolutely fantastic gift.

628
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,700
Speaker 0: But that's a situational thing.

629
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,300
Speaker 0: That's rare.

630
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,100
Speaker 1: I think that's true.

631
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:29,980
Speaker 1: Just in general.

632
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:36,360
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, if you have a bunch of money and you want to get some 3080, it's like or any sort of expensive, rare thing.

633
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:36,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

634
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,634
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they want to get it.

635
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,752
Speaker 0: I can't even get a fucking 3080 kid.

636
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:52,660
Speaker 1: But the point is, if there's something that's obviously rare out of stock, you know, hard to find, that's something that you can get for someone who even has money because they probably didn't get it for themselves already.

637
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:52,766
Speaker 1: Right.

638
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,940
Speaker 1: That's that's easy one.

639
00:39:54,521 --> 00:40:01,140
Speaker 1: But my idea was you could go and I recently changed the shells on my joy cons to be green.

640
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:09,840
Speaker 1: So you could get somebody's controllers and customize them, put different shells on them, or you could go get a controller.

641
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:13,740
Speaker 1: Don't give someone the shells unless, you know, they're a big DIY person.

642
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:14,420
Speaker 1: Right.

643
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,020
Speaker 1: You're going to have to do it for them and give them a controller that's already customized and has their aesthetic.

644
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:21,780
Speaker 1: Right.

645
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:23,139
Speaker 1: They would be into that, I think.

646
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:23,920
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

647
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,097
Speaker 0: That that's a good gift.

648
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:27,033
Speaker 0: Another with gaming.

649
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:28,319
Speaker 0: It's tough.

650
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:33,660
Speaker 0: A lot of people want to be live streamers, but don't quite know how to do it.

651
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:38,839
Speaker 0: And if you know, the person's kind of doing it, but like has not invested at all.

652
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:54,020
Speaker 0: Buying any amount of the technology or things that a professional would know to own, but some kid wouldn't know to own like a ring light or a desk mounted stand for a light or one really nice microphone.

653
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,980
Speaker 1: Like even if they're not going to be good at streaming or use it a lot.

654
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:57,300
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,600
Speaker 1: They'll be happy to have it if they're trying and having these, you know, dreams of grandeur that they give up on a two months.

656
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,120
Speaker 1: That's all right.

657
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,698
Speaker 1: They'll have a gift.

658
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,859
Speaker 1: They'll be happy for two months.

659
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:06,220
Speaker 1: Right.

660
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,858
Speaker 1: They'll thank you.

661
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,457
Speaker 0: Or even if they don't.

662
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:20,140
Speaker 0: Those kinds of things tend to just make it more pleasant to be online in social spaces in general, like being in a discord video call or zoom in with the friends or whatever.

663
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,980
Speaker 0: Those are just super generically useful.

664
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,340
Speaker 0: And a lot of people don't know like the good things that exist in that space.

665
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,700
Speaker 0: Like a lot of people have no idea that a ring light is like fantastic for a webcam and they wonder why they look like shit online.

666
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:42,899
Speaker 0: It's the kind of gift that some in general, the best kind of gift you can get someone is something that they didn't know they wanted, but you figured out they would use or would want if they knew it existed.

667
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,035
Speaker 1: Yep.

668
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,540
Speaker 1: So also along the custom lines, right?

669
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,420
Speaker 1: You know, I recently upgraded my GBA big time.

670
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:50,237
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

671
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,869
Speaker 1: If you go and get, you know, an old, you know, GBA, people probably aren't thinking of that, right?

672
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,397
Speaker 1: But go get an old GBA, upgrade it with the new screen, right?

673
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,720
Speaker 1: And the, and the USB-C charging battery, just like I did.

674
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:10,379
Speaker 1: Get a flash cart, load the flash cart with all the ROMs, do everything for them.

675
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:19,580
Speaker 1: And if you give that to some gamer as a gift, even if they weren't thinking about it, even if, you know, it's like anyone who plays video games is going to be happy to have one.

676
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:22,480
Speaker 0: And if, and there's almost no danger.

677
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:28,199
Speaker 0: This person already has that because people who have those things and use them will never fucking shut up about them.

678
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:37,659
Speaker 1: It's like, oh yes, they already have, they already, you would know if someone was the kind of person who took a Game Boy Advance and swapped this display on it.

679
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:37,976
Speaker 1: Yep.

680
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,459
Speaker 0: Cause they've got it with them.

681
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,099
Speaker 0: They show it to you when there is no context for that.

682
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,037
Speaker 0: All right.

683
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,360
Speaker 0: So we're talking cool ideas.

684
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,820
Speaker 0: One, especially for online spaces.

685
00:42:51,201 --> 00:43:11,605
Speaker 0: If you know someone like hangs out in VR chat or does a lot of social media, buying someone a commission slot with an artist who makes avatars or things like that, that is the kind of gift that no one thinks about finding a good commission artist to make you like an avatar or

686
00:43:12,748 --> 00:43:17,960
Speaker 1: commission an artist to make an art for them or obviously be an artist and make an art for someone.

687
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,539
Speaker 1: That's a gift for not just Tuesday, but any day.

688
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,337
Speaker 1: Right.

689
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:40,080
Speaker 0: But if you're not an artist and you can't make it yourself, then either commissioning someone to make it for them, or especially if it's something like a social media avatar, finding an artist that's in the style they like, or that, you know, they like and buying them the commission slot, but letting them work with the artist on the details way safer.

690
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:42,739
Speaker 0: And that is the kind of gift that no one thinks to give.

691
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:43,652
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

692
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,240
Speaker 1: And no, that branches out into like, you know, other categories.

693
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,347
Speaker 1: Right.

694
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,180
Speaker 1: So like in the tabletop zone, you might think, oh, okay.

695
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,199
Speaker 1: Dice tray.

696
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,180
Speaker 1: Wait, fancy dice tray.

697
00:43:54,783 --> 00:43:55,879
Speaker 1: Wait, no.

698
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,658
Speaker 1: Commission artist who makes custom dice trays.

699
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:00,614
Speaker 1: Right.

700
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,779
Speaker 1: That's like just take it to another level there.

701
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,060
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,340
Speaker 0: Same thing with mouse pads.

703
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,420
Speaker 0: Fancy new mouse pad.

704
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:06,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:08,719
Speaker 0: You got the art that the kid is really into.

706
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,679
Speaker 0: Like their Roblox is right there fighting the other Roblox.

707
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:13,086
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

708
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:15,639
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, buy someone some dice.

709
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:25,200
Speaker 1: No, buy someone a slot with the person who makes handmade dice and they can get their own custom dice to their desires from the dice artisan.

710
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,180
Speaker 0: Right.

711
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,900
Speaker 1: You got to go next level, right?

712
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,519
Speaker 1: If you just give someone some dice, it's like, okay, I got dice.

713
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:31,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,040
Speaker 1: I always like getting more dice because they're nerd.

715
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,679
Speaker 1: But yeah, but it's like, I got nerds who want dice.

716
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:38,120
Speaker 0: You know what they want to do more than anything.

717
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,880
Speaker 1: Someone got me, even someone like me, who's not using dice too much these days.

718
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,660
Speaker 1: If you got me the commission slot with the dice artisan, I'd be like, oh, that's great.

719
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:46,011
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

720
00:44:46,347 --> 00:44:46,453
Speaker 1: Yeah.

721
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:57,220
Speaker 0: But if you're getting someone just dice that can be bought commercially, that's kind of a fail because anyone who cares about dice, they want more than anything when they're at a gaming store or a convention to buy more dice.

722
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,980
Speaker 0: They're barely holding themselves back.

723
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:07,040
Speaker 0: So you will get them dice that they don't need and deny them the pleasure of buying those dice from the place.

724
00:45:07,343 --> 00:45:09,080
Speaker 0: But the commission dice, that's a big one.

725
00:45:09,823 --> 00:45:12,320
Speaker 1: And if they're a tabletop person in general, right?

726
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:20,800
Speaker 1: If you don't, you could either go, if you're going for some standard item that they already have, like dice, you need to level it up to like fancy or commission level, right?

727
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:25,000
Speaker 1: But you could give them some weird items.

728
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:30,680
Speaker 1: Like here, I went to Game Crafter and I got you a ton of fucking meeples and sticks and right.

729
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:36,038
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, even if someone's not looking to design games, tabletop nerds love to have game bits.

730
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,013
Speaker 1: They just like them.

731
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:38,959
Speaker 1: You can't go wrong.

732
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,960
Speaker 1: I mean, here's a sack of meeples for like every game, you know, just a hundred thousand meeples.

733
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,880
Speaker 0: I have an enjoyer of just sack of meeples to do something with.

734
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:54,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got the cow meeple, the meat meeple, the wheat meeple, you know, have fun.

735
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,795
Speaker 1: Good times.

736
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,860
Speaker 0: Along those lines, we're talking about tabletop in particular.

737
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:09,980
Speaker 0: RPGs are interesting and tough because RPG people tend to buy every goddamn RPG they even remotely thought was interesting.

738
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,219
Speaker 0: Or they just play D&D or Pathfinder, which is basically just D&D.

739
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:22,080
Speaker 0: That's a tough space to get gifts in directly unless they're in the miniature zone, right?

740
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,920
Speaker 1: It's like that is the miniatures.

741
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,560
Speaker 1: People are actually probably the easiest because, yes, they will just be happy to get more miniatures.

742
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:32,560
Speaker 1: like some dude has a 40K army or he does D&D with minis.

743
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:36,700
Speaker 1: It's like, here, I got you 20 skeletons or I got you 20 space marines.

744
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,820
Speaker 1: They're just like, yes, they're just like, here's some paint.

745
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:41,859
Speaker 1: It's blue.

746
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,660
Speaker 1: It's like, yes, it's like they're thrilled, right?

747
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,458
Speaker 1: That's just not cheap.

748
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:47,300
Speaker 1: There's doubles.

749
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,979
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

750
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,099
Speaker 1: I already got that one.

751
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:49,774
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

752
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,818
Speaker 1: Just get them anything.

753
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,499
Speaker 1: That's as long as it's in the right game that or the stuff that they do.

754
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:56,478
Speaker 1: Right.

755
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:57,520
Speaker 1: It's all good.

756
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
Speaker 1: Just minis are the easiest in the universe.

757
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,519
Speaker 1: Here's some fake bushes.

758
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:00,844
Speaker 0: Woo.

759
00:47:01,582 --> 00:47:01,756
Speaker 0: Yep.

760
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:07,500
Speaker 0: But a way to go on generic gifts, especially with a lot of people's stuff to play RPGs online.

761
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:22,198
Speaker 0: And I've seen directly from some conversations with coworkers recently that there are many people who struggled to find people to roleplay with during the pandemic, when a lot of people got driven online, suddenly had a bunch of people to play with because they were online.

762
00:47:23,062 --> 00:47:26,700
Speaker 0: A lot of people still struggle with actually making online games work well.

763
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:36,853
Speaker 0: So depending on the person, paying for a year for them to have an account like a real one on a thing like Roll20 could be a really good gift.

764
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:39,099
Speaker 0: if you know the person's playing games online.

765
00:47:39,261 --> 00:47:43,199
Speaker 1: Maybe you're getting you're getting close to my ultimate gift idea, but you're not quite there yet.

766
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:55,139
Speaker 0: Or just like I talked about with the streaming equipment, a lot of people are playing games online might not like in a discord or something might not have the things to facilitate that experience and make it easier.

767
00:47:56,361 --> 00:48:04,159
Speaker 0: One of those webcam stands that points down at a die rolling pit could go a long way for someone who's playing games online ad hoc.

768
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:05,199
Speaker 1: Hmm.

769
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,120
Speaker 1: So, yeah, back to the equipment ideas, right?

770
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:17,580
Speaker 1: You know, most gamers are probably not using regular playing cards too often, but you got to have one in the house somewhere.

771
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:24,258
Speaker 1: When I was I was recently buying a lot of playing cards for some purposes, you would be shocked.

772
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:33,720
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe probably not when you think about it, but just a sheer amount of different playing card decks that are out there with different art on them of high and low qualities.

773
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:43,117
Speaker 1: It's like if you get someone everyone needs a deck of playing cards, if you get a gamer, you can probably get a Mario deck of playing cards, a Star Wars, whatever it is.

774
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,859
Speaker 1: Fancy deck of playing cards is like that's the stocking stuffer.

775
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

776
00:48:49,480 --> 00:49:00,200
Speaker 0: You just said right along those lines, if you know a big tabletop person who doesn't have a set of actually nice clay poker chips, those are so nice, so useful.

777
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:02,639
Speaker 0: I love my poker chips.

778
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:05,859
Speaker 0: That giant, like heavy suitcase that I've been stopped.

779
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:10,420
Speaker 0: Ninety percent of the times I've flown with those things, I've been stopped by the TSA.

780
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,700
Speaker 1: All right.

781
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:21,160
Speaker 1: So next item I got here, someone might enjoy a game, say, maybe they're Animal Crossing person or Zelda person.

782
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,488
Speaker 1: There do exist various like.

783
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:32,140
Speaker 1: the easiest example are like the big strategy guide books or like that Zelda history book they have or Mega Man art book.

784
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:32,620
Speaker 1: Right.

785
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:48,660
Speaker 1: There's always going to be lots and lots of like small, not huge print run, you know, coffee table book kind of stuff, but just meta media that is published or produced about the game that they're into.

786
00:49:49,293 --> 00:49:49,500
Speaker 0: Right.

787
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:57,200
Speaker 1: Whether it's strategy guys, art books, you know, documentaries, you know, anything like that, anything in the meta zone.

788
00:49:58,074 --> 00:49:58,260
Speaker 1: Right.

789
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,819
Speaker 1: That has been created and sold.

790
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,540
Speaker 1: Those are usually sold as gifts.

791
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,377
Speaker 1: That's what they're there for.

792
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,314
Speaker 1: Right.

793
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:08,400
Speaker 1: So getting any one of those, if you know which game the person is into, is probably easy.

794
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:10,400
Speaker 1: if you know they don't have that thing already.

795
00:50:13,364 --> 00:50:25,439
Speaker 1: Likewise, we talked about getting some of the expensive, hard to get thing, but there's also the rare unknown thing is usually this applies to, you know, because it's video games, usually Japanese merch.

796
00:50:25,834 --> 00:50:26,000
Speaker 1: Right.

797
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,720
Speaker 1: Now you pay attention to merch that is being produced in another country.

798
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:38,860
Speaker 1: Go to like HLJ.com or something, or Big Bad Toy Store, or any of those websites where they're importing Japanese merchandise.

799
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:53,439
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's more expensive these days and harder to get, but there is a lot of merchandise produced in other countries that someone who isn't very internetty and isn't very well connected is not going to even know it exists.

800
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,040
Speaker 0: And the less internetty someone is, the lower that bar is.

801
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:05,700
Speaker 0: That Zelda Game & Watch, for a huge percentage of gamers in America, even if they would like that thing, they don't know it exists because they just don't pay attention.

802
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,440
Speaker 1: And it's on the shelves at their local Target and they don't know it exists.

803
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:17,740
Speaker 1: So if you get something, if you import like, you know, the Gengar backpack for some kid from Japan, it's like, holy shit, where'd you get that from?

804
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:19,580
Speaker 1: Oh, the other side of the world, right?

805
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,580
Speaker 1: It's like, no way are you going to miss as long as you get the right intellectual property.

806
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:27,719
Speaker 1: Bring the rare import.

807
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:41,938
Speaker 0: So situationally, this is either a gift for an older nerd who's starting to try to collect retro gaming stuff or a young gamer who doesn't have a lot of games or the sheer novelty of this would get them.

808
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:55,198
Speaker 0: If you've got like an old NES or an Atari 2600 laying around, not the modding situation like Scott talked about, where you like get the custom GBA mod with the chip and give it with the card and give it to them.

809
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:57,180
Speaker 0: But like kid, here's an NES.

810
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,860
Speaker 0: The cables are plugged into a modern TV and 50 cartridges.

811
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:06,999
Speaker 1: Well, you can also get, I think a good idea is, you know, how I mentioned the upgraded GBA.

812
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:12,500
Speaker 1: There are various, you know, sort of unofficial console devices that you can get.

813
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:19,960
Speaker 1: You can get like one of those handheld Raspberry Pi things or, you know, a console Raspberry Pi style device.

814
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,539
Speaker 0: Those things are pretty good.

815
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:24,840
Speaker 0: They're definitely a dubious legality, but who cares?

816
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:27,000
Speaker 1: Well, there's two different styles, right?

817
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:39,000
Speaker 1: There's the style that's full of emulators because, you know, if they're not an HDPC person, if they got an Apple TV, just get them a device and, you know, load it up with all the ROMs that they can plug into their TV that has some controllers attached to it.

818
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:48,180
Speaker 1: Or they have ones that, yeah, it's not an actual NES, but you can put an NES cartridge in or a Genesis cartridge or a Super Nintendo cartridge and it plays.

819
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:50,800
Speaker 1: Maybe it also plays ROMs, right?

820
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,619
Speaker 1: It's just, there's a lot of these, you know, sort of, uh, unofficial console devices out there that you can get.

821
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:01,339
Speaker 1: And a non-HTPC person can get a lot of benefit out of one of those.

822
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,919
Speaker 1: And, you know, coming from my perspective, I'm like always telling people, get an HDPC.

823
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,516
Speaker 1: You can play every video game ever.

824
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,117
Speaker 1: Get a, you play every video game ever and people don't do it.

825
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:24,440
Speaker 0: You, uh, you gave me a really good segue because one of the things that's near the bottom of my list was for, for someone who is not an HTPC person, fucking get them a tiny HTPC already set up and install it in their house.

826
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,898
Speaker 0: And they will, they will never look back.

827
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:32,160
Speaker 1: Or just get the gaming, you know, just, just the gaming part of it as a, as a little device, right?

828
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:34,100
Speaker 1: Just so they, it's like, look, I set it up for you.

829
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:34,939
Speaker 1: I got you this gift.

830
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:40,439
Speaker 1: You now have every emulatable video game ever on a little SD card and they all play on your TV.

831
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:42,699
Speaker 1: And now you can see what I was raving about all this time.

832
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,096
Speaker 0: Yup.

833
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:45,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

834
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:47,320
Speaker 0: The HDPC was more for my Monday list.

835
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,338
Speaker 0: It was literally just get one of those people, the tiniest possible HDPC.

836
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,480
Speaker 0: And it's got like Chrome and steam and windows installed on it.

837
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,220
Speaker 1: Tiniest computer with like eight or 16 gigs of Ram, a CPU.

838
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,416
Speaker 1: You don't need any GPU in there, right?

839
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:06,080
Speaker 1: Just, and then plug it and get it plugged into their TV with some kind of remote control keyboard thing.

840
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,538
Speaker 0: Get them that one, like Logitech integrated keyboard and touch pad that everyone uses cause it's cheap and it just works.

841
00:54:12,026 --> 00:54:12,760
Speaker 1: And they still make it.

842
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,879
Speaker 1: And it was on sale recently.

843
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,898
Speaker 1: I don't know if it still is.

844
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,159
Speaker 0: I changed the batteries every like year and a half give or take.

845
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,540
Speaker 1: So I'm down.

846
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,780
Speaker 1: I'm down to my two ultimate gift ideas.

847
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:22,358
Speaker 0: All right.

848
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:22,757
Speaker 0: All right.

849
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,020
Speaker 0: Cause I, our commission is pretty ultimate.

850
00:54:25,461 --> 00:54:27,540
Speaker 1: So our commission was pretty ultimate.

851
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,540
Speaker 0: I can't, that was, what's your pen ultimate?

852
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,807
Speaker 1: The pen ultimate is not.

853
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:38,180
Speaker 1: everybody is like us who in a safe time can just go to fucking conventions all the time.

854
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:42,620
Speaker 1: Oh, if you just, you know, it's cost money.

855
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:43,520
Speaker 1: It does.

856
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,200
Speaker 1: You take someone, you just take them and right.

857
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,158
Speaker 1: It's like, guess what?

858
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,580
Speaker 1: Bitches are going to fax, right?

859
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,159
Speaker 1: They never been.

860
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,059
Speaker 1: Or guess what?

861
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:51,078
Speaker 1: Bitches are going to Essen.

862
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:52,659
Speaker 1: We're going to Tokyo game show.

863
00:54:52,782 --> 00:54:53,380
Speaker 1: Where are we going?

864
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,660
Speaker 1: Take them, get the tickets, get the flight, get the hotel, get it all.

865
00:54:59,020 --> 00:54:59,125
Speaker 1: Right.

866
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,709
Speaker 1: It's like, we're going to Disney world.

867
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,516
Speaker 1: kids only not.

868
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,640
Speaker 0: That is one hell of a good gift idea.

869
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,579
Speaker 1: Just take them to the con.

870
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,080
Speaker 1: We're going to go see those two geek nights.

871
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,542
Speaker 1: Nerds

872
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:22,899
Speaker 0: that is a gift that requires effort because especially someone who's never been to a con before, just buying them, like getting them in and then like they're on their own by not cut it, but being willing to actually go with them and make it a thing and like show them around.

873
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:26,380
Speaker 0: Not only is that fun for them, but I mean, I like doing that.

874
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,120
Speaker 0: Whenever we have a PACS newbie who comes with us to a PACS, that is a good time.

875
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,476
Speaker 0: It's Scott.

876
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,960
Speaker 0: I were dragging them around like, Oh, we're going to the omega-thon finale.

877
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,199
Speaker 0: You don't even know what that is.

878
00:55:34,442 --> 00:55:34,655
Speaker 0: Do you?

879
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:35,839
Speaker 1: Yep.

880
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:36,920
Speaker 1: All right.

881
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:38,120
Speaker 0: Hopefully it's not a bad game.

882
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:45,740
Speaker 1: So the ultimate gift idea, the thing that all gamer, all gamer actually wants, right.

883
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,420
Speaker 1: Is won't even cost you any fucking money.

00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,100
Speaker 0: I know.

885
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:54,280
Speaker 0: I'm going to type in no, in my little notepad, uh, exactly what I think you're about to say.

886
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:55,040
Speaker 1: All right.

887
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,260
Speaker 1: Let me see what you're let me tell you.

888
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,180
Speaker 1: Oh, in your notepad.

889
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,473
Speaker 1: Okay.

890
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:03,579
Speaker 0: So I just said what I'm doing, what I typed was I will play the game that you want to play with you a certain number of times.

891
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,080
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.

892
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:05,859
Speaker 1: The thing that all gamer wants.

893
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,500
Speaker 0: I'll play your fucking train game that you've been bothering me about for 10 years.

894
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,839
Speaker 0: Look, I will play with you.

Speaker 1: We're bringing 10 people there.

898
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,780
Speaker 0: Or you want to do laser tag or airsoft for doing it once.

899
00:56:28,203 --> 00:56:28,459
Speaker 0: Here it is.

900
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:35,440
Speaker 1: I rented out the back of the game store and we're going to play that the 10 hour samurai swords taught in pyramid.

Speaker 1: It's everything is set.

928
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,817

Speaker 1: Also, it might just make sure you don't pick the game that you like and the friend doesn't like.

938
00:58:10,141 --> 00:58:17,620
Speaker 1: you have to choose the game that the, and the experience that the person you're gifting the, this too is wants the most.

Speaker 0: But it could be the bowling ball that Marge gives to Homer.

942
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:30,059
Speaker 0: You could agree to arrange the game that you don't fucking like.

943
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,359
Speaker 0: That is, that is a gift.

944

950
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:50,719

951
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:59,980
Speaker 0: It's kind of all I can think is you and me and a bunch of our show up at a certain unnamed individual's door after like post COVID.
