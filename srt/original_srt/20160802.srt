1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,342
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 2nd 2016.

2
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:20,039
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm scared and this is geek nights tonight the games that rims playing and Scott's not playing.

3
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,757
Speaker 0: I guess Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:35,980
Speaker 1: We're actually still a little bit sick like You know like usually when we get sick like there's a week of like no geek nights And then we're just good to go again, but we're both still kind of sick, and it's weird sick.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,268
Speaker 0: It's just like I keep having phlegm.

6
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:39,874
Speaker 0: I keep coughing up, and it like like.

7
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:44,068
Speaker 1: this is the longest lingering virus I've ever had like it's.

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,064
Speaker 1: actually if we if we keep lingering coughing for like another couple weeks This will be longer than Lyme disease Like it.

9
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,375
Speaker 0: just you know like it waxes and wanes like at night.

10
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:59,231
Speaker 1: It's bad, and then the day Who do we even get this from?

11
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,618
Speaker 1: thanks Kinetic on mm-hmm?

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,965
Speaker 0: Followed the protocol.

13
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,780
Speaker 1: yeah protocol did not save us that time.

14
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,986
Speaker 1: I mean I buy.

15
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 1: I even use the alcohol like hand wash Pretty regularly just because you know as the head of the panel's department I was like walking around touching shit like touching microphones.

16
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:17,625
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff.

17
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,622
Speaker 1: I don't do like at a normal packs other than the one panel We're on.

18
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:24,440
Speaker 1: it's not like we're walking around touching things other than board games.

19
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:27,251
Speaker 1: So I have in.

20
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:31,800
Speaker 1: I had other gaming news But this is important enough because we'll see if it sticks around.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,739
Speaker 1: I tried to figure out the exact and specific legal reason why and how this occurred.

22
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,980
Speaker 1: and Holy hell is the publishing provenance of Nintendo power difficult to suss out?

23
00:01:43,502 --> 00:02:00,160
Speaker 1: But the best I can tell is Nintendo ceded the rights to this other company Future which was a subsidiary of a British company also called future Which apparently also owns things like games radar PC gamer maximum PC and all that nonsense.

24
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:04,778
Speaker 1: but anyway the news is all of Nintendo power.

25
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:09,689
Speaker 1: every single one is scanned and online.

26
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,279
Speaker 1: at archive org you can just read through Nintendo power.

27
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:23,030
Speaker 1: and It was a real real hardcore nostalgia trip because I our family we subscribe to Nintendo power Literally from day one.

28
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:27,912
Speaker 1: I received in the mail every episode of Nintendo power except the first one.

29
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:33,460
Speaker 1: we bought the first one in the store and Subscribed from it and got the next one in October.

30
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,158
Speaker 1: So yeah, the Nintendo power was pretty much just An ad that I paid for.

31
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:56,769
Speaker 1: Every month an ad came and I read the ad and I read the ad so much that when I was flipping through these things today I Remember Almost every one of these issues in frightening detail Like I remember what games were in them.

32
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,731
Speaker 1: I just lay there as a kid like read them but over over again The most important one I think is probably 17.

33
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:12,635
Speaker 1: I think it's 17 17 whichever one was the Final Fantasy guide Because that one most starkly shows the difference between a kid brain and an adult brain.

34
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:40,070
Speaker 1: when I was a kid my kid brain I'd played Final Fantasy 1. but when I had the Final Fantasy 1 Nintendo power strategy guide, which I think was this year 17 I changed the way I played Final Fantasy 1. and what I would do and I do this about once a year is I would use The guide to do the perfect step count effectively other than leveling up but to just go through the game like no puzzles No getting lost no danger.

35
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,800
Speaker 1: Just fight your way through get the floater and beat the game.

36
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,095
Speaker 1: Like I would read a strategy guide and use it to play this optimal path through a very long game.

37
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:52,368
Speaker 1: and I would do this Semi often as a child.

38
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:58,899
Speaker 1: and that's the kind of thing that adult brain would not only disdain But actively try to convince people not to do.

39
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:12,419
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was but I guess all the nostalgia I would get for playing Final Fantasy 1 again is 100% covered by just reading this issue of Nintendo power again.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,214
Speaker 1: In fact, I think I'm gonna read it again right now.

41
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,140
Speaker 1: You got any news?

42
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,903
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

43
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:31,869
Speaker 0: So the game that I played perhaps the best game of a few years ago Whatever year it was that I played so much that I became one of the best maybe hundred players in the world Pac-man CEDX, XDX.

44
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,472
Speaker 0: Pac-man.

45
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:36,011
Speaker 0: Well, there was Pac-man championship edition Which I actually did not play.

46
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:44,160
Speaker 0: then those Pac-man DX which is the real one and then they even had like DX plus which is like what you'll buy on Steam now.

47
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:48,109
Speaker 0: Whatever right or see you all Whatever CEDX plus.

48
00:04:48,432 --> 00:05:00,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was 17 man, anyway anyway, so You know that game, you know has been Sort of people like lost because basically, you know, it's a game I'm good at.

49
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:02,860
Speaker 0: but the way the game works is really a game of optimization, right?

50
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:15,546
Speaker 0: There's so many maps and you optimize each one and then after you figure out how to optimize each one It's just can you execute that optimization the end and if you can, you know Every little bit counts and that's your score.

51
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:20,120
Speaker 0: and whoever gets the highest score the fastest time because there's time modes and score modes.

52
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:21,587
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

53
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:22,532
Speaker 0: And then there's not much.

54
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:33,060
Speaker 0: once you've reached like the limit There's only so much more you can improve and it's really not worth it to most human beings to sit there that long to Marginally improve by like a fraction of a second.

55
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,320
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a lot like like for real more legitimate racing games like just get your time better by a few milliseconds.

56
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:48,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, so over and over again memorize reached almost my maximum, you know Ability and results so I didn't play it as much.

57
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:51,600
Speaker 1: You don't want to be a world contender I mean, I basically am a world contender.

58
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,165
Speaker 1: So you should answer like packs.

59
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:59,109
Speaker 0: a lot of the people who are ahead of me on the score chart were basically fake Entries that were not real people.

60
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,219
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's pretty high up there.

61
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,689
Speaker 0: but part of that was also because the way that the rankings worked.

62
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,614
Speaker 0: is it you it combined.

63
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:06,996
Speaker 0: there's like.

64
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,781
Speaker 0: there's the combined ranking of Like.

65
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,865
Speaker 0: I think at my highest ranking I was like, you know Like top 20 something.

66
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:18,300
Speaker 0: but it's like it combined your scores for everything and I did everything in the whole game.

67
00:06:18,982 --> 00:06:25,080
Speaker 0: But if you looked like I was like on the regular old course the basic course, I was like 200 something, right?

68
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:32,789
Speaker 0: It's still there are a bunch of fake people above me, but it's like I did all the courses It's like on the combined total ranking.

69
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,080
Speaker 0: I was like 20 something, you know, but much higher anyway.

70
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:58,460
Speaker 0: They have announced and produced many videos displaying and advertising the upcoming thankfully after packs Pac-man championship edition - Which is now which looks to be from the videos An awesome game but also a different game from championship edition different enough that it's not the same game.

71
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,013
Speaker 0: So I think a lot of the same skills will apply.

72
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:14,309
Speaker 0: It'll be the same kind of game about optimization but it seems much more complex and more interesting and will probably Take a lot longer to master.

73
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,299
Speaker 0: and you mean you're gonna get to start from scratch no matter what.

74
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,295
Speaker 0: So let's play this game because I can play this game.

75
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:31,284
Speaker 1: Ah I played the original game and it was fun But I'm actually very much more a fan of sort of shared screen direct competition games Like video ball.

76
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:36,243
Speaker 1: then I'm going to master this one particular skill Memorization games.

77
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:44,953
Speaker 1: I have never liked games like Ikaruga never even really liked memorize these shmups that much it is Technically the same kind of thing is Ikaruga.

78
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:51,832
Speaker 0: Yeah for some reason I mean, it's not that fun, but pac-man is way fun.

79
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what differences

80
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:07,497
Speaker 1: I've been is way fun until I got really good times on everything and then I could foresee I could forecast I could see the future I could look at one of my times or one of my scores and I can imagine what it would take to make that score better.

81
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:15,320
Speaker 1: and As soon as I hit that point where I was not getting a better score almost every time I played I no longer cared.

82
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,467
Speaker 0: That was pretty much the same thing that happened to me.

83
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:22,107
Speaker 0: only the score that I got before I couldn't improve it significantly was much Higher than the one you got.

84
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:32,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, so So in other news, I'm not gonna go through the details of it But Pokemon go got a couple updates and I've noticed it still haven't even installed this game.

86
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:37,080
Speaker 1: It's uh, so here's Scott Here's the way to treat it like for real like real talk to really ignore it.

87
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,794
Speaker 1: No, go play it because it is it's a fun thing.

88
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,924
Speaker 0: It takes no time Wasn't fun to play?

89
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:48,410
Speaker 1: tang that it is Pokemon snap and Play it as such.

90
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,720
Speaker 0: Why don't I just play Pokemon snap?

91
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,280
Speaker 0: Because it's better than Pokemon snap at being Pokemon snap.

92
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz Pokemon snaps actually not that I want to remade Pokemon snap.

93
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,340
Speaker 0: I want to share but Pokemon snap is amazing.

94
00:08:59,380 --> 00:08:59,984
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

95
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:00,587
Speaker 0: It's old.

96
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,472
Speaker 0: It's great.

97
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:02,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you mean?

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,924
Speaker 0: And what's the last time you played it?

99
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:11,872
Speaker 1: last time I played it was when it was a contemporary newish game Mm-hmm, and even then I only rented it for your n64 that you didn't have.

100
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,176
Speaker 1: no, uh by who?

101
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:17,903
Speaker 1: uh, I Don't remember the names any Adam Adams n64.

102
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,049
Speaker 0: The point is Pokemon snap is still an amazing game.

103
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:21,510
Speaker 0: Even today.

104
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,494
Speaker 0: You don't know what you're talking about.

105
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, play it again I dare you.

106
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,009
Speaker 0: All right.

107
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,976
Speaker 1: It's not that fun.

108
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:26,420
Speaker 0: It's great.

109
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,203
Speaker 1: This is this.

110
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:32,480
Speaker 1: Pokemon snap is better because you're taking pictures of real Pokemon in the real world on like other people's crotches and things

111
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:33,942
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

112
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:46,090
Speaker 1: but the game has had some updates and some features have been added and removed and there was a so-called cheating thing where you could go to Google Maps and see where all the Pokemon were and And Niantic cut that off.

113
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 1: so that doesn't work anymore and people were bitching.

114
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:57,331
Speaker 1: My advice to all of you out there because I play the game idly but like don't try to level up Don't try to maximize your IVs.

115
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,120
Speaker 1: that stuff's not gonna matter ever.

116
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,100
Speaker 1: But for real Don't complain to Niantic about the fact that they made the game more annoying for you.

117
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,198
Speaker 1: You don't seem to understand the fact that this is a free-to-play cell phone game.

118
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:16,820
Speaker 0: This is a garbage game and you're complaining that they took away what like something from it.

119
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,427
Speaker 1: It's like it's not that garbage Scott like.

120
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,580
Speaker 1: I don't know why you have such as like starkly dour opinion of it.

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,551
Speaker 0: You walk around you mindlessly press a button.

122
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,920
Speaker 0: you walk to a different place and mindlessly press a button.

123
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,046
Speaker 0: This is not even like.

124
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:29,293
Speaker 0: it's very actually.

125
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:30,399
Speaker 1: no, you don't just press a button.

126
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:32,722
Speaker 1: It.

127
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:43,513
Speaker 1: you see you but you see a Pokemon composite on the real world like perched on something okay, and they're in that spot like other people only see that Pokemon in that one specific spot and You have to throw a pokeball and hit him.

128
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:44,219
Speaker 1: get him.

129
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:51,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't it be better just play Angry Birds, which is more skill-based Because they're completely different thing.

130
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:56,480
Speaker 1: Angry Birds is a game you play while you're pooping and you're trying to get a high score.

131
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:58,046
Speaker 1: This game is oh shit.

132
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:00,916
Speaker 1: There's a Bulbasaur in near this park and I don't have it.

133
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,100
Speaker 1: I'll get this Bulbasaur.

134
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a Bulbasaur.

135
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,378
Speaker 1: you fill out the pokedex and then you're pretty much done.

136
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't do that.

137
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,539
Speaker 1: All right, but plus, you know the social phenomenon.

138
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:19,345
Speaker 1: it is Really interesting to me how the crowds of people who are out like catching Pokemon are only growing despite the you know Complaints about the game.

139
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:23,640
Speaker 0: I don't need to play it to see morons in a group going around catching Pokemon.

140
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:29,477
Speaker 0: I can I can get or to see Pokemon in potent super imposed on things in the real world in a funny way.

141
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:30,260
Speaker 0: I can see that on Twitter.

142
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,590
Speaker 0: There's no reason to actually install and waste time on this.

143
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,133
Speaker 1: All right.

144
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,820
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't take really any time.

145
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,924
Speaker 1: It's not like you're leveling up.

146
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:36,726
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do.

147
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:40,439
Speaker 0: It's less effort than ingress, but you know, it's less ever nothing.

148
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,860
Speaker 1: All right, but what I'm seeing out there that's still real interesting.

149
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:54,558
Speaker 1: It's like every time I walk at the lunch There are easily like 30 or 40 people like right outside of even my office and any phone I look at like any random phone that's out where someone's standing looking at it.

150
00:11:55,302 --> 00:12:04,734
Speaker 1: more than half have a Pokemon go open and on adults kids there seems to be like a Completely flat demographic of just anyone with a smartphone pretty much.

151
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:13,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see it on almost every phone I look at and it started a lot Like I'd see a lot of strangers talking to each other which did not really happen in New York City parks before.

152
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:18,359
Speaker 1: Like you did not talk to a stranger and yet I've had strangers walk up to me.

153
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:23,781
Speaker 1: Cuz I'm poking at the game and they're like, oh man There's a Clefairy like right over there, dude and it's.

154
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:35,359
Speaker 1: it's weird and interesting to me that strangers will talk to me in New York City and I let my shields down enough to look them in the eye and possibly respond with human words that are not.

155
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,179
Speaker 1: no Thanks, or I'll call the police.

156
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,795
Speaker 0: Shouldn't the response be get the fuck away from me.

157
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:40,239
Speaker 0: Who are you?

158
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,482
Speaker 1: Pokemon guy.

159
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,407
Speaker 1: Pokemon trainers are good.

160
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:42,869
Speaker 1: They're all like.

161
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 1: they're all like the NPCs in Pokemon, but I'm an evil Pokemon.

162
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 1: I'm telling you knock a kid out and steal his fucking Pokemon.

163
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,360
Speaker 0: Dude if they let you do that, like if I if my Scott they do it's called the real world.

164
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,150
Speaker 1: Just hit people and take their phone.

165
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,312
Speaker 0: if I took someone's phone and I could just Transfer all their Pokemon into my pokedex or my PC.

166
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,480
Speaker 1: They're adding trading so you will be able to do that.

167
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,692
Speaker 0: No, just giving like just take like all in one shot really quickly.

168
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I would totally do that rocket mode.

169
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,210
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd go around and just steal all people's Pokemon when they're not looking.

170
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,018
Speaker 1: if you tied it to Google Wallet and then if you beat Someone in a Pokemon duel it literally took their money and gave it to you.

171
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:20,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

172
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:21,208
Speaker 0: I would play that.

173
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,356
Speaker 1: Okay speaking of which Google Wallet?

174
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:31,608
Speaker 1: the thing that you Desperately tried to argue with me and convinced me a long time ago that it was done And website said it was no the website didn't.

175
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,340
Speaker 0: the web multiple articles saying Google Wallet will no longer let you put money in.

176
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,827
Speaker 1: Nope You said that and you were a hundred percent wrong.

177
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:51,007
Speaker 1: every one of those articles linked to one article and that one article said Google Wallet will not let you put money in for the purposes of using a Google credit card Well debit card for transactions.

178
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,174
Speaker 1: They were ending the debit card component of it.

179
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:54,439
Speaker 1: Not the rest of it.

180
00:13:55,482 --> 00:14:04,693
Speaker 1: And I point out it is now by six months since the date that you said Based on poor reading of a website that Google Wallet was gonna die.

181
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:08,299
Speaker 1: and not only is Google Wallet still working But I used it today.

182
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,386
Speaker 1: So you were wrong about that 100%.

183
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:13,374
Speaker 0: the website was wrong about?

184
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:14,180
Speaker 1: no the website.

185
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:16,049
Speaker 1: In fact, I can find the website again a link to it.

186
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,879
Speaker 1: The website was a hundred percent, right?

187
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:28,169
Speaker 1: The website said Google Said You'll find the website again because I'll find the website again.

188
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:28,791
Speaker 1: I saved it.

189
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,935
Speaker 0: All right, go ahead.

190
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:31,420
Speaker 0: All right, you were wrong.

191
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:40,266
Speaker 1: But my advice to all you Pokemon go players out there is that if you expect Niantic to respond To you or care about your complaints.

192
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:44,300
Speaker 1: This is a free-to-play cell phone game the free-to-play cell phone games.

193
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:50,060
Speaker 1: Especially if they have a candy box model and have any sort of interaction between players or levels or anything.

194
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,940
Speaker 1: They they make their money by annoying you.

195
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,760
Speaker 1: They're not gonna stop annoying you because the only way you're gonna put money into the thing is if that money avoids some annoyance.

196
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:21,179
Speaker 0: It just never ceases to amaze me that like I'm 34 and I figured out sometime Around high school in college you know how to separate you know a game from its skin and like recognize the two things as a separate thing and see through the matrix and recognize a game for what it is and How many people in the world despite how much I spread this knowledge to them?

197
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:30,548
Speaker 0: Completely failed to recognize this and like they can't see past the fact that this Pokemon on their screen and realize that there's some garbage Useless game underneath Scott.

198
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:35,024
Speaker 1: Here's the article I had saved the link quote When to support.

199
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:36,188
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the right.

200
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:36,931
Speaker 0: the same article.

201
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:38,376
Speaker 1: This is definitely it.

202
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:39,640
Speaker 1: Google is shutting down.

203
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,519
Speaker 0: That's not the same article that I saw.

204
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:49,558
Speaker 1: Well, if you claim that then the article you saw one doesn't exist and two was wrong.

205
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:56,280
Speaker 1: So that either the best-case scenario is that you're bad at vetting websites and that you fell for a scam site.

206
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,345
Speaker 1: I mean, this is CNET.

207
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:00,528
Speaker 1: There's no.

208
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,393
Speaker 1: this was like the source.

209
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,138
Speaker 1: This is still the top link.

210
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:10,251
Speaker 1: if you search for that Wrong for some reason you're resisting it somehow here.

211
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:10,632
Speaker 1: another one.

212
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:14,125
Speaker 1: Google ready to kill its physical wallet card Got a wallet card.

213
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,216
Speaker 1: Google is dropping support for it on June 30th.

214
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:21,757
Speaker 1: separate article There is no article anywhere saying that Google Wallet itself is ending on that day.

215
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,419
Speaker 1: You made it up.

216
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,640
Speaker 0: There is an article that said Google Wallet will no longer let you put money into it.

217
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,787
Speaker 1: There is no article that says that there is.

218
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:29,269
Speaker 0: I'll find them.

219
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:29,590
Speaker 1: Nope.

220
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:32,240
Speaker 1: I dare you to find it because it does not exist.

221
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,540
Speaker 1: So but Pokemon go at least is the minimum effort and it is fun enough like it covered the basics.

222
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,185
Speaker 1: There's a Pokemon in the real world.

223
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:47,200
Speaker 1: I can throw a pokeball at it and catch it and you can ignore every other part of the game.

224
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:57,429
Speaker 1: What frightens me is that there are people who are not ignoring the rest of the game and are actively trying to level up and Play it and our certain friends of ours.

225
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,400
Speaker 1: In fact are going so far as to IV train their Pokemon.

226
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:09,310
Speaker 1: I guarantee that that IV training stuff either will never matter or If they add features to the point where it does matter.

227
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:09,992
Speaker 0: Okay.

228
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:10,556
Speaker 0: So here we go.

229
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:10,877
Speaker 0: Mr.

230
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:14,108
Speaker 0: All right This is the CNET article that you brought up.

231
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,397
Speaker 0: All right, let me read it word for word.

232
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:20,869
Speaker 0: All right When does support for wallet cards and wallet cards not wallet?

233
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:25,483
Speaker 0: Hold on wallet cards will stop working on June 30th 2016.

234
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:26,130
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

235
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:34,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, and You will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account after May 1st 2016 Period.

236
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,990
Speaker 0: so the article is written poorly.

237
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,880
Speaker 0: It says you will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account.

238
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,060
Speaker 0: It doesn't say you will not be able to add money to your Google debit card.

239
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:59,787
Speaker 0: You will not be able to add money to your Google Wallet account after May 1st 2016. clearly that is not the case because you can add money to your Google Wallet account and we are now after May 1st 2016. but those are the exact words in this article from CNET the Vented place or whatever.

240
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,837
Speaker 1: All right, so you know those words were wrong.

241
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:03,700
Speaker 0: I'm not wrong.

242
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:12,999
Speaker 0: I just read those words and those words lied to me except every other website contemporary to this Says can you guys are those the words that say are that are on that page?

243
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,887
Speaker 1: I'm reading the whole thing now.

244
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,520
Speaker 0: Are those the words that are in that side?

245
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,530
Speaker 1: So you are just there's some.

246
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,420
Speaker 0: I'm dumb because I read what the word said.

247
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,840
Speaker 0: You're the one who said something different from what the words say.

248
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,716
Speaker 1: ah But I remember when we had this argument.

249
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:29,314
Speaker 1: you Refuse to acknowledge all the other evidence of all the other sites that did not say that.

250
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,200
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that's what they wrote here.

251
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,196
Speaker 0: They wrote a wrong thing.

252
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,660
Speaker 0: We can't yet tell me I'm dumb because someone wrote a wrong thing.

253
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:35,901
Speaker 0: Well,

254
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:39,382
Speaker 1: yeah, if one website says one thing and every other website says a different thing I'm

255
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:40,150
Speaker 0: just saying and

256
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,898
Speaker 1: you believe CNET

257
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,149
Speaker 0: CNET that you were just trying to say this because

258
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:49,188
Speaker 1: I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and find any website that Corroborated your made-up bullshit about Google Wallet.

259
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,736
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you will not be able to add money.

260
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:52,780
Speaker 0: That's a pretty clear statement.

261
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if that's true, then how come you'd still argued against me even then when other websites said the opposite?

262
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,320
Speaker 1: Why did you trust CNET over all these other websites?

263
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,399
Speaker 1: I didn't read any other websites even when I showed him to you on my phone and I was like hey That's what it says right there.

264
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:14,160
Speaker 1: In fact believe many of our friends were present for this argument and we're waiting for me to bring this up in the future.

265
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,300
Speaker 1: when?

266
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,090
Speaker 1: You were definitely wrong Because no one agreed with you and everyone thought you were wrong.

267
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,077
Speaker 1: and sure enough you were wrong.

268
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:21,960
Speaker 0: Yes the whole world.

269
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,303
Speaker 0: I'm just saying those are the words that are in that article that led me to believe a thing that is wrong and those words Are pretty clear.

270
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:32,100
Speaker 0: So that's what happens when you read things up further on in the article.

271
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,319
Speaker 1: It actually is pretty clear.

272
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:39,920
Speaker 1: So you focused on one sentence of one article among a sentence among many in an article among many.

273
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,831
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I'm just saying yeah, you were super wrong on this.

274
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,435
Speaker 0: Let's go find the things.

275
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,748
Speaker 0: room is wrong about no name name one thing.

276
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:59,428
Speaker 1: I'm wrong about many things such as So Scott what's funny?

277
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:04,532
Speaker 1: because you I know you don't listen to the patreon stuff But I've been listening to the beta episodes of geek nights.

278
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,400
Speaker 0: Why why do you hurt yourself that way?

279
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,220
Speaker 1: We until the the one I just remastered was the first time we did a real episode of geek nights.

280
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:18,635
Speaker 1: Before that it was just us arguing about stupid shit like that And I was kind of nostalgic for those days like we argued about the dumbest shit.

281
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:19,980
Speaker 0: you stop listening to this shit.

282
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,264
Speaker 1: It's amazing though.

283
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,408
Speaker 0: No, it's not Scott.

284
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 1: you and I both were super convinced and excited That Karl Rove was gonna get indicted for treason.

285
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,266
Speaker 0: No, I guess that could happen.

286
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:34,300
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, but we both like really believed it and you talked a lot about Janet Reno.

287
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:35,407
Speaker 1: You seem to know a lot about her.

288
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,239
Speaker 0: I guess I'd used to yeah.

289
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:43,616
Speaker 1: But anyway, uh, that's another geek nice tradition of the dumb argument that goes on forever.

290
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,198
Speaker 0: There's not a point.

291
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,713
Speaker 0: It's like what good load of caring did to help write nothing.

292
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:57,938
Speaker 1: Pokemon go is Fun despite what Scott says but do not in any way Spend money on it.

293
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:03,200
Speaker 1: Do not in any way spend time on it other than collecting Pokemon and doing the basics.

294
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:17,510
Speaker 1: Like if you're walking around catch some Pokemon Don't spend hours using lucky eggs to level yourself up to hit a specific level and Also that level cap of 30 that you're all obsessed with.

295
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,399
Speaker 1: that's gonna take, you know hundreds of hours to level up to.

296
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:22,165
Speaker 1: They're gonna raise it.

297
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:23,430
Speaker 1: They're gonna keep raising forever.

298
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,340
Speaker 1: candy box games have to raise the levels forever.

299
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,228
Speaker 0: Your life is only so long.

300
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,180
Speaker 0: how much of your life are you gonna spend making a number go up on your phone?

301
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:41,355
Speaker 0: even if you like even if you're walking from point A to point B is Your life going to be enriched more by looking at your phone Mindlessly tapping in the picture of a Pokemon or by looking around you?

302
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,580
Speaker 1: that depends on where I am.

303
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,751
Speaker 1: If it's a place I won't let play a worthwhile game.

304
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:52,667
Speaker 0: if you're gonna be doing that a game with some amount of thought Involved like what that you can play while you're walking You can play while you're walking.

305
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,540
Speaker 0: a game with thought involves some kind of some kind of like puzzle or something.

306
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,255
Speaker 1: You know, you're gonna stare at your phone staring at a puzzle while you're walking.

307
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,240
Speaker 0: Hey, why not?

308
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:01,152
Speaker 1: I guess it could be an audio puzzle.

309
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:02,179
Speaker 0: Well, that's not bad idea.

310
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:05,575
Speaker 1: I wonder if we could make that like audio puzzles share for blind people.

311
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:05,976
Speaker 0: They exist.

312
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:08,326
Speaker 0: Yeah Where what?

313
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,214
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

314
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:09,879
Speaker 1: They exist where?

315
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,905
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of search for.

316
00:22:11,925 --> 00:22:12,869
Speaker 0: I've done this before.

317
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:18,000
Speaker 0: they search like video games for blind people and there's all sorts of like audio Only games text adventures are actually really popular.

318
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:19,282
Speaker 0: Use that.

319
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:24,723
Speaker 0: use the voice the text to voice and voice to text both combined and you can you know, ah Actually, here's one.

320
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:28,500
Speaker 1: when NPR does is it's wait, they're always logic puzzles, but they tell you a logic puzzle.

321
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,386
Speaker 1: You have to figure out the answer.

322
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:29,809
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

323
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,849
Speaker 1: I don't think they give you the answer though Maybe they give it to you next week.

324
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:33,232
Speaker 1: I don't know.

325
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,039
Speaker 1: I already lost interest.

326
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:47,641
Speaker 1: Don't just do not invest significance time or resources in Pokemon go because what it is now it will never be Substantially more than what it is Now.

327
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:54,873
Speaker 1: if you're investing in it thinking that is going to be more than it is now in the future You're going to be deeply disappointed in the future.

328
00:22:54,893 --> 00:23:00,258
Speaker 1: I'm surprised people aren't disappointed already Because it's actually way better than the minimum effort had to be.

329
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,520
Speaker 1: Shockingly, yeah, okay it is it could have been way less and it was way more.

330
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,411
Speaker 0: I guess it can always be less but it's still not enough.

331
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,137
Speaker 1: Oh, what would be enough?

332
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:11,700
Speaker 1: What do you want?

333
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,266
Speaker 0: What would be enough to make me play it?

334
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:16,415
Speaker 0: Yeah had to be an actual game of skills.

335
00:23:16,997 --> 00:23:17,780
Speaker 1: What like Pokemon?

336
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,566
Speaker 0: Pokemon is more game of skills the book.

337
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:24,799
Speaker 1: So what if it was regular Pokemon except in the real world like a are MMO?

338
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:26,224
Speaker 0: Maybe?

339
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:35,800
Speaker 1: then maybe you'd play it maybe Anyway things of the day.

340
00:23:36,355 --> 00:23:39,079
Speaker 1: so Most of you probably have no idea about this.

341
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,300
Speaker 1: But if you play Mario Party, I think seven six or seven was the last one I play because Mario Party fucking sucks.

342
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:53,820
Speaker 1: I'm just sorry, but Mario Party Has something that you might not have known because you've probably never actually put the AI on easy.

343
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:57,117
Speaker 0: Well, you've never been so sad as to play Mario Party against the AI.

344
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:02,012
Speaker 1: now I first encountered this with a red supray.

345
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:04,640
Speaker 1: It's one of the things you'll ever see.

346
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,400
Speaker 1: It's Mario Party of one and it's a kid playing Mario Party.

347
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,892
Speaker 0: I think that was the prettiest thing of the day.

348
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:11,819
Speaker 1: calm calm and calm.

349
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,035
Speaker 0: But well calm one come to come through.

350
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:14,659
Speaker 0: I should do that.

351
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:26,315
Speaker 1: If you put the AI in Mario Party games on easy like you set the game to easy mode and You're the only human the AIs conspire to make you win.

352
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:50,619
Speaker 1: and this video And there's one of these for every Mario Party it's just a compilation of a ton of mini games in Mario Party 10 where Luigi wins by inputting nothing at any point into the game and It's kind of amazing to watch Especially considering a lot of the comments are people who are either saying it's fake or who are Angry at the other players for being so bad.

353
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,314
Speaker 1: Do not understand that.

354
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:54,399
Speaker 1: it's the AI.

355
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,811
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rin sent me this link and I'm like, why is it?

356
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:00,480
Speaker 0: I just watched the video and I'm like, why is this interesting?

357
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,260
Speaker 0: it's just like somebody made a bunch of clips of Luigi winning it Smash Brothers and Mario Party without pressing any buttons.

358
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 0: I assumed that some other people were controlling all the other characters and just making them be stupid.

359
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,275
Speaker 0: Yeah to create this video and I'm like, this isn't really funny or interesting.

360
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:17,957
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

361
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:18,640
Speaker 0: Why do you like this?

362
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,420
Speaker 0: And then I realized Smash Brothers is only one and they probably did the Smash Brothers one like a bunch of times.

363
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:33,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the until they got the result they wanted but the Mario Party ones is yeah It's the AI went on easy is so bad that it loses on purpose.

364
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:41,672
Speaker 0: So they were able to show I don't know why they didn't need to do so many of them to demonstrate this but it's like Yeah, well the thing is an easy loses on purpose.

365
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,300
Speaker 0: You can literally input nothing and win.

366
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:47,982
Speaker 1: This is in a court one of those ghettos on the internet, especially on YouTube There are.

367
00:25:48,022 --> 00:25:53,917
Speaker 1: there's this whole underground world of no input wins in games and there's a community of people.

368
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,724
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the lot Running community.

369
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:57,529
Speaker 1: They're not.

370
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,680
Speaker 1: they're not like super big but I found this whole game.

371
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,060
Speaker 1: There's a lot of videos about this stuff and as people try to win games by not inputting anything

372
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:20,212
Speaker 0: I've seen people make Mario Maps before Mario maker and the old like hack ROMs and stuff where they make their own maps where they design the map where you don't input anything and it starts and then Mario just goes like Through a crazy amount of stuff and eventually wins the level without pressing anything.

373
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:25,146
Speaker 1: This is a step beyond the half press a. So you got a thing of the day.

374
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,500
Speaker 0: yeah, I do have a thing of the day.

375
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:37,360
Speaker 0: So, you know under your bicycle you got gears and you got a gear in the front and a gear in the back Hopefully a bunch of gears in the back unless you're really dumb and there's a ratio between those gears.

376
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:45,499
Speaker 0: right if you got a big one in the front and a small one in the back one crank in the front might turn the back one Like five or six times.

377
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,637
Speaker 0: that's like the ratio is the number of times the other one spins and you turn the crank once.

378
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:59,048
Speaker 0: if you had a little One in the front a big one in the back You might turn the crank once and have the back one spin like not even one time And then your ratio is like less than one.

379
00:26:59,088 --> 00:26:59,952
Speaker 0: It's like point five.

380
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:01,599
Speaker 1: That's how you go weeka weeka weeka up a hill.

381
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:02,540
Speaker 0: All right, exactly.

382
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:09,786
Speaker 0: But when the ratio is low less than one or you know well the lower the ratio the easier it is to turn the handle.

383
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:15,349
Speaker 0: the crank is real easy to turn and The bigger the ratio you go a lot faster.

384
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,580
Speaker 0: less cranks will get you a lot of spins, but it's hard to turn like.

385
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:20,506
Speaker 0: You need more energy.

386
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:29,337
Speaker 1: Oh, I was gonna look up something about gear ratios And all I found is these fixie people who are obsessed with a 44 16 ratio and how it's the perfect rate.

387
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,263
Speaker 1: fixie people Whatever.

388
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,211
Speaker 0: So this guy this has nothing to do with bicycles.

389
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:48,471
Speaker 0: He just set up a bunch of gears and these gears have Particularly, they're designed in particular way such that the ratio is ridiculously Ridiculously low or high depending on which end you put the crank on.

390
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:51,100
Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like it's a bunch of planetary nonsense in here.

391
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, well no It's.

392
00:27:52,841 --> 00:27:55,049
Speaker 0: it's really the other gears that are the main ones.

393
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:05,840
Speaker 0: you just use the planetary ones to sort of multiply the effect of the other ones, you know if you watch the video, but basically He's got a whole bunch of gears all stacked up in a really interesting configuration.

394
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:18,039
Speaker 0: That's easy to understand if you watch the video such that you have you would have to turn the crank over 11 million times to get the big gear to turn one time.

395
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:19,770
Speaker 0: So such power.

396
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:27,439
Speaker 0: so it's like dude Turn the big gear one time put a lever on it and pull it and make the handle spin 11 million.

397
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,224
Speaker 0: Just do it.

398
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:30,066
Speaker 0: Just do it.

399
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:30,448
Speaker 0: Of course.

400
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:36,149
Speaker 0: It would be so hard to turn that you actually I'm pretty sure It might just explode if you do that.

401
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,004
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure I need a lever So big.

402
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:45,339
Speaker 1: if you tried to do that it would If it was a perfect system that doesn't exist in the real world.

403
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:52,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other end would go faster than the speed of light which is why this is impossible Independent of the material sciences concerns, huh?

404
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,816
Speaker 0: That's interesting, right?

405
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:54,117
Speaker 0: Yeah.

406
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:54,780
Speaker 1: I know the answer.

407
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,509
Speaker 1: I know where you're going with this behind you.

408
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,233
Speaker 0: What's the answer then?

409
00:28:57,374 --> 00:29:00,660
Speaker 1: So the answer is Materials are not actually rigid.

410
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:09,291
Speaker 1: So no matter how long a lever you think you're gonna make because you're thinking make a lever so long That you could force something else to go faster than the speed of lights, right?

411
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:09,752
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:12,119
Speaker 1: The answer is materials aren't actually rigid.

413
00:29:13,123 --> 00:29:21,974
Speaker 1: So just because the bending of the thing y'all couldn't can't actually make a rigid body Mmm, cuz remember it's just electrons like nothing's touching anything.

414
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:26,671
Speaker 0: So even though on paper it would happen You can't actually do it because there's no material you can actually make.

415
00:29:26,712 --> 00:29:27,555
Speaker 0: that would make it happen.

416
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:28,719
Speaker 0: Something else would mess you up.

417
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,885
Speaker 0: Yep, physically.

418
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,472
Speaker 1: Yep physics gets in the way.

419
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:35,472
Speaker 0: It's like we just it's like oh, haha It didn't actually happen the way you thought all this video.

420
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,180
Speaker 0: I didn't make one that wouldn't explode.

421
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:41,540
Speaker 1: I was clicking around the video and I hit the page where he shows the equation of the gear ratio.

422
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,387
Speaker 0: It's not really a complex math at all.

423
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:53,340
Speaker 0: He's just multiplying the ratios of all the gear after gear after gear, you know All together, so we should make an art installation with a robot that's slowly turning that 11 million times.

424
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:54,505
Speaker 0: Go for it.

425
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can 3d print all his gears.

426
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Go.

427
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,573
Speaker 1: Whoa, there's a. so I found another ghetto on the internet.

428
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:03,070
Speaker 1: Oh That's all his channel.

429
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:07,916
Speaker 1: I was about to say now There's all these recommended videos of crazy gears, but it's all the same guy's channel.

430
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:08,900
Speaker 0: He 3d prints gears.

431
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,484
Speaker 0: That's his deal.

432
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:12,140
Speaker 0: So you could actually add his channel to the thing of the day if you want as well.

433
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,260
Speaker 0: But the extreme ratio is the most interesting one, right?

434
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,340
Speaker 0: Yeah bigger go home.

435
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,597
Speaker 1: I really do just want to do what you're saying and put something on the inside gear.

436
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:23,260
Speaker 1: just give it a twist.

437
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:24,298
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

438
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:31,879
Speaker 0: At least you know, you know If you can't do the 11 million right at least cut it down to like 1 million and then turn it like 90 degrees.

439
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:36,195
Speaker 0: You don't need to turn all the way and you get 250 K spins in one pole.

440
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,580
Speaker 0: It's like go for it.

441
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:38,544
Speaker 0: Pretty awesome, right?

442
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:42,020
Speaker 0: I wonder what that has to be a point at which it's doable.

443
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,185
Speaker 1: Well, the gears either.

444
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:46,580
Speaker 0: even 10,000 spins in that amount of time would be really cool.

445
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,339
Speaker 1: I suspect things will either melt catch fire or shear or explode.

446
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,625
Speaker 1: Those are the four options.

447
00:30:52,665 --> 00:31:03,286
Speaker 0: melt like no, all right, you know put a knife on it and pull it right cut something Put a knife with like an apple and like You know, we've.

448
00:31:03,347 --> 00:31:05,540
Speaker 1: if we were better at this we could just video ourselves.

449
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:18,799
Speaker 1: Like we're gonna turn the other way and make a whole video and then you like walk up to it and you start to turn It and then we just composite it exploding and killing both of us Do it like a live stream prank and then just shows us sitting there dead and the live streams keeps going after that.

450
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:23,296
Speaker 1: Whatever in the moment the book club book, which we are talking about on Thursday.

451

457
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,240
Speaker 0: Ah, I feel like they were the main plot point if you could pay attention and understand what the hell was going on.

458
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:56,388
Speaker 1: Something that is very important to modern society is that I think Chicky knobs would be a good idea.

459
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:59,303
Speaker 1: Like I feel like we really should make things like that I would eat chicken them.

460

473
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,349

Speaker 1: I'm working on some diagrams to show that Pokemon go we can talk about because there's a candy box in there.

Speaker 0: Summer, why would I play games?

492
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,818
Speaker 1: But what are you doing instead of playing games?

493
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,798
Speaker 0: Not playing games.

00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:49,310
Speaker 1: anything other than laundry like it's.

497
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,783
Speaker 1: it's nice out but like it can only bike so much in a day Biking around.

498
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:55,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been biking around reading books.

499
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:57,055
Speaker 1: I've been reading books.

500
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,710
Speaker 1: I've been powering through some books Watching some internet videos watching Korean stuff.

501
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the same amount as every week.

00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:08,600
Speaker 1: I've been cooking those.

504
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:09,885
Speaker 1: I've been watching a lot of TV.

505
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,333
Speaker 1: actually cuz Steven Universe is like in full steam again.

506
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,178
Speaker 1: Bojack just came out Rick and Morty's coming real soon.

507
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,255
Speaker 1: Stranger Things looks real good.

508
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:26,699
Speaker 1: It looks like It looks like some Stephen King style horror nonsense with a modern sensibility but with some throwback sensibilities as well.

509
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:27,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't watch any of that trick.

510
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:30,435
Speaker 1: It's probably really good and critically acclaimed.

511
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:31,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

512
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,760
Speaker 1: So I thought I thought your whole definition of non-drek was like it has to be critically acclaimed in some way.

513
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,688
Speaker 0: No, I just don't like American television really.

514
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:39,973
Speaker 1: All right.

515
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:42,340
Speaker 1: So what about critically acclaimed American television?

516
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if anyone even remembers it in like five years.

517
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,080
Speaker 1: So have you watched the wire?

518
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,811
Speaker 1: Nope, cuz that's still remembered.

519
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,219
Speaker 1: It's been a long time since that came out.

520
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:54,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not playing any games at all because you don't even come to like game nights.

521
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:55,480
Speaker 1: We do over here anymore.

522
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,095
Speaker 1: No, no, you're not playing like games.

523
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't even really play all the games we played at the party.

524
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,172
Speaker 0: You only played Motai night, which is a bad game now.

525
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,640
Speaker 1: We played a few other games.

526
00:35:07,861 --> 00:35:08,704
Speaker 0: What are the games you play?

527
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,190
Speaker 1: mostly glory to Rome?

528
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,495
Speaker 0: I played that once.

529
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:11,736
Speaker 0: Yeah.

530
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:12,760
Speaker 0: It's also not a good game.

531
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,325
Speaker 0: That's a good game.

532
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:13,930
Speaker 1: It's a real good game.

533
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,080
Speaker 1: I like Motai night a lot.

534
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,974
Speaker 1: I still think I like glory to Rome more, but I feel like they're.

535
00:35:19,194 --> 00:35:20,780
Speaker 1: they serve different purposes.

536
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:24,938
Speaker 1: glory to Rome is just a romp through this heuristic space.

537
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:31,060
Speaker 1: and Motai night is you stare at each other and then you all do a thing and then you all go well shit.

538
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,733
Speaker 1: And then you stare at each other do it a few more times and someone was smarter.

539
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:36,520
Speaker 0: I don't like any of those games.

540
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:37,284
Speaker 1: All right.

541
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,060
Speaker 1: So what game what game do you want to play if you're not playing any games?

542
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,319
Speaker 1: Like what game would break you out of your not gaming funk?

543
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:46,234
Speaker 0: It starts snowing so I can't go outside.

544
00:35:46,255 --> 00:35:48,788
Speaker 1: I have to play a game So there's no game you can think of.

545
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,280
Speaker 1: that would get you to stay inside and play a game like today.

546
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:53,848
Speaker 0: It is kind of raining today.

547
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:55,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was raining yesterday's why I didn't bike to work.

548
00:35:56,602 --> 00:36:00,656
Speaker 0: I spent all night playing overwatch a game where I like wouldn't go home and eat dinner.

549
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:01,780
Speaker 0: I'd play the game instead.

550
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:05,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'd say like after we do the show We just play the game cuz I can name like.

551
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,616
Speaker 1: I could easily come up with 40 or so games.

552
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,438
Speaker 1: I would do that for right now.

553
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,278
Speaker 1: Mmm, some of those games don't exist.

554
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:19,902
Speaker 0: Nothing I'm not in a gaming mood.

555
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:20,924
Speaker 0: It's not game time.

556
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:21,444
Speaker 1: What is it?

00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:35,210
Speaker 1: Oh, you least installed it.

563
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:36,274
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

564
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:37,418
Speaker 0: That's a single-player game.

565
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:37,880
Speaker 0: What's the rush?

566
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like there was an update to it already.

567
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,818
Speaker 0: I can wait for a gaming mood and then play.

568
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:42,280
Speaker 0: it's not going.

569
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,872
Speaker 0: It's nothing, you know, it's not gonna be a different game than it is now.

570
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,060
Speaker 1: So I got the expansion to camel up.

571
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,890
Speaker 1: Now we can do 10 player camel ups.

572
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:52,760
Speaker 0: if you had 10 people I might play that once.

573
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact people are coming over tomorrow.

574
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,434

00:36:56,454 --> 00:36:58,100
Speaker 0: I don't think you have 10 people though.

576
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,838
Speaker 1: No, I don't agree to have 10 people either.

577
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,767
Speaker 1: Camel up at this point is my.

578
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,840
Speaker 1: there's more people than we have room in a real game to play.

579
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,775
Speaker 1: So we're gonna play camel up instead pretty much.

580
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:11,055
Speaker 1: That's the game I mean, it's fun, but it's not as fun as say st.

581
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,340
Speaker 1: Petersburg or Kayla's.

582
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,108
Speaker 0: Now I'll play games at PAX too, right?

583
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:16,274
Speaker 0: So why should I play games now?

584
00:37:16,294 --> 00:37:17,480
Speaker 0: I'm gonna spend four day.

585
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,440
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fly across the country to spend four days playing games.

586
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:27,040
Speaker 1: Why would I play a game now just play a game then but you're gonna get over there and we're all just gonna want to Play overwatch and we'll just go to the PC area and play an overwatch.

587
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,615
Speaker 0: Okay, you can't do that for more than like 20 minutes.

588
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,480
Speaker 0: So good luck with that.

589
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,423
Speaker 1: I could I could.

590
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:34,654
Speaker 1: I could enter the tournament cuz that was the secret I learned from that packs.

591
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:38,744
Speaker 1: where I went I entered the Counter-strike arms race tournament.

592
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:50,920
Speaker 1: because basically and this seems to be a trend at PAX is if you enter those like second tier PC gaming tournaments at PAX is The enforcers like set you up and it's sort of self-regulating like they don't really pay attention to you that much.

593
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,159
Speaker 1: So you do the qualifier and you lose or whatever?

594
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:03,719
Speaker 1: But usually no one comes over and makes you leave because those pcs are dedicated to that tournament and you can just stay in There and keep playing counter-strike for like hours and no one will say anything to you.

595
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:11,172
Speaker 0: That's how you want to spend your pecs playing a game that you could play in your house Playing it on a LAN with other people or physically next to me yelling and screaming.

596
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,520
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm slightly improved, but it's not.

597
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:16,188
Speaker 0: Experience not really worth the.

598
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:21,566
Speaker 1: I think it is more than like one or two because the LAN experience is actually rare Er than it used to be.

599
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:28,394
Speaker 1: so I don't commonly experience the LAN But on the rare occasions when I do usually cuz I'm at a con by accident.

600
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:36,350
Speaker 1: Like I play a game on a LAN suddenly like How come I can avoid coughing in the microphone.

601
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,640
Speaker 0: but you can't you think you've been coughing constantly for a while?

602
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,940
Speaker 0: But I go is go away from the microphone like chocolate rain.

603
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:48,427
Speaker 1: I still have a filter that edits the cops out at least for you because yours are yours are pretty Regular and consistent.

604
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,700
Speaker 1: I can show you the cough filter if you want.

605
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,739
Speaker 1: It's a noise filter that looks specifically for cops and reduces them.

606
00:38:56,227 --> 00:39:00,615
Speaker 1: But the LAN experience every time I do it like especially a couple weekends ago.

607
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:05,015
Speaker 1: our friends came out and Phil and Jan and we we just played overwatch while they were here.

608
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,040
Speaker 1: They stood up in the living room.

609
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:06,904
Speaker 0: Why didn't?

610
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:07,606
Speaker 0: why they even come?

611
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:08,490
Speaker 0: they could have just stayed at home.

612
00:39:09,153 --> 00:39:10,860
Speaker 1: There's something about the LAN experience.

613
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:16,160
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, there's something about the LAN experience, but I'm not gonna do it more than like two games worth at a PAX.

614
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:18,487
Speaker 1: I mean, I used to go to LAN.

615
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:21,340
Speaker 0: The LAN experience does not even come close to the PAX experience.

616
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,269
Speaker 1: The LAN experience is the PAX experience.

617
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all part of the same experience.

618
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,143
Speaker 1: No All right.

619
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:28,168
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna keep doing it.

620
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:30,620
Speaker 1: But yeah overwatch is pretty much my overarching game right now.

621
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,567
Speaker 1: Like I'm actually playing it's interesting.

622
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:36,540
Speaker 1: We've sort of flipped for some reason Scott's I guess doing laundry and watching Korean dramas.

623
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,969
Speaker 1: I'm playing more games than I've played.

624
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,034
Speaker 0: I don't watch any dramas.

625
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:41,560
Speaker 1: Ah, just the variety shows.

626
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:46,332
Speaker 1: But like I'm gaming a lot lately.

627
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,740
Speaker 0: The dramas are probably even worse than American television.

628
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:52,439
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, they have their merits but it's like oh my god, you can't watch it.

629
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,340
Speaker 1: But I honestly play overwatch like an hour or two every night and you're never getting those hours back.

630
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:03,094
Speaker 1: You know what dad you never get those tribes two hours back yet either.

631
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,660
Speaker 1: Do you regret those tribes two hours?

632
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,610
Speaker 1: Maybe what do you really regret?

633
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,440
Speaker 1: playing tribes - those are good time?

634
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,850
Speaker 0: I could have done some good stuff instead.

635
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,959
Speaker 0: if like what less stupid?

636
00:40:12,352 --> 00:40:13,684
Speaker 1: Oh, well Like what if we had died.

637
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,374
Speaker 1: if we had done like we're gonna fucking make shit.

638
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,657
Speaker 1: back then when we were in college instead of playing Games, we wouldn't have played enough games to be able to geek nice.

639
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,569
Speaker 1: now Mmm, like we wouldn't have known the things that we.

640
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:26,520
Speaker 0: so I running out of you guys ideas now cuz they're making shit and not.

641
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,180
Speaker 1: So we got to play more shit.

642
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:29,843
Speaker 1: No, why not?

643
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:38,331
Speaker 1: because then week one I don't want to because either we can make more because we've played more or We're just playing games like in the old like, you know those days.

644
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:40,460
Speaker 0: problem is I've seen through all games.

645
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,122
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

646
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:42,527
Speaker 0: there's nothing new in gaming.

647
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,991
Speaker 0: That is different than anything.

648
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:46,680
Speaker 0: I've seen before it's not you know, it's not getting me excited.

649
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:49,471
Speaker 0: Every time I look at a new game, I'm like, yeah.

650
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:49,873
Speaker 0: All right.

651
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:50,797
Speaker 0: That's just one of those.

652
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,668
Speaker 0: whatever That played that what?

653
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,300
Speaker 1: if that's true then how come you don't win new games when we play them?

654
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,099
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean that I have the skills.

655
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:01,088
Speaker 0: It just means that I'm not interested.

656
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,334
Speaker 1: but you saw through it.

657
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:03,660
Speaker 1: So clearly you didn't actually see through.

658
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,870
Speaker 1: you Don't really know what's going on.

659
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:08,020
Speaker 1: What do you mean like in a random board game?

660
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,727
Speaker 1: Look, you play.

661
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:12,357
Speaker 1: we play some new board game Like you don't really see if you understood it enough to win it.

662
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:16,758
Speaker 0: I understand it enough that it is not stimulating me in a way that is bringing me.

663
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:20,975
Speaker 1: Joy All right, so what kind of game would you would be new?

664
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,179
Speaker 1: what kind of game do you want to play?

665
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,845
Speaker 0: No games Not any game.

666
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,790
Speaker 0: I can bet a game.

667
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,796
Speaker 1: What kind of tabletop game?

668
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:30,339
Speaker 1: any game?

669
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,945
Speaker 0: You just play some teeny I guess.

670
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:33,891
Speaker 1: so just play teeny again.

671
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:33,972
Speaker 1: Mmm.

672
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:36,300
Speaker 0: What else you want to play?

673
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,281
Speaker 1: I don't know.

674
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,811
Speaker 1: I actually kind of want after doing that show the other day.

675
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,900
Speaker 1: I kind of want to play Kayla's again.

676
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I miss Kayla's.

677
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,500
Speaker 0: I think I'd actually like to play a legacy game.

678
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,184
Speaker 0: but the problem is the only legacy games are risk and pandemic.

679
00:41:50,486 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 1: if there was something else legacy like Agricola legacy Everyone we know has seems to agree that if they played risk legacy or not race legacy pandemic legacy It's not the best game, but the pandemic problem is eliminated by the fact that it is just legacy.

680
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:19,393
Speaker 1: It's more like you're playing this sort of adventure game together and then you react to stuff that happens and it's not the well Let's beat this very trivially optimized semi-random game again.

681
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,280
Speaker 0: No, I just believe them.

682
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,553
Speaker 1: We should play it and find out you don't know.

683
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:24,458
Speaker 0: you go for it.

684
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're not gonna play it.

685
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:30,424
Speaker 1: you tell me first and then maybe okay, but if I play it I'm not gonna play it again.

686
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,689
Speaker 1: There's only play the game once.

687
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:34,460
Speaker 0: Oh, you got a you know, but you got to play multiple sessions.

688
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,446
Speaker 0: That's what the legacy is about.

689
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:36,190
Speaker 0: So play the first set.

690
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play the multiple sessions with the same people.

691
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:38,324
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna.

692
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:40,260
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna split up my group once I make a group.

693
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,574
Speaker 0: Good luck getting the same people to shove every time.

694
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:44,996
Speaker 1: Ah I think I get some people to show up.

695
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:47,873
Speaker 1: actually I'm pretty sure we're gonna start up the burning wheel game again.

696
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:49,360
Speaker 0: No burning wheels a good idea.

697
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,446
Speaker 1: You wanna play burning wheel.

698
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:51,452

Speaker 1: What game do you want to play burning wheel then?

Speaker 1: What do you want like Luke crane to personally curate a custom RPG for you in your house.

712
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:16,479
Speaker 0: I wouldn't complain about that, but I'm not gonna ask for it either.

713
00:43:20,507 --> 00:43:25,872
Speaker 1: Just not rim Pretty much anyone else when I don't know if you've ever played in a game.

Speaker 1: I DM'd I Can imagine.

Speaker 1: Then we'll never speak of again.

723
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:47,835
Speaker 0: No, even though the last session was pretty good That's why I figured out how to make shit up.

724
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:49,804
Speaker 0: No No, it's.

725
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,056
Speaker 1: I know what I'm doing now makes it up but also follow the rules.

726
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:52,619
Speaker 1: That's how you do it.

727
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't making shit up before that last game.

728
00:43:54,808 --> 00:43:56,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you want to play.

729
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:58,020
Speaker 1: what kind of RPG?

730
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,813
Speaker 1: Do you want to play or who do you want to run?

731
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:00,459
Speaker 1: What kind of DM?

732
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,102
Speaker 1: Do you want?

733
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:02,569
Speaker 0: I just kind of want to play like cuz.

734
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:06,184
Speaker 0: I got so many indie RPGs that I bought and are on the Urban played.

735
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,614
Speaker 0: I don't want to play each one like one time each.

736
00:44:08,734 --> 00:44:09,277
Speaker 1: I'm up for that.

737
00:44:09,337 --> 00:44:11,327
Speaker 1: Like I got the Warren I'm pretty excited to run it.

738
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:11,769
Speaker 1: Actually.

739
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,906
Speaker 1: I could play a Warren once play the Warren So I don't want to play it once.

740
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:29,199
Speaker 1: I want to play at least one short campaign because most Kind of like I'm not interested in the one-off RPG anymore because all the like advancement mechanics and legacy mechanics Those are the things that have always made RPGs really fun.

741
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:39,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean while I do agree that the campaign that goes on has gone forever I'm talking like six sessions has you know, much more power and quality than the one-off.

742
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:41,220
Speaker 0: There is no denying that.

743
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,378
Speaker 0: It's just that I don't want to commit to anything.

744
00:44:45,122 --> 00:44:48,736
Speaker 1: So your main complaint about other people is that they won't commit to anything.

745
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:49,660
Speaker 0: That's also true.

746
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,072
Speaker 0: But I'm also people that won't commit.

747
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,639
Speaker 1: your complaint is about yourself.

748
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:55,920
Speaker 1: So do you want in the thief game or not?

749
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,440
Speaker 1: Cuz I'm gonna start it up again as soon as the weather gets a little bit south like right after packs.

750
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:02,557
Speaker 0: Well, I mean after packs, it might be in a game mood again.

751
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:02,959
Speaker 0: Who knows?

752
00:45:03,644 --> 00:45:04,088
Speaker 0: I don't know.

753
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:05,538
Speaker 1: until then you're in the mood for anything.

754
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:09,853
Speaker 0: I mean laying in the Sun like I'd say.

755
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,260
Speaker 1: you're missing the boat on overwatch.

756
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,369
Speaker 1: But overwatch is only gaining steam like it's not slowing down.

757
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:15,211
Speaker 1: It's expanding.

758
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:17,096
Speaker 0: I don't really want to play enough.

759
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:18,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

760
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,789
Speaker 0: I mean, I just don't want to play enough.

761
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,172
Speaker 0: Yes.

762
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:25,091
Speaker 1: So what what if tribes 2 was remade?

763
00:45:25,151 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 1: but it had everything good about tribes 2?

764
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,699
Speaker 1: Everything like it was perfect as far as our game design sensibilities were and it just came out again tomorrow.

765
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,549
Speaker 1: But it was like tribes to 2016.

766
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:40,534
Speaker 0: I Mean they did come out with those other tribes and then one of them I played like.

767
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:41,438
Speaker 1: those are all kind of bad.

768
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:42,678
Speaker 1: We knew they were bad.

769
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:49,900
Speaker 1: There's even a penny arcade talking about how like they'll get you through the night, but they're not a real substitute for tribes to.

770
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:52,565
Speaker 1: I Weren't.

771
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,256
Speaker 1: they were kind of bad.

772
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:56,630
Speaker 0: Maybe if I was in a given mood, I'm just nice not game time.

773
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,654
Speaker 0: All right.

774
00:45:57,815 --> 00:45:58,478
Speaker 0: I'll play pac-man.

775
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:01,068
Speaker 0: Say pac-man championship edition - that's good.

776
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:02,213
Speaker 1: That's just a single-player game.

777
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,700
Speaker 1: I guess I'll play it enough to review it.

778
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:04,523
Speaker 0: I'll play it.

779
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:05,669
Speaker 1: I'll play it to review it.

780
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:11,039
Speaker 0: if it'll run on my ancient htpc Why would I think it's gonna run in pretty much any?

781
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:13,244
Speaker 0: X86 computer?

782
00:46:13,344 --> 00:46:13,726
Speaker 1: I hope so.

783
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,940
Speaker 1: We'll find out because actually video ball a little bit of trouble on my htpc.

784
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:26,996
Speaker 1: Video ball runs way better on my main PC Which itself is not not a spring chicken compared to the htpc.

785
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:35,556
Speaker 1: Remember the htpc is also 2009 era but it was less than a third the cost of my other PC 2009 era.

786
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,693
Speaker 0: I mean mine's like i3 as a GPU.

787
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:39,600
Speaker 0: I would be nice.

788
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:44,179
Speaker 1: I can't play 2d video of all the frame rate not as good as on my main PC.

789
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:45,506
Speaker 0: I'll have to test it out.

790
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:48,400
Speaker 1: You should the game does not work a hundred percent great.

791
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,216
Speaker 0: I mean now's the time to buy computers.

792
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:57,400
Speaker 1: So Yeah, it's either buy it now because if you buy a computer like six months from now, it's not gonna cost much less.

793
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,002
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

794
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:58,424
Speaker 0: It packs.

795
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:02,320
Speaker 1: You'll have less time with the new computer, you know, we're going to a packs.

796
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,833
Speaker 0: We can go around to all those little booths with all the hardware vendors.

797
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:08,412
Speaker 1: That's what I did at the last packs We went to.

798
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:09,684
Speaker 0: well, yeah I keep that for some reason.

799
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:15,240
Speaker 0: I keep doing that at packs and then even though I've done it packs like three or four Times I've never actually bought anything in there.

800
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:17,187
Speaker 1: But this time I don't buy things.

801
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:18,913
Speaker 1: what I do is I add them to my.

802
00:47:18,934 --> 00:47:21,222
Speaker 1: I have that wish list that I'm constantly updating of the piece.

803
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:31,998
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go look at the small computer vendors like zotac and whatnot and try to see if I can get a htpc, maybe get like a 1070 in there and then I won't need another htpc for like ten years.

804
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:40,872
Speaker 1: Yep but that's why you know, I chose what case I'm gonna build my new computer in because I poked at all the cases that a And the one that had the most marketing around.

805
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:43,300
Speaker 1: it happened to also be the easiest to use case.

806
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:47,997
Speaker 0: I happen to fall for the marketing and then make an excuse as to why I didn't fall for the marketing.

807
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:48,820
Speaker 0: so I can believe that.

808
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,672
Speaker 0: Continue to believe advertising did not work on me when it totally did

809
00:47:51,973 --> 00:48:00,339
Speaker 1: now because there were others flashy booths But mostly those other pcs like those other cases were either like weird liquid cool bullshit that I don't

810
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:00,720
Speaker 0: want

811
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:02,989
Speaker 1: or they were loud or

812
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,272
Speaker 0: They

813
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,075
Speaker 1: were like really

814
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:07,019
Speaker 0: really heavy.

815
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:11,561
Speaker 0: you can't judge the loudness on your impacts as you're in this giant loud room Every computer sounds quiet.

816
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:12,830
Speaker 1: No, I went out and read some reviews.

817
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:16,787
Speaker 1: I mean what might have helped is that the one vendor we looked at like the one that like that case

818
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:17,763
Speaker 0: is in the quiet Area,

819
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:27,389
Speaker 1: yeah they were outside of the expo hall so I could stand next to it in a quiet area and see what it sounded like and It had like big stuff inside of it and it was not that loud.

820
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:30,018
Speaker 1: Hmm it also had that baffle in the front.

821
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,781
Speaker 1: most of the cases that I looked at don't have the baffling and the baffle according to reviews Definitely decreases the noise substantially.

822
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:43,070
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and That's what doesn't matter cuz you're gonna put a 1080 in there and it's gonna go.

823
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,124
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna get a 1080 yet because I want to.

824
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:49,530
Speaker 0: oh, I mean you just wait for one day.

825
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,722
Speaker 0: There's no reason to buy anything.

826
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:57,530
Speaker 1: any other GPU And I sorted basically by reviews and every day 1080 I would buy is sold out out of stock.

827
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just wait for them to come back in stock and use whatever GP you already have.

828
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,774
Speaker 1: So I did some research.

829
00:49:02,056 --> 00:49:03,783
Speaker 1: there are two quiet 1080s.

830
00:49:03,823 --> 00:49:04,064
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

831
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:07,740
Speaker 1: They're real performant just like the other ones.

832
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:19,870
Speaker 1: You know why they're quiet water cooling water cooling Yeah but the water cooling is built in to the card and it just has the Assembly with the radiators and you stick that in one of the radiator assembly spots in your case.

833
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:21,403
Speaker 1: But you have to get a modern case.

834
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:25,424
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Like this case I got here does not does not support that kind of modern shit.

835
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:37,238
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I've been doing my research the I gotta buy this PC real soon because like I said So there's a what is a pump for the liquid cooling on the GPU and you need to plug power into it from your power Supply.

836
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:37,545
Speaker 0: no

837
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:53,025
Speaker 1: So basically so it looks like it works the same way as the CPU coolers where instead of a big heat sink fan thing You put you have the nubbin that is on the heat source and there's two tubes coming out of it And those tubes go to a block that has fans and radiators in it.

838
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:54,310
Speaker 1: It's like a square.

839
00:49:54,671 --> 00:50:02,870
Speaker 1: it looks like two fans stuck to each other and Modern cases have multiple places where you put those like on the top inside or on the back inside.

840
00:50:03,352 --> 00:50:08,693
Speaker 1: So they work as a case fan, but they're pulling the air over that thing Mm-hmm.

841
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:11,484
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how anyone who isn't crazy does it.

842
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:12,026
Speaker 1: now.

843
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:33,273
Speaker 1: if you're crazy then you get a motherboard that supports that and instead of buying like All these like you don't buy like a CPU cooler that has its own fans and then a separate video card cooler to zone fans you buy a cooling rig that will connect to multiple devices with a larger loop and You have the cooling rig and the giant set of radiators but then it's

844
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:33,714
Speaker 0: a loop.

845
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:38,209
Speaker 0: wouldn't you be sending like hot liquid from the CPU to the GPU and then to the cooler?

846
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:41,581
Speaker 0: and that's A bad idea when you want each one individually going to them.

847
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:44,050
Speaker 1: Well, it's sort of like it's like heat pipes.

848
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,990
Speaker 1: They effectively act like heat pipes, so you're just pushing heat out of the system.

849
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,480
Speaker 1: There's complicated.

850
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,024
Speaker 1: I mean it's got.

851
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:56,700
Speaker 1: I'm not an expert But that's not a concern.

852
00:50:57,102 --> 00:50:58,005
Speaker 0: Don't you still need a pump?

853
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,009
Speaker 0: and doesn't the pump make noise?

854
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,890
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, quiet pumps cost so much fucking more than loud ones.

855
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:10,150
Speaker 1: Oh like it's ridiculous, but basically reading the reviews like if you buy a cheap pump either, you know what you're doing or God help you.

856
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:26,250
Speaker 1: But the crazy ones like the crazy people and I don't I'm not doing this The motherboard will have two little holes in it on the back and you plug Like you basically plug your pump system into that and it cools the motherboard itself.

857
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:31,819
Speaker 1: So like all the bridges and all the things that have like, you know Your motherboard is like heat sinks all over it

858
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:44,850
Speaker 0: and like I mean for something like this I think you're gonna like have to not build your PC and just find someone who put you got a Compatible motherboard case CPU cooler GPU cooler that all work together and put them together for you in advance.

859
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:48,119
Speaker 1: Well, I've been doing my research and instead of that It seems like the way to go.

860
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:52,290
Speaker 0: if you can take care all the other parts But it's like the GPU the motherboard the CPU and the case.

861
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,469
Speaker 0: I mean You could put that together for you and then you do everything else to roll your own.

862
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:57,735
Speaker 1: You have to have.

863
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,779
Speaker 1: you have to put in the remember.

864
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:03,940
Speaker 1: when we were kids like before we knew shit and we'd like research building a Computer like in high school my computer shopping magazine.

865
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, you you would have to do that level of research Like you've been.

866
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:19,265
Speaker 1: you basically have to spend the amount of time that I spent in high school in college learning about like specific detailed computer component integration shit to build a modern computer.

867
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:25,309
Speaker 1: roll your own with modern liquid cooling and As an adult, there's no way in fucking hell that I'm gonna do that.

868
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:33,056
Speaker 1: So the options are either do what you said or buy all the components from the same company and they pretty much just work together Mmm, so like.

869
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:36,230
Speaker 1: but if you buy a case from like the people I want to buy that case from.

870
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:39,289
Speaker 1: Only buy the cooling stuff that that company also makes.

871
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:46,815
Speaker 0: well I'm sure at pecs we could go to say the Cooler Master booth and we could be like up buy those four things that we See assembled right there before us.

872
00:52:47,036 --> 00:52:51,690
Speaker 1: people on the internet seemed to hint that Cooler Master is overpriced and not great.

873
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:55,450
Speaker 0: I'm sure it isn't but I'm just that's just an example of a brand.

874
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,199
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can go to the new egg booth the Intel booth no highs no lows Just Cooler Master.

875
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:11,570
Speaker 0: you could go to any of the booths Right of hardware vendors and they will have at least one setup computer That has demonstrating this technology that you could look at and say yeah, I'll buy those four things.

876
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:14,730
Speaker 1: But I also I poked it overwatch.

877
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:20,186
Speaker 1: I turned a bunch of settings down to get my frame rate up because I'm actually there's a little bit of a frame rate issue.

878
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:24,460
Speaker 1: just you know, My computer is pretty old and Yeah, I need a new computer.

879
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:32,310
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I really need a new computer because it is PC gaming season because the other thing I'm playing pretty much constantly is Civ 5.

880
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,474
Speaker 1: Now, I know the videos are going up.

881
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:36,264
Speaker 0: pretty sure you can play Civ 5 on any computer.

882
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:37,910
Speaker 1: Civ 5 I can play on my laptop.

883
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:44,370
Speaker 1: But I've been playing a lot of Civ 5 and you guys seem to like the videos are putting up of our games.

884
00:53:45,592 --> 00:53:56,542
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start putting those up a lot faster because we've blown through multiple further games beyond the ones that I've got up on YouTube so far and I kind of want to start one of those up again with Scott.

885
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:57,668
Speaker 1: So you want to do it?

886
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,249
Speaker 1: No, not really not even not even if we make it with two AI.

887
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:09,421
Speaker 1: So it's not just like a stupid donut duel on a bullshit math Where I put like one unit between you and the city-state and game over.

888
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:14,413
Speaker 0: I mean, that's better, but it's still not that exciting Not exciting.

889
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:14,976
Speaker 1: It's like it's.

890
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,790
Speaker 1: you take one turn of a complicated German board game every day or so.

891
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I've got four.

892
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,923
Speaker 0: I'm not even like reading webcomics lately.

893
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:26,110
Speaker 1: I've got four GM our games going now.

894
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:31,728
Speaker 1: They're all like gigantic and it takes maybe ten minutes out of my day every other day or so.

895
00:54:31,789 --> 00:54:35,070
Speaker 1: tops Cuz with eight players like people don't take the turns that fast.

896
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,116
Speaker 0: meh Nah, I'm actually like glad.

897
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:48,054
Speaker 0: I just you know quit that other game because it's like how much time would I spend on it by Now, I don't know how this is like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer's like Well, how do you?

898
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:56,550
Speaker 1: it takes me like two hours to take a shower and just saw Jerry's like, uh You're spending way too much time in the shower and he needs help because he's spending too much time in the shower.

899
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:59,290
Speaker 1: Was it that situation like how much time do you spend on your turns?

900
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,282
Speaker 0: I look at every city and then gonna move every unit.

901
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:07,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like two minutes tops And look at all that, you know every possible thing that's going on.

902
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, so three minutes.

903
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:17,059
Speaker 1: if you also like look at the crazy deep arcane bullshit and like rearrange great people production and then you know Try enough like different combinations.

904
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:19,910
Speaker 1: I just take my turn and go I don't redo my turn anymore at all.

905
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,448
Speaker 0: Mmm, you know got to see what's going on.

906
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:28,811
Speaker 1: The only time I ever redo my turn is if I sometimes you miss click and a guy moves cuz you've meant to click somewhere Else.

907
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:35,730
Speaker 1: then I redo my turn cuz I'm not going to eat the fact that I moved a cellar to the wrong spot next to a barbarian.

908
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,622
Speaker 1: I'm gonna restart my turn if I do that But I never like.

909
00:55:39,844 --> 00:55:40,228
Speaker 1: I don't like.

910
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:45,048
Speaker 1: And then oh that didn't work out and do the war again cuz no nobody's got time for that.

911
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:45,490
Speaker 1: I just play.

912
00:55:47,416 --> 00:55:49,757
Speaker 1: hmm No, you know don't want to play that.

913
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:51,082
Speaker 1: Danny to two minutes.

914
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,350
Speaker 1: two minutes every other day can't handle it.

915
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:57,060
Speaker 0: It's also you got to keep sieve like open on your computer.

916
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,190
Speaker 1: You know, it boots in like 30 seconds tops.

917
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:02,362
Speaker 1: I just hit play and then some pops up.

918
00:56:02,382 --> 00:56:03,608
Speaker 1: then I take my turn and I close it.

919
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,999
Speaker 0: Even though my computer is way faster sieve does not boot quickly.

920
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,540
Speaker 1: how Scott my sieve is on a spinning disk On say to three.

921
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,429
Speaker 1: I've got 12 gigs of RAM.

922
00:56:15,132 --> 00:56:15,473
Speaker 1: Like.

923
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:18,003
Speaker 1: in fact sieve is not only on a spinning disk.

924
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:19,830
Speaker 1: It's on my system partition.

925
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:22,379
Speaker 1: How is my computer faster than yours?

926
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:27,081
Speaker 0: and if your computer isn't faster than mine, but sieve does not boot up quickly Boots up pretty quick.

927
00:56:27,222 --> 00:56:28,269
Speaker 1: I don't leave sieve running.

928
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:33,919
Speaker 1: Like sieve boots up quicker than overwatch does Mmm, it's not boot up quickly.

929
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:34,281
Speaker 0: made them.

930
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:35,808
Speaker 0: do I have more sieve stuff than you.

931
00:56:35,868 --> 00:56:36,190
Speaker 0: I don't know.

932
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:44,330
Speaker 1: I'm playing games that have like eight player like giant nonsense late-game like bullshit going on.

933
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:48,739
Speaker 1: In fact when I'm in the game It takes a long time for the turn to load.

934
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:55,303
Speaker 1: now because the game is just so big there's so much stuff Hmm.

935
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:56,450
Speaker 0: Oh, it sits on the screen.

936
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,550
Speaker 0: That's like Civ 5 logo with all the shit in the background before the main menu comes up for a long time.

937
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:03,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, are you on an SSD?

938
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:05,977
Speaker 1: No, no, that's part of it I guess.

939
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:08,044
Speaker 1: but I mean I'm not on an SSD.

940
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,878
Speaker 0: I install all my steam games on this Spinning disk.

941
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,390
Speaker 0: It's like I colon slash steam.

942
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:19,350
Speaker 1: I installed overwatch and a couple other games on my third SSD the one that I bought a while ago cuz they were cheap.

943
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:20,377
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll move it to SSD.

944
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:20,941
Speaker 0: I don't know.

945
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:21,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might help.

946
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:26,550
Speaker 1: Will you play a two player with two AI Civ game again?

947
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,935
Speaker 1: Once it starts raining and is cold again in the winter It's gotta be.

948
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:33,090
Speaker 0: if I'm in a gaming mood, I'll probably want to play all the games.

949
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:36,301
Speaker 1: What'll it take to be in a gaming mood again?

950
00:57:36,502 --> 00:57:39,075
Speaker 0: gaming season, which is current I mean, I'm not baking anything either.

951
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,685
Speaker 0: why cuz it's caught out and I'm gonna turn my fucking oven on.

952
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:42,850
Speaker 1: cuz I got a concern.

953
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,232
Speaker 1: what if you're?

954
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:48,145
Speaker 1: you're the noble from far away who comes back to play.

955
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:51,052
Speaker 1: go at the Capitol and Everyone surpassed you.

956
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:55,358
Speaker 0: so what then?

957
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:56,580
Speaker 1: it won't be team room and Scott anymore.

958
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,115
Speaker 1: I gotta get a team over someone else to have the guaranteed joint victory or 50/50 shot.

959
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:03,500
Speaker 0: What have you ever actually teamed up with?

960
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:09,693
Speaker 1: We got to keep the illusion up that we never team up But really I want one of us to to win because fuck everybody else.

961
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,340
Speaker 0: You've never teamed up with me ever.

962
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:15,659
Speaker 1: You're the one who attacks me out of nowhere Usually like make sure you don't win.

963
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:21,500
Speaker 1: Like look the last board game that you and I actually played together of the we were playing Hanza, right?

964
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what'd you do immediately?

965
00:58:24,606 --> 00:58:29,500
Speaker 1: You use the item to just attack me all over the board and played as fast as possible.

966
00:58:30,263 --> 00:58:30,909
Speaker 1: Who won that game?

967
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:32,542
Speaker 0: I Don't remember.

968
00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:33,446
Speaker 1: You really don't remember that.

969
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:36,380
Speaker 1: I won by so much that not everyone even counted up their scores.

970
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:38,040
Speaker 0: I mean you could be sad even remember.

971
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,367
Speaker 0: We don't remember so I have no idea.

972
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:41,392
Speaker 1: other people are in that game.

973
00:58:41,412 --> 00:58:42,819
Speaker 1: They'll remember that I won by so much.

974
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:44,778

986
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,120
Speaker 1: We couldn't come up with a show topic.

987
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:19,596
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about games we were playing and he's literally not playing and he's not even playing netrunner right now.

988
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:23,407
Speaker 1: So, uh, Yeah, I'll figure out what to do next Tuesday show on.

989
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,600

01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,396
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'll just get the other Scott on the show and we'll talk about overwatch.

991
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:37,666
Speaker 1: anyway We're still coughing.

992
01:00:37,726 --> 01:00:40,580
Speaker 1: that's kind of slowing down some of the extra audio content.

993
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:46,160
Speaker 1: I actually had to edit out a lot of coughs while I was doing that other patreon update before with the remastering and the whatever.

994
01:00:46,864 --> 01:00:47,628
Speaker 1: But stay tuned.

995
01:00:47,668 --> 01:00:49,358
Speaker 1: Hopefully we'll be over this thing at some point.

996
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:52,651
Speaker 1: I will definitely see you guys I assume at PAX West.

997
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:55,059

Speaker 1: youth with its enthusiasm Which rebels against any accepted norm because it must and we sympathize It may wear flowers in its hair bells on its toes but When the common good is threatened when the function of society is endangered Such revolts must cease.

1003
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:18,280
