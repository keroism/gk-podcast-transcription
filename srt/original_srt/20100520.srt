1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,775
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Thursday, May 20th.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:20,199
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight one of the most important things in all of human civilization That has brought us from the depths of bread.

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,720
Speaker 1: Let's do this Way to go rim the manly.

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,548
Speaker 0: I see I feel weird if we just say bread.

5
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:34,170
Speaker 0: It's too short.

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,460
Speaker 0: You know the music comes in.

7
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:36,569
Speaker 1: we're gonna know that's not it.

8
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:37,800
Speaker 1: Oh, you know you're bullshitting.

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,884
Speaker 1: you told me two seconds ago It was because like you couldn't figure out how to get the opener to sound better.

10
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:45,549
Speaker 1: your technological failure.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,578
Speaker 0: now It's more.

12
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:47,870
Speaker 0: It's just a cadence fail.

13
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:52,341
Speaker 0: You know if you say the opening and it's too short in geek nights Then the music sounds weird.

14
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:57,625
Speaker 0: if you come to cut it off right away And if you let it go on too long after that it also sounds weird because you said so little.

15
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,278
Speaker 1: I'm sure there is a. This is a false dichotomy.

16
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,130
Speaker 1: There is a. there is a third solution.

17
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:03,053
Speaker 0: I think it just.

18
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:07,269
Speaker 0: it's fine, and you're just weirdly oversensitive to things that you find corny.

19
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,056
Speaker 0: We're not.

20
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:09,348
Speaker 0: we're not doing the show on stool.

21
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:11,798
Speaker 0: You laughed at that.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,444
Speaker 1: you left.

23
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:14,754
Speaker 1: That's a Poop.

24
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:20,730
Speaker 1: joke is like the opposite of corny unless of course there was corn in the poop which is a totally different situation.

25
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:39,410
Speaker 0: So all that aside I realized you know we did the show last night, and there's an there's an anecdote in my life That is it's very rare that I ever have an opportunity to use it in any capacity Because the situation the setup for it basically can't happen anymore, and it's such a specific.

26
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,758
Speaker 0: So I what are you talking about?

27
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,070
Speaker 0: so in the last show we're talking about command and conquer and like RTS's and things right.

28
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,116
Speaker 0: So when I had command and conquer this is this is a witty ball Mo from early rim.

29
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:56,382
Speaker 0: I was playing with my friend in high school And he was using the old 486 in our house And I had the Pentium Pro with a null modem between him.

30
00:01:56,944 --> 00:02:05,350
Speaker 0: now the Pentium Pro was fine But the 486 had a trouble where sometimes the mouse driver Which is freaked the fuck out and the mouse would go all over the place, and you couldn't do anything.

31
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,457
Speaker 0: So we flipped coins.

32
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,687
Speaker 0: he got the 486 and we started to play.

33
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:10,330
Speaker 0: command and conquer.

34
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,783
Speaker 1: Do you ever have a boot disk that was like mouse dot exe followed by the game?

35
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:14,325
Speaker 0: Yep?

36
00:02:14,365 --> 00:02:16,351
Speaker 0: That's how I ran doom 2.

37
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,296
Speaker 0: Okay, or sometimes I hold f5 to boot.

38
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:23,549
Speaker 0: type mouse dot exe then type high mem then type mem maker then type doom 2 dot exe.

39
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,869
Speaker 0: Sometimes I often would not load the sound card driver if I was playing multiplayer because it slowed me down too much.

40
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:40,810
Speaker 0: So we're playing and in the middle of the game You know a game of command and conquer the mouse bugs out on him And there's no way to fix it short of reboot, so he says rim what the fuck.

41
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:47,989
Speaker 0: How am I supposed to play command and conquer if the shitty ass computer's mouse just breaks, and I said well I guess your only option is to conquer.

42
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:59,682
Speaker 0: Since he couldn't command anymore I thought it was great And I had to get that out because I will rarely have times in my life where I can ever even get you like you Took the corny pills this morning.

43
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:00,469
Speaker 1: I think that's what happened.

44
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,377
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see this afternoon.

45
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,784
Speaker 0: It's it's.

46
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:08,075
Speaker 1: it's already like 6 p.m All right captain.

47
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:11,589
Speaker 0: so what do you got for me in this Thursday front half of geek night?

48
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:11,970
Speaker 1: Nothing.

49
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:12,915
Speaker 1: It's so boring.

50
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,040
Speaker 0: There's plenty of stuff on the internet.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,723
Speaker 0: You're just jaded.

52
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:15,768
Speaker 1: There's nothing.

53
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,299
Speaker 1: anyway I could tell you a weird story about the subway.

54
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,870
Speaker 0: It doesn't involve a fat and/or crazy lady.

55
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:24,164
Speaker 1: No, it was actually just one of those slightly weird situations.

56
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:31,029
Speaker 1: You know we're standing on the subway I'm playing some game on my iPhone and suddenly a couple of people are like whoa whoa.

57
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:32,157
Speaker 0: So there was.

58
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:32,823
Speaker 0: there was a hubbub.

59
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:33,609
Speaker 0: there was a hubbub.

60
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,390
Speaker 1: I turn around and like this you know I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:44,065
Speaker 1: But apparently they're paying attention to this girl Who looks like she's just hugging this dude that she was with and I think they would.

62
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:54,903
Speaker 1: those two people were talking when I got on the subway, so I was like uh But apparently like she had some seizure or something And she just like leaned on the guy and then she was better.

63
00:03:54,923 --> 00:04:00,970
Speaker 1: yeah, that's sort of thing gonna happen Yeah, but then it was all like the two people who were involved.

64
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,890
Speaker 1: You know the the dude and the girl who like had the problem were all like making nothing of it.

65
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:13,443
Speaker 1: They were like yeah, whatever and that some other people were like you should go the hospital, dude Probably and they're just like whatever.

66
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:14,229
Speaker 1: It's all good.

67
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 0: I mean if they have a problem that they have under control then they probably know exactly what they need to do.

68
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,072
Speaker 0: I'm sure this has happened to them before yeah But it's like.

69
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:28,774
Speaker 1: you know she got off the subway and was all wobbly and it was just like uh It's really not a problem Are you sure?

70
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,629
Speaker 0: well at least you know it does speak of New Yorkers and the whole people.

71
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,020
Speaker 0: Despite the common perception of New York City people basically jump.

72
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:40,677
Speaker 0: if there's any excuse for a hubbub to happen and for someone to be The good guy like a hundred people are jump on it.

73
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:48,410
Speaker 1: It's pretty yeah, I mean, it's it's like people mind their own business Unless there's a problem in which case they want to fix it.

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,105
Speaker 1: You know and the thing is quite often people are stupid like remember.

75
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,069
Speaker 1: This is very similar story.

76
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,420
Speaker 0: I think I know which one you're gonna train.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,089
Speaker 0: when the woman's like friend was having a heart attack or something She went to go pull the emergency brake.

78
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:04,588
Speaker 1: No, no the one where you had like the weird guy who wouldn't tell what was wrong with the woman.

79
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,609
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, that was even worse.

80
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, same kind of thing those were.

81
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:10,982
Speaker 0: you know where the dude was?

82
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:13,152
Speaker 0: just you know with a girl who was kind of moaning in Pain.

83
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,305
Speaker 0: and then when someone asked him like hey, is she all right?

84
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:16,010
Speaker 0: Do you need any help?

85
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:16,935
Speaker 0: He was like man.

86
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:17,579
Speaker 0: mind your business.

87
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:18,565
Speaker 0: Just leave us alone.

88
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:27,650
Speaker 0: mind your business Yeah, which immediately aroused the suspicion of everyone in the world And the guy just got more and more loud and angry the more people tried to help out.

89
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,835
Speaker 1: This guy wasn't loud and angry.

90
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,410
Speaker 1: They were just sort of quiet and like whatever, but it was still weird.

91
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:38,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know it brings me back to when we were in colony, and that's the biggest thing I miss about college.

92
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,385
Speaker 0: isn't so much the clubs the hanging out or the infinite free time.

93
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:52,407
Speaker 0: no responsibility I miss all those things But I miss living in a world where just random crazy bullshit will happen to you like you know coming home one day And there's just a couch out of fire in front of the door.

94
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,312
Speaker 1: That was.

95
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:58,894
Speaker 1: that was at night while we were sitting in our you know Apartment.

96
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:04,089
Speaker 0: I remember the next morning when I go out And there's the skeletons of a couch out there because they hadn't gotten rid of it.

97
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:05,498
Speaker 1: yet What did you think would be out there?

98
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:06,384
Speaker 0: I don't know.

99
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:08,353
Speaker 0: maybe they'd moved it Maybe two couches.

100
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:18,070
Speaker 0: what would have been funny if there was another couch unburned and the burn couch was gone Like a practical joke or maybe a Phoenix Phoenix couch.

101
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,999
Speaker 1: So I think you know you know couch.

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:36,989
Speaker 0: I Think it is worth noting at least that today was in fact the much controversial Draw Muhammad day or everybody draw Muhammad day Which seems to have drawn a Facebook group for it and an equally large Facebook group against it.

103
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,661
Speaker 0: People in Pakistan lost their shit and Pakistan like banned face.

104
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:43,670
Speaker 1: none of the other Muslim countries lost their shit I don't know.

105
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,079
Speaker 0: I think.

106
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,557
Speaker 0: one Pakistan is more Actually has internet.

107
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:55,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah that I think that's one big part of it and to Pakistan is probably not as good at covering up dissent as say Saudi Arabia or Iran.

108
00:06:56,652 --> 00:07:02,835
Speaker 1: Mmm, and three Pakistan was video of this lady driving a car in Saudi Arabia Which she's not allowed to do.

109
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,990
Speaker 1: yeah, because she's you know has boobs and vagina.

110
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is against law.

111
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,470
Speaker 0: I also have boobs, but not having a vagina is key.

112
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,006
Speaker 1: It's against the law there, but she did it anyway, and there's a video.

113
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:14,409
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

114
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,684
Speaker 0: She just driving around like like you do at least like you should be able to do.

115
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:24,060
Speaker 0: yeah, but also Pakistan I think a couple years ago banned YouTube for a while.

116
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, didn't they break YouTube because someone fucked up the something something.

117
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was all sorts of weirdness with Pakistan, but now this time they went crazy.

118
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,036
Speaker 0: like they banned Twitter They banned blackberry.

119
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:50,909
Speaker 0: apparently they were blocking blackberry messages into the country and all sorts of craziness at least until the end of the month to Prevent anyone from getting more angry about the fact that people in America and much of the rest of the world where people are free Are drawing pictures of Muhammad like hugging kittens and eating ice cream?

120
00:07:52,972 --> 00:08:08,265
Speaker 0: It's pretty epic though, I wish I would have had time But now that I have a real job where I can't just like BS around at work I wanted to make a Muhammad on the go much in the vein of Lord of the Rings on the go or Prince of Nothing On the go, but I didn't have time to make the seed picture.

121
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:11,744
Speaker 0: so all of you out there Make Muhammad on the go.

122
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:12,690
Speaker 0: you would make me so happy.

123
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,650
Speaker 1: I think what disappoints me the most is that everyone draws Muhammad in sort of a stereotypical way.

124
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:18,699
Speaker 1: It's always like a bearded.

125
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,678
Speaker 1: You know you know Skin dark skinned guy with the turban.

126
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,130
Speaker 0: I drew a dot and a cat all right that I called Muhammad.

127
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:33,749
Speaker 1: So I mean people I want to see like like wasp businessman, and then it says Muhammad.

128
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:40,289
Speaker 1: underneath I want to see like you know a little girl in a frilly tutu, and it says Muhammad.

129
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,855
Speaker 1: That's what I want to see right.

130
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:45,648
Speaker 1: I mean why everyone's just sort of you know at the one hand.

131
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,801
Speaker 1: It's like aha We're getting their religion blah blah blah.

132
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:55,443
Speaker 1: We you know we got them, but on the other hand We're just propagating this you know stereotype Which is sort of not.

133
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,450
Speaker 0: well it depends.

134
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,668
Speaker 0: I mean in the very least historically we have a good idea of the vagueness of what Muhammad would have looked like.

135
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:07,090
Speaker 1: yeah Cuz you know Jesus looks a lot like the pictures of Jesus people draw are a lot like what Jesus looked like.

136
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:14,020
Speaker 0: Well the thing is there are there have been pictures of Jesus continuously And they're all influenced heavily by Byzantine art and all that stuff.

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,029
Speaker 0: so we lease we know the artistic progression of like kind of.

138
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:20,069
Speaker 0: why That fictional characters portrayed that way.

139
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:25,090
Speaker 0: But with Muhammad like some I mean the problem is some people are just drawing like turban guy.

140
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I wonder like what if I draw Muhammad?

141
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,534
Speaker 1: right, but it's not the Muhammad It's just this guy.

142
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,640
Speaker 1: I know his name is Muhammad.

143
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,068
Speaker 1: He works at the bodega.

144
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,056
Speaker 0: well What is another prejudice stereotype?

145
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:42,929
Speaker 0: what I should do is take a picture of Muhammad Ali and say I assert that Muhammad Ali is in fact the reincarnation of the Prophet Muhammad who looks identical to him.

146
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:47,150
Speaker 1: I could just draw Muhammad Ali and then be like aha lol yeah.

147
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,195
Speaker 1: Or what if I draw right?

148
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:56,924
Speaker 1: like you know the the the wasp businessman a little girl in a tutu right with boxing gloves and I say Muhammad parentheses Ali.

149
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,718
Speaker 0: It's interesting how this you know.

150
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:04,494
Speaker 0: the mainstream media talking about this They didn't have a lot to say.

151
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:08,628
Speaker 0: they mostly focused on the fact that Pakistan lost their shit and the controversy surrounding it.

152
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:16,250
Speaker 0: this Holiday really only existed on the internet where it's a big deal, and I have a feeling it's going to happen every year henceforth.

153
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, just right next to talk like a pirate day.

154
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:22,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should have talked like Muhammad day.

155
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:24,754
Speaker 0: What would you say?

156
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,242
Speaker 0: how about dress like Muhammad day?

157
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,113
Speaker 1: I Would be.

158
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:31,897
Speaker 1: I would just wear my normal clothes and be like hey How do we know mom?

159
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,950
Speaker 1: it didn't have awesome geeky t-shirt?

160
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,164
Speaker 0: What is interesting is that it's kind of dressing like my friend Muhammad.

161
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,630
Speaker 1: He works at the company on the next floor.

162
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:39,559
Speaker 1: He's also a programmer.

163
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,690
Speaker 0: this can almost be used.

164
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:48,170
Speaker 0: It's gonna cut a lot of cool people off the internet But it's sort of a litmus test of whether or not you can actually engage in a free society.

165
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:59,368
Speaker 0: Because look if the nations where people are so angry about it block all the means of free exchange where these pictures might appear They're basically cutting themselves off from what is the internet?

166
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,444
Speaker 0: And I wonder what the consequences of that are going to be 10 or 15 years down the road.

167
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:04,765
Speaker 0: if so

168
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:11,648
Speaker 1: if we if the free Countries just continually to freely express themselves, and they keep doing it a whole bunch and not

169
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:12,150
Speaker 0: just this but

170
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:26,630
Speaker 1: The non free countries will will just keep having being forced to basically you know they won't be able to filter They'll be forced to completely cut themselves off And we'll like split the world into the free world and non free world and the divide will grow.

171
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,390
Speaker 0: I mean, I think that's the way to go with China especially I mean Google took the first step.

172
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,490
Speaker 0: But imagine if bit by bit no no outside entity in the world would kowtow to China's censorship demands.

173
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,081
Speaker 1: They wouldn't have an internet.

174
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,430
Speaker 1: They would have intranet of China.

175
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:49,264
Speaker 0: Yep, now the thing is China scarily is at least technically competent enough to have a reasonably workable national firewall Which is kind of sad, but that's cuz Cisco did it for them.

176
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:53,748
Speaker 1: It wasn't China being smart It was paid someone you know a zillion dollars to do it.

177
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:55,770
Speaker 0: So I don't know it.

178
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:57,290
Speaker 0: I just it was worth mentioning.

179
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:10,179
Speaker 0: I don't want to turn the whole show into a Muhammad show though I will note right now that if you're watching the you stream that is not in fact rim and Scott But it is the exact representation of Muhammad sitting next to Muhammad Talking into microphones.

180
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:11,770
Speaker 0: Oh, and I'm drinking alcohol.

181
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,115
Speaker 1: I think we need you know.

182
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:17,855
Speaker 1: I mean the you stream is awesome and everything and it's it's helping us out and more people are Watching it, but I want to.

183
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,302
Speaker 1: I don't want to interact with it.

184
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,412
Speaker 0: cuz then it's like we're never You know.

185
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,555
Speaker 1: because it's like.

186
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:28,008
Speaker 1: then the people who most people isn't the podcast just that doesn't.

187
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:28,750
Speaker 1: it's not good for them.

188
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:29,910
Speaker 1: It's the same way.

189
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,238
Speaker 1: I don't like to do stuff that Acknowledges the community or the forum or anything.

190
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,225
Speaker 1: cuz then people most people aren't in that.

191
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,170
Speaker 1: so if they listen to the show and we Do that all the time it really makes them outsiders.

192
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:46,623
Speaker 1: I guess some of them will you know take that as a clue and join in but most of them will just be like turned Away, well one way to handle that.

193
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:47,570
Speaker 0: I guess you know it's Thursday.

194
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:51,010
Speaker 0: We talk about whatever we want instead of you know sequestering it all in the meta moment.

195
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,796
Speaker 0: I feel like the best way to handle that.

196
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:58,310
Speaker 0: if you have the you know the resources to make all the media you want to Make is to have your real thing.

197
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:05,890
Speaker 0: You know like geek nights the show and then independently you have like one other show that is the community show that's focused at those people.

198
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:11,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean this is what stack like if we did the couch Which is the video of us hanging out on the couch?

199
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,710
Speaker 1: This is what Stack Overflow learned right is they made Stack Overflow and the thing was is a lot of people would make post questions on Stack Overflow about Stack Overflow.

200
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:24,076
Speaker 1: They'd be like should Stack Overflow Changed this to work this way.

201
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,990
Speaker 1: right and the thing is people who come to Stack Overflow itself.

202
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,321
Speaker 1: They're not supposed to be talking about Stack Overflow.

203
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,270
Speaker 1: They're coming to get help with their technical problem.

204
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:39,906
Speaker 1: So eventually they made meta that Stack Overflow Which is a Stack Overflow for Stack Overflow and nothing else right to talk about.

205
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:40,969
Speaker 1: it's that right and?

206
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,748
Speaker 1: Keeping the meta separate from the actual thing is incredibly important because the meta 99% people don't care about that.

207
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:53,710
Speaker 1: yeah I mean like all our listeners who are in the put it in the face of the people who don't care about it at all.

208
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,710
Speaker 1: Right then it really makes your thing shittier.

209
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:05,155
Speaker 0: There has to be a big separation between the meta and the thing which is also kind of a shout-out now to all of you Listeners who aren't in our.

210
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,845
Speaker 0: you know the geek nights community in the forum and all that BS.

211
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:14,109
Speaker 0: because you know our Hardcore listeners the ones that hang out in our forums always ask us things like why didn't you do a show on X?

212
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,949
Speaker 0: You know we all want a show on X And they'll all talk about like do this do this do this do that.

213
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:26,965
Speaker 0: But the emails we get from all you guys and the interaction with them like the majority of the listeners is Very different from them and you guys want very different things.

214
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:27,790
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell.

215
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:46,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you see the same pattern over and over again like uh you know people on the internet They complain about X. You know, but 99% of the people don't say anything and you know what they want the opposite of X. or You know everyone says oh Nintendo do this, but what sells you like we fit which nobody wanted right?

216
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,670
Speaker 0: We fits not a bad game the thing is what bothers me about it.

217
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,450
Speaker 0: The only thing that bothers me about it is that DDR is a much better exercise platform.

218
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,820
Speaker 1: It's not about real exercise about pretend to exercise.

219
00:14:58,121 --> 00:14:59,966
Speaker 1: you wouldn't be able to sell real exercise.

220
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:00,709
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be fun.

221
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,008
Speaker 1: It would hurt the fat people.

222
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,856
Speaker 1: Plus you know DDR is not accessible.

223
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:06,639
Speaker 1: It's very difficult.

224
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, it always amazing.

225
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:09,167
Speaker 1: anyone can do.

226
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:11,436
Speaker 0: step on the things I always kind of forget.

227
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:26,379
Speaker 0: You know we've been playing DDR for like a decade and yet You know like Emily's playing DDR again now that we've got to set up in the apartment and everything and you know watching her learn and progress like through like a one foot to a two foot to a three foot to a four foot and Reminded me of how much of my life.

228
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,967
Speaker 0: I kind of invested in DDR.

229
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,521
Speaker 1: It's it's how much you fell under the spell of DDR.

230
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,550
Speaker 1: you allowed the computer to infect your brain.

231
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:41,370
Speaker 0: Well regardless your body in one way or another I spent a scary amount of time mastering that skill.

232
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:44,926
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, yeah.

233
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:47,957
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about.

234
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:52,799
Speaker 1: so I get there's so much tech stuff going on especially with the Google I/o that I got to offload some of it to today.

235
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,366
Speaker 0: Oh, no it is Thursday.

236
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:54,607
Speaker 0: Well.

237
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,735
Speaker 0: You know affectionately I like to call Thursday the lounge.

238
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,541
Speaker 0: whatever like that whatever.

239
00:15:58,561 --> 00:15:59,625
Speaker 0: that thinks everything's corny.

240
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,649
Speaker 1: You're being real corny.

241
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,610
Speaker 1: right now I can tell you that you're being like ultra corny.

242
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:04,595
Speaker 1: So there's this problem.

243
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:12,070
Speaker 1: that was basically the problem of Google accounts that has existed for a long time And it goes something like this right you have a Google account.

244
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,693
Speaker 1: It's your you know.

245
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:16,190
Speaker 1: use it for Gmail use it for reader use it for wave use it for everything.

246
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,481
Speaker 1: That's Google all right, and then you have Google apps.

247
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:25,870
Speaker 1: because you don't want your email address to be at gmail.com You want it to be at your own domain.com, so you get Google app which is still already.

248
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,833
Speaker 0: That's the minority of.

249
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:30,184
Speaker 1: yeah, Google apps is meant for schools or offices.

250
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:34,564
Speaker 1: right can get their own private Google So they can use all the Google stuff, but it's their own right.

251
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:35,770
Speaker 1: so we have one of those.

252
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,703
Speaker 1: It's totally sweet, and you get.

253
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:38,146
Speaker 1: you know.

254
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:43,750
Speaker 1: you get You know mail and Doc's and calendar and all you know all the good stuff is in there.

255
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,619
Speaker 0: I mean like all the front row crew.

256
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,708
Speaker 0: people have front row crew email address.

257
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:56,558
Speaker 1: the problem Is is right like I'll go and I'll try to use like some Android phone or something and it'll be like yeah You want to use Google latitude.

258
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:59,270
Speaker 1: give us your Google account, and I can't use my apps account.

259
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:00,778
Speaker 1: I got to use the regular one.

260
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:02,085
Speaker 0: a couple of things were smart now.

261
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,010
Speaker 1: I got two accounts.

262
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,027
Speaker 1: It's like ah fuck me.

263
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, a couple of things were smart and if I put in the full address with the at they would figure it out.

264
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,675
Speaker 0: But most things would not.

265
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:13,050
Speaker 0: especially Google made things yeah like Google reader.

266
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:14,935
Speaker 1: You can't use my app.

267
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:15,116
Speaker 1: good.

268
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,701
Speaker 1: There's no reader in apps right.

269
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:23,396
Speaker 1: all we want is to be able to use our Google apps Account with all the Google stuff And I won't need a regular Google.

270
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,203
Speaker 0: is I got to get rid of my old gmail account?

271
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:28,057
Speaker 1: even stuff like feed burner or Google Analytics or ad.

272
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,050
Speaker 1: where to be YouTube yeah?

273
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,474
Speaker 1: I gotta have like these separate account.

274
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:36,572
Speaker 0: our YouTube is associated with some bullshit account that I made a long time ago to set up YouTube.

275
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:40,068
Speaker 1: yeah, so I think they've made some progress in fixing it.

276
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,160
Speaker 1: for example They just added wave rights now.

277
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,703
Speaker 1: We have you know we got front-row crew wave But from what I can tell front-row crew wave is just wave and I can totally it.

278
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,092
Speaker 1: totally you know mixes in with the actual Wave.

279
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,550
Speaker 1: just fine, so I never need to use the other account on wave.

280
00:17:54,671 --> 00:18:03,719
Speaker 1: I can use my front-row crew account on wave and it's all good, and I logged into something else I think it might have been calendar or Docs And it said which account do you want to use?

281
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,470
Speaker 1: and it said this one or the front-row crew one?

282
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,516
Speaker 1: And I was like oh my God I've never seen this before.

283
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:15,326
Speaker 1: so I think there they might be Spreading that out across the board, and I hope that I can one day like try to use.

284
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:20,947
Speaker 1: you know Google I don't know feed burner And it'll say which account you're actually what I really want to use.

285
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,570
Speaker 0: I want to wait.

286
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,977
Speaker 0: I want to talk about this a lot on Monday.

287
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:31,027
Speaker 0: Is that Google predictive engine Google voice Google latitude Google Google predictive that I really want access to that, but they're not going to give it to me.

288
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:31,790
Speaker 0: I'm a terrible coder.

289
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:33,661
Speaker 1: Well, you can just get it right.

290
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:34,566
Speaker 0: I mean no there.

291
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,250
Speaker 0: It's right now.

292
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,241
Speaker 0: It's super invite only and it's kind of like you know.

293
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,569
Speaker 0: propose like what do you want to do with it?

294
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,869
Speaker 1: And I don't know what are you gonna do with it?

295
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,334
Speaker 0: I got some ideas.

296
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:48,397
Speaker 0: basically I want to put in stock market data and see what it predicts in a black box Whatever that.

297
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,650
Speaker 0: and I want to put in listener.

298
00:18:49,771 --> 00:19:02,350
Speaker 0: I want to put in basically listener numbers from geek nights right because I can Export that from the feed burner and the libsyn and everything and I want to compare it to The titles of the episodes and the text of the thing and see if there any weird correlations.

299
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:03,213
Speaker 1: Mmm.

300
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,099
Speaker 1: That's not a bad idea.

301
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,321
Speaker 1: Yes.

302
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:05,630
Speaker 0: I want to just do cool stuff like that.

303
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,614
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just an API.

304
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:10,006
Speaker 0: I can write little Python apps to like interact with it, but we'll see.

305
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:10,648
Speaker 0: maybe I'll get in.

306
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:20,368
Speaker 0: So to get back on track.

307
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,940
Speaker 0: I think we're derailing a little bit things of the day.

308
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,227
Speaker 0: I tried to say that as corny as possible.

309
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,155
Speaker 1: Are you trying to be corny gray?

310
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:28,857
Speaker 0: Yeah now I am.

311
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:37,260
Speaker 1: You know like I have to in response to your anti corn You want to read some some like Marvel two-in-one?

312
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:39,907
Speaker 1: 80s and 70s and whatever.

313
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,700
Speaker 0: so you got a thing of the day for me because I got something pretty amazing here.

314
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just want to you know, I couldn't really find an awesome thing a day.

315
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,602
Speaker 1: But I just want to you know remind people that in the California far away from here All right.

316
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:57,613
Speaker 1: this weekend May 22 and 23 is the Maker Faire Which is you know, always the awesome.

317
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:02,949
Speaker 1: if you want to see Shit people made in you know, the Arduino.

318
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:04,112
Speaker 1: is it full of corn?

319
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:08,285
Speaker 1: make magazine boing boing kind of style Of making stuff.

320
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,020
Speaker 1: then you want to go to the Maker Faire.

321
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:17,900
Speaker 1: It's in San Mateo County event center from 10 to 8 on Saturday and 10 to 6 on Sunday.

322
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:21,820
Speaker 0: It is funny how that kind of really does define a genre of making.

323
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:25,340
Speaker 1: This is like the one kind of thing that we don't have here, right?

324
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,480
Speaker 1: It's like we've got comic cons, you know, even though San Diego's out west we got New York.

325
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,584
Speaker 1: We got some other ones, right?

326
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:31,608

Speaker 1: we got gaming.

329
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:39,111
Speaker 1: now that we got PAX East and such We don't have like a Maker Faire in the east or things like burning.

330
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:39,633
Speaker 1: Oh, no way.

331
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:45,083
Speaker 1: It says world Maker Faire, New York City 2010.

332
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,112
Speaker 1: Wait, I gotta go look at this.

333
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:52,853
Speaker 1: Whoa, wait, okay September 25 and 26 at New York Hall of Science.

334
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:53,436
Speaker 1: Oh crap.

335
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,360
Speaker 1: I guess we're going to that.

336
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a double thing of the day.

337
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,177
Speaker 0: Not bad.

338
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:00,192
Speaker 1: When is The New York comic-con.

339
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,760
Speaker 0: I think it's October.

340
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,481
Speaker 1: It's October, okay, it's soon after the world Maker Faire, but okay, we're going to the world Maker Faire, New York City 2010.

341
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:20,530
Speaker 0: so In Philadelphia an event happened that will basically settle anytime you ever argue like, you know I'm from Detroit and the cops are real hardcore there now.

342
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,252
Speaker 0: I'm from LA.

343
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,200
Speaker 0: the cops like we'll just beat you up for nothing there.

344
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:24,638
Speaker 1: Well, no, what do you mean?

345
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,161
Speaker 1: We're not.

346
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,210
Speaker 1: we don't care how how tough the cops are.

347
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:32,347
Speaker 1: we care how disgusting the people are and we know that in Things Philadelphia has the most disgusting thing.

348
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,654
Speaker 0: Uh, I would take issue with that.

349
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,439
Speaker 1: Who do you think is more disgusting Oakland?

350
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,526
Speaker 1: What's wrong with Oakland?

351
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:42,073
Speaker 0: the Raiders mostly.

352
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,017
Speaker 1: so that's it.

353
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:50,244
Speaker 0: so anyway Philadelphia actually wins this fight because there was a situation and this is my thing of the day Just the whole.

354
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,653
Speaker 0: you can read the entire story.

355
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:52,538
Speaker 0: I will summarize it.

356
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:57,213
Speaker 0: There's a group of people who are members of an organization that they called move.

357
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:05,923
Speaker 0: in the end of the 70s a bunch of them were arrested after a shootout that ended with a police officer dying and nine of them went to jail.

358
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:12,779
Speaker 0: and the ones who didn't go to jail moved to Philadelphia moved to her neighborhood bought a house and Preceded to be jackasses.

359
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,650
Speaker 0: They fortified it.

360
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:16,420
Speaker 0: they stocked up supplies.

361
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:21,593
Speaker 0: They had loudspeakers that 24/7 played weird like anarchist propaganda.

362
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:36,779
Speaker 0: They built like steel bunkers on the roof and Basically the stench from this place coupled with the severe health hazard and the rats and everything what was coming to a head Mmm, so Philadelphia police went to deal with that.

363
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,552
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fast-forward through the part that you can read on Wikipedia.

364
00:22:40,953 --> 00:22:42,940
Speaker 0: They bombed the entire city block.

365
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,787
Speaker 0: Everything burned down.

366
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:48,360
Speaker 1: they fucking way with an airplane that had a bomb that falling out of it.

367
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,933
Speaker 1: So they basically they just walked in.

368
00:22:50,953 --> 00:23:01,765
Speaker 0: they put a bomb on the ground and wine trouble Evacuated the entire city block the night before saying yeah take a change of clothes We're gonna get rid of those jerks and then you can come back in the morning you know the next day.

369
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:15,767
Speaker 0: and then there was a shootout and During this a police helicopter or something like that with a guy who had made a bomb officially out of c4 a large amount of c4 a Surprising amount of c4.

370
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,737
Speaker 1: they don't take that much at c4.

371
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,860
Speaker 0: They dropped it on top of the building to blow up the bunkers so they could then finish the gunfight.

372
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,100
Speaker 0: The bomb blew up much of the building and set the rest of it on fire.

373
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:29,909
Speaker 0: The fire spread to the entire city block.

374
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,214
Speaker 1: So the bomb wasn't.

375
00:23:31,414 --> 00:23:32,197
Speaker 1: they didn't make a bomb.

376
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:32,980
Speaker 1: That was too big.

377
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,446
Speaker 0: So the bomb was too big.

378
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,672
Speaker 1: the fire was too big.

379
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:39,595
Speaker 1: The bomb was also too big But the explosion isn't what got the rest of the block.

380
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:42,551
Speaker 0: It was the fire no, but yeah, yes, but the explosion spread.

381
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:51,736
Speaker 0: the fire caused the fire and Despite all the fire department hanging out right there So the fire department tried to fight the fire and the people inside kept shooting at them.

382
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,509
Speaker 0: Oh so I.

383
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:58,393
Speaker 1: Why didn't they use poison gas right with poison?

384
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, they already fired tear gas at the building.

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,981
Speaker 0: That's not.

386
00:24:01,021 --> 00:24:03,870
Speaker 1: I mean poison gas like you're right.

387
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:04,392
Speaker 1: Yeah.

388
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,495
Speaker 1: I mean you're shooting at them.

389
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:06,839
Speaker 0: You're already children in there.

390
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,065
Speaker 1: You're already shooting at them.

391
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,153
Speaker 1: You're already trying to murder the women and children.

392
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:12,900
Speaker 1: I murdered them too, right?

393
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:17,920
Speaker 1: Least with the poison gas you would do the same amount of murdering but you wouldn't burn down the whole block.

394
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:28,896
Speaker 0: Basically what it came down to is this was the most over-handed Inept police respect, you know people talk about like Waco and what was good what was bad and you know the catastrophe there or a Ruby Ridge.

395
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,247
Speaker 0: This one takes the keg.

396
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:41,791
Speaker 0: This is just police and civil servants Dealing with the situation in perhaps the worst Possible way and it ended up in just disaster.

397
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:44,984
Speaker 1: and it I mean they could have like thrown like if they just wanted to set It on fire.

398
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,019
Speaker 1: They could have just thrown like one molotov over there.

399
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:49,848
Speaker 0: They could have just waited.

400
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:51,794
Speaker 0: They didn't have that much food in there.

401
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:53,860
Speaker 1: I thought you said that they stocked up.

402
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not enough they could have.

403
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:56,190
Speaker 0: they could have.

404
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,279
Speaker 0: it would have been cheaper to just surround the place.

405
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:58,902
Speaker 1: Keep it.

406
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:01,416
Speaker 1: Well, I assume they cut off the water and the electricity, right?

407
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:01,919
Speaker 0: I don't know.

408
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,013
Speaker 1: I mean you cut off the water and it's only a matter of time.

409
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:10,209
Speaker 0: cut off water cut off electricity Tear gas constantly and terrible music.

410
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:13,160
Speaker 1: Oh, and if they have a well though, you had to like poison it or something.

411
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:17,640
Speaker 0: I'm sure they could have dealt with the well or special forces or something.

412
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,414
Speaker 0: This is amazing and you should read the entire story of this.

413
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,317
Speaker 0: and it gets worse.

414
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:32,054
Speaker 0: the city Rebuilt the whole block for all the people who got kicked out With some of the most shoddily put together houses the world has ever seen to this day.

415
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,240
Speaker 0: That neighborhood is a festering disaster.

416
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:37,059
Speaker 1: We should go to that neighborhood just to be lol.

417
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:47,456
Speaker 0: The story that the multi decade-long story of this debacle is an amazing thing to read about Mmm, so that is my thing of the day.

418
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:54,825
Speaker 0: So the meta moment.

419
00:25:55,025 --> 00:26:00,600
Speaker 0: next Thursday's show which is two Thursdays from now, we will be doing the geek nights book club cosmos.

420
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,620
Speaker 1: Oh shit, Carl Sagan's cosmo had a lot of time to read this people a lot of time.

421
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:14,860
Speaker 1: If you care at all about science about humanity about astronomy If you're a human being and you're listening to this show and you didn't read the book you suck.

422
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:17,156
Speaker 0: It's one of the more important books ever.

423
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:17,478
Speaker 0: read it.

424
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:19,466
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say that.

425
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:25,606
Speaker 0: I would say that because it got an entire generation of American scientists a world Scientists into science.

426
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,655
Speaker 0: it spawned a generation that I don't think we have an equivalent.

427
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:35,891
Speaker 1: No, it's no Shakespeare It's no Out there in importance, I mean, you know, it's.

428
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:38,037
Speaker 1: it's not any more important than earlier.

429
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,445
Speaker 0: best-selling book Well, but best selling.

430
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,188
Speaker 0: in what regard?

431
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:42,613
Speaker 0: I mean New York Times bestseller.

432
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,657
Speaker 1: I don't know.

433
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:44,460
Speaker 1: It's a best seller.

434
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,789

00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,880
Speaker 1: and the zombie shows are never gonna happen.

458
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,342
Speaker 1: It's never.

459
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,291
Speaker 1: but you know food shows.

00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,164
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, we'll talk about bread.

462
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:36,703
Speaker 0: Bread is in fact a staple food prepared by cooking a dough of flour and water and possibly more Ingredients.

463
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:39,358
Speaker 1: rim said that he was gonna read Wikipedia whenever he had nothing to say.

464
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,197
Speaker 1: So now here he goes.

465
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:44,246
Speaker 0: It is amazing.

466
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:53,831
Speaker 0: what if you ever get really bored find a Wikipedia article on something just so basic like bread or walking.

467
00:28:53,851 --> 00:29:04,593
Speaker 0: and It is interesting to read a very deep discussion of something so simple and kind of the weird Associated facts and just sentences you would never expect to see in the rest of your life.

468
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:06,502
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

469
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 1: The thing is let's talk about some breads, right?

472
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,804
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

473
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,069
Speaker 1: I can't pick one bread.

474
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,992
Speaker 1: That's impossible.

475
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,180
Speaker 0: I think I would just have to go with some sort of like peasant bread.

476
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,748
Speaker 1: It depends on what you need right like.

477
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:43,510
Speaker 1: if I need a sandwich right like a big long sandwich I got to get that de Bellas bread, but if I need like, you know Sandwich right then I got to get my home pride, but if I need to Get some pastrami you need some Jewish right?

478
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:43,811
Speaker 1: I need like.

479
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:44,754
Speaker 1: yeah, I need like a ride.

480
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:45,738
Speaker 0: Maybe a marble rye.

481
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:46,400
Speaker 1: I don't know.

482
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,837
Speaker 1: It's a different bread for a different time, you know.

483
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,769
Speaker 1: and to stain You know, maybe I need a garlic bread.

484
00:29:53,352 --> 00:30:00,639
Speaker 1: Maybe I need You know a bread, you know, if I'm having a burger I need like a bun with all sorts of sesame seeds all over it.

485
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:03,960
Speaker 1: But if I get in a bagel, I might need everything bagel.

486
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,771
Speaker 1: I need all kinds, you know And it's each variety of bagel a different bread.

487
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:08,795
Speaker 1: or is bagel a bread?

488
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,540
Speaker 1: bagel is a bread But everything bagel is not a different bread.

489
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,894
Speaker 0: Bagel, you know, I think the toppings of a bread are independent of the bread itself.

490
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:19,619
Speaker 1: So two different rise, right?

491
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,509
Speaker 1: So it's not two different kinds of bread.

492
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,395
Speaker 0: I think a rye is rye.

493
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:25,719
Speaker 0: now there's different grades of rye.

494
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,629
Speaker 0: I mean at the top is like but I mean you got.

495
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:28,855
Speaker 1: you got rye with seeds.

496
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,900
Speaker 1: you got rye without seeds.

497
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,352
Speaker 1: You got rye with like that.

498
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,320
Speaker 1: They had a rye at the store.

499
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,919
Speaker 1: They like a euro rye rye, which wasn't real pumpernickel and then they had real pumpernickel rye and then marble rye.

500
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,751
Speaker 1: You know, I mean those different bread.

501
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:47,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they all have different constituent elements But they're all under the subset of rye.

502
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:48,491
Speaker 1: but but everything.

503
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,660
Speaker 1: bagel and garlic and garlic bagel and onion.

504
00:30:51,082 --> 00:31:00,818
Speaker 0: Well when you when you make a seeded rye you put the seeds in as an intrinsic part of making the bread When you make everything bagel, you kind of add them to the already effectively bagel bagel.

505
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,178
Speaker 0: What if you got?

506
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,565
Speaker 1: Raisin bagel that are actually is.

507
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:08,460
Speaker 1: there's something in the bread now that's different cuz it's mixed in our whole grain bagel.

508
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,371
Speaker 0: I don't know about whole grain bagels.

509
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:11,337
Speaker 0: That's some bullshit right there.

510
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:13,806
Speaker 1: You know, you got it in free.

511
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:14,528
Speaker 0: go to subway.

512
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,793
Speaker 1: They give you like five choices.

513
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,478
Speaker 0: There's no breaded subway.

514
00:31:17,498 --> 00:31:18,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is Bread.

515
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,059
Speaker 0: That is a bread like substance.

516
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,986
Speaker 1: No, see, I mean Taco Bell.

517
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:28,705
Speaker 1: you could say that that is a Mexican food was the last time you ate at a subway Quite recently.

518
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:32,340
Speaker 0: when cuz I ate at a subway a couple days ago cuz I was desperate and I was in a hurry.

519
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,450
Speaker 1: I was in Brooklyn a couple months ago.

520
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,620
Speaker 1: I had a subway that bread just and actually know it.

521
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,168
Speaker 1: I'm feeling like going to subway right now after the show.

522
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:39,670
Speaker 1: Really?

523
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,533
Speaker 1: I don't know.

524
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:41,295
Speaker 1: I just feel like it.

525
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,303
Speaker 1: Ah What do you mean?

526
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:43,966
Speaker 0: Uh, it's just.

527
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:47,000
Speaker 0: it's so I'd all Wonder bread is below subway bread.

528
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,260
Speaker 1: Okay, that's true.

529
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:54,280
Speaker 0: I think what's ruined me is I have a very skewed perspective on bread now.

530
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,414
Speaker 0: But right by the way is probably the most important food to be like.

531
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:58,700
Speaker 0: I eat more bread than anything.

532
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:02,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right and the thing is like I eat more bread than anything But it's also even in the city.

533
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:03,913
Speaker 1: It's like hard to get.

534
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,240

535
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 0: What are you got?

536
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:09,206
Speaker 0: Well, maybe just cuz I work across from Grand Central I go to the hot and crusty.

537
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,700
Speaker 0: the hot and crusty is great or I go to the Grand Central Market.

538
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,906
Speaker 0: There's even more bread in there.

539
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,373
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's also sorrows.

540
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:24,612
Speaker 1: if you really want some shitty bread Overpriced shitty bread, but I mean, you know, it's hard, you know, there's places that have breads But it's hard to find the exact breads that I want at.

Speaker 0: you know, like what bread do you want?

542

Speaker 1: There are no you do.

586
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:16,518

00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:18,818
Speaker 1: there is like.

589
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:32,274
Speaker 1: No, like if I was having a dinner and I needed like, you know Like a bread to go with the dinner depending on what the dinner was.

590
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:33,460
Speaker 1: They got that kind of bread.

591
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,400
Speaker 1: They got that bread, but they don't got like the everyday bread.

592
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:40,656
Speaker 1: You know the bread that you keep there and slowly eat away and then replace when it is done.

593
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:41,699
Speaker 1: see they don't got that.

594
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,228
Speaker 0: I don't you the only.

595
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,040
Speaker 0: I don't very rarely get bread like that anymore.

596
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,937
Speaker 0: I basically every time I want bread I buy a fresh bread with it by the second day.

597
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:50,420
Speaker 0: It's all eaten Mm-hmm.

598
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,967
Speaker 0: So it's always fresh bread.

599
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,011
Speaker 1: I don't need that much bread.

600
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,199
Speaker 1: I like four slices a day.

601
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,660
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll come home from work You know, I want a little repent a little snack before we do the show before we do stuff.

602
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:07,819
Speaker 0: So I'll basically cut like a couple of pieces of fancy like nice bread and I'll cut up some cheese Get some olives some nuts for that and eat all that together.

603
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:11,797
Speaker 0: So I'll eat like three or four slices of bread every day.

604
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:17,256
Speaker 1: when there's bread I'll eat like, you know that and it's not just hanging out of my mouth in the morning.

605
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,016
Speaker 0: if there's bread I'm gonna make that like garlic bread or something with dinner.

606
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,864
Speaker 0: That's just obvious I don't know.

607
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:27,240
Speaker 1: I'll eat like, you know, the the Sutton coming out of my you know, a piece of toast.

608
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:37,479
Speaker 0: Actually what I'll do a lot too is the toppings on the bread I'll take like one of those peasant style, you know Like the big round white like kind of doughy open bread like you had an Italian restaurant.

609
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:42,495
Speaker 0: I'll do the the olive garden or the macaroni grill thing or I guess the Italian thing.

610
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,411
Speaker 0: you put the olive oil and the pepper And the vinegar on a little plate.

611
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:48,381
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

612
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:58,420
Speaker 1: I'll have the piece of toast hanging out of my mouth in the morning and then you know on the way home You know when I get home, maybe I'll eat something a little bit more bread and then I have a sandwich for lunch at work.

613
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,971
Speaker 1: You know, it comes on some breads, but that's pretty much it.

614
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:09,927
Speaker 1: I don't you know, I don't eat, you know vast quantities I eat, you know the correct amount Quality fairly vast quantities of bread.

615
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,959
Speaker 1: then compared to you you do I think you need vast quantities of bread compared to most people.

616
00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:16,129
Speaker 0: People showed him you supposed to see what.

617
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:17,940
Speaker 0: like 11 servings of grains per day.

618
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean I eat lots of grains that are not bread like what like a melba toast That's a bread or a corn chip.

619
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:25,433
Speaker 0: Do crackers count.

620
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:32,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, you know He's a bowl of cereal, you know, all these things are grains but are not.

Speaker 1: you know bread straight up.

622
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,037
Speaker 0: So I actually don't eat many of those things except crackers.

623
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:39,091
Speaker 1: Oh, see I eat lots of things that are grains but are not.

624
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,758
Speaker 0: I don't eat cereal because I can't stay.

625
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:41,260
Speaker 1: no bread.

00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:53,490
Speaker 1: You got a dry cereal.

630
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:54,133

00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:54,435
Speaker 0: Actually.

Speaker 0: I'll get like granola or something.

634
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,630

637
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:08,673
Speaker 1: in that case Why no granola bars are so fucking dry.

638
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:14,260
Speaker 0: every granola bar I find is either moist and juicy in that fake way that I can't deal with anymore.

639
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,648
Speaker 0: It's the same moistness that you get in like a Twinkie.

640
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,460
Speaker 1: No, the moistness of a Twinkie is different from like the kudos bar.

641
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kudos bar still feels like weird to me.

642
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:24,210
Speaker 0: I don't know.

643
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:30,005

Speaker 0: Those are good Yeah, but they still.

646
00:37:35,124 --> 00:37:42,130
Speaker 0: they feel weird to me compared to fresh granola, which is not dry ass But it's not wet either just kind of in between.

647
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:46,691
Speaker 0: I can't stand those dry bars Like the nature's harvest whatever.

648
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:47,998
Speaker 1: Oh God there that stuff.

649
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:48,360
Speaker 1: I can't eat.

650
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,560
Speaker 0: They basically just cut my throat all the way down.

651
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, too scratchy.

652
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,660
Speaker 1: and you know, I gotta have the chew with this chewy ones.

653
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,100
Speaker 1: But I could see I do know the fake chewy like the cupcake with the white swirl on top, right?

654
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that fake, you know, okay, that's that preservative mushiness That's just discussed.

655
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,203
Speaker 1: when I was a kid.

656
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:10,694
Speaker 0: My favorite thing in the world was the orange version of that Cuz there's the chocolate one that all of normal kids ate.

657
00:38:10,714 --> 00:38:11,599
Speaker 0: then I had the orange one.

658
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,516
Speaker 0: This day I could not tell you what that flavor was.

659
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:15,300
Speaker 1: I don't know.

660
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,305
Speaker 0: It was not orange nor was it vanilla at RIT.

661
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:23,104
Speaker 1: I ate like the you know, fake preservative donuts and Cupcakes a couple times.

662
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:27,320
Speaker 1: I never had a vending machine when I was desperate for like something that actually had weight to it.

663
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,103
Speaker 0: So I never ate those.

664
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:31,154
Speaker 0: but what I would eat is Krispy Kremes in explicable.

665
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:32,679
Speaker 1: I ate all those a whole bunch too.

666
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:36,204
Speaker 1: Is there any?

667
00:38:36,245 --> 00:38:38,856
Speaker 1: there's got to be one in the city somewhere right I did.

668
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:39,820
Speaker 0: Krispy Kreme is shit.

669
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,709
Speaker 0: No, it's only good at RIT cuz we were poor.

670
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,514
Speaker 0: There's a lot of calories in those things.

671
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:45,979
Speaker 0: Those are some shit-ass.

672
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,103

Speaker 0: They're terrible donuts.

676
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,180
Speaker 0: Why do you think the company is doing terribly?

677
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,619
Speaker 1: Because they've screwed up business-wise not because there was anything wrong with the product.

678
00:38:57,122 --> 00:38:58,286
Speaker 0: Those are not donuts.

679
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:00,576
Speaker 1: They're just you and your donut, whatever.

680
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:01,620
Speaker 1: Nobody agrees with you.

681
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:05,520
Speaker 0: What do you think a real donut is fried dough from a baker?

682
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

683
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:10,380

00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:40,918
Speaker 1: cider donuts.

696
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:47,610
Speaker 0: a donut It is but it's a special kind of what is a normal donut You know makes it good donuts a glazed donut from Krispy Kreme.

697
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,340
Speaker 0: You know what top-hot donuts are real fucking donuts.

698
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,151
Speaker 1: You know Krispy Kreme also a donut.

699
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,419
Speaker 0: Nah, it's not a donut.

700
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,290
Speaker 1: Krispy Kreme is a donut.

701
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,920
Speaker 1: You're making like a No True Scotsman argument.

702
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,411
Speaker 1: You're just done.

703
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:57,780
Speaker 1: That's it.

704
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,280
Speaker 0: Go look at the definition of a donut and how to make one and look at how Krispy Kreme makes a donut.

705
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,843
Speaker 1: You're done.

706
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:03,874
Speaker 0: Krispy Kreme is a donut in the same way.

707
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:11,279
Speaker 0: No True Scotsman game over Scott, Krispy Kreme is a donut in the same way that Taco Bell is a taco, but it's not.

708
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,085
Speaker 0: well How not?

709
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:19,115
Speaker 1: no true Scotsman no true taco Because the Taco Bell does not actually contain what is required by the definition of taco.

710
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,740
Speaker 0: What is the definition of a taco?

711
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:25,220
Speaker 0: What is not in a Taco Bell taco, it's fun to say there's no meat in but you know what there's meat?

712
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:25,963
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

713
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:26,465
Speaker 1: That's me.

714
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,007
Speaker 1: It's not.

715
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:29,377
Speaker 0: it's better meat in there than there isn't a Burger King.

716
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,863
Speaker 1: It's soy It's it's not.

717
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:31,886
Speaker 1: there's no actual meats.

718
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,112
Speaker 1: The percentage of meat is not high enough.

719
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:34,875
Speaker 1: You can measure.

720
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:36,480
Speaker 1: you can measure with a ruler.

721
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:41,091
Speaker 0: Wait, you just went from no meat to small amount of meat.

722
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:41,632
Speaker 0: You're slipping.

723
00:40:42,395 --> 00:40:47,600
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there might be Yours clearly committing the no true taco fallacy.

724
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,331
Speaker 1: Well, I mean how much grain does it I mean?

725
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,520
Speaker 1: is a bread still a bread if it has like corn syrup in it?

726
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:55,160
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we have to go by the definition of bread.

727
00:40:55,561 --> 00:41:00,739
Speaker 0: So to go back to Wikipedia bread is a staple food prepared by cooking a dough.

728
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:03,959
Speaker 1: Nothing's bread because there are definitely no staples in the bread that I eat.

729
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:09,560
Speaker 1: I don't know if you got some swing line in your bread by cooking a dough of flour and water.

730
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:10,383
Speaker 1: So what if?

731
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,412
Speaker 1: so if you make it with corn chip is not bread.

732
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,140
Speaker 1: No, so what if I make corn bread?

733
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,396
Speaker 0: No, no corn flour corn bread is not flour.

734
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:16,820
Speaker 0: You're fine.

735
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:19,460
Speaker 1: So it has to be flour of some grain.

736
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:26,262
Speaker 0: So yes, but if I flour flour is a powder made of cereal grains other seeds or so What roots?

737
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:27,868
Speaker 1: or seeds or roots?

738
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:29,233
Speaker 1: so it has to be milled?

739
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,160
Speaker 1: Yes, you actually have to mill the grain.

740
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:38,991
Speaker 0: So if you whole grain bread is not bread because there's no flour, you know, cuz they know the whole not Scott they're not just using the whole grains.

741
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:40,858
Speaker 0: if they were doing that it wouldn't be bread.

742
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:46,240
Speaker 0: It's mostly milled grains and they leave some of them unmilled which is fine in all these definitions.

743
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:49,880
Speaker 1: So the breads that say 100% whole grain are false advertising.

744
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:55,280
Speaker 0: Well, the whole grain also matters whether or not they leave like the husk on whether or not they leave the germ in there.

745
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,184
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of stuff.

746
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:59,480
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about grains really except they taste good.

747
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:00,219
Speaker 0: I mean great.

748
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:10,120
Speaker 0: We do not know if it was beer or bread that came first But beer or bread according to a lot of people is the absolute origin of human society and settlement.

749
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:13,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much we couldn't have that until we invented one of the two.

750
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:17,190
Speaker 0: beer probably came first At least from the things I've read but those could be biased.

751
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:17,572
Speaker 0: I don't know.

752
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:22,834
Speaker 0: Oh Apparently bread should be stored in a container such as a bread box.

753
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:23,296
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

754
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:24,400
Speaker 1: I don't store my bread in a container.

755
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,000
Speaker 1: I just sort of leave it in the plastic bag and make sure it's tied up.

756
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,353
Speaker 0: Uh, I actually put it in the bag, but then I put it in a small cabinet.

757
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,818
Speaker 0: that functions much like a bread box.

758
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:33,267
Speaker 1: Mmm, why?

759
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:35,159
Speaker 1: why do you need to store your bread in a bread box?

760
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,440
Speaker 0: Less chance of contamination by what other bread mold?

761
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:43,433
Speaker 1: You know bread just gets moldy no matter what I do with that.

762
00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:52,340
Speaker 1: my bread doesn't you know, it takes You know, the thing is it but by the time it gets moldy, you know If it gets moldy, it's been there for a long time and it's usually because I want to.

763
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:53,865
Speaker 0: I will differentiate.

764
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:55,552
Speaker 0: there are two completely different kinds of bread thing.

765
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:57,760
Speaker 1: Is that looking at you're like, oh my bread doesn't get moldy.

766
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,763
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you eat the bread.

767
00:42:58,823 --> 00:42:59,887
Speaker 1: You need a half a loaf.

768
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:01,532
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying to bread.

769
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:03,780
Speaker 0: I don't buy pre sliced bread.

770
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,558
Speaker 0: Uh-huh ever I buy loaves of bread and I use that ugly knife to cut slices every time I want them.

771
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:19,571
Speaker 1: See I We got to talk about the knife in a second But I like to buy a pre sliced bread depending on the kind of bread You know like the only see.

772
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:21,000
Speaker 0: even I learned at the Zaya.

773
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,660
Speaker 0: They don't make that many of them but that fancy the bread I get the sugar bread the white bread.

774
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,180
Speaker 0: You can get that on slice and on sliced bread like like a rye bread.

775
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:34,841
Speaker 1: I try to slice the rye bread with a knife.

776
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,289
Speaker 1: that slices come out too thick.

777
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,840
Speaker 0: Get a bread mitre a mitre.

778
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the hell is that?

779
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:43,030
Speaker 0: You've obviously never done woodworking.

780
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:43,874
Speaker 1: I don't think you have.

781
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:46,950
Speaker 0: I don't have one because I can cut fucking straight.

782
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:49,920
Speaker 1: But if you can't cut all the slices it perfectly.

783
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,532
Speaker 1: every slice of rye bread when you go through that machine is like exactly like One centimeter.

784
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:59,190
Speaker 0: So if you really can't do that and you want to have the perfect bread just get a bread mitre.

785
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:04,970
Speaker 1: The other thing is that when I cut the bread right with a knife you make a mad crumbs fucking everywhere.

786
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,670
Speaker 1: All right, and if I let them pre slice the bread crummage not an issue.

787
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:17,866
Speaker 1: So I like to keep the crummage to a minimum and get the pre slice bread depending on the kind of bread You know I realize people might be thinking I'm talking about the hats.

788
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:24,534
Speaker 0: a Mitre is basically a box and use a special saw in it that has slots to make sure you cut things in the exact right Positions.

789
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:26,790
Speaker 1: see I can cut the you know straight up and down.

790
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,421
Speaker 1: The problem is cutting exactly one centimeters with.

791
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:33,898
Speaker 1: so that's why I guess I'm having the bread, you know Be it takes care of that situation.

792
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:34,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

793
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,343
Speaker 1: All right.

794
00:44:35,564 --> 00:44:36,567
Speaker 1: We got to talk about the knife.

795
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,330
Speaker 1: So this is knife.

796
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,117
Speaker 1: What's the find the exact name of the knife?

797
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,924
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'll look it up.

798
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:41,526
Speaker 0: you talk about.

799
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:42,530
Speaker 1: it's this yellow knife.

800
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:43,093
Speaker 1: It looks.

801
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:46,531
Speaker 1: you look at this knife and it looks like the kind of thing that being grandma's kitchen Like.

802
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,590
Speaker 1: it's all ugly and yellow and you're like what the fuck is that thing?

803
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,168
Speaker 0: It's part of a whole set and all the other pieces in the set are really cool-looking.

804
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,438
Speaker 0: The what the bread knife is just weird-looking.

805
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:57,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like this yellow knife.

806
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,290
Speaker 1: It's totally weird.

807
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:05,643
Speaker 1: It is the best bread cutting knife in the universe in terms of like cutting a loaf The pure komachi bread knife by shouldn't.

808
00:45:05,924 --> 00:45:06,447
Speaker 1: yeah, that's it.

809
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:12,350
Speaker 1: so The thing is with this knife, it's serrated in such a way that you never had to sharpen it, right?

810
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,252
Speaker 1: Well, it's serrated.

811
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:18,109
Speaker 1: knives usually don't sharpen anyway, but it's serrated in both directions was sort of like these humps.

812
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:24,973
Speaker 1: So when you push it forward it cuts and when you pull it backward it cuts but it cuts the same way whether you're going Backwards or forwards.

813
00:45:25,394 --> 00:45:30,710
Speaker 1: so when you cut a bread with it you look at the bread and it's like this absolutely smooth cut.

814
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,183
Speaker 1: It looks like you cut it with like the bread slicing machine.

815
00:45:33,223 --> 00:45:34,370
Speaker 1: It's like so smooth.

816
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:40,667
Speaker 1: It's straight down the middle and it makes minimal crummage compared to other knives Of course depending on the kind of.

817
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:47,281
Speaker 0: well The reason for that primarily is that any time you've had trouble cutting bread with a bread knife It's not really a bread knife.

818
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:47,764
Speaker 0: Look at the.

819
00:45:47,805 --> 00:45:48,086
Speaker 0: look at the.

820
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:48,670
Speaker 0: we'll link to this.

821
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,193
Speaker 1: We learned this.

822
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:51,630
Speaker 1: we went to the store right where I bought a bunch of knives.

823
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:52,890
Speaker 0: I wasn't even there as you and Emily.

824

Speaker 1: He's like no, that's a deli guy finally comes to help us.

827
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,195
Speaker 1: He's like that's a deli knife.

Speaker 1: It's an ugly duckling, but it works and I'm like you sure he's like Oh, yeah.

831
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,776
Speaker 1: So I trusted the big fat knife selling guy at the store and boy am I glad I trusted that guy Because he knews about knives.

832
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,282
Speaker 1: He works in the knife store.

833
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:22,907
Speaker 0: So well, how many knives did he have?

834
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:23,570
Speaker 1: kitchen store?

Speaker 1: It's the kitchen store.

837
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:30,370
Speaker 1: but as like this great knife section they actually have a knife club and I'm in the knife club there.

838
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:31,713
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome.

839
00:46:31,974 --> 00:46:33,800
Speaker 0: Plus this bread knife 20 bucks.

Speaker 1: Yeah 20 bucks for the only bread knife You'll ever need for the rest of your life.

841
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,250
Speaker 1: Why not?

842
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,962
Speaker 0: You might eventually bust it and have to get another one like 40 years.

843
00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:42,570
Speaker 0: How could you possibly break it?

844
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,255
Speaker 0: I don't know if you don't.

845
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:47,790
Speaker 1: if you have a marble cutting board It's a good thing to get as a gift for people, you know.

846
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,568
Speaker 1: Like if you don't have one cuz like here I bought you this bread knife.

847
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:51,132
Speaker 1: It's.

848
00:46:51,212 --> 00:46:53,746
Speaker 1: and then they use it and like holy shit, you know and you add it.

849
00:46:53,766 --> 00:47:01,278
Speaker 1: see if they eat bread It's something they'll actually use a lot and will actually make a difference in their lives as opposed to if you get them Like I don't know an expensive appliance.

850
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:01,600
Speaker 1: They never.

851
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,030
Speaker 1: they use like once in a blue moon like a bread maker.

852
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:10,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a great the great knife the pure komachi Awesomeness.

853
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:10,596
Speaker 0: Yep.

854
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,087
Speaker 0: Ah, you should get a bread.

855
00:47:12,107 --> 00:47:15,921
Speaker 0: minor though Cuz remember if you don't slice your bread it lasts a lot longer.

856
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:18,870
Speaker 1: Let me go on Amazon and search for bread miters.

857
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,150
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone makes bread miters specifically.

858
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,855
Speaker 0: I mean it develops.

859
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,910
Speaker 0: we had one we made ourselves that we use forever.

860
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,210
Speaker 1: You know what?

861
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,258
Speaker 1: They have those those bread like shoots.

862
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:32,884
Speaker 1: you like send the bread down the chute and there's a chainsaw in there Basically or spinning and it goes near and slices it perfectly in half.

863
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:34,370
Speaker 1: I like that action.

864
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,850
Speaker 0: You just get a whole bread cutting machine this element like creating barrel.

865
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:40,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not something you have for a house with what an apartment would be awesome.

866
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,696
Speaker 0: No, you know you have your loaf of bread.

867
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:42,238
Speaker 0: people come over.

868
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:43,725
Speaker 0: You're like, all right guys want some sandwiches.

869
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:47,018
Speaker 1: Oh I see how the bread miter works.

870
00:47:47,058 --> 00:47:48,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not really gonna work.

871
00:47:48,905 --> 00:47:52,203
Speaker 0: for the rye bread though You'd have to get one that was the right size and shape.

872
00:47:52,223 --> 00:47:53,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think they have one day.

873
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,890
Speaker 1: Oh, there's only three on Amazon.

874
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:55,714
Speaker 0: You can make one.

875
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:56,236
Speaker 0: when I was making.

876
00:47:56,257 --> 00:48:00,098
Speaker 1: there is this one that was good for cutting bagels exactly in half Wouldn't bagel miter.

877
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:01,710
Speaker 0: I actually get a bagel miter.

878
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:06,127
Speaker 1: They also have baguette miter and a French minor, but they don't have a rye miter.

879
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:07,396
Speaker 0: I'm surprised.

880
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,710
Speaker 0: didn't you ever take like a shop class?

881
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,330
Speaker 0: Miters sawing is like one of the first things you learn with that flat backed weird back.

882
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I know what a miter is.

883
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:15,399

Speaker 1: how much longer do we have to talk about bread?

889
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:32,150
Speaker 0: I think we can cut it off.

890
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,856
Speaker 0: We I really fucking like bread.

891
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:41,190
Speaker 0: I think my let's just go down, you know favorite breads like overall man I like so many bread cuz I really like like peasant bread like the white.

892
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:46,209
Speaker 0: I like like they're really crusty on the outside like spirally rolls with poppy seed on the inside.

893
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:50,730
Speaker 0: It's like really airy and loose, you know, basically I don't like any bread.

894
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:51,192
Speaker 1: That's like.

895
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:55,998
Speaker 1: I like breads that have a lot of substance, but I don't like them to be like heavy in the stomach You know, it's like.

896
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,130
Speaker 0: well, it depends.

897
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:58,816
Speaker 0: I mean, I like a good pumpernickel.

898
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:02,949
Speaker 0: if the mood is right pumpernickel is not heavy in the stomach of real pumpernickel is.

899
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:05,239
Speaker 1: no It's not I'm talking about like these breads.

900
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,528
Speaker 0: We didn't even tell you know, what pumpernickel bubble.

901
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:09,030
Speaker 0: save that We don't tell the list.

902
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,939
Speaker 1: I'm talking like you go to the grocery store and there's a bread and it says like 12 grain and you bite into it like One bite and you're full cuz.

903
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,389
Speaker 0: well that is a separate issue.

904
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,050
Speaker 0: I found that seems weird lately and a lot of foodies are talking about this more and more.

905
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:28,170
Speaker 0: There seems to be this war on white bread because you know Most people think white bread think Wonder Bread or you know slice bread in a bag from the grocery store.

906
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,838
Speaker 1: The thing is the problem with those breads is white bread, you know Wonder Bread I think to white bread in general I don't like.

907
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:39,590
Speaker 1: but like I get like, you know home fried wheat bread Which you know, I mean it still has corn syrup in it.

908
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,683
Speaker 1: It's not like a fancy high-grained bread, but it's totally awesome.

909
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:45,850
Speaker 1: and white bread Wonder Bread is totally disgusting.

910
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,086
Speaker 0: Well thing is there are many like a baguette is technically a white bread.

911
00:49:49,106 --> 00:49:49,930
Speaker 1: baguettes are awesome.

912
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:54,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but a lot of people are using non white bread.

913
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:56,650
Speaker 1: man They need to open up a pond cotillion in Queens.

914
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:02,510
Speaker 1: Instead of going to Subway after the show I could go there and get the baguette sandwich another poor place to work.

915
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:03,618
Speaker 0: There's one right next to my office.

916
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:03,819
Speaker 0: I eat.

917
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:06,529
Speaker 1: there's one right next to my office, too But there isn't one right now.

918
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I wouldn't get a sandwich though.

919
00:50:09,763 --> 00:50:11,130
Speaker 0: I'd get one of those tartines instead.

920
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:13,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got to sit down to get that.

921
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,327
Speaker 0: No, you can get that to go.

922
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:14,830
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

923

Speaker 1: Maybe.

932
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:41,630
Speaker 0: I like friends that are really crusty on the outside, but then really like warm and doughy on the inside.

933
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:45,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all about the high quality crust But the thing is the crust has to have like a flavor.

934
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,220
Speaker 1: a lot of times you get like a charred crust or a tasteless crust.

935
00:50:48,364 --> 00:50:48,891
Speaker 1: yeah It's like.

936
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:56,290
Speaker 1: no the crust like brings all these great flavors, and then the inside has to be nice and squishy But it also has to have you know a flavor.

937
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:58,058
Speaker 1: But hey, you know the thing is I don't like it.

938
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:01,395
Speaker 1: when the inside has a weird flavor like a sourdough It's like all right.

939
00:51:01,455 --> 00:51:02,261
Speaker 1: That's a good kind of.

Speaker 0: Yeah Lately though one thing I do want to say Living here.

971
00:52:14,993 --> 00:52:16,078
Speaker 0: I don't have a toaster.

972
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,528
Speaker 1: I've always had a toaster oven.

973
00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:19,846

975
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:30,070
Speaker 0: But when I live I used to blues brother when I lived alone in fish kill because I didn't buy a toaster then and I had A wire coat hanger, and I'd blues brother it and I got a gas stove.

976
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:42,450
Speaker 0: I could blues brother it But I've taken back up an art that I'd lost from when I was in high school Which was instead of using a toaster I would always make toast with a little bit of butter on a skillet, and I have refined that art again.

977
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:45,370
Speaker 0: And I very much love butter toast.

978
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:49,425

979
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:57,950
Speaker 1: otherwise fire yep So you got to toast it then butter it, but if you do the butter toast obviously making grilled Non bread you know cheese without the tomato or the cheese.

Speaker 0: Oh, you go one step further and fry the bread and like bacon grease, but I usually fuck that up The guy.
