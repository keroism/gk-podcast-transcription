1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,891
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, July 3rd, 2013, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:19,280
Speaker 1: Tonight, those quiet badasses.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,397
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,360
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they're not all quiet, but they're all badasses.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,620
Speaker 1: But I got another biking story.

6
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:37,640
Speaker 1: I guess Geek Nights has the, we don't have the opening bit anymore, we just have the "So I was biking home from work" bit.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,760
Speaker 0: Hey, you know what my bit is?

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,060
Speaker 0: I said I wasn't able to bike pretty much fucking all week with this rain.

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,099
Speaker 1: I biked to work almost every day because I'm not a pansy.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,437
Speaker 0: I had, you know, the different nights I had stuff to do, every night.

11
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,240
Speaker 0: it was just, the rain was not on my schedule.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:59,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I got to admit, I biked to work this morning, but it just started to rain like right as I got to the office, and then it was fine when I left.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,300
Speaker 0: I used an umbrella to walk to the subway.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:13,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm biking over to the Pulaski, coming home, doing my thing, and there's this big dude who's kind of chubby and kind of angry looking, just kind of walking forward, blocking the whole bike path, the whole pedestrian way, so I can't get around him.

15
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:15,739
Speaker 1: He's walking super slow right in the middle.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,034
Speaker 1: So I'm like, "Excuse

17
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:17,116
Speaker 1: me?".

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,879
Speaker 1: You know, I'm real polite and he doesn't respond, so I ding my bell.

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,058
Speaker 1: He turns around, he's like, "Slow the fuck down, fucking

20
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:23,360
Speaker 1: biker!".

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,598
Speaker 1: He's just really mad at me.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,503
Speaker 1: So I scoot around him and I start to bike away, and he starts chasing, like, "Come back here

23
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:30,685
Speaker 1: you!".

24
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:41,600
Speaker 1: And I flipped him off, and then I heard him yell even more, and he got so mad, and I just biked away, because chubby, angry guy's not going to do much.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,397
Speaker 0: What's he going to do?

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,439
Speaker 1: I guess he would try to hit me if he got close enough to me.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,418
Speaker 0: Listen, if he can chase me down while I'm riding my bike, my hat is off to you, good sir.

28
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,177
Speaker 0: On foot?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,020
Speaker 0: In a friggin' all race, fucking Usain Bolt on my bike.

30
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:01,320
Speaker 1: I did, as a kid, someone stole my bike.

31
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,460
Speaker 1: I was in, like, middle school.

32
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,720
Speaker 0: Usain Bolt's on foot, by the way.

33
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:15,439
Speaker 1: I was in middle school, and I parked my bike, and I walked over to fuck around with this tree ford, and this bully kid, I hear a noise, and I look, and he's standing next to my bike, and he's getting on it and going to ride off with it.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,660
Speaker 1: I don't think he realized I was right there, up in the tree, watching him.

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaker 1: So I jump down, and I start chasing, and he sees me and tries to bike away.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,078
Speaker 1: Doesn't know how gears work.

37
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:34,238
Speaker 1: So I ran up behind him, and I grabbed his shirt, and I pulled on it, and it didn't pull him over, but it ripped his shirt basically off and ruined it.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,479
Speaker 1: And then he turns around like he's gonna fight with me, and he gets off the bike, and bully kids tend to be big and slow.

39
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:45,978
Speaker 1: So I ran around him, got on the bike, and then I just biked away, and I left him there with his broken shirt.

40
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,200
Speaker 1: There's nothing else happened there.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,858
Speaker 1: That was the story.

42
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,838
Speaker 0: If someone's on a bike, running away, what you want to do is run up and give them a good ol' check.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Speaker 0: They play shoulder ram right in the side.

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,193
Speaker 1: Boom!

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,497
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I could chase down most people who weren't good bikers if they tried to get away from me on a bike.

46
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,798
Speaker 1: My bike or someone else's bike.

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,858
Speaker 0: It's like if they pick up the bike and it's in high gear, they don't know how to shift down.

48
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:09,976
Speaker 0: That's actually when I...

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,660
Speaker 1: 'Cause sometimes I'll leave my bike outside the store, 'cause I'm gonna go in, get some ice cream, and then come right back out.

50
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,819
Speaker 1: I can see it in the window.

51
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:21,520
Speaker 1: I just put it in the highest gear, because the majority of bike thieves would not be able to get away in time.

52
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:29,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, unless they toss it in the back of a truck, they're gonna get on and go, "Nyeh," and I'm gonna see them and easily be able to catch up and slam right into the street.

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,540
Speaker 1: So, I was gonna link to this on the Anime News Network, but their DNS stopped working literally as we started to do Geek Night, so I can't actually visit their link.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,620
Speaker 0: Well, their loss is their loss.

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,279
Speaker 1: However, the site I found is pretty cool.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,157
Speaker 1: It's all Sailor Moon-y.

58
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:54,359
Speaker 1: So, the person who created Sailor Moon, Naoko Takeuchi, hasn't done an interview in over a decade.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,813
Speaker 0: Have they done anything besides?

60
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,720
Speaker 0: make Sailor Moon?

61
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,080
Speaker 1: I don't actually know.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,380
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon is the only thing of hers that I know about.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Speaker 0: It's the manga creator, right?

64
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:03,857
Speaker 0: Yes.

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,215
Speaker 0: Yeah.

66
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,980
Speaker 1: I'll be honest, I don't really know anything about her other than Sailor Moon.

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,320
Speaker 0: Are you the Sailor Moon fucking expert?

68
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,460
Speaker 1: No, I just happen to have seen all of Sailor Moon.

69
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:15,180
Speaker 1: If you have seen all of anything, you can speak to it.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,116
Speaker 1: You can probably say things that make you sound like an expert about Hokkaido Ken to someone who's never seen it.

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:30,917
Speaker 1: But regardless, I learned from Wikipedia that she's a licensed pharmacist, and her senior thesis had the title "Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to

72
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:31,620
Speaker 1: Ultrasound.".

73
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:32,660
Speaker 1: Okay.

74
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,854
Speaker 1: Anyway, she has not done an interview in 11 years.

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,200
Speaker 0: But she's still been making manga?

76
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:42,540
Speaker 1: She's made some stuff, doesn't look like much of it's that recent.

77
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:45,560
Speaker 1: There's something called Tokimeka from 2006.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,980
Speaker 0: Is she just raking in Sailor Moon money and pharmacy money and not working?

79
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:56,499
Speaker 1: In 2002 she did Love Witch, story of a girl receives a perfume bottle and becomes a witch, but it carries a heavy price.

80
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,459
Speaker 0: Sounds fancy-lala-ish to me.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,460
Speaker 1: Discontinued after three chapters with no explanation.

82
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,840
Speaker 0: Oh, because it wasn't because it was bad?

83
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,899
Speaker 1: It was just- Has yet to be reprinted in any form.

84
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:07,780
Speaker 0: Okay.

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,919
Speaker 0: Let's find it on the internet.

86
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of want to read that now.

87
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:23,220
Speaker 1: But one, you should check this interview out because Sailor Moon, like it or not, seen it or not, is a pretty important anime in terms of the history of anime.

88
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:23,880
Speaker 0: That's true.

89
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:36,055
Speaker 1: And two, if you've seen the anime, especially if you've just seen what was on American TV, you've never read the manga, go find some of the Sailor Moon manga and just read a little bit of it.

90
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:37,879
Speaker 1: Just check that out.

91
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,160
Speaker 1: It's more like Green Lantern than you would expect.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Speaker 1: And it mostly involves space drama.

93
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:48,920
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's all I got here.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,360
Speaker 1: I would say more, but again, the Anime News Network's DNS stopped working.

95
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:58,156
Speaker 1: Oh, but the news is that she gave an interview for the first- The news that she gave and interview, the first one in supposedly 11 years.

96
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:00,160
Speaker 0: What does it say in that interview?

97
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:00,799
Speaker 1: I don't know.

98
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,939
Speaker 1: I can't read the whole thing.

99
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:02,859
Speaker 0: Okay.

100
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,340
Speaker 1: I gotta search around for another site that has the interview.

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,400
Speaker 0: Okay, so in real news, it's more important.

102
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,717
Speaker 0: You know, I buy a lot of comic books every month and it's pretty great because I get a huge discount because pre-ordering, but it's pretty sucky because my house fills up with comic books.

103
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,379
Speaker 0: I would much rather have digital comic books.

104
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:31,219
Speaker 0: However, there are problems with digital comic books, unlike other forms of art and mediums such as anime or JPEGs or whatnot.

105
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,479
Speaker 0: Comics do not translate perfectly to digitalness.

106
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:35,560
Speaker 1: No they don't.

107
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,076
Speaker 0: They do not.

108
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,280
Speaker 1: Someday we'll have that technology.

109
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,620
Speaker 0: A lot of these comic readers get like zoom in on a panel.

110
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,359
Speaker 0: It's like, nope.

111
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,300
Speaker 0: Or the ones it's like, oh, one page at a time.

112
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,380
Speaker 0: It's like two page spread.

113
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,859
Speaker 1: I know what the perfect interface is.

114
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:46,879
Speaker 1: It's trivial.

115
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:48,400
Speaker 1: Magic paper.

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,420
Speaker 1: Hologram.

117
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:49,880
Speaker 1: No, no magic paper.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,420
Speaker 1: No.

119
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Speaker 1: Overlay glasses and it just holds a perfect comic book in front of your face.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,350
Speaker 0: Yup.

121
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:56,818
Speaker 0: Sure.

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,060
Speaker 0: But anyway, the main reason I don't buy digital comics is because, you know, the only ones that are really like pirated.

123
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:11,180
Speaker 0: You can go online and there's torrents fucking every week, like every DC comment that came out this week, every Marvel comment that came out this week.

124
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,620
Speaker 0: But I don't want to read that shit.

125
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,080
Speaker 0: Right.

126
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:17,458
Speaker 0: I want to read all this other weird stuff that doesn't really get torrented, pirated as much.

127
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:21,239
Speaker 0: It's not as easy to find because, you know, no one's really buying it.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,939
Speaker 0: Like who's buying and scanning, for example, you know, complete Prince Valiant hardcovers that are dragging nobody.

129
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:30,480
Speaker 0: All right.

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,211
Speaker 0: So I had to buy it.

131
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,559
Speaker 1: But so you would you only buy stuff because you can't pirate it.

132
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:36,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:37,156
Speaker 0: Yes.

134
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,469
Speaker 0: OK.

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,640
Speaker 0: Anyway, if it was digital and a reasonable price, I would pay for it like steam anyway.

136
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,920
Speaker 0: So there are digital comics and most of them run comiXology and such.

137
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,513
Speaker 0: But I don't like that shit because DRM.

138
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,439
Speaker 0: Same reason I don't buy no Kindle books.

139
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,120
Speaker 0: Right.

140
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:53,776
Speaker 0: DRM's.

141
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:55,497
Speaker 0: Don't tell me steam has DRM's.

142
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,560
Speaker 0: Steam is a dollar.

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,859
Speaker 0: ComiXology.

144
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,040
Speaker 0: They're charging you the same price as the physical comics.

145
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:02,120
Speaker 0: Go fuck your mother.

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Speaker 0: Even if there's no DRM, I'm not paying that price for a digital comic.

147
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:05,918
Speaker 0: Go to hell.

148
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:08,858
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

149
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,100
Speaker 1: Seventy bucks is the cheapest I can find.

150
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,717
Speaker 1: One of the Prince Valiant's.

151
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:13,153
Speaker 0: Yeah.

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,140
Speaker 0: This is why preorder comics at a discount.

153
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,139
Speaker 0: I bought it at thirty five percent off retail and I have all of them so far.

154
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,417
Speaker 0: So take that.

155
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,598
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a someone some guys selling for one hundred and twenty eight that hasn't been opened or read yet.

156
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,020
Speaker 0: Mine's been opened in red anyway, anyway, anyway.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,380
Speaker 0: So there are sites that do DRM free digital comics.

158
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,600
Speaker 0: We just get PDFs and such.

159
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,596
Speaker 0: I think it's like my digital comics dot.

160
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:39,958
Speaker 0: com.

161
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:40,600
Speaker 0: Right.

162
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:48,220
Speaker 0: But nobody really goes to those sites because they really only have, you know, sort of more obscure indie comics from publishers.

163
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:57,080
Speaker 0: No one really cares about like, you know, you know, there's indie comics that are the ones that are like, you know, they're hot indie comics, like maybe from a publisher, like Top Shelf or Fanta Graphics.

164
00:08:57,341 --> 00:09:09,799
Speaker 0: And then there's those indie comics that's like, oh, it's just that generic stuff that fills the shelves of the comic book store, like vampire something or zombie and girl with boobs and guns or shit like that.

165
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 0: Right.

166
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,998
Speaker 0: That's the kind of stuff you're going to find on my digital comics dot.

167
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:13,220
Speaker 0: com.

168
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,158
Speaker 0: Well, big news.

169
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:21,640
Speaker 0: Image comics redid their website to be less sucky because, you know, comic publishers usually don't have good websites.

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,399
Speaker 0: And part of that is they put DRM free comics for sale directly on their website in PDF, EPUB, CBR or CBZ.

171
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,700
Speaker 0: So any format you want.

172
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,620
Speaker 0: Not bad problem pricing.

173
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:35,980
Speaker 0: Still not so good.

174
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,898
Speaker 0: Oh, how bad?

175
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,820
Speaker 0: Well, it's not as bad, really.

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,399
Speaker 0: It's pretty much like old comics are like a dollar each and brand new ones are the same price as the print.

177
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:46,999
Speaker 0: So still not buying it.

178
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,940
Speaker 0: But that's a major publisher.

179
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,899
Speaker 0: Images number three.

180
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:54,600
Speaker 0: And in fact, I see myself on my order forms ordering more image comics.

181
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,260
Speaker 0: I mean, fucking saga, right?

182
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,978
Speaker 0: That's fucking image.

183
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,040
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

184
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,440
Speaker 1: I need to read the next trade of saga.

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,277
Speaker 0: I read it.

186
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,319
Speaker 0: I have not yet.

187
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:02,734
Speaker 0: I own it.

188
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,167
Speaker 0: I need to borrow.

189
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,079
Speaker 0: that lives up to the hype.

190
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:07,318
Speaker 1: Of course it does.

191
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:08,599
Speaker 0: It's no joke.

192
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:18,819
Speaker 1: I can see in my Twitter feed as the issues come out, because it's good enough to where a lot of people I know who otherwise are trades only end up getting issues anyway.

193
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,560
Speaker 0: You can pay for these digital issues every freaking month.

194
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,500
Speaker 1: No, I'm just going to read the trades that you buy.

195
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,740
Speaker 1: See, I don't pirate anything.

196
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,940
Speaker 1: I just borrow your comics.

197
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,738
Speaker 0: That's a good deal.

198
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,955
Speaker 1: Scott's library is open for business, but yeah, that Sailor Moon interview did not happen yet.

199
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:37,336
Speaker 1: Oh, it will be available on August 1st.

200
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,508
Speaker 0: Mm.

201
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Speaker 0: Interesting.

202
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:40,860
Speaker 0: Did the interview happen?

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
Speaker 0: Is it not published or the interview didn't happen?

204
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,479
Speaker 1: It's going to be published in a women's fashion magazine, Rolla.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Speaker 0: Interesting.

206
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:48,793
Speaker 0: Yeah.

207
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,840
Speaker 0: All right.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,599
Speaker 0: Maybe she's working on some Sailor Moon fashions.

209
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,880
Speaker 0: Uh, so yeah, image is now making DRM free comics.

210
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:08,620
Speaker 0: So if you're into the digital comics like, uh, I'm not, and you're willing to pay the cover price or slightly less than government price for old stuff, then you don't want to pirate you because image comics are probably easily parable.

211
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:13,520
Speaker 0: You can go to image comics is official website and buy DRM free comics.

212
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,257
Speaker 0: This is a big deal.

213
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:22,157
Speaker 0: Uh, hopefully like the whole comics industry can sort of do stuff like this and really put the pressure on Marvel and DC to get one.

214
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:33,860
Speaker 1: Because if the, even if, if the prices don't change just as long as it's all available digital for at least no more than the physical copy, I think that'll cause a big seismic shift culturally.

215
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,040
Speaker 0: I think really what they need to do is it's good to sell it on their website.

216
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:40,740
Speaker 0: Obviously that's good for them because they get all the money from sales, right?

217
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Speaker 0: But what they should also do is if it's DRM free, it's like also sell it on Amazon.

218
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,340
Speaker 0: Also sell it on Apple.

219
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:57,899
Speaker 1: All here's the trouble for the business model where they have, instead of having 4,000 people reading a comic, they have 1000 people who buy each of the four alternate covers.

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,542
Speaker 1: Hmm.

221
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:14,400
Speaker 0: So it'll actually cut down on their, I mean, if there's digital copies, the nerds, but they save money, I'm not paying to print the paper, even though that isn't a good, the significant cost, the significant cost is paying artists to make the comics, right?

222
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:25,039
Speaker 1: So what they should do is sell it digitally for price X and then only print like 500 copies or a hundred copies of each alternate cover and sell those for like 40 bucks.

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,438
Speaker 0: Here's what they should do.

224
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,620
Speaker 1: So double down on that.

225
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,515
Speaker 0: Here's what they should do.

226
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,019
Speaker 0: Image comics should just be like, look, you pay us 25 bucks a month or a hundred a year, some price like that.

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,660
Speaker 0: The kind of prices that make you go, Ooh, right with the small annual fee like flicker or the small monthly fee like Spotify or something.

228
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:46,559
Speaker 0: And you just fricking get every image comic, no matter what.

229
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:54,119
Speaker 0: And as they just had to, then they just had to make enough image comics that are good enough to get you to do that.

230
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:03,820
Speaker 1: There is a trouble with that model that from everything I've read, Spotify basically pays out rounding down to zero to pretty much everyone.

231
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:07,620
Speaker 0: Let's talk about that a little bit before we get off, you know, even though it's a tangent.

232
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:13,040
Speaker 1: I mean, they were getting back into an issue that has not had new discussions since 1994.

233
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,151
Speaker 1: Right.

234
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:13,780
Speaker 0: It is true.

235
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,779
Speaker 0: But there was one point someone made recently that I did not think of.

236
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:17,280
Speaker 0: Right.

237
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:19,709
Speaker 0: And they were talking about how Pandora basically pays.

238
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,711
Speaker 0: almost some guy, I think he's a songwriter was like, I get basically get nothing when my song is played on Pandora, but it's a huge hit.

239
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,700
Speaker 0: It's been played millions of times and I got almost nothing.

240
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,080
Speaker 0: I'm curious if you're going to say what I was about to say probably, but basically number one is that Pandora actually paid out a lot more than what he got.

241
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,660
Speaker 0: All these other people took a cut, right?

242
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,400
Speaker 0: The record company, the other people who played the music, the et cetera, et cetera.

243
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:41,696
Speaker 0: Right.

244
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:55,040
Speaker 0: But the real reason, uh, is that he didn't get as much money as say a play on the radio is that he was, these people were comparing the one radio play to the one Spotify play or the one Pandora play.

245
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,540
Speaker 0: It's like one Pandora play is heard by one person.

246
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,439
Speaker 0: One radio play is heard by more than one person.

247
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,720
Speaker 1: One radio play is heard by one old person.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,196
Speaker 0: I know.

249
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,930
Speaker 0: I'm just saying theoretically.

250
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,480
Speaker 0: more than one person hears the one radio play.

251
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:18,960
Speaker 0: So a one radio play is worth multiple times as much money as a Spotify play, which is one person playing the song one time, which really has almost no value.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,721
Speaker 0: If you consider that paying a dollar to iTunes for a song is infinite plays of a song, what is?

253
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:29,360
Speaker 0: one play of the song costs almost nothing, right?

254
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,053
Speaker 0: Even at the $1 overpriced iTunes price.

255
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,840
Speaker 0: So they're actually getting pretty good money from a Spotify iTunes.

256
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,720
Speaker 0: So what is one read of a comic worth to what?

257
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,054
Speaker 0: Right.

258
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,660
Speaker 0: Not much, you know, definitely not $4 that they charge at the comic book store.

259
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,233
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

260
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:46,618
Speaker 0: Dollar at most.

261
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,473
Speaker 1: Yeah.

262
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:55,077
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it depends that the more niche your comic is, the fewer people are interested in it, but it doesn't really get cheaper to make it.

263
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 0: Hey, listen.

264
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

265
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:58,379
Speaker 0: It's the world we live in.

266
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,960
Speaker 1: Deal with it.

267
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,699
Speaker 1: This is the hand we're given.

268
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:09,440
Speaker 0: I think, you know, Image could also companies, these comic companies could also do much better to drop a lot of the shitty fucking comics.

269
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 0: Like what good comics does Image have?

270
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,537
Speaker 0: Walking Dead and Chew and Saga.

271
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:16,939
Speaker 0: What else they got?

272
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,037
Speaker 0: Right.

273
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,218
Speaker 0: It's like, why are you even publishing all that garbage?

274
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, give new stuff a shot.

275
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,220
Speaker 0: But if it doesn't work, it's like, yeah, you got five issues.

276
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:24,917
Speaker 0: Then you're out of here.

277
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,418
Speaker 0: If it's not as big as Mouse Guard, fuck it.

278
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,909
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

279
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:44,707
Speaker 1: So Collectivet is a, appears to be a Norwegian comedy group, and they do funny songs and other things.

280
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,589
Speaker 1: And Emily found this for me.

281
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,090
Speaker 1: They have this funny song, it's in English, where they go through the idea that bigger is better and size matters.

282
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,468
Speaker 0: So the United States- Making fun of the big fat US.

283
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,330
Speaker 1: So the United States wins at everything.

284
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,030
Speaker 1: We have the biggest amusement parks, the biggest people, aka they're fat.

285
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,750
Speaker 0: They're like- Biggest cars.

286
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,670
Speaker 1: You're so fat, you're so big, you're dying of it.

287
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,628
Speaker 1: We can't compete with that.

288
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,449
Speaker 0: Biggest hats.

289
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,450
Speaker 1: But they point out the one area where Norway wins.

290
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,747
Speaker 1: They have a bigger alphabet than we do because they've got the I-O-O.

291
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:24,369
Speaker 1: The A-E that are stuck together, the O with the line through it, and the A with a funny little circle on top.

292
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,549
Speaker 0: They don't have anything with two dots on it?

293
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,589
Speaker 1: Well, those are accents as opposed to letters.

294
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,310
Speaker 0: Okay.

295
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:45,610
Speaker 1: There's a difference between a letter that has an accent like an E with an accente gear, or accent circumflex, or accent grave, or a C-C-D, and an actually different letter, even though that is an entirely arbitrary distinction.

296
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,309
Speaker 1: Their alphabet has I-O-O in it.

297
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:49,706
Speaker 0: Where do they put the I-O-O?

298
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,509
Speaker 0: Is it A-I-O-O?

299
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,829
Speaker 1: I'm going to find out right now.

300
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,729
Speaker 1: Google Images.

301
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,387
Speaker 0: How do they sing the alphabet song?

302
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,849
Speaker 1: I'm going to find out, Norway.

303
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,289
Speaker 0: While you do that, I'm going to do my thing of the day.

304
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:06,147
Speaker 0: So, when I was a baby, as in zero, in the womb of my mom.

305
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,164
Speaker 1: In Queens.

306
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:08,785
Speaker 0: In, yeah.

307
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:13,049
Speaker 0: She would be sitting around, all pregnant and shit, and what would she do?

308
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,872
Speaker 1: Play the Atari 2600.

309
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:15,021
Speaker 0: With?

310
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,229
Speaker 0: What game?

311
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,230
Speaker 0: What was my mom's favorite game?

312
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:18,930
Speaker 0: Super Breakout.

313
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,430
Speaker 0: Super Breakout was my mom's game.

314
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,770
Speaker 0: She still loves that fucking game.

315
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,390
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny because my mom has the same story.

316
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,410
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why- But your mom didn't play Super Breakout.

317
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,049
Speaker 0: She played other games.

318
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,970
Speaker 1: She played regular Breakout, she liked it more, and a bunch of other games, but did your mom do the same thing?

319
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:38,769
Speaker 1: When my mom was super pregnant, it was hard to lean over and hit the reset button, so she liked the 2600 because she'd reach over with her toe and tap the reset button.

320
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,224
Speaker 0: I don't know.

321
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:39,866
Speaker 0: Ask her.

322
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,608
Speaker 0: Anyway, she played on a tiny black and white TV.

323
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,950
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, Super Breakout.

324
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,590
Speaker 0: So, I played Super Breakout since before I was born.

325
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,429
Speaker 0: That's how good I am.

326
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,501
Speaker 0: So, you think, I've seen pretty much every Breakout.

327
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,249
Speaker 0: there's been for as long as Breakouts existed.

328
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:55,228
Speaker 0: There has not been a Breakout that has escaped me.

329
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,130
Speaker 0: Here is one that was totally new and amazing.

330
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:06,189
Speaker 0: This is Brick Smash, Brick Smash, Brick, Brick Smash, Brick, whatever, by Alan Hazelden, the creator of this.

331
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,190
Speaker 0: My hat is off to you.

332
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,670
Speaker 0: It's a tiny flash game, and basically you play Breakout, and in each of the bricks and the Breakout, there is another game of Breakout.

333
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,730
Speaker 0: It is Brickception.

334
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:16,849
Speaker 0: It's incredible.

335
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,129
Speaker 0: Yo, dawg, Breakout.

336
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,230
Speaker 0: You have to play this.

337
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,189
Speaker 0: I won on my first try.

338
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,269
Speaker 0: Rym did, and I'm better than Rym.

339
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:26,148
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you look for the Norwegian alphabet song, you just keep finding this comedy video that I'm linking to.

340
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,629
Speaker 1: But their alphabet, a, u, o, are in order at the end.

341
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,010
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's just z, a, u, o. Okay.

342
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,589
Speaker 1: So, they just added them at the end there.

343
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:37,463
Speaker 1: They also have accents.

344
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,430
Speaker 1: They have an accent, a, u, the up line, the down line, the hat.

345
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,090
Speaker 1: That's it.

346
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:45,869
Speaker 0: Do they have the two dots?

347
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,218
Speaker 1: No.

348
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,750
Speaker 1: They do not have the two dots.

349
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,589
Speaker 0: You gotta have the two dots.

350
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:48,998
Speaker 1: Why?

351
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,200
Speaker 1: Why?

352
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,189
Speaker 1: What are the good of the two dots?

353
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,766
Speaker 1: Do you even know what the two dots do?

354
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:08,750
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, the book club book is Stasi-land, true narrative stories of the bullshit people went through living in East Germany under the Stasi during the Cold War.

355
00:19:09,772 --> 00:19:12,190
Speaker 1: It's kind of relevant with all the NSA stuff going on.

356
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,650
Speaker 0: The next book club book is going to be Gideon's Bible.

357
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:22,149
Speaker 1: Then the next book club book is going to be Ulysses or Norwich's history of the Byzantine empire.

358
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,930
Speaker 0: And the one after that will be Dead Sea Scrolls, the real edition.

359
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,220
Speaker 1: I'm going with Webster's.

360
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:31,330
Speaker 0: Okay.

361
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,530
Speaker 1: No, the OED because it's longer.

362
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,650
Speaker 0: The complete works of Dostoevsky in Russian.

363
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,990
Speaker 1: The first story, once it gets past kind of the intro, is pretty good.

364
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:51,990
Speaker 1: And it's about this 16 year old girl who actually tried to go over the wall because she got arrested and held in solitary confinement and was tortured.

365
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,010
Speaker 0: How was that barbed wire?

366
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,288
Speaker 1: She got over the barbed wire okay.

367
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:55,910
Speaker 0: Nice.

368
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,148
Speaker 1: She got past the dogs too.

369
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:57,665
Speaker 0: Nice.

370
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:08,950
Speaker 1: And the Stasi, it's interesting because people have this impression in the West that the Stasi were this like almost Nazi-esque level of control.

371
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:10,408
Speaker 1: And that's kind of true.

372
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:20,190
Speaker 1: But at the same time, a lot of what they would do was so utterly and patently ridiculous, but yet they would do it seriously and with a straight face.

373
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:26,010
Speaker 1: It's a weird part of world history that I don't think enough people know about.

374
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,848
Speaker 1: And the more I'm reading this book, the weirder it is.

375
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:34,210
Speaker 0: Yet another group that had really great fashion sense that you can't use anymore.

376
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:34,806
Speaker 1: The Nazis.

377
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,106
Speaker 0: And the Stasi.

378
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:36,908
Speaker 0: The Stasi too.

379
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,369
Speaker 0: They had those awesome leather coats with the...

380
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:40,183
Speaker 1: There's something about that sharp look.

381
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,449
Speaker 1: Why can't we have scientific fascism?

382
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:46,309
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

383
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,004
Speaker 1: I don't know.

384
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:53,269
Speaker 1: All the trappings of fascism, but with the goal of making awesome science, making everything great for everyone.

385
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:58,970
Speaker 0: So we can wear evil looking coats, but they have no swastikas or anything on them.

386
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:00,370
Speaker 0: People know that we're good.

387
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,110
Speaker 0: We just really like, we just respect good fashion.

388
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,669
Speaker 0: We should call it.

389
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:10,950
Speaker 0: And then we're going to call ourselves the grand dragons and be like, look, we fucking hate the KKK, those assholes, but they took all the good names.

390
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:11,809
Speaker 0: We're going to be there.

391
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,588
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't work.

392
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:13,849
Speaker 0: We can't take it back.

393
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:17,250
Speaker 0: The fashion and the names, I've let them go long ago.

394
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:20,608
Speaker 0: I just like to complain about it every once in a while, but I've given up.

395
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:26,989
Speaker 0: There is no way to take those awesome fashions or awesome names back without bringing also the evil.

396
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,429
Speaker 1: I mean, even the Charlie Chaplin mustache has been destroyed by all this.

397
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,130
Speaker 0: Anyway.

398
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,401
Speaker 0: Other metas.

399
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,230
Speaker 1: Kineticon.

400
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,530
Speaker 0: It's like fucking tomorrow.

401
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:36,860
Speaker 0: Next.

402
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:37,870
Speaker 1: God damn.

403
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,229
Speaker 1: Well, the schedule of the panels that we are running ourselves, I don't even know what those are.

404
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:44,810
Speaker 1: I got to go look them up because I forget.

405
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:45,626
Speaker 0: Great.

406
00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:46,589
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

407
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,670
Speaker 1: Kineticon is going to be awesome.

408
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,450
Speaker 1: And then Scott and I are immediately flying to Australia to present beyond judges and dragons in the Wombat theater.

409
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:51,851
Speaker 1: 1 p.m.

410
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:56,530
Speaker 1: on Friday in Melbourne, Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.

411
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,790
Speaker 0: Just if you want to pronounce Melbourne correctly, Melbourne, imagine it's M E L B I N. Melbourne.

412
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,770
Speaker 1: Forget that R. Forget the O U. Melbourne.

413
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:07,510
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,149
Speaker 0: Melbourne.

415
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,608
Speaker 0: Anyway.

416
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,077
Speaker 0: Yeah.

417
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,289
Speaker 1: Um, we got to plan the rest of this trip.

418
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fine.

419
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,889
Speaker 1: So far.

420
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,650
Speaker 1: I've not planned beyond, beyond dungeons and dragons.

421
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,323
Speaker 0: Okay.

422
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:24,208
Speaker 0: You know, if we just get there and ask natives, like what's the awesomest thing, you know, we'll end up doing the good stuff.

423
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,430
Speaker 1: What a plan ahead a little bit.

424
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,790
Speaker 1: I kind of want to do those go-karts.

425
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,348
Speaker 1: I got to trick someone in Melbourne.

426
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,167
Speaker 0: Uh, organizing it.

427
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:31,669
Speaker 1: To organize it.

428
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,769
Speaker 0: So we needed to show other people to do it.

429
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,609
Speaker 0: We can't just make it happen on our own.

430
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,930
Speaker 1: We can do it Sunday after packs.

431
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,509
Speaker 1: I think we could get enough people from packs.

432
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:51,590
Speaker 1: Maybe our first packs in the U S. we trivially formed what can only be described as a mob by snapping our fingers and saying, moonblazing, burning whale, signed up in advance and shit.

433
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:52,524
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll figure it out.

434
00:22:53,431 --> 00:23:05,770
Speaker 0: Um, any other meta moments you should, while we're away and we're not going to be making a lot of stuff for you, pretty much the rest of July after next week or so is going to be like nothing, uh, in terms of geek nights.

435
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:18,807
Speaker 0: So you're going to want to go to our YouTubes and other such and follow us on the internet and the Twitters and all those places, because that's the only place is going to be content because that's the only place we can post things while we're on the go, like Lord of the rings on the go.

436
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:24,430
Speaker 0: So you're going to watch our flicker, see some photos from Australia and kinetic con and all that kind of stuff.

437
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,458
Speaker 0: So make sure you follow geek nights and me and rim at all the internet places, the Google pluses, the Facebooks, not only that.

438
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,810
Speaker 1: you want us to do geek nights, presents you 10 faster.

439
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,650
Speaker 1: You want us to ever make another radio for Equestria.

440
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:41,390
Speaker 1: You want the four other, well, I guess five other lectures, man in Boston, rerecorded.

441
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,118
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm taking my sweet ass time.

442
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:49,189
Speaker 1: unless you guys do what you did with our, uh, judge anime by its cover and get the views up.

443
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:53,009
Speaker 0: If you get like three or four videos up, so now you have to do another one.

444
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:53,390
Speaker 0: Yeah.

445
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,430
Speaker 1: Get more views up the more views up, look, they put the views up and what happened?

446
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:00,030
Speaker 1: I almost immediately released on other geek nights presents.

447
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:03,390
Speaker 1: In fact, I ordered new lights that we're going to use right after packs.

448
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:03,864
Speaker 1: Awesome.

449
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:04,422
Speaker 1: Ooh.

450
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:05,018
Speaker 0: Ooh.

451
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:05,705
Speaker 1: Yes.

452
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:07,530
Speaker 0: All right.

453
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,010
Speaker 0: So meta moments over.

454
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,650
Speaker 0: It is time for the episode.

455
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:26,750
Speaker 1: So I realized we realized we were talking about anime and we, we kind of, there's that, there's a certain kind of character that everybody loves and whenever there's a show that has a character like that, it's always the like unstated, obviously the best character.

456
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:27,389
Speaker 0: Yup.

457
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,130
Speaker 1: But in this particular way, it's the Hughes in the full metal alchemist.

458
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:37,670
Speaker 0: Usually this character is usually a dude, but not always usually old, but not always.

459
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:44,850
Speaker 1: I think already there's a distinct separation of two kinds of the anime bad-ass kind.

460
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,530
Speaker 1: Number one, the old master, the old invincible sensei, right?

461
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:55,970
Speaker 0: It's like the main character, you know, is leveling up in an anime, getting more powerful.

462
00:24:56,098 --> 00:24:56,310
Speaker 0: Right.

463
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:58,150
Speaker 0: But how can the main character learn anything?

464
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,749
Speaker 0: If they're the most powerful, there is someone who is so ridiculously powerful, but doesn't use it.

465
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:11,730
Speaker 0: Just like in the Simpsons episode, the guy in the white suit who stands still and doesn't do anything when he does something, holy crap, it's going to be the best, right?

466
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:16,670
Speaker 0: For example, in Kill Bill 2, Pi Mei is the bad-ass, right?

467
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,150
Speaker 0: You know, he's so much stronger than everyone else, but he just started chills out and doesn't use his full power.

468
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:26,488
Speaker 0: That's the guy, you know, in Initial D, crazy Bunta, right?

469
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,888
Speaker 0: He's not in the races.

470
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:35,289
Speaker 0: You just know he could win every race with like his eyes closed because he's that much better, but he stays in the sidelines and watches.

471
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:35,623
Speaker 1: Yup.

472
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:46,189
Speaker 1: Now these guys, we were trying to think of all the examples of that kind of guy and they're all really, really similar, at least in a superficial two minute conversation.

473
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:51,367
Speaker 1: because the first people we thought of, let's see if there's Bunta, there's Aramaki in Ghost in the Shell.

474
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,929
Speaker 1: Who's, especially now we're going to see him younger with brown hair, like it's not fully clowned out yet, not Wilead all the way.

475
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:10,185
Speaker 1: There's Fujisawa Sensei in El Hazard and notice how they all will often have sort of a smoking or drinking or some sort of like thing.

476
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:10,930
Speaker 1: that's up with them.

477
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:16,608
Speaker 1: Like they're not 100% the best people or they have some sort of flaw or past.

478
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,949
Speaker 1: that's dark, but that's not the story.

479
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:23,290
Speaker 0: Who's the guy in Naruto who's always reading, the teacher who's reading the porn magazines all the time.

480
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,150
Speaker 0: I always forget his name.

481
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,486
Speaker 1: Forget his name too because Naruto stopped being good after 3.5 episodes.

482
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,310
Speaker 0: Let me look at list of Naruto characters on the Internet.

483
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:42,530
Speaker 1: Plus I don't think he is the invincible sensei anymore, but he did serve that purpose in that part of the show, though he was too young to hold it off in the long run.

484
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,610
Speaker 0: I think it's Kakashi.

485
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,440
Speaker 1: Yup.

486
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,366
Speaker 1: That's definitely him.

487
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:51,726
Speaker 1: Wow, all the young anime fans listening to Geek Nights are like, "How do you not

488
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:52,007
Speaker 1: know?"

489
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:53,447
Speaker 1: Right?

490
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,930
Speaker 0: In one piece, it's Red Shanks, right?

491
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,589
Speaker 0: Red Shanks, the guy you hardly ever see.

492
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:58,962
Speaker 0: Yup.

493
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,569
Speaker 1: Because he's in the beginning, he's the badass, loses his arm.

494
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,255
Speaker 0: Yup.

495
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,363
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

496
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:21,790
Speaker 1: But then there's the other kind of badass, the young, not invincible guy, who is the badass and seems to often get killed in a pivotal plot point because they're not the main character, they're not a villain, but they're the badass that makes the impossible possible.

497
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,323
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

498
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:30,209
Speaker 1: The Moolaflaga, the Hughes, the Fokker, in fact, I think all three of them serve basically the same purpose in their three respective shows.

499
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:40,450
Speaker 0: But even those guys are sort of like incredibly powerful, older than main character, sensei-ish mentor figures, right?

500
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:45,010
Speaker 0: They just sort of are more active than, say, a bunta on the sidelines.

501
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:53,530
Speaker 1: Well, I think with them, it's really that they're the characters that the show starts and they're already way leveled up and almost no one else around them is.

502
00:27:53,871 --> 00:28:00,490
Speaker 1: They're the only ones who can pull shit off, they're the only competent ones, they're the only cool ones, and they're not on screen that often.

503
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,927
Speaker 1: I think that's the key.

504
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,888
Speaker 1: It's the same thing with King Cosma in Summer Wars.

505
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,598
Speaker 1: It's the character where people watch a show and they think back and it's like, "Who's your favorite

506
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:11,007
Speaker 1: character?"

507
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:13,088
Speaker 1: With 90% of people like King Cosma.

508
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:13,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, duh.

509
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,329
Speaker 1: Mula Flaga, Hughes.

510
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:16,210
Speaker 0: Yep.

511
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's someone that is showing you what the future can be like, right?

512
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,507
Speaker 0: Like, you play Mega Man X and at the beginning of Mega Man X, it's just like this equalitis video.

513
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,570
Speaker 0: Mega Man X is kind of weak ass, he just woke up from his friggin' stasis, whatever, but you know what?

514
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,407
Speaker 0: Zero's out there.

515
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:39,910
Speaker 0: Total badass, already leveled up, and then it's eventually you get the main guy, Mega Man X, eventually is better than Zero, but not right away.

516
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,990
Speaker 0: It's showing you the future, right?

517
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,401
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh yeah, Mula Flaga at the beginning is, yeah, the competent pilot, and you know what?

518
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,850
Speaker 0: These kids are just some fucking kids at the beginning of Gundam Seed.

519
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,030
Speaker 0: You know at the end of Gundam Seed?

520
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:04,946
Speaker 0: Those kids are now the really powerful people, and Mula Flaga's still pretty good, but basically they leveled up to his level, but he was so high level, he really only gained one level over the show because he needs so much XP to get one

521
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:05,168
Speaker 0: more.".

522
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:10,150
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone ever gets better than Punta.

523
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:11,829
Speaker 0: I don't think ever, no.

524
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,989
Speaker 0: I haven't read enough Initial D, but I don't think so.

525
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,170
Speaker 0: I think Punta pretty much stays at the most powerful.

526
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,490
Speaker 1: So why do we like these characters?

527
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,370
Speaker 1: Why do they stand out so much to us in particular?

528
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,130
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's universal that other people think about this or are obsessed with these characters.

529
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,168
Speaker 1: It might just be us.

530
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:36,250
Speaker 1: I mean, when normal people talk about Ghost in the Shell, they're like, "Oh, the major, the best," or "Bato, hey," but we're just always Aromaki.

531
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:37,868
Speaker 1: Is it because we're getting old?

532
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,790
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I don't dislike those other characters.

533
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:46,708
Speaker 0: In fact, I think I like Togusa the most in Ghost in the Shell, but Aromaki is still the baddest ass.

534
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,230
Speaker 0: You know, Togus is not exactly a bad ass, he's just sort of, you know, cool, whatever.

535
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,610
Speaker 0: But yeah, why do we like these bad ass characters?

536
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,244
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's because number one, right?

537
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:04,532
Speaker 0: These characters are super powerful, but they're not super powerful in like an evil boss kind of way.

538
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:10,222
Speaker 0: or we're just going to make the show boring and use my superpowers to end the conflicts kind of way, right?

539
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:23,910
Speaker 0: Is they're super powerful in sort of a funny way and it sort of creates this contrast of, you know, like you want to see them in action so bad, like this hidden mystery power.

540
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:35,710
Speaker 1: Well, like Fujisawa, when he learns his kick and his punch and he's just, he's such a bad ass, but he's also such a moron at times, but he's not a complete moron.

541
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:43,010
Speaker 1: But yet, this is distinct from Captain Tyler, let's say, where he is the plot, he is the main character.

542
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,350
Speaker 1: It always feels like cheating where your favorite character is the main character.

543
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:52,868
Speaker 1: I mean, if your favorite character in Hooka Nona Ken is Ken Shiro, that feels really obvious or cheap.

544
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,449
Speaker 0: Yep.

545
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,189
Speaker 0: It's okay.

546
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:58,528
Speaker 1: And I think there's a lot of anime fans, because I know a bunch of people we knew at RIT would do this.

547
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,930
Speaker 1: They kind of like to like the obscure character that no one else likes.

548
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:12,190
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing is in animes in particular, and a lot of stories, main characters have to be appealing to everybody, to a wide audience.

549
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,545
Speaker 0: So they're very generic, they're not, you know, the kind of thing that would appeal to only one person.

550
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:24,710
Speaker 0: So like in a harem show, right, let's say it's a girl harem, there's one girl and a whole bunch of dudes in this harem, it's a dude harem, whatever you want to call it.

551
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,809
Speaker 0: But a lot of dudes, one girl.

552
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:33,509
Speaker 0: That girl isn't going to have a lot of character to her usually, it's going to be someone that every girl can identify with in some way.

553
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:38,570
Speaker 0: And then all it's sort of like a harem combined and merged into one person.

554
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:59,570
Speaker 0: Whereas the harem itself is a bunch of separate individuals that are all really specific and everyone's going to like one of them or maybe two of them, right, that are going to be sort of the ones, you know, and then there might be one in the harem that has a wider appeal than that's the one that you're actually going to get together with in the story at some point, right?

555
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,290
Speaker 1: I think there's some characters that sort of fall between, like they're not like they serve that purpose in the beginning, but don't later.

556
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:19,769
Speaker 1: Like Toga in Utena actually, in the beginning of the show, he seems like the only one who's got it together and he knows more, he's secret, he's mysterious, he's badass, but then you learn about other people who know way more.

557
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:38,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, that's an interesting, that's what makes Utena really good, but it's also something that, you know, where they made a use out of that character instead of just having them there to be a character that people like to set a contrast, to help the main character by giving them advice and stuff like that.

558
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:43,710
Speaker 0: They actually brought them into the plot and made a use out of them without them overpowering everything.

559
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,450
Speaker 0: Right.

560
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,690
Speaker 0: And in Toga's case, it's like, yeah, he wasn't as bad as you thought, right?

561
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:55,190
Speaker 0: Bunta, if they would have brought Bunta into things, you know, and made him race or something, it's like, well, that sort of ruins everything, right?

562
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,270
Speaker 0: Because he can't lose, you know, there's not going to be any drama there if that happens, right?

563
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,190
Speaker 0: They would have had to bring Bunta down to give you doubt about Bunta's power.

564
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,190
Speaker 0: And you can't do that, that every, every race, it's the key, he's not going to win this time.

565
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:09,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

566
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:16,409
Speaker 0: The other ability, the other possibility to bring everyone else up to Bunta's level, which is like, hell no, that's not going to happen.

567
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,209
Speaker 0: That's Dragon Ball.

568
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,329
Speaker 0: Maybe you can have Bunta versus Michael Schumacher.

569
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,296
Speaker 1: That might work.

570
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:25,644
Speaker 0: But otherwise, no, you know, but it's like some animes.

571
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:27,350
Speaker 0: it's or mangas.

572
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,650
Speaker 0: It's hard to figure out.

573
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:30,078
Speaker 0: Is there such a character?

574
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,390
Speaker 1: or most shows do not have these characters.

575
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:43,110
Speaker 1: I've realized as an aside, I was looking for just like a giant list of anime that were popular like top hundred list to scroll through just to kind of remind myself of, oh yeah.

576
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,128
Speaker 1: And that show, there was that guy.

577
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:51,769
Speaker 1: So my only point is this pretty much every top X anime list on the internet is ridiculously bullshit.

578
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:52,669
Speaker 0: No credit.

579
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,330
Speaker 1: Here's, here's one that's actually pretty popular.

580
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,090
Speaker 1: Fullmetal Alchemist is number two of all time.

581
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,750
Speaker 1: Alpha leaves.

582
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,504
Speaker 1: Number six.

583
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,094
Speaker 1: Whoa.

584
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:00,745
Speaker 1: What?

585
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,730
Speaker 1: Cowboy Bebop's number five.

586
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,782
Speaker 0: Why is it not number one?

587
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,409
Speaker 1: I was 37, but Naruto's at 35.

588
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,790
Speaker 0: So copy of up and I was among the two great shows that do not have such a character.

589
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,389
Speaker 1: Most shows don't have these characters.

590
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,989
Speaker 1: Escaflowne almost had one, Alan Chazar, but he's basically a toga.

591
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:18,730
Speaker 0: He's not yet.

592
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,389
Speaker 0: He's not strong enough to be that guy.

593
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:25,849
Speaker 0: The main character is actually the most powerful in that show and doesn't really have mentor action going on.

594
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,429
Speaker 1: You don't have the awesome side character except for you have the old instructor in the beginning, but he dies.

595
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,268
Speaker 0: He's not, he's not an awesome, whatever.

596
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:39,310
Speaker 0: And even jelly and you can have someone, what's his name?

597
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:40,589
Speaker 0: Kaji.

598
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:44,130
Speaker 1: He's sort of the, well, Kaji is the Hughes.

599
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:45,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

600
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:45,578
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,708
Speaker 1: Again, look at the pattern.

602
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:56,449
Speaker 1: The characters that are the younger stereotype of the bad-ass or at least the favorite side character or all the certain way.

603
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,789
Speaker 1: And then the old ones are another certain way that, but there isn't an old one in Evangelion.

604
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,527
Speaker 1: There's just the Hughes.

605
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:07,510
Speaker 0: Well, like in star Wars, it's Yoda or Boba Fett or both of us.

606
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,147
Speaker 0: The bad one.

607
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:08,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,908
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know, we said it had to be on the good guy side.

609
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,829
Speaker 1: Is that really true?

610
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:20,470
Speaker 1: Because star Wars, maybe this explains this thing we're talking about why Boba Fett appears briefly in star Wars.

611
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:23,929
Speaker 1: He is barely part of star Wars at all.

612
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,490
Speaker 1: And yet when I was a kid and I saw star Wars for the first time, my friends all saw star Wars.

613
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,594
Speaker 1: Boba Fett was all.

614
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:34,809
Speaker 1: anyone could fucking talk about Boba Fett, but everyone was obsessed with Boba Fett.

615
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,208
Speaker 1: No matter how sure I am, I never risked the Fett.

616
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,889
Speaker 0: Boba Fett never risked the Fett man.

617
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,090
Speaker 1: So I think it's the same thing.

618
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,210
Speaker 1: There's something about that secondary badass character.

619
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:53,950
Speaker 1: And if I had to guess psychologically, I think it really just comes down to the mystery that you don't know their full deal.

620
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:59,330
Speaker 1: So you can kind of fill in way more than you can with even a main character.

621
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:06,910
Speaker 1: Cause even in a harem show, a main character has some kind of plot and there's some sort of framework, but Boba Fett, you look at both and you're like, what's that guy's deal?

622
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:11,269
Speaker 1: I don't know, but he's a bad ass and you don't see him lose until you see him lose.

623
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:19,770
Speaker 0: I think, Oh, you know who has another perfect example of this character in Hajime no Ippo, right?

624
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,689
Speaker 0: There's a what's his name?

625
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,310
Speaker 1: Oh, the fricking, uh, I have not seen a lot of that show.

626
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,329
Speaker 0: Takamura who's basically like the, the world champion guy.

627
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:33,930
Speaker 0: He's just incredibly, ridiculously powerful.

628
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:36,089
Speaker 0: He punches the bear.

629
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:37,870
Speaker 1: Oh, the bear punching guy.

630
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:38,703
Speaker 1: I know who that is.

631
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,719
Speaker 0: He's basically, that is like the perfect example of ridiculously powerful, you know, best character guy.

632
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:53,065
Speaker 0: You know, he's sort of a mix between Bunta and, um, from sanctuary, Mr.

633
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,670
Speaker 0: Um, Tokai, yes.

634
00:36:57,294 --> 00:36:59,049
Speaker 0: Sort of a combination of those two.

635
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:04,730
Speaker 1: Sanctuary is a problem because everyone is that guy.

636
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:07,850
Speaker 1: If you ignore the main characters, everyone is that guy.

637
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,329
Speaker 1: And the main characters are just better than them.

638
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,310
Speaker 1: The end, the good guys are that way.

639
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,709
Speaker 1: The bad guys are that way.

640
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,349
Speaker 1: Every character is that way.

641
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:25,094
Speaker 1: Every side character is that way, except for background, normal people, maybe that's why I like sanctuary so much.

642
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:28,770
Speaker 1: sanctuary is just nothing but Boba Fett.

643
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,889
Speaker 0: It's written by the same.

644
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,910
Speaker 1: It's Boba Fett and Boba Fett fighting against Boba Fett.

645
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:34,667
Speaker 1: That's what that manga is.

646
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,850
Speaker 0: I mean, it's written by the same guys who wrote Fist of the North Star, right?

647
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,450
Speaker 0: Which has the same situation where everyone is a total badass.

648
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,749
Speaker 1: It's all about Bronson.

649
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,650
Speaker 0: That's right.

650
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,088
Speaker 0: Okay.

651
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh, do you have anything else to say about this?

652
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,890
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going through anime that I have watched and they're not that common either.

653
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:59,047
Speaker 1: The more I really think about it, I mean, like Cowboy Bebop does not have a character like that.

654
00:37:59,333 --> 00:37:59,485
Speaker 1: Really?

655
00:37:59,770 --> 00:37:59,866
Speaker 0: Nope.

656
00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:02,189
Speaker 0: What the native American guy?

657
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:02,810
Speaker 0: Yeah.

658
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:04,110
Speaker 1: But he's not bad.

659
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,270
Speaker 0: You don't see him doing it.

660
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,730
Speaker 0: He has the sensei part, but not the badass part.

661
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

662
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:21,250
Speaker 1: There's a lot of characters that have an aspect of this, but these two kinds of badasses, there's the young badass who makes the impossible possible and probably dies and you feel really bad because they're young and invincible.

663
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,290
Speaker 1: And then there's the old invincible.

664
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:24,730
Speaker 0: Yep.

665
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,225
Speaker 0: Madoka doesn't really have such a character at all.

666
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:38,629
Speaker 1: You could argue almost that a Homer follows that purpose of the consummate badass, but the show is partially, the show is too good.

667
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:45,309
Speaker 1: And also does notice how the best shows don't have characters that fall perfectly into all these stereotypes.

668
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,450
Speaker 1: Madoka has the trappings.

669
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,974
Speaker 0: This is a character that you see in the formulaic, you know, the, the anime formulas, the quality stand out.

670
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:56,750
Speaker 1: anime is a formulaic show.

671
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:02,988
Speaker 1: And in El Hazzard, there is Fujisawa, who is that kind of character that we're talking about.

672
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,469
Speaker 1: Madoka is too complex.

673
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:10,170
Speaker 1: It has all the trappings of a formulaic show, but doesn't actually follow any of those formulas.

674
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:13,330
Speaker 1: And every character is a mold breaker in one way or another.

675
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,469
Speaker 1: Every single one of them.

676
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:15,448
Speaker 0: How about slayers?

677
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,137
Speaker 1: Slayers.

678
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,389
Speaker 0: Not really.

679
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,516
Speaker 0: I mean, you can go with the rock face dude, but not really lean is more powerful than he is.

681
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,289
Speaker 0: And he's not really a mentor or anything.

682
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,150
Speaker 1: Plus that's a show about a team of people.

683
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,748
Speaker 1: They're all basically the main characters and the enemies are way more badass than them until the end.

684
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:33,146
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:33,906
Speaker 0: What a rezo.

686
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:38,449
Speaker 1: Well, rezo is my favorite villain ever.

687
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,429
Speaker 0: You know, and Trigun doesn't have such a character though.

688
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,590
Speaker 1: Though I think Wolfwood almost fits into the stereotype of the Hughes type.

689
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,190
Speaker 0: But he's not.

690
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,550
Speaker 0: But he's not as strong.

692
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,270
Speaker 0: He doesn't have that aspect of being so super powerful more than everyone else.

693
00:39:53,290 --> 00:40:02,010
Speaker 1: He has the aspect that notice how fans seem way more invested in Wolfwood and talk about him more than they talk about Vash.

694
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:03,150
Speaker 0: Quite possibly.

695
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:03,508
Speaker 0: Yes.

696
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,670
Speaker 1: That's purely anecdotal.

697
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:05,869
Speaker 1: But that's, that's what I've seen.

698
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:09,209
Speaker 1: I mean, Monster doesn't really have anything like this.

699
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:17,905
Speaker 0: Monster is not that kind of formula, but 20th century boys does have a, what's his face, the Shogun, Ocho the Shogun.

700
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,167
Speaker 0: He's basically the badass guy.

701
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:26,728
Speaker 1: So whenever you're watching anime, just think about the characters that fit into that particular stereotype.

702
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,950
Speaker 1: The side character, the King Cosmo, that's not super important to the plot.

703
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,769
Speaker 1: They're not the main movers and shakers, but they're there.

704
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:39,470
Speaker 1: They affect things and everyone just seems to always be like, yeah, that's the best character.

705
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,009
Speaker 1: That's my favorite character.

706
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,169
Speaker 1: Everyone's always obsessed with the side character, even more so than the main character.

707
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,850
Speaker 1: And if they think that way, pretty much always Bunta, or Boba Fett.

708
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:58,400
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

709
