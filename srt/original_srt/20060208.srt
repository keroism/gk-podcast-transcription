1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,730
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, February 8th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,250
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about Ninku and Masuda Kosuke Theater, gag manga Biore.

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,089
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:33,289
Speaker 1: Man, I had a meeting today at work, and all I have to say is that it seems like most adults in this world don't know how to, uh, actually confront each other or talk about problems in an adult professional manner.

5
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,906
Speaker 0: It's because they forgot how to talk?

6
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:37,309
Speaker 0: I don't know.

7
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,517
Speaker 1: It's just, it's kind of annoying.

8
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:55,209
Speaker 1: I sat through a meeting, and I can't really get into the details, but basically, a lot of companies will have managers, like they'll have an anonymous survey where you rate how well your manager's doing, blah blah blah, and then the manager gets, like, these statistics of, well, some people say this and some people say this.

9
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:56,030
Speaker 1: Alright.

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,597
Speaker 1: And it's supposed to help teamwork and whatever.

11
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:14,502
Speaker 1: So, uh, imagine if your manager gets that, and then you have a meeting, and you gotta sit there while the manager talks about the results of the survey, and then all the people want to give their criticism to the manager without actually criticizing the managers.

12
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:23,526
Speaker 1: Everyone's kind of dancing around the issue, and everyone keeps saying things like, "Oh, well, not to speak of you specifically, but in general, blah blah blah blah blah

13
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:23,828
Speaker 1: blah.".

14
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:24,973
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,099
Speaker 1: It was just, it was painful.

16
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,750
Speaker 1: I just, I, I, oh my God.

17
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,729
Speaker 0: Why didn't you just say this and this and this and this and this?

18
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,704
Speaker 1: 'Cause I have no problems with my manager.

19
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:33,490
Speaker 1: At all.

20
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,350
Speaker 0: But why do these people have problems?

21
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:42,361
Speaker 1: Uh, honestly, the funniest thing was that the biggest complaint people seem to have in a lot of companies is that they're not appreciated.

22
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:48,369
Speaker 1: And they want, like, in these intangibles, like, someone to just tell me I did a good job or appreciate me.

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,937
Speaker 1: And that's not something I can relate to.

24
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,870
Speaker 1: Honestly, if you appreciate me, give me more money.

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,596
Speaker 1: That's all I care about.

26
00:01:55,918 --> 00:02:01,530
Speaker 1: If you'll pay me $100,000 a year to sit on my ass in an office doing nothing, I'll take the money, and I'll work on something else.

27
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:04,449
Speaker 1: But money is the only reason I'm at my job.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get plenty of money, but the thing is, it's like, sitting there all day doing nothing.

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,570
Speaker 0: It's like, sometimes I feel like, you know, I should be doing something 'cause they're paying me.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,390
Speaker 1: See, here's the way I look at it.

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,190
Speaker 0: And then, if they don't pay attention to me, it's like, why are they paying me?

32
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,508
Speaker 0: And it's not so much that I'm bothered, that, you know, I don't have to do any work, or that, you know, there isn't a whole lot of work to do.

33
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:34,030
Speaker 0: It's just like this, hmm, what are they thinking?

34
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,447
Speaker 0: It's all weird and mysterious, and it's kind of like, ooh.

35
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,990
Speaker 1: Well, see, to me, if I'm sitting, like, say I end up with a few hours with nothing to do at work at all.

36
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,215
Speaker 1: Like, absolutely nothing.

37
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:45,341
Speaker 1: For whatever reason.

38
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,110
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm waiting for someone's crap or whatever.

39
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,330
Speaker 1: I'll spend that time just learning about something.

40
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,033
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

41
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one thing.

42
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:56,417
Speaker 0: If, like, on a day of work I have a few hours with nothing to do, that's, you know, obvious.

43
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:01,350
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, I finished something, you know, but then I have to wait for something to happen, so I've got a few hours.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,589
Speaker 0: And I'd feel fine doing whatever I want during those hours, you know?

45
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:07,750
Speaker 0: But what if it's weeks and weeks and weeks and there's nothing?

46
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:19,850
Speaker 1: I had that happen a lot when I worked for RIT's IT department, because most of my job was scheduling things and then doing those things, and I had no responsibilities outside of doing those scheduled things.

47
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:26,539
Speaker 1: So I had weeks at a time where, other than a couple of appointments here and there, they were paying me to just do nothing.

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,769
Speaker 1: I just did my homework, or I slept, or...

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:41,623
Speaker 0: When it was a full-time job, you did it all day, every day, and for weeks upon weeks, no one really paid attention to you or asked you what you were doing or gave you anything to do or asked anything of you or did anything for you.

50
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:42,909
Speaker 0: You just sat there and...

51
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:55,550
Speaker 1: Honestly, if that actually happened to me and I had a job like that, I'd probably be generally looking for a job elsewhere, just in case, because I'd be worried that they were going to fire me, and that's why they weren't giving me any work.

52
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,830
Speaker 0: And then they give you more money and move you to a new office.

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,437
Speaker 1: You know what?

54
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,150
Speaker 1: That's fine.

55
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like I feel bad if I start working on something else.

56
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,557
Speaker 0: And I do kind of have work to do.

57
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:08,786
Speaker 0: It's like I got this one thing to do.

58
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,389
Speaker 0: that's so trivial, it's like I don't even want to look at it.

59
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:23,309
Speaker 0: And I have this other thing to do where I 99% finished it, and I just have to fix one bug and it's done, and it's just like I really don't feel like doing it, because if I did it, there would be one less thing I have to do in my queue.

60
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,790
Speaker 0: And then I have this giant project, which I want to work on, but they haven't given me the final spec.

61
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:38,149
Speaker 0: And I've already read all the documentation they've given me and already know everything there is to know about it, short of the actual instructions about what they really want me to do.

62
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,850
Speaker 0: And no one's talked to me about it since giving me... They basically just gave me the documentation and haven't said a thing about it since.

63
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,170
Speaker 1: See, that's the one thing that does get to me, is a lot of times I'll have work I could do.

64
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:54,430
Speaker 1: I'm all ready to do something, but I'm waiting for some idiot somewhere else to get their act together before I can do it.

65
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,530
Speaker 0: See, the real problem here isn't the fact that I'm waiting.

66
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:09,889
Speaker 0: It would be fine if I knew that, say, someone was planning to give me the stuff I needed, and I was just waiting for them to do it, because then they'd be like, "Okay, I'm stuck here waiting for this guy, and I would feel just fine working on my own

67
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:10,230
Speaker 0: whatever.".

68
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:16,125
Speaker 0: But when they haven't even communicated anything to me at all, they didn't say, "We're going to get it to

69
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:16,267
Speaker 0: you.".

70
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,476
Speaker 0: They didn't say, "It's

71
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:17,918
Speaker 0: coming.".

72
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,749
Speaker 0: They didn't say, "You're going to do this, you're going to do

73
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:19,890
Speaker 0: that.".

74
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,237
Speaker 0: They just said absolutely nothing.

75
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,383
Speaker 0: No words whatsoever.

76
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,610
Speaker 0: I have no information.

77
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,515
Speaker 0: All I have is these documents.

78
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:26,862
Speaker 0: They said, "You have a new project.

79
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:27,083
Speaker 0: Here's

80
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:27,585
Speaker 0: documents.".

81
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:29,527
Speaker 0: That's it.

82
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,429
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, at least thank yourself that you're not in IT.

83
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:44,369
Speaker 1: Because a lot of IT work, if you're just a system administrator, you're not going to do a lot of proactive work, because once all that's done, if there isn't a project on the horizon, there's not much to do.

84
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:50,549
Speaker 1: So you honestly spend a lot of your time kind of sitting around, being ready to deal with things if they break.

85
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,689
Speaker 0: But see, that's fine, because then at least I would know for sure my job is to sit around and wait for things to break, which means I'm not supposed to be doing anything now.

86
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,169
Speaker 0: But it feels like I'm supposed to be doing something, but I'm not sure, or maybe...

87
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,310
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my take on that is that there have been many times...

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,849
Speaker 0: It's like the fact that I could have finished some of these things that I'm doing, like the thing that I'm 99% done with, I probably could have finished it weeks upon weeks ago.

89
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:21,450
Speaker 0: The fact that no one seems to care that it's not done, and no one's even asked about it, is like... Does it not matter?

90
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:29,650
Speaker 1: What often scares me is when I'll finish a project, and I think I've done it really slowly and terribly, like I just kind of put a half-ass into it, like I didn't do a good job.

91
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,690
Speaker 1: Or it took way longer than it should have.

92
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:35,466
Speaker 1: And people still praise me like, "Wow, that was awesome, none of us could have done

93
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:35,687
Speaker 1: that.".

94
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:36,919
Speaker 0: Wow.

95
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, my job's kind of interesting sometimes.

96
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,569
Speaker 0: But I think the people at my work know how long it takes to do stuff.

97
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,190
Speaker 0: They're not really amazed or anything.

98
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:51,189
Speaker 1: I'll freely admit that the people at my work have no idea how long things should take to do.

99
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:54,949
Speaker 0: I mean, the stuff that I've finished, they said, "Yeah, you did a good job,".

100
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,150
Speaker 0: because I did do a good job, you know, I took my time and did things right.

101
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:17,789
Speaker 0: I wasn't in a big rush or anything, but... You know, they don't seem to... I don't know why they're paying me, and they seem to think highly of me, and they're nice to me, but I don't understand why they keep paying me more, because I don't feel my work is really... I don't think I do anything valuable to them.

102
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,529
Speaker 0: I think I just take their money from them.

103
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:26,748
Speaker 1: Honestly, in America, I'm pretty sure that our entire economy is based on the fact that everyone does things really inefficiently.

104
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,550
Speaker 1: And if any company actually did things efficiently, there wouldn't be any jobs.

105
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, I could do my job.

106
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:44,370
Speaker 1: I mean, I honestly, aside from some of the application development, I'd say I've met at least 40 or 50 people in the course of the last year working where I work.

107
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,089
Speaker 1: People who just don't need to exist and their job could be done by a computer or by me in my spare time.

108
00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:01,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, if I really wanted to, really, and I had the specs for the project, I could finish that project in maybe a month, you know, if I did it really well, maybe.

109
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:06,050
Speaker 0: And I could do the stuff, you know, the other two things I have to do in like a day.

110
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,236
Speaker 0: Just like, oof, they're done.

111
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,346
Speaker 0: And then I had nothing to do.

112
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:10,150
Speaker 0: At all.

113
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,618
Speaker 1: I guess don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

114
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,250
Speaker 1: I mean, there are people who would kill to have a job like that.

115
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I sit alone in this office all day like banging my head against the wall.

116
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,752
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

117
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,930
Speaker 1: You sit alone in your office all day instant messaging me while I'm trying to do work.

118
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,470
Speaker 0: Because I had nothing else to do to keep me from going insane, sitting in this empty office.

119
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,533
Speaker 1: You know what?

120
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,250
Speaker 1: Most people sit in that office for the rest of their lives.

121
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to get out of this office as soon as I drain enough money out of it.

122
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe Geek Nights will become popular and syndicated.

123
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,429
Speaker 0: I don't think so, but, you know, it's kind of like a Puerto Rico game, you know?

124
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:48,049
Speaker 0: You gotta keep using this small market until I get enough doubloons to buy the university, then I'm outta here.

125
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,070
Speaker 1: So anyway, tell us about Songbird, Scott.

126
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:58,970
Speaker 0: So, we all know about Firefox, Thunderbird, and what's the other one?

127
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:00,067
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

128
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,850
Speaker 0: Sunbird, I think.

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,730
Speaker 1: Sunbird, yeah, whatever.

130
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the one with the calendar.

131
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,235
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a new one.

132
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:09,910
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually made by Mozilla, but if it turns out to be good, Mozilla will probably absorb it.

133
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,510
Speaker 0: It's called Songbird.

134
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,610
Speaker 0: It's basically iTunes built on the Firefox engine.

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,130
Speaker 0: But it's not actually iTunes, it's an iTunes replacement.

136
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,788
Speaker 1: Now, I'll warn you guys right now that this isn't a finished product at all.

137
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like version .1 alpha something.

138
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,761
Speaker 0: It's not really useful yet.

139
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,729
Speaker 0: I wouldn't use it.

140
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,710
Speaker 1: All I can say about it is that it looks like it has potential.

141
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,330
Speaker 0: Yeah.

142
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:45,170
Speaker 0: If you go, it looks like black iTunes, and on the left side of the screen, you've got links to pretty much every source of music other than, you know, iTunes.

143
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,147
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, like every podcast aggregator, Amazon, everything.

144
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:59,870
Speaker 0: In the middle there, you've got basically what amounts to a Firefox web browser, but it's very trimmed down, so you just like view controls for things in it, you know?

145
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,590
Speaker 0: And the websites that you buy music from, just like iTunes, you know, the music store.

146
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,890
Speaker 0: It appears in this big kind of browser-y window.

147
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,050
Speaker 0: And then in the menus, it obviously plays music.

148
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,410
Speaker 0: It can play all kinds of music, any audio files and whatever.

149
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:26,370
Speaker 0: And at the top, there's controls to like create smart playlists and manage your audio library and, you know, handle any devices you have.

150
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,289
Speaker 0: I don't think that works yet.

151
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,209
Speaker 1: Nothing seems to really work so well.

152
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:37,270
Speaker 1: In fact, I recall earlier you told me you were going to show it to me, and then it opened off the screen and you couldn't get it back.

153
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,250
Speaker 0: Well, I think that was partly because I was using two monitors at work, but it's also partly because of the program.

154
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,149
Speaker 0: But, yeah, it's also big and slow right now.

155
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,549
Speaker 1: I guess keep an eye on it and give it time.

156
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,950
Speaker 1: I'd really like to see something to compete with iTunes that would actually work well.

157
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:59,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if this, if they come out, this is Mozilla Zool stuff, so there's no reason it shouldn't run on all the platforms.

158
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:15,390
Speaker 0: If they can really get some Firefox-style quality in there, I think they can beat iTunes, especially if they have, you know, proper MP3 player and iPod support and proper podcast-subscribing action and library management.

159
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,090
Speaker 0: If they can get those three things, they can really take over.

160
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:21,470
Speaker 1: All right, so in other news, NASA.

161
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,350
Speaker 0: NASA.

162
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,693
Speaker 0: Anyway... Oh, '58.

163
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,370
Speaker 1: Yes, that, dear listeners, was an inside joke.

164
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,730
Speaker 0: You'll find out about it later, if you don't know it already.

165
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:43,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're probably going to make it a thing of the day, because it's funny how sometimes a thing or a joke, or just a thing we see on the internet, we'll be immune to it and it'll disappear and we'll forget about it.

166
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:50,970
Speaker 1: But sometimes, we just latch onto something and quote it infinitely for, you know, a year or two, and then we forget about it.

167
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,348
Speaker 0: All right, so NASA.

168
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, NASA.

169
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,629
Speaker 0: The real NASA.

170
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,450
Speaker 1: So, uh, George C. Deutsch of NASA was not the best dude.

171
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:04,210
Speaker 1: He was working for NASA, and he was a very high-up kind of guy there.

172
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,350
Speaker 1: He had the power to squelch research and direct scientists and that sort of thing.

173
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,070
Speaker 0: What was the name of his position?

174
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:19,590
Speaker 1: So, our good friend George was appointed by our other good friend George, as in George Bush, as a writer and editor, a presidential appointee at NASA.

175
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:29,890
Speaker 1: And, one, he claimed to have graduated from Texas A&M, which actually was discovered by some bloggers to be a falsehood, if you will.

176
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,209
Speaker 0: He dropped out of Texas A&M.

177
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,050
Speaker 1: Yes, in fact, he dropped out, if I may, to work on George W. Bush's election campaign.

178
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:40,110
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,690
Speaker 1: Huh, fancy that, and then somehow he got appointed to NASA.

180
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,290
Speaker 0: Maybe I should join some people's election campaigns so I can get appointed to things.

181
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:46,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

182
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,027
Speaker 0: I think I'll do that.

183
00:12:48,990 --> 00:13:05,230
Speaker 1: So, he lied about having a degree, and this probably wouldn't have mattered, except that he brought a bunch of attention to himself when, among other things, he was trying to muzzle James Hansen, a scientist at NASA, concerning his research on global warming and the fact that it's actually happening.

184
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:13,070
Speaker 0: So, as writing and editing, he edited and wrote things that concealed or did not include research which NASA was doing?

185
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, and it looks like he was trying to, all right, not let this guy publish his papers, period.

186
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,872
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:22,130
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, does he have to publish them through the NASA public, whatever office?

188
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really don't know.

189
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:24,770
Speaker 1: I don't know much about the inner workings of NASA.

190
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:35,210
Speaker 0: I mean, I went to space camp when I was a little kid, and that seems to me like this guy was sort of like a middleman for people in NASA trying to publish his papers.

191
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,310
Speaker 0: He published things to the public somewhere.

192
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

193
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he edited and wrote.

194
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,810
Speaker 1: Also, he was trying to force the web designers to add the word "theory" every single time the Big Bang was mentioned.

195
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:48,642
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

196
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:52,370
Speaker 1: And he tried to cover up various research into the Big Bang.

197
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,015
Speaker 0: Can we frickin' leave?

198
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,484
Speaker 0: Theory means awesome.

199
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:56,430
Speaker 0: God damn it.

200
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:01,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he doesn't like the fact, apparently, that Big Bang is asserted as a fact.

201
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,610
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

202
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,290
Speaker 1: It's no different than the intelligent design bollocks going on.

203
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,354
Speaker 0: God damn it.

204
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:10,110
Speaker 0: The colloquial meaning of the word "theory" is not equal to the scientific meaning.

205
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,417
Speaker 0: The scientific meaning means, "Holy crap, it's a theory, it's

206
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:13,778
Speaker 0: true."

207
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,367
Speaker 0: And the colloquial meaning is, "In theory...".

208
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:31,810
Speaker 1: So basically, the short version of this is that this guy dropped out of college, was appointed by Bush to NASA, used by Bush in NASA to cover up research that went against what the administration was trying to do, and then he got caught and was forced to resign.

209
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,661
Speaker 0: Isn't he just like a 23, 24-year-old guy?

210
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,150
Speaker 1: He's a 24-year-old punk who didn't graduate from college.

211
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,588
Speaker 0: So he's about as old as we are.

212
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:48,070
Speaker 0: I think I read somewhere that he pretty much went from writing for the college newspaper articles about video games to being the NASA guy.

213
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:54,690
Speaker 1: Well, in the fart thread about this, people pointed out a lot of other interesting appointments Bush has made in his tenure.

214
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:55,590
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

215
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,210
Speaker 1: And he's appointed a lot of young punk kids to very high-level positions in our government.

216
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,174
Speaker 0: Really?

217
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,850
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why things suck.

218
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, that might be hard.

219
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,690
Speaker 0: What was that guy who...

220
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,838
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, look at recent ones.

221
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,670
Speaker 1: Brown, the head of FEMA.

222
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was just gonna say him.

223
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,890
Speaker 1: That guy was an expert in horses, and yet he ended up being the disaster manager of the whole country.

224
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:16,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, way to go there.

225
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:19,328
Speaker 1: We saw what a colossal fuck-up he was.

226
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,970
Speaker 1: Harriet Meyers, he tried to get on the Supreme Court, who had absolutely no experience whatsoever.

227
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,090
Speaker 0: As a judge, at least.

228
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,177
Speaker 0: Yeah.

229
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,269
Speaker 0: She was a lawyer, which is close.

230
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,750
Speaker 1: Granted, honestly, very few Supreme Court justices were actually judges at any point before being on the court.

231
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, she was at least a lawyer, so that was something, but it was his personal lawyer.

232
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,670
Speaker 1: It was his personal lawyer.

233
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,110
Speaker 0: That's like me trying to make my physician the surgeon general.

234
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,954
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:42,195
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:43,507
Speaker 0: Just a little fishy.

237
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,354
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of them.

238
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:54,090
Speaker 1: Apparently, some young, I think it was a 25-year-old kid, was appointed to some high-up contractor-something position, and he was flying around Iraq in military jets.

239
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:05,430
Speaker 1: So, at least this one had a happy ending, because the guy probably would have been able to stay in and do all of his evil crap, except that he had to lie about going to college.

240
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:05,851
Speaker 0: No, wait.

241
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:14,690
Speaker 0: If this is a job that is appointed by the president, as opposed to some other hiring mechanism, isn't Bush just going to appoint some other idiot in the place?

242
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:15,889
Speaker 1: I don't know.

243
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,850
Speaker 0: Does it need some sort of congressional or something approval?

244
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,329
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any congressional oversight for things like this.

245
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,201
Speaker 0: No approval by anyone?

246
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:24,270
Speaker 0: No committee anywhere?

247
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,589
Speaker 1: Honestly, I really don't know.

248
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,132
Speaker 0: Yeah.

249
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,383
Speaker 0: Maybe they should look into that.

250
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,133
Speaker 0: I mean, it seems like-- You know what?

251
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:32,150
Speaker 1: Maybe they should at least actually read the kid's resume.

252
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,328
Speaker 1: I mean, when I get jobs, they call RIT and ask, "Hey, did this guy

253
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:36,790
Speaker 1: graduate?".

254
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:38,346
Speaker 1: And RIT says, "Yep, he

255
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:38,548
Speaker 1: did.".

256
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:46,510
Speaker 0: But it seems like a lot of appointments are just made by the executive branch, and no one else looks at it.

257
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,409
Speaker 0: And that's something that should be fixed.

258
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,389
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess the scary thing is that-- At least have some committee look at it.

259
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,750
Speaker 1: If this guy hadn't lied about college, then there would have been no problem, because he hasn't done anything illegal.

260
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,850
Speaker 1: He's just done things that were boneheaded and stupid.

261
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,658
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,850
Speaker 0: You should also be fired if you're boneheaded and stupid.

263
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,044
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

264
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:19,179
Speaker 1: I don't know how many of you out there have actually played Zelda's Adventure for the Philips CD-i.

265
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,720
Speaker 0: I never played it, but it is infamous.

266
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,035
Speaker 1: But I played it at a Sears store a long time ago.

267
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 1: They used to have demos of all these things.

268
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:36,420
Speaker 1: And there's a video on Google Video that I discovered that kind of brings back that whole horrible experience.

269
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,220
Speaker 1: It's a video of the actual gameplay from the Philips CD-i version of Zelda.

270
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,304
Speaker 0: Wow.

271
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:43,879
Speaker 0: I never thought I'd see that.

272
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:45,907
Speaker 1: There's more to the game.

273
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,880
Speaker 1: There's a lot of FMVs and such.

274
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,040
Speaker 1: But basically what you'll get out of this is that one, the game's terrible.

275
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:56,059
Speaker 1: Two, there are load times between every single screen.

276
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,356
Speaker 0: That was back in the day when they had 1X CD-ROMs.

277
00:17:59,377 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 0: That's what happened.

278
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember dealing with that in, like, Under a Killing Moon with its four CDs or Phantasmagoria with its seven.

279
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:13,358
Speaker 0: All I gotta say is this game looks exactly like a really bad version of Dink Smallwood or other shitty Windows 95 games.

280
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,003
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

281
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:22,120
Speaker 1: I mean, to this day, I'll bet Nintendo just wants to kill itself over giving Philips the right to make a Zelda game.

282
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,017
Speaker 0: I don't even know if Nintendo, what were they thinking?

283
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:25,420
Speaker 0: I don't know.

284
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:26,905
Speaker 1: They were forced to.

285
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:31,240
Speaker 1: They didn't want to give it away and they hated doing it, but they had to because of a license agreement with Philips.

286
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,220
Speaker 0: Maybe we should go check in all the details on that one.

287
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:44,020
Speaker 1: I used to know all the details, but basically it had to do with the fact that Nintendo and Philips were going to collaborate to make a CD extension for a Nintendo system.

288
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,850
Speaker 0: But that was Sony and Nintendo.

289
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,200
Speaker 0: That's how the PlayStation was born.

290
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,499
Speaker 1: You know Sony Philips?

291
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,199
Speaker 0: No, Philips isn't Sony.

292
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:59,079
Speaker 1: They're all separate companies, but there's kind of an incestual relationship when it comes to the technology involved.

293
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:09,220
Speaker 1: And it ended up that Philips, in this case, had the right to use licensed characters from Nintendo games for a set period of time.

294
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,319
Speaker 1: And Nintendo was obligated to honor that.

295
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:16,260
Speaker 1: Nintendo did not want them to make this game, but they had no choice.

296
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,439
Speaker 0: Nintendo should have at least stipulated the game didn't suck.

297
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not Nintendo's choice.

298
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,380
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because the game is now just some scary part of history that no one remembers or cares about.

299
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, though it is eerie that the Nintendo Revolution controller on a superficial level looks a lot like the Philips CD-i controller.

300
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,900
Speaker 0: Except for the fact that the Nintendo Revolution controller is useful and the CD-i controller is not.

301
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,700
Speaker 1: Well, hence I said in a very superficial way.

302
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,137
Speaker 0: Wait, didn't the CD-i controller have this giant yellow ball in it?

303
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,499
Speaker 1: Mmm, it wasn't yellow.

304
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,336
Speaker 0: It had this giant ball in it.

305
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,800
Speaker 0: I don't think it was like the Revolution controller now that I remember it.

306
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,460
Speaker 1: In terms of that, it looked like a remote control.

307
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,651
Speaker 0: I think it was only vertical.

308
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:55,860
Speaker 0: I don't know, was it even vertical?

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,743
Speaker 1: Yes, it was vertical.

310
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:01,480
Speaker 1: There might have been different ones, but the one I played was vertical and terrible and hard to hold.

311
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,240
Speaker 0: I'll have to go check it out because I remember there being this giant ball that you spun around or something.

312
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,512
Speaker 1: I know Intellivision had that.

313
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,479
Speaker 1: It had the big black disc.

314
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,013
Speaker 0: No, this is a big yellow ball.

315
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:13,920
Speaker 0: Like, round.

316
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,372
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm just remembering something else.

317
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:17,097
Speaker 0: I have to go look it up.

318
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,660
Speaker 1: So in that brief interlude, I showed Scott a picture of the Philips CD-i controller and he was indeed remembering something else.

319
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,860
Speaker 0: I was remembering something else with a big yellow ball and I have to go look it up and find what the hell it is.

320
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,540
Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about.

321
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,786
Speaker 0: I don't know either now.

322
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:32,255
Speaker 0: I thought it was the Philips CD-i.

323
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:32,940
Speaker 0: I guess it isn't.

324
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, your thing of the day.

325
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,657
Speaker 1: You can talk about it just because we both found it.

326
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,295
Speaker 1: And I think everyone on the internet has found it because it's really cool, but...

327
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this guy in Mexico City is a helicopter pilot, which is not a bad job.

328
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,530
Speaker 0: Takes some skills.

329
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,340
Speaker 0: Respectable.

330
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,750
Speaker 0: And he goes around taking aerial photos, which is cool.

331
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,918
Speaker 0: You know, aerial photos.

332
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:56,420
Speaker 0: Nice.

333
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,357
Speaker 0: Especially when there's stuff that you can't see from the ground, like big giant stuff.

334
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:00,940
Speaker 0: You know, whatever.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,200
Speaker 0: And he goes around taking pictures of things, but the thing in Mexico City, everything is apparently awesome.

336
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, Mexico City, after looking at these pictures, looks like an interesting place to live.

337
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:18,380
Speaker 0: He took a picture of the biggest bullfighting arena in the world, and it wasn't full of people.

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,308
Speaker 0: It had a bunch of people in it, but it wasn't full.

339
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,860
Speaker 0: But apparently it's very impressive when it's full.

340
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,958
Speaker 0: And I can imagine so now that I've looked at it.

341
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,838
Speaker 1: There's a building that has a giant Wislowski from Monsters, Inc.

342
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,360
Speaker 1: on the roof.

343
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what that is, but there were many, many apartment buildings that were like extra fancy.

344
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,511
Speaker 0: And there were like extra fancy country clubs.

345
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:50,200
Speaker 0: And some of the greatest pictures were like, you know in a movie, there's like a Mexican drug lord who has like this tiny little island mansion that always looks like something that no one lives in.

346
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,219
Speaker 1: They're all over the place.

347
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,946
Speaker 0: He took a picture of like three of these things.

348
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,496
Speaker 0: One of them looked like a castle and had a boat at it.

349
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:56,500
Speaker 0: And I was like, holy crap.

350
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,077
Speaker 1: My favorite one, and I gotta say, well there were two about this, but this is something the U.S.

351
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:02,800
Speaker 1: really needs.

352
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:09,600
Speaker 1: And that Mexico, for all its problems, Mexico really looks like they're trying to take care of their less well-off people.

353
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,210
Speaker 0: Well, at least in the Mexico City area.

354
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,720
Speaker 0: What do you get, you know, out in the desert.

355
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever, out in the desert.

356
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 0: Bandits, but...

357
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 1: But low-income housing, like massive, massive, massive tracts of identical, yet brightly colored houses.

358
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,331
Speaker 1: These pictures look fake.

359
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:23,999
Speaker 1: They look like CG.

360
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, as soon as I saw the picture, I was like, what, is this CG from?

361
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:28,637
Speaker 0: like The Sims or something?

362
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:29,360
Speaker 0: What is this?

363
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,039
Speaker 1: No, it's real, and it's awesome.

364
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, this is a picture from the sky of just like miles upon miles of just grids of streets with identical houses perfectly evenly spaced from each other in like these flat, bright colors.

365
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,051
Speaker 1: Brightly, brightly colored.

366
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:48,700
Speaker 1: Very neat.

367
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:53,908
Speaker 0: It's so, you know, uniform that it looks like a computer-generated image.

368
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:54,650
Speaker 0: It doesn't look real.

369
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:01,000
Speaker 0: Even the cars look fake in the setting, you know, but it's real, and it's pretty cool.

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:09,820
Speaker 1: It seems like just Americans have this aversion to low-income housing, which to me is a crock because I think that really people deserve to have a place to live.

371
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,111
Speaker 0: If you want one.

372
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Speaker 1: Well, the fact that the two of us, we're fairly highly-played professionals, and yet it's real hard to find affordable housing freaking anywhere in this country where there are jobs.

373
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, it's easy to find a house.

374
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:35,600
Speaker 0: You can get a house in the middle of the boonies, but to get a house near a place where you can work, you either have to live in some terrible, terrible place, or you have to live for a lot of money.

375
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,945
Speaker 1: Well, we live in the 'burbs?

376
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:37,970
Speaker 1: in New York City, basically.

377
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,660
Speaker 1: We live out on the commuter line, you know.

378
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,029
Speaker 0: We're beyond the 'burbs.

379
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,500
Speaker 0: We're in, like, the outskirts.

380
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least we're still on the commuter rail line.

381
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,092
Speaker 0: We are on the commuter line.

382
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:47,800
Speaker 0: We're not, you know.

383
00:23:47,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Speaker 1: But the thing is, even out here, there's a lot of people have big houses that are separated by a lot of land and sprawl, and it's set up to where there's absolutely no way you could actually have public transportation, and the roads are all long and windy and full of cars, and there's all this wasted space that really could have been used for actual affordable housing.

384
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:10,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, along the side of the highways, there's a bunch of trees, right?

385
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:17,980
Speaker 0: And I understand the trees are to keep sound and stuff from bothering everyone, but if you just put houses in the way, houses work as well as trees.

386
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,857
Speaker 1: Well, no, see, that's odd, because people don't want to live next to a highway.

387
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,260
Speaker 1: That's terrible.

388
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,253
Speaker 0: Poor people don't care.

389
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:22,780
Speaker 0: They're poor.

390
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:34,420
Speaker 1: No, I'm just talking about, like, there's a, I don't know if you've seen it, but between here and IBM, there's this big subdivision, and the subdivision is full of giant, freaking, million-dollar McMansions.

391
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:42,216
Speaker 1: And the thing is, people who buy them are even getting ripped off, because they're really condos, even though you get the whole house, and you don't own the land.

392
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:43,620
Speaker 1: Just a giant scam.

393
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,482
Speaker 1: And that's not what this area needs.

394
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:54,713
Speaker 1: This area needs some affordable, nice, actually livable low-income housing, because honestly, people like us want low-income housing.

395
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,716
Speaker 1: I don't really need a mansion.

396
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:57,697
Speaker 1: I'd like a mansion.

397
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,940
Speaker 1: I'd like a manor house and a butler, but I'm not going to get one.

398
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:09,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I really need the house for is a place to sleep, shower, and put my stuff, and plug in to utilities and such.

399
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,320
Speaker 0: You know?

400
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,239
Speaker 1: Oh, and occasionally to have a sexy potty.

401
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:22,500
Speaker 0: Well, occasionally a sexy potty, but, you know, if I had to, if my house was cheap enough, I could get, you know, the extra monies to have sexy parties and party houses, and ballrooms and things.

402
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:30,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is, it seems like people who have larger houses, or who lived before, you know, sprawl came, really are overprotective of their property values.

403
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's up with this property value nuttiness.

404
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:45,698
Speaker 1: Honestly, unless you want to move from where you live someday, and your house is only an investment, I'm not saying that low property values are good, but you don't want your property value to rise steadily, because you know what rises along with that?

405
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:46,940
Speaker 1: Property taxes.

406
00:25:47,960 --> 00:26:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know, I mean, if you're a renter, if you're a guy who owns a bunch of places and rents them out, you don't really care what the property value is, because you, you know, you care the property tax is low, because, you know, you can charge rent whatever you want.

407
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:11,641
Speaker 0: You know, so I don't know why those people want property value to go up, unless they're, the only people who really care are the people who are in the business of buying and selling houses like crazy, or people who plan to move and- You know who else cares?

408
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:21,180
Speaker 1: People who live in subdivisions and are members of homeowners associations who don't understand how the property value actually affects them, and don't want their neighbor to have his grass too long.

409
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get it.

410
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,255
Speaker 1: Or, you know, the people who don't want wind power plants near them, or don't want cell towers, but still want cell service.

411
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,380
Speaker 1: We could do a whole episode on those people.

412
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:32,497
Speaker 0: Goddamn.

413
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:41,640
Speaker 0: As far as I'm concerned, they should just imminent domain land wherever there is no cell signal, and put the most powerful tower they possibly can.

414
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:53,079
Speaker 1: Hey, if I owned the land we live on right now, I'd totally call up Reisner Sprint and say, "Hey, you can put a cell tower on my roof if you'll pay for the electricity it uses, and maybe give me a free cell

415
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:53,319
Speaker 1: phone.".

416
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be great.

417
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:59,168
Speaker 1: I actually read that on the outskirts of a lot of cities, cell phone companies will do that.

418
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:07,040
Speaker 1: If you own land, they'll pay you a nice rent forever, and they'll give you free cell service if you let them put a tower in your area.

419
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,583
Speaker 0: I would totally go for that.

420
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:13,720
Speaker 0: I'd get the infinite data, infinite minutes, and then I'd get the fanciest phone, and I'd be all set.

421
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:14,502
Speaker 1: Yeah?

422
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:23,100
Speaker 1: Well, like our friend Scott Johnson, his parents' house, they put a little gas... I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like a little gas compressor something station on their land.

423
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,848
Speaker 1: And it's near the house, but it doesn't make any noise, and it's far away.

424
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:31,380
Speaker 1: And as a result, the gas company pays them quite a decent sum per month to keep it there.

425
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,102
Speaker 0: Hmm.

426
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:33,160
Speaker 0: Not bad.

427
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:33,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

428
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:43,480
Speaker 0: I should buy a house with a big piece of land off to the side of it, and then just sell that land to whoever, and just have this little area next to my house full of crap.

429
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,307
Speaker 1: Well, that land has to actually be useful.

430
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,980
Speaker 1: I mean, you have to actually be in a place where people want to pay you to put stuff on the land.

431
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, leave it between my house and the neighbor's house.

432
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,784
Speaker 1: It depends if they need a cell tower there.

433
00:27:53,864 --> 00:28:00,180
Speaker 1: I mean, luckily, where we live now, I mean, there's a mountain outside my window, and I can see the cell tower I use because it's right there.

434
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:02,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, we get pretty good signal here.

435
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,100
Speaker 0: I don't get signal at my new office.

436
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,080
Speaker 1: I didn't get signal when I lived in the other mountains up in Poquoi back in the day.

437
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:08,568
Speaker 0: Uh.

438
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:20,520
Speaker 1: I didn't get such good signal when I lived in Vishco, but I think that was because I lived in an old French-style apartment, and it was, uh, I think the walls were just made of solid, horrible death or something, I don't know.

439
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if you get cell signal in Mexico.

440
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,667
Speaker 1: I don't know, but you know what?

441
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,160
Speaker 1: I'd be able to find affordable housing.

442
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:33,460
Speaker 1: But I guess the main thing you'll get out of this is that Mexico City, I mean, Mexico's not a third world country.

443
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,720
Speaker 0: We should go to Mexico City for vacation.

444
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:36,274
Speaker 1: You want to?

445
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:36,835
Speaker 0: Why not?

446
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,460
Speaker 1: Alright, we can go to Mexico.

447
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,300
Speaker 0: We'll just fly there.

448
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,120
Speaker 1: I gotta get my passport all fixed up before we head down.

449
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:42,798
Speaker 0: Mine's all good.

450
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, my passport, I need it to be renewed and such.

451
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,939
Speaker 0: You're gonna get the RFID, maybe.

452
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:49,617
Speaker 1: Uh, you gonna nuke it?

453
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,120
Speaker 0: You have to get your tinfoil wallet.

454
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:55,800
Speaker 1: Or just put your, uh, passport in the microwave for 30 seconds.

455
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,700
Speaker 0: You know, you could eat in one of those, like, E-ZPass bags that doesn't let E-ZPass go off if you put it in your glove box?

456
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:03,179
Speaker 1: Any Faraday cage will do it.

457
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:03,604
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:29:04,595 --> 00:29:04,979
Speaker 0: Go for it.

459
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:09,300
Speaker 1: But anyway, since it's anime day, we should probably talk a little bit about anime.

460
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,080
Speaker 0: Well good, we just watched two animes.

461
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watched- Crazy anime.

462
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,099
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

463
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,654
Speaker 1: So we watched episode one of an old anime made in 1995 called Ninku.

464
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,420
Speaker 0: N-I-N-K-U, as in Ninja, but without the Ja, and with the Ku instead.

465
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,160
Speaker 1: Imagine a Naruto Cromartie, I guess.

466
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,020
Speaker 0: That's the best we can come up with.

467
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,679
Speaker 1: With a little bit of Jibaku with that penguin, and it's farting.

468
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:37,240
Speaker 0: Okay, so, oh my god, this show is about this little kid.

469
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:38,407
Speaker 0: Okay, no.

470
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,399
Speaker 0: Let's start before that.

471
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,820
Speaker 0: It's about this world where there are Ninku, which are like this ancient secret order of awesome powerful ninjas.

472
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,559
Speaker 1: Twelve awesome powerful ninjas.

473
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,580
Speaker 0: Very s- well, there are twelve clans of powerful ninjas.

474
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, there weren't so many of them though, and they held off- I thought it was just twelve guys, but they held off the Imperial Army.

475
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,198
Speaker 1: I think it was twelve guys.

476
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:57,572
Speaker 1: Alright.

477
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,939
Speaker 1: It showed twelve guys.

478
00:29:59,302 --> 00:30:01,359
Speaker 0: Okay, then maybe they had descendants, I think?

479
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:02,920
Speaker 1: I don't know, whatever.

480
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,040
Speaker 0: Whatever, but they're basically the ninja-ness works almost identically to Naruto ninja-ness.

481
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,520
Speaker 1: Only in such a stupid over-the-top way.

482
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,740
Speaker 0: I mean, let me tell you, there was a scene where the guy did the same, you know, rapid set of hand gesture things they do in Naruto.

483
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,199
Speaker 0: Like, straight out of Naruto.

484
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,697
Speaker 0: Of course, Naruto was straight out of this, because this came out in '95.

485
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:35,260
Speaker 0: And then, they spent, like, an entire minute with a frozen image, while some guy explained the entire ninja technique.

486
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,219
Speaker 0: Like, in many, many words.

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,179
Speaker 1: Yep, and a giant kanji was, like, flashing on the screen.

488
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:45,197
Speaker 0: I didn't even read any of those words, because I was too busy going, "Oh my god, he's explaining the technique!

489
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:45,498
Speaker 0: Oh my

490
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:45,819
Speaker 0: god!".

491
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:54,240
Speaker 1: Now, the opener to the show- I mean, at first they do this bit, they talk about these ancient whatevers, and they fought off the Imperial Army, and they're dangerous and cool.

492
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:58,255
Speaker 1: So the opener starts, and we think, "Alright, this is going to be a show about dangerous

493
00:30:58,295 --> 00:30:58,616
Speaker 1: guys.".

494
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:04,320
Speaker 1: And then the opener proceeds to have probably the ugliest thing I've ever seen in anime.

495
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,420
Speaker 0: The main character is just hideous and painful to look at, like you want to kill yourself.

496
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,211
Speaker 1: Ah, did someone open the Ark of the Covenant?

497
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,299
Speaker 1: I can't look at you.

498
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,020
Speaker 0: I mean, like, Naruto is painful to watch for a long time, because you get these 15 episode fights.

499
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:23,720
Speaker 0: But imagine if Naruto was ugly, and had giant eyeballs, and his tongue stuck out, and his cheeks were flappy, and ugh!

500
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,765
Speaker 1: Like, we're not kidding.

501
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,309
Speaker 1: The kid's creepy looking.

502
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,535
Speaker 1: Like, ring-u creepy looking.

503
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:31,100
Speaker 1: Like, I don't want him looking at me.

504
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,295
Speaker 0: But he has this pet penguin.

505
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:33,680
Speaker 0: that's funny.

506
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:36,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually a friend penguin, not a pet.

507
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, they make a point of saying that.

508
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:40,100
Speaker 1: The show is every frickin' cliche ever.

509
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:46,700
Speaker 1: It's a boy who, his mother's kidnapped, and he, like, tries to stop the guy who's going to kidnap his mother.

510
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:54,360
Speaker 1: And then the guy pulls the whole, "Oh, if you want revenge, then become stronger and come after me, ahaha," and walks away.

511
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:58,334
Speaker 1: And then, you know, you meet someone, and, "Oh, let's be friends.

512
00:31:58,696 --> 00:31:59,378
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll be your

513
00:31:59,419 --> 00:31:59,700
Speaker 1: friend.".

514
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,372
Speaker 1: And then they get kidnapped, and then, "Oh, he'll save,".

515
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:04,260
Speaker 1: and then he saves her, and oh my god.

516
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you might be wondering how this tiny, tiny, he looks like a six year old, but I don't think he is.

517
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:13,000
Speaker 0: Little kid saves people from evil.

518
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,819
Speaker 1: Well, he quite literally kicks their asses.

519
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:24,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, it turns out in the first episode, they reveal that the main character, the ugly little kid, is actually a crazy powerful ninku, former ninku, commander, whatever.

520
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,299
Speaker 0: From some clan.

521
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,149
Speaker 0: And he has magic ninja powers.

522
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,320
Speaker 0: He does the turning into a log trick.

523
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:39,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny, because you know the typical scene where there's a whole bunch of guys with guns, and then there's one guy on the other side, and the one guy charges and somehow beats them all?

524
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,460
Speaker 1: That scene happens, except the kid charges them, and they open fire, and he gets riddled full of bullets and blood and falls over dead.

525
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:48,738
Speaker 0: But it's a log!

526
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,840
Speaker 1: Oh, it turns into a log, just like in Naruto.

527
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,204
Speaker 0: It's the old ninja trick.

528
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,900
Speaker 0: Well, Naruto, he turns into a log, just like in ninku, actually.

529
00:32:57,405 --> 00:33:00,920
Speaker 1: The show is kind of funny, but kind of painful to watch.

530
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:08,380
Speaker 0: If the main character wasn't ugly, I would say the show is basically Naruto five years ago with a funny penguin.

531
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,108
Speaker 1: Yep, and a little bit of Cromartie.

532
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:12,100
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Cromartie type dialogue.

533
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dialogue is very Cromartie.

534
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:17,940
Speaker 0: Not much else is, but the dialogue is definitely Cromartie style.

535
00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:28,198
Speaker 1: If anything, watch the opener, because if you see a full-grown woman riding a penguin as it flies, and the penguin is a normal-sized penguin.

536
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,160
Speaker 1: In fact, it's a little penguin.

537
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,938
Speaker 0: It's a little penguin.

538
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,059
Speaker 1: I don't know what to say about this show.

539
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna watch any more of it, that's for sure.

540
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:34,978
Speaker 0: No, no.

541
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,717
Speaker 0: But the penguin, two or three times during the episode, farts in order to fend off enemies.

542
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:43,000
Speaker 0: And it works.

543
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:43,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

544
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:44,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:46,439
Speaker 0: That's all you gotta say about that?

546
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,168
Speaker 1: I guess the show is trying to be funny.

547
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:52,320
Speaker 1: I can't imagine that the show is actually serious.

548
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,840
Speaker 0: I think it might be funnier if you had, like, an anime club to watch it with.

549
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we showed that to an anime club, they would've gone nuts.

550
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,140
Speaker 0: You'd have to only- you couldn't watch more than one episode, though, 'cause it totally wouldn't keep going.

551
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,418
Speaker 1: It's like a bobo-bobo-bobo-bobo.

552
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:06,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

553
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,717
Speaker 1: One episode is awesome, two episodes is shit.

554
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:09,802
Speaker 0: Yeah.

555
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:15,699
Speaker 0: Of course, after two minutes, he can't look at the kid anymore, but he's the main character.

556
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,304
Speaker 1: Oh, god.

557
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:17,020
Speaker 1: Ark of the Covenant.

558
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:19,239
Speaker 0: Ark of the Covenant.

559
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:20,188
Speaker 0: Ninku.

560
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:29,400
Speaker 1: So, the other show we watched was real short, and it's Masuda Kosuke Theater, Gag Manga Biyori.

561
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:31,620
Speaker 0: I think it's like, it's a gag.

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, like gag manga.

563
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,772
Speaker 0: Like a gag, a joke, you know, a practical joke, a gag.

564
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,679
Speaker 0: Gag Manga Biyori.

565
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:43,659
Speaker 0: Of course, they say "gag-you" because they can't, I don't know, it's a Japanese pronunciation of gag, I don't know.

566
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:45,763
Speaker 1: It's funny?

567
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:51,380
Speaker 1: It's short, and it's funny, you know, I'm not really sure what to think, 'cause it went by so fast.

568
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:01,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, let's see, the first bit is this guy who's in charge of a company, and- He's talking really fast, constantly, as in he's not breathing, he's just talking.

569
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, and then eventually that bit's over.

570
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:20,960
Speaker 1: And it's like, little joke, little joke, little joke, and each one of them's not that funny, but they keep hitting you with 'em, and you just, like, have this rolling chuckle through the whole thing, and then at the end it hits you with this one-two-three punch of three actually really funny jokes in a row, and by the end I was just hysterical.

571
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was, I laughed a lot.

572
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:24,840
Speaker 1: The sticker, oh my god.

573
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:35,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it starts off with this guy, he's yelling at his board of directors at the company, at a snack company, they make snacks, about the stickers that come in the snacks, because that's how they sell them to kids.

574
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,600
Speaker 1: And oh my god, the stickers are just three very similar pictures of this depressed-looking, like, eight-year-old.

575
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:50,360
Speaker 0: Right, so then he has them change 'em, and then he has them change his stickers again, and he keeps going, and they show a, when they turn the camera to the board of directors, it's like, what was it, Chain Wielder?

576
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,260
Speaker 1: Bear Killer something?

577
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were, like, four people, and it put their names and their occupation in it.

578
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really can't explain the humor, you just have to watch this.

579
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:07,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was, like, so-and-so the Bear Killer, and he was covered in, like, these scratch marks from Bear Claws, and another guy was, like, so-and-so the Chain Wielder, and he had chains wrapped around him.

580
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,803
Speaker 1: That has nothing to do with what was going on.

581
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, that may not sound funny, but oh my god, go to Anime Ski, and get this show, and watch one episode, it's not long.

582
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,619
Speaker 0: There are actually four episodes, and I'm getting two, three, and four right now.

583
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just two, I really can't describe it.

584
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:36,880
Speaker 1: It's hilarious.

585
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:49,360
Speaker 0: I don't think the quality of it is the highest quality, but the hilarity factor, at least in the first episode, you should at least watch the first episode, I haven't watched it anymore, because you will laugh.

586
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:53,048
Speaker 0: And quick, easy laugh, why not?

587
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,780
Speaker 0: Of course, it's the crazy, wacky kind of humor, I know some people might not like it.

588
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:03,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you like Cromartie, or Excel, or anything weird like that, you freaking love this show.

589
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're not into the weird stuff, but the weird stuff just makes you go, "Huh?

590
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,075
Speaker 0: What's going

591
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:09,676
Speaker 0: on?"

592
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:10,960
Speaker 0: Then you can probably forget about this one.

593
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is not a show for people who aren't into anime, I guess.

594
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,198
Speaker 0: I don't think it really is so much anime.

595
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,875
Speaker 1: Or at least have some kind of vague, dim understanding of Japan.

596
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:22,818
Speaker 1: At all.

597
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:24,524
Speaker 0: Maybe.

598
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:24,785
Speaker 0: I guess.

599
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,594
Speaker 0: The second one might relate to people.

600
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:27,859
Speaker 0: if you know what Pokemon is.

601
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:28,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, dokiwa.

602
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,160
Speaker 0: If you know anything about Pokemon at all, like if you know it exists, and there are monsters in it, then the second half of the episode will amuse you.

603
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,524
Speaker 1: But this definitely doesn't pass the street test.

604
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:45,580
Speaker 1: If you showed this to some randomish muck on the street, they wouldn't have any words to say to you, to express how they felt, I don't think.

605
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:46,482
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:49,292
Speaker 0: They might just go, "What the hell?

607
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:50,616
Speaker 0: I was freaking fucked up,

608
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:51,018
Speaker 0: man.".

609
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:59,020
Speaker 0: So, if you've been to our website, you can agree it's a little bit ugly, just a little bit.

610
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically when we installed WordPress way back, it came with like four themes.

611
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,540
Speaker 0: No, it didn't come with four themes.

612
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,400
Speaker 1: No, you installed a bunch of themes.

613
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,180
Speaker 0: It comes with two themes, the classic and the default, and I installed a bunch from this.

614
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, we installed a bunch, and they were all crappy, and the one we picked was the least crappy of them, and we don't like it at all.

615
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,183
Speaker 0: It has some problems with it.

616
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:19,571
Speaker 0: Like, I don't like how, you know, the way you figure out there are comments on.

617
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:23,160
Speaker 0: a post is based on the number next to the title, and it's just not great.

618
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the fact that this theme doesn't do the WordPress stuff 100% correctly.

619
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:29,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like...

620
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,380
Speaker 1: Like, I had to do some terrible "fucking" with it to make it display the links on the right properly.

621
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:42,760
Speaker 0: The other thing is I want to disable commenting on the blog part by people other than us.

622
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:51,839
Speaker 1: Yep, no offense to you guys, it's just that we want discussion to be in the forum, and we're going to use the comments mostly for things like, "Well, in this episode, Scott was

623
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,079
Speaker 1: sick.".

624
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:56,359
Speaker 1: Or, "Well, we got to clarify that it was actually this thing and not this

625
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:56,540
Speaker 1: thing.".

626
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,020
Speaker 0: You know, just things we don't want to appear in the description of the podcast itself.

627
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,400
Speaker 1: So basically errata.

628
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:13,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I disable that feature that disables comment... If I enable the disabling of commenting, then the comment box still appears, and some people might be confused and try to use it.

629
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,360
Speaker 0: So I have to change the theme so that doesn't happen.

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,960
Speaker 0: So basically I'm making a whole new theme, and it's going to look a lot like the default theme in the forums.

631
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,518
Speaker 0: Because I actually looked at the style for the forums, and the guy's like, "Yeah, you can use this if you give me

632
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:28,818
Speaker 0: credit.".

633
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,238
Speaker 0: So I'm going to basically be hacking away at CSS stuff for...

634
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:33,202
Speaker 1: For now.

635
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:40,580
Speaker 1: And later on, we're still working, we've got some artist friends trying to help us make some good logos for Geek Nights, better than our neon sign that was thrown together.

636
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:51,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we can get like a square picture that looks really good, you know, for a Geek Nights logo, then we could use that to label our MP3s with, and label our feed with it.

637
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:58,420
Speaker 1: And also eventually make our theme a very customized, cool-looking thing with some sort of theme to it, other than just color.

638
00:39:58,883 --> 00:39:59,165
Speaker 0: Yeah.

639
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:01,040
Speaker 0: You know, cool stuff like that.

640
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all just in the works, so just be warned that the site may change a little bit as time goes on.

641
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Speaker 1: If any of you out there feel particularly artistically inclined, give us a ring, we can provide you with whatever reference photos you need.

642
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,300
Speaker 1: And I guess the only reward we could offer you is that we'd credit you if we used anything you gave us.

643
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll credit anyone who gives us anything.

644
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:27,999
Speaker 0: Also, if you're musically inclined, make like, you know, if you made like little bumper musics for us, or...

645
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,700
Speaker 1: A little guitar riff, a little jazz riff.

646
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,977
Speaker 0: Anything like that that might be useful for us, you know, maybe.

647
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:34,500
Speaker 0: What do we need?

648
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,540
Speaker 0: We need something to go, like, after the thing of the day, maybe, or...

649
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,165
Speaker 1: No, we need something before our main bits.

650
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:44,520
Speaker 1: We'd like to have a different thing for every type of main bit, like anime day will be an anime thing, whatever.

651
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone made like anime music for the anime day, like a different theme for each day of the week.

652
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:55,100
Speaker 1: But definitely following in the theme of geek nights, you know, a late show, jazzy kind of late show music.

653
00:40:56,683 --> 00:40:56,764
Speaker 0: Yeah.

654
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:57,044
Speaker 0: Alright.

655
00:40:57,406 --> 00:41:01,639
Speaker 0: Also, um, join the forums, a lot of people have joined the forums like we tell them to.

656
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,380
Speaker 0: Uh, do stuff in there, like, say something.

657
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,071
Speaker 1: Well, honestly, the forums have been rocking mostly, just the last couple days.

658
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:11,400
Speaker 1: they've been a little slow, but normally there's a lot of people in there.

659
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,380
Speaker 1: There have been some really good arguments, I'm real pleased with you people.

660
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, um...

661
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:17,238
Speaker 1: Keep it up.

662
00:41:17,623 --> 00:41:19,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all you other people.

663
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,080
Speaker 0: Join them.

664
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are you doing?

665
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,020
Speaker 0: I know you're not a member of any other forum on the internet.

666
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:34,560
Speaker 1: I've noticed over time that the segment of listeners that's rising the most is iTunes people, who probably have never even seen the website.

667
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, go to FrontRowCrew.com.

668
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,520
Speaker 0: You can throw a www at the beginning if you want.

669
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, doesn't matter though, we only have one server.

670
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, so FrontRowCrew.com.

671
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,871
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

672
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:58,460
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

673

Speaker 1: Geek Nights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

678
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:25,300
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

679
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,160
Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
