1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,696
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 29th.

2
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:11,198
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:15,650
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight the technology of WikiLeaks.

4
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,226
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,694
Speaker 1: Yeah, the listeners want it.

6
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:37,226
Speaker 1: clearly no one has exhibited any support whatsoever for not saying the date.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:52,168
Speaker 0: I Should have you know as my problem is I can never use the strategy of pretend I like it so that people switch back cuz they're picking it just cuz I don't like it Unless I start out lying from the get-go, which I never do because I am a non liar.

8
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:53,573
Speaker 0: non liar That's right.

9
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,320
Speaker 0: ever nope ever nope.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,003
Speaker 1: in your entire life.

11
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:56,645
Speaker 1: You've never lied.

12
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:00,696
Speaker 0: That's I have Since I have become a non liar.

13
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:02,683
Speaker 1: I remember that that one argument.

14
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:12,023
Speaker 1: We're having it was like two or three years in RIT and Someone pointed out that you had lied in recent memory, and then your response was I think yeah That was before the non lying time.

15
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:15,036
Speaker 0: That's right I Became a non liar.

16
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:21,910
Speaker 1: only you know I got kind of an aside from work And I obviously can't use the names of vendors because this is all BS.

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,447
Speaker 1: But here's some examples of the BS that goes on when it comes to enterprise software.

18
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,876
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, how much does this cost?

19
00:01:30,097 --> 00:01:31,564
Speaker 0: well you have to call us?

20
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay?

21
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:37,628
Speaker 0: Let's talk about how much is gonna cost how much you have How much is your budget for this project?

22
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:37,850
Speaker 0: well?

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:46,666
Speaker 1: Then we'll decide how much it's gonna come aside from the fact that enterprise vendors seem to magically pull 50 to 80 percent Discounts out of their asses when you say you're not gonna buy their product.

24
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:56,142
Speaker 1: Yeah There's another thing that I don't think a lot of people realize and I want to point this out because we have a lot of Tech people listening, and this is something that you need to cover your butt about.

25
00:01:56,644 --> 00:02:01,329
Speaker 1: so say you've got a product And you you need to buy a product that does this thing.

26
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,387
Speaker 0: I don't have time to develop it which would be the right answer?

27
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,238
Speaker 1: yep That's usually sadly the right answer.

28
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:11,050
Speaker 1: so you need a thing and there's only and there's no open-source solution.

29
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:12,643
Speaker 0: And even if there was it's.

30
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,570
Speaker 0: it's flawed.

31
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:18,610
Speaker 0: Or maybe you have to hire someone who would cost a lot of money to take care of an open-source solution flawed?

32
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:23,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not ticketing because it's some weird business thing you got to do.

33
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:24,110
Speaker 1: that's not ticketing systems.

34
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:34,449
Speaker 1: but I'll say this I was looking at ticketing systems again and Dear Lord are the open-source ticketing systems so desperately new painful?

35
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,470
Speaker 0: well They're all meant to be you designed by small-time guys for small projects.

36
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:40,194
Speaker 1: I'm not.

37
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:45,156
Speaker 1: even some of them claim to be big and or they're all or they're all hippie And they're not bug trackers.

38
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:56,263
Speaker 1: I learned not to look for bug trackers, but I found three Really kind of big looking ticketing systems that did a lot Command line only source distribution.

39
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,090
Speaker 1: yep who's gonna use that?

40
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:01,000
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's not a ticketing system.

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,752
Speaker 1: It's something else that I need and now Hypothetically say there's only like three vendors who actually make this thing Cartel.

42
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:13,050
Speaker 1: so you go to all three of them and get quotes and you make a requirements not requirements document.

43
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,789
Speaker 1: You're like here's what I need and you give it to them and none of them are able to do what you want.

44
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,350
Speaker 0: None of them can check off everything on the list yes.

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,010
Speaker 1: So then you get a demo from all of them, which is the only way to try.

46
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,963
Speaker 0: Did I have any plug-in architectures?

47
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:27,910
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a plugin?

48
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,615
Speaker 0: You know Microsoft does.

49
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:32,060
Speaker 1: yes Microsoft does.

50
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,585
Speaker 0: Microsoft doesn't make what you need.

51
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,170
Speaker 1: now Microsoft doesn't make what we need.

52
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,556
Speaker 1: So you go to these.

53
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:48,070
Speaker 1: you go to multiple vendors and you get demos of all their software And you got to sign all the NDA is and whatever to actually try out their software Sign an NDA to try out something that is a product for sale, so I'm gonna go to Best Buy.

54
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,707
Speaker 0: No You can't look at the TVs that you're going to buy until you promise never to tell anyone if these TVs look like.

55
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:57,070
Speaker 1: so let's Say that of the three vendors none of them do what you want.

56
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:04,150
Speaker 1: But one of them says all right dude look if you'll sign a contract with us We'll put in writing that will do all those things.

57
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,010
Speaker 1: We'll work directly with you because obviously you know more about this product than you know a lot of our other customers.

58
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:12,102
Speaker 0: Then I would say I would like to talk to some of your other customers.

59
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:14,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, so say that say that works.

60
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,390
Speaker 1: I mean say you've got a company that's kind of new on the market in this thing and They basically are willing to implement whatever you want.

61
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,009
Speaker 0: Are they gonna go out of business tomorrow now?

62
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:25,440
Speaker 1: And you have the option of walking away if they don't provide.

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,883
Speaker 1: you don't have to pay until they've made the entire list complete and They will let you walk away if you're not satisfied at the end.

64
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,150
Speaker 0: all right without giving them even one penny.

65
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:43,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right because obviously they stand to gain more than you stand to gain And you know they're competing against the other two vendors that maybe have a more entrenched market share.

66
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:56,449
Speaker 1: Don't be surprised if the other two vendors Threaten to sue you on the grounds that all the features in your requirements document that you gave them before this you saw their software in a demo.

67
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,409
Speaker 1: They claim that you got the idea for all that from using their software.

68
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:05,745
Speaker 1: Uh-huh my advice to you is simply this doesn't your requirements document have a date on it.

69
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:13,150
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, those are easily forged Yeah, so now obviously there's no trouble on my side.

70
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:26,280
Speaker 1: I've handled this adroitly and there's no trouble, but for anyone who is new in the realm of negotiating with enterprise bullshit software Make sure you read contracts very very explicitly.

71
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,014
Speaker 1: ignore threats of lawsuits unless they actually sue you Have a lawyer.

72
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:34,225
Speaker 1: if you don't have a lawyer you really shouldn't be buying enterprise software in the first place.

73
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:38,102
Speaker 1: I Mean you're not big enough to use enterprise software.

74
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:47,947
Speaker 0: I would like to know however What variety of software this is so I can make an open-source solution Or make my own enterprise version, and then kick those other guys asses.

75
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:53,350
Speaker 0: so obviously I'm not saying publicly because I have obviously never used or seen any of their programs.

76
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,796
Speaker 0: So there's no way they could sue me.

77
00:05:54,936 --> 00:06:01,825
Speaker 1: there are so few vendors in this realm that It would be trivial to figure out what companies.

78
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:02,408
Speaker 1: I'm talking.

79
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:10,277
Speaker 0: I admit I've made a list of like vertical software markets where I know a lot of money could be made because the existing You know choices are so slim.

80
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:15,940
Speaker 0: change management document management ticketing well I mean those are just ones that I'm talking about.

81
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:31,310
Speaker 0: stuff like the one that I know the most about is You know every sporting Official or semi-official sporting event in the entire country possibly nay the world right from college on up Uses the exact same piece of software to track the statistics of every player in every game.

82
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,930
Speaker 0: You know so someone's watching a college basketball game between schmuck team one and schmuck team two.

83
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:42,527
Speaker 0: They're typing in so-and-so player number 34 scored two points at three minutes and five.

84
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:42,908
Speaker 0: you know 54 seconds.

85
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,750
Speaker 0: You know with an assist from so-and-so on the whatever team They.

86
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:55,841
Speaker 0: all of this is tracked in this one piece of software that some guys wrote in their garage that have this archaic like you Know keyboard interface with there's like codes you got.

87
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:57,990
Speaker 0: so you got to know like you know it for basketball.

88
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:01,299
Speaker 0: Fp is this and QR is this other right?

89
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,637
Speaker 1: It's a lot like medical transcription, which actually has the same problem You know.

90
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:15,850
Speaker 0: but in other areas They're also very few competitors like Dennis office right software to actually interface with x-ray machines and store all the x-ray images.

91
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,595
Speaker 0: Yep, not too many of the hose.

92
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,624
Speaker 1: well in general anything related to health care has that problem.

93
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:26,124
Speaker 1: also anything related to industrial maintenance Like maintenance scheduling or inventory management.

94
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,630
Speaker 1: they all have the same problem.

95
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:32,270
Speaker 1: But suffice it to say I cannot actually let on to what this software is.

96
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,623
Speaker 0: I mean tell me I didn't mean to tell me now and tell me after.

97
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,950
Speaker 0: so maybe probably not.

98
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:43,930
Speaker 1: you're never gonna find out because I Think I've convinced a company to actually follow the requirements document that I wrote and build exactly what I want.

99
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:45,003
Speaker 0: how about that?

100
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:51,893
Speaker 1: and one of their competitors may or may not have threatened to cause trouble and They're obviously foolish.

101
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,610
Speaker 0: this is actually this is a third situations like oh, I can't afford to develop it myself, right?

102
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:08,081
Speaker 0: But if all the enterprise guys want to charge you an arm and a leg you can just hire Outsourced to a good Development team not just some schmucks in India, but you know a real development He's not that I'm sure there are real development teams in India.

103
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,368
Speaker 0: I just haven't seen many of them.

104
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:11,594
Speaker 1: Well, the trouble there.

105
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:12,596
Speaker 1: It is pretty simple.

106
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:21,164
Speaker 1: anytime you get a resume where someone is very specifically a Tomcat web sphere Java developer They probably only know that and nothing else.

107
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:21,847
Speaker 1: and don't you know that?

108
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,330
Speaker 0: that what I mean?

109
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:27,690
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about hiring developers the way about outsourcing to a company that basically makes custom software.

110
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:33,823
Speaker 0: You know you can hire a Group of developers that is already a team that already makes things together.

111
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,830
Speaker 0: don't say here's their requirements.

112
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,030
Speaker 0: I want you to make a piece of software that does this don't expect to ever be able to maintain that code?

113
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,909
Speaker 0: No, but you can maintain the relationship with that company.

114
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,499
Speaker 0: I asked a US company course.

115
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,928
Speaker 0: then they and it might be in my.

116
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:51,776
Speaker 0: you know It could cost a lot less than some ridiculous It easily.

117
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:58,516
Speaker 1: could I actually do recommend that over developing yourself unless you have dedicated developers Because you're gonna keep on staff.

118
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:03,913
Speaker 1: otherwise you're gonna get some guy who writes something in Perl that no one else knows how to deal With ever.

119
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:11,670
Speaker 1: yep, but a problem you may run into when dealing with this sort of software Is that if you have a long-standing relationship?

120
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:27,622
Speaker 1: This is not the case obviously in this situation with an enterprise vendor, and you try to walk away they will more often than you would expect try to use legal pressure or Effectively all but blackmail to force you to maintain a business relationship with them.

121
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,369
Speaker 1: they will threaten to send the BSA after you.

122
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:35,368
Speaker 1: Relationships like this go sour real quick the moment you say you're not gonna pay for something.

123
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:42,309
Speaker 1: yep So one IT professional to another that I could do a whole show on this stuff, but this is like rims.

124
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,022
Speaker 1: I enterprise IT.

125
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,729
Speaker 1: tip of the day They're all fuck.

126
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,877
Speaker 1: Everything sucks.

127
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,567
Speaker 1: There's no I don't know what I can say.

128
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:58,923
Speaker 0: yeah Anyway, so in the news right Microsoft who I just mentioned a few seconds ago They've actually you know sort of figured things out.

129
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:00,208
Speaker 0: Maybe a little bit, right?

130
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:04,219
Speaker 0: In terms of the old world of openness right.

131
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:12,167
Speaker 0: so what happened was is when at first when everyone was trying to hack the Kinect Microsoft was like oh you fuckers don't even try that shit, but then like a week later.

132
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:12,750
Speaker 0: They're like oh nevermind.

133
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,699
Speaker 0: But then a week later.

134
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:21,110
Speaker 0: They were like oh We thought you meant by hacking to connect that you were like trying to cheat or that you were trying to.

135
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,550
Speaker 0: You know make your own connects.

136
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,393
Speaker 1: Oh, I think they're.

137
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:28,390
Speaker 1: one of the claims was reverse engineer the actual code in the in the Xbox.

138
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:29,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, those the Kinect data.

139
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:40,937
Speaker 0: We thought that you were gonna like make your own connect You know so that you could sell bootleg connects or that you were trying to you know cheat at Kinect games or some of that Kind of bullshit, but apparently you're not.

140
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:44,069
Speaker 0: you just want to use Kinect with your computer or whatever and you know what.

141
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:44,879
Speaker 0: we have No problem with that.

142
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,589
Speaker 0: That's totally cool.

143
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,730
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell if the reversal was due to bad publicity or due to a legitimate mistake.

144
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:51,716
Speaker 0: Well it could have been.

145
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:55,815
Speaker 0: I think what it was was Was actually you know.

146
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:08,444
Speaker 0: first of all everyone knows that Microsoft is sort of a dysfunctional many parts not working in concert But not as bad as Sony kind of organization right, but I think basically what it was is you know There was a big news story because they put out a bounty.

147
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:33,230
Speaker 0: so Microsoft You know the bureaucracy of it automatically reacted to a news story with its name in it right with the automatic legal You know worded reaction, but then it must have been that some sane person at Microsoft in a position of power actually looked at it and said Okay, so our automatic legal reaction was not entirely the correct reaction let us correct it.

148
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,276
Speaker 1: And they did now think of this.

149
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:35,717
Speaker 1: that is just.

150
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:36,098
Speaker 1: this

151
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,884
Speaker 0: is the outcomes razor explanation

152
00:11:38,205 --> 00:12:04,534
Speaker 1: that if that's true that Corporations in many ways and we already know this act like organisms that will have their own reactions to events independent of any individual human making a decision I Mean bureaucracies even without a corporation just a bureaucracy of any kind can do things that no Individual human at any point in the chain would actually want to do or be willing to do or even be ethically Charged to do.

153
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:08,650
Speaker 0: and yet the corporation what it is is that the people who are doing it, right?

154
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:16,030
Speaker 0: I mean they are doing it with intent right, but the thing is they're not actually Considering nor do they care right?

155
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,394
Speaker 0: They're just there's.

156
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:18,778
Speaker 0: their job is to sit here.

157
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,456
Speaker 0: some guys job is to look at news stories about Microsoft and give the official response.

158
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:32,038
Speaker 1: sometimes it's the paralysis of the crowd where one every person no person has authority to stop it Directly or to do the whole thing directly.

159
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:40,185
Speaker 1: everyone does a tiny piece and then the actual decision-making Authority is deferred somewhere else and everyone makes tiny decisions where.

160
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,170
Speaker 1: I may not agree with this But my job is just to pass the news story.

161
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:45,867
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, I may not agree with this, but my job is just to send the C&D.

162
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,350
Speaker 0: It's like a customer service representative, right?

163
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,210
Speaker 0: You call them and they you get the script and you really can't get them off script no matter how hard you try.

164
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,087
Speaker 0: I've tried obscenities.

165
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,302
Speaker 0: That doesn't get them off script, right?

166
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,530
Speaker 0: They have a script for obscenities.

167
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,984
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's everyone's everyone's.

168
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,310
Speaker 0: guys boarded his job.

169
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,657
Speaker 0: His job is PR guy.

170
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,374
Speaker 0: respond to news stories about Microsoft with the official response And he just does it.

171
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,325
Speaker 0: me doesn't really care what the response means or anything.

172
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:12,670
Speaker 0: It's just like hey stop hacking our shit.

173
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,696
Speaker 0: That's their official response.

174
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:18,875
Speaker 1: I've already seen a lot of cool connect hacks Some guys playing Mario with it very poorly in addition though.

175
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,497
Speaker 0: It's somewhat interestingly, right?

176
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:27,880
Speaker 0: They've given a similar response to the You know jailbreaking of Windows Phone 7 hack.

177
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,327
Speaker 1: Ah, I think I can tell you why they're.

178
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:31,490
Speaker 1: they're not selling.

179
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:34,215
Speaker 1: They're not selling for crap.

180
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:35,940
Speaker 1: So Microsoft is probably thinking.

181
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,385
Speaker 1: All right, we're fucked on this.

182
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, what did Apple do?

183
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,594
Speaker 1: What are people mad about that?

184
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,001
Speaker 1: Apple does let's do the opposite.

185
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,508
Speaker 0: Well, no, they didn't do the opposite.

186
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:56,979
Speaker 0: what you know Basically, you know Apple's response is like do not jailbreak, you know They even tried to try to argue that it was illegal, you know, Microsoft is basically like look, you know You're just gonna ruin your phone.

187
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,546
Speaker 0: You're gonna void your warranty.

188
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,048
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

189
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,909
Speaker 0: We can't stop you, but really we suggest you don't do that, but we can't stop you.

190
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,846
Speaker 0: Right and maybe updates might break it, but we can't stop you.

191
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:07,870
Speaker 1: Well, there's a big difference.

192
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,341
Speaker 0: That's not the same as the.

193
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:25,957
Speaker 0: the actually best response Which is here is the source code for Windows Phone 7. you are free to do anything with it that you wish except sell phones with this software on it without paying us right and Do whatever you want with your phones.

194
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,087
Speaker 1: have a good day I'd even be happy with.

195
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:28,730
Speaker 1: alright.

196
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,249
Speaker 1: Well, here's some drivers to interface with it.

197
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:35,209
Speaker 1: You're on your own if you want to do something with this phone, but we're not gonna stop you.

198
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:45,910
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean because really they make their money with Windows Phone 7 because a company like say HTC Will make a phone and they'll want to put Windows Phone 7 on that phone.

199
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:57,749
Speaker 0: And so if they make a hundred thousand of that phone They need to pay Microsoft a hundred thousand times Copies of Windows Phone 7 and that gets integrated into the price of the hardware, you know Sort of like when you buy a Dell that has Windows on it.

200
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,570
Speaker 0: All right Dell actually buys the copy of Windows and then just gives it to you with the part of the price of the computer.

201
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,437
Speaker 0: All right, so that's how they make their money.

202
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:08,150
Speaker 0: So it doesn't really matter if Windows Phone 7 OS is open source.

203
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,907
Speaker 0: right, but you know, they're never gonna do that because that's how they are.

204
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:20,516
Speaker 0: but I Wouldn't matter because nobody could make and sell a phone with Windows Phone 7 on it and avoid You know their lawyers, right?

205
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:24,030
Speaker 0: That would be sort of incredibly difficult except for Chinese phones, which are gonna do that shit.

206
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,230
Speaker 0: Anyway, yep, so they wouldn't actually lose money.

207
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:38,770
Speaker 0: You know either way because of the way that carriers and phone manufacturers work until that's busted up You know, there's actually no real business reason to keep shit closed source.

208
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,687
Speaker 0: Except maybe you want to hide some secrets that oh shit our stuff course at the same time.

209
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:50,747
Speaker 1: There's no active reason to support it or Advertise it because a small number of angry nerds are the only people who care.

210
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,893
Speaker 0: no But what I'm saying is that you know, it's the same situation I said with Apple.

211
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:59,848
Speaker 0: if you would just do it, even though there's no reason, you know kind of go.

212
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:08,728
Speaker 0: either way It would actually give you this great boost of people who you know Cuz right now people are like, oh, let's hack it because every single thing that comes out We're gonna hack no matter how obscure useless.

213
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,955
Speaker 0: All right, we're gonna.

214
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:13,089
Speaker 0: we're gonna jailbreak every phone on the market no matter who it what it is.

215
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:16,100
Speaker 0: But if they open source their phones suddenly people like wait a minute.

216
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,650
Speaker 0: Well, I think and the people would flock to it.

217
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,258
Speaker 1: Nick I think the effect would be very small.

218
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,110
Speaker 1: I also think that at least Apple their fear probably unfounded.

219
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:33,030
Speaker 1: Well his unfounded is I assume that if the phones are totally open people are gonna be much better writing exploits.

220
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,749
Speaker 1: They're gonna have to worry more about security.

221
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,844
Speaker 1: Hey grandma, I'll make your phone better and then grandma gets a virus.

222
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:41,286
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:41,567
Speaker 0: Okay.

224
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:46,442
Speaker 0: What has more At security holes that are closed more slowly?

225
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,410
Speaker 0: ie acrobat which is closed.

226
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:53,504
Speaker 0: Actually, this is a. I'm gonna give a tech alert to people right?

227
00:16:53,845 --> 00:17:03,790
Speaker 0: You may not realize this but Acrobat reader has a bunch of serious security holes in it And if you open up certain PDFs in it, it is possible that you take over your computer.

228
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,516
Speaker 0: It's especially if it's a Windows computer.

229
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,038
Speaker 0: now think of this.

230
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,023
Speaker 1: PDFs are generally like people one.

231
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:09,028
Speaker 1: It's a document.

232
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:12,650
Speaker 1: Yeah granted There are a lot of macro virus while Trojans from back.

233
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,869
Speaker 0: However, there is now a solution to this problem, right?

234
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:26,243
Speaker 0: If you are the kind of person who doesn't want to use an alternative PDF reader because they suck right first of all The newest newest versions of Chrome have a PDF reader in them, right?

235
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,089
Speaker 0: So I actually did not know that.

236
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's not the greatest yet.

237
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:40,233
Speaker 0: It's not really and you know, and the thing is Acrobat reader sucks, but really all the alternative PDF readers that you can get for Windows at least right and a You're good.

238
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:42,706
Speaker 0: You got preview right and on Linux you're good.

239
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:43,309
Speaker 0: You're good.

240
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,399
Speaker 0: So only on Windows you have an issue.

241
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:50,870
Speaker 0: you can get the stupid Fox it reader, which is It works, but it's fully drag.

242
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,111
Speaker 0: It's.

243
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:55,870
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, it's not spyware or virus, but it technically costs money and you could pirate it.

244
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,270
Speaker 0: But it's I don't you know, it's so shady.

245
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,454
Speaker 0: I don't like that shit, right?

246
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:03,570
Speaker 0: or you can get something like events, which is the one that's used in Ubuntu, right?

247
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,769
Speaker 0: And it actually runs on Windows runs on Windows just fine But it's actually got some bugs and it crashes sometimes and it can't handle every PDF.

248
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,804
Speaker 0: So you kind of want to use the Adobe Reader even though it's evil and full of security holes.

249
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:19,070
Speaker 0: Adobe has released Adobe Reader X. you can get it now.

250
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,994
Speaker 0: So uninstall Adobe Reader 9 completely and install Adobe Reader X and this will solve your security problems And you'll be alright.

251
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:28,962
Speaker 0: I highly recommend this course.

252
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,790
Speaker 1: exactly does it solve the security problems?

253
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:31,773
Speaker 1: Can you just have its own?

254
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,158
Speaker 0: no because it is.

255
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,490
Speaker 0: the architecture of Adobe Reader X is one of isolation.

256
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,950
Speaker 0: So the readers are certain it's sort of like a virtual PDF reader, right?

257
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,797
Speaker 0: It's like there's a virtual machine for each PDF.

258
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:43,540
Speaker 0: You're looking at.

259
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,230
Speaker 0: Okay, just make sure it's easy sandboxing all the people.

260
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,249
Speaker 1: There was an unstated assumption there that it was somehow better, but it wasn't actually said how.

261
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:52,702
Speaker 0: yeah It's it sandboxes all the PDFs effectively.

262
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:58,588
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go into the details I mean, so you're the worst any evil PDF can do is ruin itself.

263
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,701
Speaker 1: granted There's still the inherent flaws in Windows.

264
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,733
Speaker 1: remember that old exploit Wasn't that old?

265
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,864
Speaker 1: where that one archaic image format even forget what it was.

266
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:15,830
Speaker 0: keep your window if you got Windows 7 and you update it all the time and You don't do anything stupid like run some exe from some shady place or look at a bad PDF, right?

267
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:23,794
Speaker 0: Or you know take your computer with absolutely no firewall into a cyber cafe and then do everything on an unencrypted Connection.

268
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,864
Speaker 1: you're gonna be alright actually if you do that.

269
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:27,310
Speaker 1: It's not gonna hurt your computer.

270
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,677
Speaker 0: It's hurt all your accounts, which is just as bad In fact, he's worse.

271
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,450
Speaker 0: He's two more than if they hurt your accounts, then they can hurt your computer.

272
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:36,038
Speaker 0: So you don't do that.

273
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:36,319
Speaker 0: so

274
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:51,603
Speaker 1: very briefly because I do want to talk a lot about WikiLeaks I want to talk about this interesting article pointing out something a lot of people have not thought about electric cars if everyone has one or even if you know a Small but vocal minority of people have them in one area about

275
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:53,970
Speaker 0: completely electric cars that you need to plug into the wall

276
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:59,750
Speaker 1: Yes, or the electric hybrids that can be charged Because they drop, you know a lot of power to charge.

277
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need to plug them into the washing machine style power outlet.

278
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:03,050
Speaker 1: now.

279
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:16,010
Speaker 1: We used to have the problem at the turn of the century Well the turn of the last century where the wiring in houses sucked and couldn't handle stuff like, you know You'd have house fires because the tin wiring couldn't handle a fancy new electronic tin wire.

280
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:18,102
Speaker 1: In fact, there were even like back in the day.

281
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:24,749
Speaker 1: if you bought a toaster You plugged it into an Edison socket as in what you screw light bulbs into because there weren't wall outlets.

282
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,838
Speaker 1: yet People only use stuff for lighting.

283
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,547
Speaker 1: so that used to be the problem.

284
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:29,190
Speaker 1: so we fixed that.

285
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,025
Speaker 1: I mean my modern fancy apartment has holes Jerry on every goddamn wall.

286
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,470
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred holes in this apartment.

287
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,293
Speaker 0: I got plenty holes.

288
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:37,939
Speaker 1: I have like nine circuits.

289
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,223
Speaker 0: I got UPS's.

290
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:50,520
Speaker 1: I got them loaded but the substations that provide power to individual groups of houses They cannot give that much power.

291
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:55,456
Speaker 1: and if everyone in like a block in a subdivision is Powering up their Tesla overnight.

292
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,024
Speaker 1: It'll probably overload that little substation.

293
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're already telling people right?

294
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,010
Speaker 0: Don't use your washing machine during the peak hours, right?

295
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:10,006
Speaker 0: Cuz you know that'll uses too much electricity and you know if and everyone runs their air conditioner at the same time It sort of hurts the system.

296
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:10,250
Speaker 0: It's like.

297
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:18,150
Speaker 0: But the trouble that imagine if every night all night was ultra peak because everyone was charging car batteries.

298
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:26,130
Speaker 1: You know The load is not the issue the overall load because we need more power during the day than tonight anyway.

299
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:31,750
Speaker 1: So a lot of times excess either things are powered down or spun down or excess power is lost.

300
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,544
Speaker 0: It's true the cars we most likely plugged in at night when nothing else is really on.

301
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:36,705
Speaker 1: Yep.

302
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,390
Speaker 1: So baseline load is not the issue.

303
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:54,577
Speaker 1: it's actually the infrastructure between the baseline load and the high tension lines and that all of that and like Individual blocks of houses because our power infrastructure is laughably old and archaic and This is just better out west though, right?

304
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:57,970
Speaker 0: Most of this electric stuff is happening out west before it happens out east.

305
00:21:58,473 --> 00:22:00,710
Speaker 0: So their electricity is much better than ours.

306
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,710
Speaker 1: California was the only state that had rolling blackouts.

307
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,870
Speaker 0: Well, it's California has other issues.

308
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:08,896
Speaker 1: The real issue is just that.

309
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:14,777
Speaker 1: as you know, everyone intelligent has been saying for the last 20 years American infrastructure is really old.

310
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:25,710
Speaker 1: I mean there was a time when we would spend amounts of money that would seem ludicrous today Just building a bridge and now all our bridges are a hundred years old and the ones outside of major cities are starting to collapse.

311
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,445
Speaker 0: Well, here's the major two reasons for that.

312
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:34,010
Speaker 0: number one We built all this infrastructure a long time ago before anyone else built any infrastructure, right and we built it really well.

313
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:37,549
Speaker 0: So it keeps working and we don't have a lot of money to replace it and the other.

314
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:42,470
Speaker 0: The other problem is that we're very big so you built a lot of stuff everywhere.

315
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:50,394
Speaker 0: We'd build something somewhere and then and we would choose to build something in a place that had nothing as opposed to choosing to update A place that already had something.

316
00:22:50,494 --> 00:23:01,343
Speaker 1: so I would actually I don't know if the bigness is nearly as useful as of a factor as People always bring it is because if you're a place like say Luxembourg you can just replace fucking everything.

317
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:02,490
Speaker 1: No, but here's my point.

318
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:13,167
Speaker 1: So the argument that you know broadband sucks in America because we can't wire Everybody because everyone's so spread out you could just wire a single major city really easily.

319
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,166
Speaker 0: people don't want to do that I know but the thing is we could.

320
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,955
Speaker 1: yeah We very easily could that.

321
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,220
Speaker 1: the bigness of the u.s.

322
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:21,590
Speaker 1: Is not an excuse for a failing infrastructure.

323
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,010
Speaker 1: It's only an excuse for having outdated infrastructure in areas that aren't population centers.

324
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:36,847
Speaker 0: I think one solution actually is if you look at you know infrastructure the only infrastructure We're actually doing a good job of updating is the evil cellular infrastructure.

325
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:37,409
Speaker 0: They're getting the 4g.

326
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,464
Speaker 0: They're rolling it out in the big cities, right?

327
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:40,210
Speaker 0: It's coming.

328
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,395
Speaker 0: The thing is right.

329
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:46,930
Speaker 0: that also is because there's this evil corporate structure around it.

330
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,756
Speaker 0: It's all private.

331
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:54,932
Speaker 0: if we if you wanted new bridges You got to have a private bridge would probably work really well And you would get.

332
00:23:55,073 --> 00:24:01,033
Speaker 0: you would get a brand new bridge right the fuck away and there would be a $30 toll to go over Every time.

333
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:07,730
Speaker 1: but at the same time I feel like it is a useful and valuable expenditure of taxpayer dollars to build infrastructure.

334
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:11,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I agree that we should spend taxpayer dollars on infrastructure.

335
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:17,594
Speaker 0: That is a high priority, but there are not enough taxpayer dollars to pay for that and the other thing I think there would be.

336
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,924
Speaker 0: what's what other thing are you not going to pay for?

337
00:24:20,064 --> 00:24:21,470
Speaker 0: or what tax are you going to raise?

338
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,621
Speaker 1: I'll just raise the income tax.

339
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,647
Speaker 1: All right I'm fine with that.

340
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:34,850
Speaker 1: So now as someone who is in who is near the top of the tax brackets I am totally okay with paying 40 50 percent of my income if the trains fucking worked.

341
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:40,705
Speaker 0: Now what what's gonna happen when you pay 40 50 percent income and the trains are no different that revolution.

342
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:41,527
Speaker 0: They're just cleaner.

343
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:45,097
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you know I would be fine.

344
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,661
Speaker 0: You know, it's like if if actually paying actually got if you actually got what you were gonna pay for it's like sure We pay for.

345
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,855
Speaker 1: now at least in New York We get what we pay for.

346
00:24:55,875 --> 00:25:01,120
Speaker 1: if you look at our subway infrastructure versus how much it costs total It does not cost that much for what we get.

347
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we're not getting it much We got a big service cut.

348
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:07,385
Speaker 0: see anytime you W train.

349
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,590
Speaker 1: I don't need that W train.

350
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,777
Speaker 1: 7 7 hasn't been hurt.

351
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:11,981
Speaker 1: In fact, seven is growing.

352
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:12,562
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

353
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,947
Speaker 1: Seven is like the best train.

354
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,235
Speaker 1: it is Never fucked me.

355
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,550
Speaker 1: It always fucks Conrad because he lives one stop away not at the hub.

356
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:30,341
Speaker 1: So Anyway things of the day.

357
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,090
Speaker 1: what do you got for me Scott?

358
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:40,050
Speaker 0: Okay, so the the 2010 the pirate party in Into Germany, I like the pirate party.

359
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:48,196
Speaker 0: Yes They went to the airport for some protesting fun and they did the most fun kind of protest that there is in the world Which is the naked protest.

360
00:25:48,216 --> 00:25:49,100
Speaker 0: naked protest.

361
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,225
Speaker 1: Wait all full Monty.

362
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:51,430
Speaker 0: No, they had underwear.

363
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:59,110
Speaker 0: Okay, because full Monty is actually illegal in a lot of places and yeah, but they're basically like hey This scanner is gonna you're gonna see our junk.

364
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,182
Speaker 0: Well, let's just let everyone see our junk.

365
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:02,490
Speaker 0: and they had some hot ladies with them.

366
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,636
Speaker 1: We should do that in America.

367
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,930
Speaker 0: You can go to the airport and get down to your underwear.

368
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,412
Speaker 0: No one's gonna.

369
00:26:06,553 --> 00:26:07,919
Speaker 1: actually when is international?

370
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,542
Speaker 1: no pants day?

371
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:11,092
Speaker 1: because it should be coming up in like February I don't know.

372
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:11,996
Speaker 0: I want to do that again.

373
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:15,370
Speaker 0: But yeah you this is a you know pretty phony video.

374
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:20,990
Speaker 0: I'm not now doing the Swedish instead of the German because pirate is from Sweden.

375
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,813
Speaker 0: You know party.

376
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,524
Speaker 1: I feel like two three four years ago doing geek nights.

377
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:27,736
Speaker 1: This is when I would have pointed out Hey, I'm not even wearing pants now, but you know what.

378
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:28,519
Speaker 1: and Scott?

379
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,470
Speaker 0: I'm actually wearing pants is indeed wearing pants.

380
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:40,642
Speaker 0: However, I am wearing the pants What you know because I'm wearing, you know, you know who wears the pants me.

381
00:26:41,364 --> 00:26:42,688
Speaker 1: Yes you yes.

382
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:47,614
Speaker 0: Yes You And the pants where?

383
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,542
Speaker 1: so Conrad Wolfram love him or hate him?

384
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:53,030
Speaker 0: wait Conrad Wolfram, that's his name.

385
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,314
Speaker 0: I thought it was Steven Wolfram.

386
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,645
Speaker 1: You might be thinking of a different Wolfram Wolfram alpha guy.

387
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:02,308
Speaker 1: There is also a Steven Wolfram huh, he also did a TED talk.

388
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:06,703
Speaker 0: I Think the Steven Wolfram is the wolfram alpha Wolfram.

389
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,204
Speaker 1: Yes, Mathematica I'm talking about Conrad Wolfram.

390
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:12,089
Speaker 0: I don't know who this is.

391
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:13,293
Speaker 1: He is.

392
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:20,230
Speaker 1: Conrad Wolfram runs the worldwide arm of Wolfram research the mathematical lab behind the cutting-edge knowledge engine Wolfram alpha.

393
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:25,475
Speaker 0: then who is Steven Wolfram.

394
00:27:25,817 --> 00:27:33,980
Speaker 0: Steven Wolfram is the creator of Mathematica Which is the same people who did well from alpha.

395
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,026
Speaker 0: yeah, so are these brothers?

396
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:36,468
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

397
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,170
Speaker 0: there were two of them.

398
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:37,913
Speaker 0: I don't know.

399
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:39,178
Speaker 0: I really don't know.

400
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,130
Speaker 0: Oh Conrad is the younger brother of Steven.

401
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:42,834
Speaker 0: There we go.

402
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:44,241
Speaker 0: I thought it was one guy.

403
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:45,367
Speaker 0: I only knew the one guy.

404
00:27:45,408 --> 00:27:46,854
Speaker 0: suddenly now I know there's two guys.

405
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:50,810
Speaker 1: So he gave us head talk and I think you should all watch it.

406
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,570
Speaker 1: It's my thing of the day, but I kind of had a sea change of my own personal opinion.

407
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:05,853
Speaker 1: The gist of this talk is that we teach math in pro in school, you know kindergarten through 12th grade and even college in the order of complexity of Computation.

408
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:14,764
Speaker 1: so we do calculus last because it is really goddamn hard to calculate Advanced calculus to sit down and actually compute it and be like, that's the inner girl.

409
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,249
Speaker 1: multiply by one.

410
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:21,430
Speaker 0: This math curriculum was created before the time of calculators.

411
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:38,174
Speaker 1: Yes, so he argues that in a world with computers, we should still teach computation, but we should not teach mathematics and theory in the order of difficulty of computation But instead in the order of difficulty and usefulness of Application and theory.

412
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:40,360
Speaker 0: I I sort of agree, right?

413
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,990
Speaker 0: I just think that we need to take also into account, right?

414
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,490
Speaker 0: It's like you should learn the math that is most practical in everyday life first.

415
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:57,768
Speaker 0: And if math if there is a math that is not practical for use in everyday life It really just shouldn't be taught in public school and only in you know for your special field.

416
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:04,569
Speaker 0: So yeah So if you're a physicist, you should learn the math that physicists need to know that normal people They're never gonna need to know in every day.

417
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,618
Speaker 1: Well, he goes a little bit further and points out that you know Even at a young age.

418
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:18,779
Speaker 1: if we forget, you know If we ignore the computation and let the computers do it you can teach very young children the high-level concepts of calculus and Those concepts are actually pretty damn useful.

419
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,750
Speaker 1: and he shows this interesting idea and he used his daughter's example.

420
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:33,247
Speaker 1: It worked pretty well, but you can use advanced maths and sit a kid down and be like, here are the tools here's a problem and point out that maths actually make it very easy to solve this problem.

421
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:40,787
Speaker 1: and then Learning the computation beyond obviously arithmetic, which every kid should learn and everyone in the world should know very well.

422
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:44,503
Speaker 1: I Think he makes a really good point and he can make it better than I can.

423
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:58,249
Speaker 1: but toward the end He talks a little bit about programming and I only not only I not only agree with him But I want to go one step further because I used to argue that Technological literacy is tantamount to literacy in the modern world and I still agree with that.

424
00:29:58,953 --> 00:30:02,210
Speaker 1: But I'm not saying we should drop calculus from the curriculum.

425
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,549
Speaker 1: I'm just using it as an example.

426
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:10,210
Speaker 1: What we teach things like calculus and all these very specific things because they're considered core education in America.

427
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:18,193
Speaker 1: I feel like we should drop some of those less directly practical things like maybe calculus from the Guaranteed.

428
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,437
Speaker 1: everyone has to do this.

429
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:19,999
Speaker 1: God damn it.

430
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:30,370
Speaker 1: curriculum and I think programming not computer literacy I mean straight-up object-oriented programming should be one of the core fundamental things that everyone has to learn.

431
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,728
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go a step further than that.

432
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:42,144
Speaker 0: I think we should make the fifth subject be technology and everyone should learn everything from Transistors all the way up and on top of that we shouldn't drop a damn thing.

433
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:44,190
Speaker 0: These kids are working too easy.

434
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,577
Speaker 0: They're not learning enough in school year-round school.

435
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:47,861
Speaker 0: You're learning more.

436
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:50,690
Speaker 0: I argue and you know what teachers unions fuck you.

437
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:57,090
Speaker 1: I argue against you around school for one reason and one reason alone every all the study stage is better for it every possible way.

438
00:30:57,331 --> 00:30:58,054
Speaker 1: Actually, they don't.

439
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,249
Speaker 0: the kids are less happy actually because they don't get to have a summer.

440
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:10,402
Speaker 1: Every study I've seen has actually been a comparison not just on your round school but between all the countries that have your round school and the ones that don't.

441
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:15,097
Speaker 1: and the ones that have your round school have Fundamentally different educational systems.

442
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:18,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, the system is probably much more the effects.

443
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:19,450
Speaker 0: I gotta change.

444
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,961
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about changing your own school is not the answer.

445
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,670
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually seem to be the causative factor.

446
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,122
Speaker 0: You still there's no reason that we had to cut out anything.

447
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,350
Speaker 0: get your asses and gear kids.

448
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:43,070
Speaker 1: the reason I say cut something out is because Think about this a lot of people's arguments against this idea stem along the lines that you know programming is hard Or I don't need it for my job, but you can say the same thing about high-level math.

449
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:44,702
Speaker 0: The thing is.

450
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:50,302
Speaker 1: but here's the thing we we say, you know, so how many people say yeah I sucked at math in high school.

451
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,150
Speaker 1: I never learned trig.

452
00:31:51,270 --> 00:32:00,110
Speaker 1: You know math stupidity is kind of an accepted social thing and yet programming stupidity is not when Arguably, they're equally important.

453
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:09,159
Speaker 1: I think it should be mandatory programming in school pretty much throughout school just like math and social studies and reading our and History and everything but simultaneously.

454
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,550
Speaker 1: if you suck at it, that's no difference.

455
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,712
Speaker 1: I mean some people suck at math some people suck at language and you know what as long as you can become a productive member Society.

456
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,382
Speaker 1: yeah, you failed programming in first fourth eighth and twelfth grade.

457
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:24,410
Speaker 1: a lot of people failed math in those grades, but we have to try.

458
00:32:25,436 --> 00:32:30,726
Speaker 0: I think that actually, you know, it's like There is some maths right like calculus.

459
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:38,190
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a separate thing You're never you're never gonna use in your life if you're say, you know, I don't know like a watch repairman, right?

460
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:49,550
Speaker 0: But even programming no matter what your job is right even janitor Programming you will use it if you know it and you won't use it if you don't know it.

461
00:32:49,590 --> 00:33:00,500
Speaker 0: But it can help every single job where there is a computer anywhere near you, right, you know well, one of the things Conrad argues is that math education and Programming education should be hand-in-hand.

462
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:02,590
Speaker 1: They should in fact be the same curriculum.

463
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:10,710
Speaker 0: I don't think so because programming at least modern useful programming for everyday people what they would actually help them with their job.

464
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,110
Speaker 0: Here's an example much further away from the math theory sort of program of a computer.

465
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,676
Speaker 1: So you're not you're not thinking about this.

466
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,520
Speaker 1: So here's an example.

467
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,050
Speaker 1: Here's here's a high-level math concept.

468
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:29,450
Speaker 1: We teach the concept we show the applications of it and then in the cross curriculum in the programming classes You have to implement it to do something.

469
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, that helps you learn the math by better by programming and it helps you learn some programming.

470
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,163
Speaker 0: But that programming that you're learning is not going to actually Help you that much with everyday sort of programming.

471
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:47,611
Speaker 0: right if you're really good at writing basic programs to solve math problems You're.

472
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:52,470
Speaker 0: that is not going to help you write a website that integrates with Facebook.

473
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,640
Speaker 1: It's actually not what he thinks is important.

474
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,730
Speaker 0: I think that that's is what's important.

475
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:08,136
Speaker 1: Recommend you watch this TED talk because he makes an interesting point that the high-level math and the high-level programming Actually could have more impact.

476
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:26,650
Speaker 1: but we live in a society where it often doesn't where there are fields like biology basically everything but programming where high-level math and high-level programming could revolutionize those fields and Physics is one of the few fields where that's actually happening Yeah, and that we need to expand it that we need to kind of try to get everyone to learn

477
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,857
Speaker 0: Thinking about scientists and academic people.

478
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:34,909
Speaker 0: I'm talking about, you know, some guys sitting in his office who is a salesman.

479
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:36,862
Speaker 1: We're not saying anything different.

480
00:34:36,882 --> 00:34:37,869
Speaker 1: look at the way we do math now.

481
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,217
Speaker 1: Everyone learns basic arithmetic and you know.

482
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:52,610
Speaker 1: people who aren't aren't dumb learn algebra and then people who aren't you know difficult don't have Difficulties with math usually learn trigonometry and the people who are going into science or who are really smart at math learn calculus.

483
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,036
Speaker 1: programming would be the same way.

484
00:34:54,277 --> 00:35:01,530
Speaker 1: some people only get up to the Facebook website and The same people who would take calculus take calculus and advanced programming side-by-side.

485
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:09,090
Speaker 0: I think that the the math programming of basically writing programs that do the same thing that calculators in Excel already do.

486
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,229
Speaker 1: No Are you he actually a lot less?

487
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:17,969
Speaker 0: Impactful on everyday life and will provide less helpfulness to normal people in their everyday jobs than actually learning how to program.

488
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:18,999
Speaker 0: Scott You did real thing.

489
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,095
Speaker 0: You didn't listen to anything I say is every day.

490
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:22,460
Speaker 1: look at the way we currently do education.

491
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,970
Speaker 1: the majority of people who go through high school don't actually ever Take calculus because it'll never be applicable to their lives.

492
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,110
Speaker 1: They never get to that level, but that should still be the goal for anyone who can do it.

493
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:38,136
Speaker 1: mmm Not everyone's gonna do the high level math and high level programming But that should be the course.

494
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:42,330
Speaker 1: that is the equivalent of what the course to calculus is in current high schools.

495
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:43,621
Speaker 1: Most people won't get there.

496
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:44,367
Speaker 1: Most people don't get there.

497
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:44,589
Speaker 1: now.

498
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:53,479
Speaker 0: I think that people should You know figure out what they're gonna do with their lives and then learn what's appropriate to it and don't bother learning What's not appropriate unless they really like learning.

499
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,970
Speaker 1: except most people don't figure out what they're gonna do with their lives.

500
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:57,416
Speaker 0: Well, that's another problem.

501
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:57,778
Speaker 0: We need to.

502
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,297
Speaker 1: I just I don't know I kind of disagree with you But watch the TED talk.

503
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:07,450
Speaker 1: we can talk about this as a separate show All right, but the main gist here is I no longer think that we should just teach technology.

504
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,470
Speaker 1: I think programming should specifically be required curriculum for every single student.

505
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:13,962
Speaker 0: I always thought you know, it should be part of technology.

506
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:17,034
Speaker 0: is programming that is, you know I never thought differently.

507
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:20,830
Speaker 1: very briefly the meta moment will be a magfest pax east all that stuff.

508
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,539
Speaker 1: The book club book was World War Z by Max Brooks.

509
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,622
Speaker 1: We're gonna review.

510
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:25,987
Speaker 1: almost done almost done.

511
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:26,970
Speaker 1: Stop breathing into the mic.

512
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:28,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, that book sucked.

513
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:29,306
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

514
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:32,118
Speaker 0: Okay Can you like lay off now?

515
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:34,188
Speaker 0: I can't cuz I gotta get around you're not?

516
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,600
Speaker 0: you're like Disturbing the legitimacy of the book club.

517
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:42,623
Speaker 1: I went back and read like the last 30 pages again just to try to be like, well, maybe it wasn't so bad.

518
00:36:42,643 --> 00:36:48,473
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Anyway Book.

519
00:36:48,654 --> 00:36:50,704
Speaker 1: I think I might want to announce it right now cuz it's my pick.

520
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:51,488
Speaker 0: Are you going early?

521
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:54,178
Speaker 1: Yeah So I was suddenly inspired.

522
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:55,001
Speaker 0: you can't hold back.

523
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,728
Speaker 0: You can't wait until the appropriate time.

524
00:36:56,828 --> 00:37:01,490
Speaker 1: This is a book I read a long time ago when I was in high school.

525
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:09,675
Speaker 0: This is gonna be terrible and I I can already say I'm really interested to see how it holds up now because I remember This is gonna be a terrible D&D book.

526
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:10,437
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

527
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:15,553
Speaker 1: I remember a lot of the concepts and a lot of it I actually applied.

528
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:17,502
Speaker 0: Oh, it's gonna be a painful nonfiction book.

529
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:18,265
Speaker 1: It's not.

530
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,530
Speaker 1: well, it's not gonna be painful.

531
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,660
Speaker 1: Oh, the next book club book is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

532
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,442
Speaker 0: Oh, what the hell?

533
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:25,127
Speaker 1: Have you ever read hyperspace?

534
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:25,268
Speaker 1: huge?

535
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:32,046
Speaker 0: It's not that big You know, he teaches over at CUNY.

536
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,809
Speaker 1: it's I know Kind of want to go see him someday.

537
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,142
Speaker 1: Every now and then he does a lecture.

538
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:38,987
Speaker 1: keep an eye out.

539
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:43,146
Speaker 1: So Michio Kaku's hyperspace will be the next book club book.

540
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:43,869
Speaker 0: What are you doing to me?

541
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,443
Speaker 0: You can't pick anything fun fine.

542
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:49,333
Speaker 1: Never mind Ulysses War and peace.

543
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,099
Speaker 0: I'm gonna warm pieces actually better.

544
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:51,962
Speaker 1: Really?

545
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,487
Speaker 1: Have you read it better than Ulysses?

546
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:54,349
Speaker 0: Have you read it?

547
00:37:54,692 --> 00:37:55,948
Speaker 0: I've examined both works.

548
00:37:56,534 --> 00:38:02,710
Speaker 0: I didn't flip through them Enough to know that I would brat if I had to choose between one of the two.

549
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,235
Speaker 1: Fine, I'll pick the other.

550
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:08,130
Speaker 1: my other candidate was one of those D&D books pages of pain by Troy Denning.

551
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,006
Speaker 0: No, how about we pick something like Cat in the Hat?

552
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:15,243
Speaker 1: All right Well, you know what you get the pick next and this is revenge.

553
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:16,307
Speaker 0: Cat in the Hat comes back.

554
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:16,930
Speaker 0: That's it.

555
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,843
Speaker 1: It's revenge for goddamn zombie bullshit.

556
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,209
Speaker 0: There's a monster at the end of this book.

557
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:26,133
Speaker 1: That was a really good book Club monster.

558
00:38:26,153 --> 00:38:30,030
Speaker 0: then every book club should be double book club one really hard book and one really easy.

559
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:31,979
Speaker 1: You know what'll happen?

560
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,070
Speaker 1: It'll be like Apple Geeks.

561
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,790
Speaker 1: They've got the main Apple Geeks and the Apple Geeks light the light.

562
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,630
Speaker 0: But if like if they're really hard book is less hard.

563
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,330
Speaker 0: So if it's like war and peace it war and peace has to go with c-spot run.

564
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,786
Speaker 0: But if you if you bring it down if you bring like Locke Lamora, it's like.

565
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:47,060
Speaker 0: well Locke Lamora We can go with instead of c-spot run.

566
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,593
Speaker 0: It could be like, you know, super fudge I'm just.

567
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:53,787
Speaker 0: you know, it's like you got to add them.

568
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:55,556
Speaker 0: two books But add it together have to be.

569
00:38:55,597 --> 00:39:00,398
Speaker 1: I have this worry that what'll happen is in the forum We'll see a thousand posts about c-spot run.

570
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:03,470
Speaker 0: I know you like c-spot run, but you know what?

571
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,627
Speaker 0: I will give you a fucking Clifford cuz then I hate that shit.

572
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:09,850
Speaker 1: So without further ado after you know, 40 minutes of dicking around.

573
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show's a hot a long show, but you know what?

574
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:13,350
Speaker 0: It was just a holiday.

575
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,180
Speaker 0: So we'll give you the long show double episode.

576
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,370
Speaker 0: Not really more like one and a half episodes 1.6.

577
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,196
Speaker 1: I'm thinking that's what the rates looking like.

578
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:25,290
Speaker 1: Well, so WikiLeaks now, we had this idea because WikiLeaks not wick early.

579
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,610
Speaker 1: We can leaks wiki wiki wiki wiki.

580
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,357
Speaker 0: Okay, it's not wick up Eda.

581
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:31,360
Speaker 0: It's Wikipedia.

582
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:33,948
Speaker 1: Uh, most people's what most people say Wikipedia.

583
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,099
Speaker 1: They say it quick It's it's at best.

584
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,869
Speaker 1: It's a schwa in there these days.

585
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:42,784
Speaker 1: You know where wiki wiki came from right the wiki wiki bus.

586
00:39:42,804 --> 00:39:46,849
Speaker 0: yeah in Hawaii Hawaii Hawaii.

587
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:47,706
Speaker 0: Okay.

588
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:50,617
Speaker 0: So the wicker wicker bus I.

589
00:39:51,421 --> 00:40:03,116
Speaker 1: we wanted to do a show on WikiLeaks for a while But at the same time it really would have been a Thursday show, you know the social ramifications And whether or not we agree with it and all you know There's all this kind of we can.

590
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:06,030
Speaker 1: you could do like weeks and hours and months of just discussion.

591
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:06,577
Speaker 1: I'm you kidding.

592
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:07,610
Speaker 0: We could do WikiLeaks.

593
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:12,990
Speaker 0: I guess it really isn't fit into Tuesday or Wednesday, but Monday and Thursday shows we could like for them just with WikiLeaks.

594
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:19,550
Speaker 1: Yep, but there's one aspect that a lot of people aren't really talking about and I think it actually warrants a lot.

595
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:26,807
Speaker 1: It's just the technology behind WikiLeaks what it is how they do it how to defeat them how to make them in defeatable.

596
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,440
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I mean, it's not just WikiLeaks itself, right?

597
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,350
Speaker 0: I mean, there's the WikiLeaks website.

598
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:40,770
Speaker 0: There's you know, the people who are you know getting leaked right the government's third the embassies, right?

599
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:47,822
Speaker 0: And then there's the third person which is the person who takes the information from the Governments leak and then leaks it to the WikiLeaks.

600
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:49,670
Speaker 0: and all of these three areas.

601
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:56,529
Speaker 0: there are a lot of technological issues to discuss especially in the realms of security and identity and networking.

602
00:40:57,871 --> 00:41:03,350
Speaker 0: So which which three area which area do you want to start and we can discuss what they did wrong and what they should do.

603
00:41:03,992 --> 00:41:21,765
Speaker 1: Let's start with WikiLeaks itself and because you know, they the organization It's interesting that there actually is a website and an actual direct, you know Here it is website because I note that it was DDoS for like a day and a half Prior to and during the release of all these cables.

604
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:22,288
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

605
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:27,430
Speaker 1: And there's no way you can tell me that that wasn't governments trying to hold back as much as possible.

606
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:34,290
Speaker 0: Wasn't WikiLeaks originally like just with you know a wiki just like media wiki the same wiki software that Wikipedia uses?

607
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:37,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I don't want to get into all and now it's sort of like its own website.

608
00:41:38,051 --> 00:41:50,140
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that any whoever decided that a DDoS of WikiLeaks was a good idea and I don't think it was just people clicking on the site trying to actually get it is the fact that The leaks are gonna be distributed by a torrent.

609
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:52,190
Speaker 1: So how are you going to stop it?

610
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,026
Speaker 1: I mean the one original tracker went down and within like five minutes.

611
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,050
Speaker 1: There was another tracker.

612
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:06,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I find the most interesting right is it's like, okay so even if you take down the WikiLeaks website you think that might help you because Normal people won't get the information.

613
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:08,545
Speaker 0: only technologically advanced people get the.

614
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,730
Speaker 0: you know get this files.

615
00:42:10,412 --> 00:42:15,870
Speaker 0: But the thing that really blows the holes, you know, the shitter is that all these newspapers are taking the data and reporting on it.

616
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:20,165
Speaker 0: so Why what's the point of even taking WikiLeaks website down at all?

617
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:21,129
Speaker 0: It's not helping you.

618
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:31,210
Speaker 1: Actually, I was about to say that because of all places the Guardian Basically before I even had time to download the torrent highlighted all the interesting shit.

619
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:37,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like this bulleted list and I'm sure you know as days go on people will grep and find more interesting shit.

620
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,803
Speaker 0: That's probably you know of lesser impact here.

621
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:40,950
Speaker 1: Let's do a really quick aside.

622
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,349
Speaker 1: What's your favorite story from there?

623
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:48,330
Speaker 0: My favorite story that I've seen because I've seen a bunch of my favorite one is still the guy on the horse who escaped.

624
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:51,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's a. it's a pretty good, you know story.

625
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:57,033
Speaker 1: It was just one of those neat things that historians would never have known about and yet now that'll probably be in some history books Somewhere.

626
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,083
Speaker 0: I like just a lot, you know for me.

627
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:03,928
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like the general thing of you know, all the you know.

628
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:12,210
Speaker 0: Diplomatic relations between countries are like a bunch of friends who have really shitty drama and they're really just immature morons.

629
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, and just in general just all that shit.

630
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:24,413
Speaker 1: It's like come on You know fucking grow up do a said replace with anime related proper nouns and it's the bullshit drama between the RIT anime club And our wag.

631
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

632
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:27,243
Speaker 0: it's like thou has insulted me.

633
00:43:27,263 --> 00:43:29,030
Speaker 0: It's like what the fuck is wrong with you.

634
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,535
Speaker 0: You're a fucking country.

635
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:32,181
Speaker 0: You're insulted by somebody.

636
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,425
Speaker 0: you said something about me.

637
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:34,790
Speaker 0: Oh, did you hear that shit?

638
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,103
Speaker 0: Mmm, I do know how to get them to smack down.

639
00:43:37,123 --> 00:43:47,383
Speaker 1: That is not okay You know, it's I do like the the ad the direct You know kind of someone who thinks they're talking to someone in confidence like when an ambassador is like Yeah, the president of X country is such a douche.

640
00:43:47,684 --> 00:43:48,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

641
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:50,699
Speaker 1: that's the kind of thing I say to Scott after we go to a party.

642
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,550
Speaker 0: It's like what the fuck is wrong with you.

643
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:54,110
Speaker 0: Why are you so immature?

644
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:02,327
Speaker 0: You're supposed to be the leaders and the people running the world at the high country level and you're just the same douches that everyone else is.

645
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:03,789
Speaker 0: Why aren't you know?

646
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,660
Speaker 0: It's like if just the FRC was in charge of every country.

647
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:09,440
Speaker 0: everything would just be so much better because everyone just be like hey What's up?

648
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:11,213
Speaker 0: What's going on?

649
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:12,978
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know you did that.

650
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,916
Speaker 0: I know I don't like that but it's your country, but what's interesting I'm mature an adult.

651
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:21,210
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna be a jerk is that WikiLeaks is relatively open.

652
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:23,650
Speaker 1: I mean the location of their servers is known.

653
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:32,316
Speaker 1: Yeah The the front the leader of the organization ostensibly is a known person a known person with Shadiness around them except at the same time.

654
00:44:32,396 --> 00:44:35,905
Speaker 1: It's interesting how like that's the best they could get on him.

655
00:44:35,945 --> 00:44:47,010
Speaker 1: the governments of the entire world Want nothing more than for this guy to disappear and yet not only is he not disappeared But the best they could get is a sexual harassment lawsuit in Sweden.

656
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:51,843
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the best the world government conspiracy can do.

657
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,743
Speaker 1: and you people think there's a New World Order ready to take over any day.

658
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:06,115
Speaker 1: But Technologically - there's just a website and bit torrent and bit torrent is not exactly the most Reliable and safe protocol.

659
00:45:06,155 --> 00:45:10,970
Speaker 0: I mean with bit torrent it would be really hard for them to stop everyone from sharing the torrent, right?

660
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,476
Speaker 0: That's very very difficult.

661
00:45:12,597 --> 00:45:15,670
Speaker 0: What isn't so difficult though is just see who's on the torrent.

662
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:17,441
Speaker 1: But here's the safety in the crowds.

663
00:45:17,683 --> 00:45:18,750
Speaker 1: It's fucking everybody.

664
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:22,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many tens of thousands of leeches and seeds there were today?

665
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:24,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all those torrents?

666
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,762
Speaker 1: No, of course, so the government makes a database of everyone who stole the secrets.

667
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:28,404
Speaker 1: Ah shit.

668
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,170
Speaker 1: It's everyone who owns a computer.

669
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:33,237
Speaker 1: Now what know what right?

670
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:41,555
Speaker 0: also what the thing is right is you could use some sort of tour Proxies anonymizers so that you are not listed on the tour But you still get the torrent.

671
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:51,970
Speaker 0: another thing you can do is there's a lot of places now They're actually selling Or renting out, you know hosted servers that you can get in four in weird places around the world.

672
00:45:52,090 --> 00:46:02,669
Speaker 0: Yeah that you can then torrent from and then download from those computers to your computer even though it's like you buy a Torrent machine that just sits out in some country somewhere doing your torrents for you and seeding and leeching and all that stuff.

673
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:03,873
Speaker 1: even look At Amazon s3.

674
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:07,970
Speaker 1: you can pick which legal jurisdiction you want your day to be in and you can encrypt it if you want.

675
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:09,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, an Amazon.

676
00:46:09,355 --> 00:46:09,656
Speaker 0: actually.

677
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:15,089
Speaker 0: some people were talking about getting some ec2 Amazon machines to use for torrenting You know and that totally works.

678
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:16,489
Speaker 0: There's no reason you can't do that.

679
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:28,564
Speaker 1: But this is what I find really interesting and I haven't quite formed my opinion yet on it But despite the pretty much open and slapdash nature of how this data gets out the world governments

680
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:29,108
Speaker 0: are

681
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,150
Speaker 1: Like desperately impotent to stop it like they are impotent to a degree that is laughable.

682
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:36,376
Speaker 0: Here's how to stop it.

683
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,501
Speaker 0: find out what country it's in.

684
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:38,766
Speaker 0: go take the computers.

685
00:46:38,786 --> 00:46:39,570
Speaker 1: All right in Sweden.

686
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,258
Speaker 1: What do we do now and fade Sweden?

687
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,525
Speaker 0: No, you don't do it.

688
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:43,510
Speaker 0: Sweden has to do it.

689
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Sweden doesn't seem that interested in doing well in tough shit.

690
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:48,256
Speaker 0: It's gotta go now.

691
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:51,050
Speaker 1: The thing is that's not necessarily safety.

692
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:58,252
Speaker 1: I mean part of the problem of WikiLeaks is that they cook a concerted effort could bring down the website and every public person Involved.

693
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:07,707
Speaker 1: so I know there's the security file and all that other kind of stuff and I'm sure The real like the other people behind WikiLeaks are probably relatively anonymous.

694
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:14,615
Speaker 1: I Assume have all sorts of disaster scenarios but if I were them I would actually do something pretty simple.

695
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:29,300
Speaker 1: the next step of WikiLeaks now that is well known is to publish a series of public keys And and just publish them anonymously, you know Laptop in a car that connects to random Starbucks's and puts them in places for people to get later And get them all over the place.

696
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,150
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they had to publish these public keys.

697
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:37,410
Speaker 0: We people have to know that these public keys are definitely Verifiably the WikiLeaks keys.

698
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,430
Speaker 0: They're not just because I can just publish public key and say it's a WikiLeaks key and how will you know if it is here?

699
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:49,295
Speaker 1: If it isn't yep, one way to do this would be to publish a sort of master key while WikiLeaks is still up and known Yeah on the WikiLeaks website.

700
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:49,657
Speaker 1: Yeah.

701
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:51,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I mean one seed.

702
00:47:51,242 --> 00:48:00,850
Speaker 1: you just need as long as there is some way for People involved in WikiLeaks to prove not who they are but to prove that they sign whatever document is now out there.

703
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really just need one RSA public key.

704
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:19,830
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, I could do a 4096 or whatever, right and then anything that WikiLeaks publishes sign it with that key right and then Anyone out there who got a document could verify that this is a valid, you know, this document came from WikiLeaks.

705
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:25,728
Speaker 0: There would be zero absolutely zero mathematical doubt that this document was released by WikiLeaks and not by someone else.

706
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:35,207
Speaker 1: and yet at the same Time while you've kind of it's interesting you've created an identity that is foolproof and yet you've created an identity That is not tied to an actual person.

707
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:35,811
Speaker 0: Nope it's.

708
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,714
Speaker 0: maybe you've got a number.

709
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:42,281
Speaker 1: you might have a cabal of 13 people who each have the private key as long as none of them get compromised.

710
00:48:42,645 --> 00:48:45,938
Speaker 1: and Here's kind of a very specific technical thing.

711
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,150
Speaker 1: true crypt is actually a great means of encrypting things.

712
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:51,861
Speaker 1: Oh and the best part about well, that's just a call.

713
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,190
Speaker 0: No that just is a product that encrypts your hard.

714
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:59,250
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but specifically the fact that it automatically will at least easily does deniable encryption.

715
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:08,530
Speaker 1: The problem with the deniable encryption is that it's mathematically breakable if the data changes a lot Like if you encrypt your whole hard drive, it's pretty obvious.

716
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:15,510
Speaker 1: All right, you gave us a password that gave us an empty windows install where Firefox went to slash dot once four years ago.

717
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:15,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

718
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:16,574
Speaker 1: Yeah.

719
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:21,025
Speaker 1: In fact mathematically we can prove you've got another partition in there somewhere Mm-hmm.

720
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:28,375
Speaker 1: So the way around this what true crypt is great at is taking your private key and putting it in there with 10 Passwords.

721
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:30,069
Speaker 1: they give 10 different bullshit keys.

722
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:35,002
Speaker 1: There's basically no way to actually force one of these keys out of someone.

723
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:35,945
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

724
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:47,218
Speaker 1: So well There there's still there more complicated issues around that but suffice it to say if you did something like that That would kind of be the next stage from WikiLeaks.

725
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:52,730
Speaker 1: the sort of completely distributed, you know info dumps from Starbucks is to fortune.

726
00:49:53,232 --> 00:50:10,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you would you know, you would basically by using you know Public-private key, you know cryptography and encryption and such you would know Verifiably that you know Even though this is just some file on a weird bit torrent somewhere that it was definitely a WikiLeaks document confirmed 100%.

727
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:16,070
Speaker 1: You can also go one step further and make the so-called like debt all bomb insurance file.

728
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,000
Speaker 1: You know the file you've distributed everywhere that's encrypted.

729
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,590
Speaker 1: that can only be decrypted with the original private key.

730
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:33,976
Speaker 1: So if there's ever doubt like say five years go by and you've like Unleash the political scandal and like opened up the new world Illuminati whatever and there's doubt you can come forward and say I'm now gonna risk my life.

731
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:35,120
Speaker 1: I'm the dude.

732
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:37,468
Speaker 1: Here's the private key to prove.

733
00:50:37,508 --> 00:50:37,849
Speaker 1: It's me.

734
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:40,457
Speaker 1: Oh, look, it unlocks the file over there.

735
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:44,550
Speaker 1: that also proves it's me and backs up everything I released for the last 10 years.

736
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:52,786
Speaker 1: So there are lots of ways to go about this and It's just interesting that we haven't even had to resort to that bit torrent.

737
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:53,650
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Sweden.

738
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:54,988
Speaker 0: It's like this.

739
00:50:55,050 --> 00:51:01,790
Speaker 0: It's like an old movie Situation where there's a conspiracy right one guy has a half of a thing and then another guy has the other half of the thing.

740
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,917
Speaker 0: You know like Indiana Jones, I got the rod.

741
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:04,821
Speaker 0: I got the pendant.

742
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:05,965
Speaker 0: Oh, we put him together.

743
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:12,010
Speaker 0: Oh shit, you know It's like we proved that it's the real deal because it goes together and the light shines on the right spot.

744
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:21,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, okay, so that's WikiLeaks just needs to do a better job of Decentralizing, you know and being more verifying and anonymizing, right?

745
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,505
Speaker 0: What about the people who don't want to get their shit stolen, right?

746
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:26,530
Speaker 0: I read this.

747
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:31,968
Speaker 0: Well, actually no, I read this great article that talked all about this like defense network.

748
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:39,218
Speaker 0: It's called like S-trip something I forget what the actual acronym was And basically what the situation was.

749
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:40,743
Speaker 0: they had this network right.

750
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:45,447
Speaker 0: it was like just for you know diplomats to communicate with computers, right.

751
00:51:45,468 --> 00:51:50,390
Speaker 0: and What happened was is more and more people needed access to the system?

752
00:51:50,590 --> 00:52:03,169
Speaker 0: So it expanded trends of trust always fucks and expanded to like over a hundred and eighty embassies worldwide and then right on top of that they Like all these military people needed access to it.

753
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,802
Speaker 1: It only takes one jackass and your train of trust

754
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:37,826
Speaker 0: there was something like, you know millions of people who have secret, you know security clearance and had access to the system and Supposedly the system was supposed to have the following security measures everyone had is supposed to have a really hard password that I heard every hundred and fifty days and Anything that was ever plugged into a USB port on any machine logged into the system was supposed to be As requiring secret clearance and even people who are plugged in their iPods to such a machine We're supposed to have the iPods confiscated and you know that whole right.

755
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:38,690
Speaker 1: that never works.

756
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:39,592
Speaker 0: All right All that stuff.

757
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:56,684
Speaker 0: and there was like an alarm that would go off on the system if there's anything compromised possibly on the machine, but then like Soldiers in Afghanistan were like complaining that the alarm just kept going off and was so annoying and all the security was just causing a Hassle, so they actually turned it off for a period of time.

758
00:52:56,765 --> 00:53:01,642
Speaker 1: Oh, so even then alright, I Assume they're using, you know DVI for their monitors.

759
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just have a monitor screen scape.

760
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,842
Speaker 0: I'll just turn I'll take a camera and take a picture of the screen.

761
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:07,544
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

762
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:32,290
Speaker 0: Oh shit the the major flaw here in this system right was simply that security real security if you actually want to keep a secret you on computers these days because basically the way computers work these days if you type something into a computer if Exists in digital format you've Effectively told the whole world right unless you surround it with some insane physical security.

763
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:41,044
Speaker 0: like you have a computer in a vault and the computer has no network access and you type it into that computer and nothing leaves That room and you search everyone who goes in and out of the room.

764
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:42,069
Speaker 1: I've got to watch out for tempest.

765
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:43,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

766
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,297
Speaker 0: You can have security on a computer.

767
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:49,172
Speaker 0: but any networked computer if you type the letter a you basically type the letter a to the Whole world.

768
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:57,650
Speaker 0: what they really need to do is sadly To have any kind of network security you need to have a huge ass hassle.

769
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,077
Speaker 0: It is a hassle.

770
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,710
Speaker 0: Everyone has to have their own goddamn keys.

771
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:04,279
Speaker 0: You've got to encrypt and decrypt everything.

772
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:14,970
Speaker 0: every computer that's on this network has to be Physically locked down so nobody can even touch the USB port, you know You've got to have the computers the hard drives in them.

773
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,870
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, nothing can be stored on those hard drives at any point in time.

774
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:21,129
Speaker 0: They need to be basically like thin clients, you know.

775
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:21,812
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna.

776
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:30,210
Speaker 1: I'm gonna step back from that a little bit and and make a much more simple supposition if The security is gonna be a pain in the ass as it should be for actual real secrets.

777
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:39,629
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm okay with the government saying because there is an amount of security risk You're willing to take in exchange for the benefits of being able to communicate with computer.

778
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:47,750
Speaker 1: Yes Well, like I'm about to say we've got an agent, you know Actually, like monitoring the nuke situation like a deep agent who's been living in North Korea for 10 years.

779
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:53,234
Speaker 1: That is pretty good secret information and it'd be pretty bad If that got out.

780
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:56,789
Speaker 1: that information should not be available to anyone doesn't need to know it.

781
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:01,200
Speaker 1: But we're way too liberal at least in the u.s.

782
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:05,090
Speaker 1: With our security clearances and with what gets classified.

783
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:05,713
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

784
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:09,010
Speaker 0: Well, that's another problem is that we classify - I think that's the main problem.

785
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:15,650
Speaker 1: We classify so much that as a result too many people need access and as a result the whole systems compromised.

786
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:24,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we would only classify what really needed to be classified which you know could be nothing but you know Well, we're assuming that we do really need to class.

787
00:55:24,191 --> 00:55:24,432
Speaker 0: I'll make

788
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:41,850
Speaker 1: a reasonable argument that I that I think it is reasonable for our government to classify imminent military actions Actual espionage that we are currently engaged in or that while we engaged in it in the past is Still active in some direct form where direct harm could result from it coming out.

789
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:50,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would just hope that you know, ideally you wouldn't have any need or have espionage or military actions, but anyway regardless That's a libertarian world.

790
00:55:51,611 --> 00:56:03,210
Speaker 0: Beyond the point that you if the action if you only made stuff that needed to be confidential Confidential they would actually be so little that was confidential that like only a handful of people would actually need access.

791
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:14,210
Speaker 0: it could be an incredibly small and tight system right like the red telephone system or whatever and Everything else is just like oh who cares, you know, you wouldn't really need that much security because it's just it's government information.

792
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,256
Speaker 0: Let it be public like the law.

793
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:28,470
Speaker 1: In fact, I would argue that by making more information like this public Information that might actually be damaging even if it isn't actually technically secret will be lost in the flood of data.

794
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:30,112
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean right now.

795
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:36,768
Speaker 0: basically that's like WikiLeaks makes these huge dumps and it's like the newspapers go in and Parse and find the tent that the juicy bits.

796
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:41,044
Speaker 0: you didn't go and actually look at any of the actual, you know releases Did you?

797
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:41,966
Speaker 0: yeah, I didn't.

798
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,912
Speaker 1: it's basically it's so much hassle.

799
00:56:43,972 --> 00:56:48,351
Speaker 1: I'm gripping through for words like fuck Penis or douchebag.

800
00:56:48,451 --> 00:56:49,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just such a hassle, right?

801
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,640
Speaker 0: And you know it there might be juicy bits and then no one will ever find because it's just so much.

802
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:55,889
Speaker 1: It's not that much data.

803
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,199
Speaker 0: actually who's gonna read all of it?

804
00:56:58,042 --> 00:56:59,977
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people who are gonna read all of it.

805
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:03,879
Speaker 0: But imagine if there was that much data every day every hour.

806
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:11,040
Speaker 0: Because think about all right, basically these are phone lines between diplomats and they're just talking on the phone kind of all the time.

807
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:23,760
Speaker 0: So this just data piling up constantly, you know If two if you have you you know, one person can pay attention to one phone conversation in real time There's at least five ten, maybe hundreds of conversations going on simultaneously.

808
00:57:23,961 --> 00:57:25,345
Speaker 0: And this is just diplomats.

809
00:57:25,706 --> 00:57:33,852
Speaker 0: add in military add in every government agency add in the DMV Talking to the capital of the state that you're in.

810
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:35,780
Speaker 0: right there is so much.

811
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,974
Speaker 0: You could not even come close to finding all the juicy bits everywhere.

812
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,580
Speaker 0: It would it just wouldn't happen.

813
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:44,240
Speaker 0: So let it be public and it won't really be public.

814
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,059
Speaker 0: It'll just be a big old haystack with a few needles that poke out now and then.

815
00:57:48,963 --> 00:58:00,549
Speaker 1: It would also just be a general net benefit to society because I think a lot of the corruption and this is obviously more Thursday territory and waste that occurs in our government is Effectively classified for no good reason.

816
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:04,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it there should be a fairly serious Disincentive to classifying things.

817
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:09,493
Speaker 1: if the security is a giant pain in the ass Some senator is not gonna classify everything he does.

818
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:10,799
Speaker 1: It'll be a giant pain in the ass.

819
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:15,360
Speaker 0: Oh, that's all that says is a catch-22 right because too much is classified.

820
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:15,982
Speaker 0: They know it.

821
00:58:16,022 --> 00:58:19,294
Speaker 0: they won't make it a pain in the ass right security wise.

822
00:58:19,314 --> 00:58:20,800
Speaker 0: so then everything leaks out.

823
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:26,900
Speaker 0: But if they made it a pain in the ass Oh, we couldn't really classify that much because it'd be too much a pain in the ass.

824
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,115
Speaker 1: You know and I do point out as far as I can tell nothing top secret is in this.

825
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:31,858
Speaker 1: it was all secret.

826
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:34,107
Speaker 0: and yes Secret is millions of people.

827
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:34,750
Speaker 0: top secret.

828
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,000
Speaker 0: I think is a lot less people doesn't Britain?

829
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,320
Speaker 1: I don't know exactly how many Britain has like another level about top top above top secret.

830
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:43,780
Speaker 0: I'm sure there is stuff that is ultra secret.

831
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:46,047
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's stuff that the president doesn't know.

832
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:51,865
Speaker 0: that's like relegated to pictures of the president's penis or his lack thereof Stuff like that.

833
00:58:51,925 --> 00:58:53,051
Speaker 1: I think the president would know.

834
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:58,478
Speaker 0: well, I mean this stuff for example I know is like ultra secret is like when the president goes to stay somewhere, right?

835
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:06,259
Speaker 0: They always have two or more possible places He might be sleeping right and which one he's actually sleeping in that night is like the ultra.

836
00:59:06,279 --> 00:59:06,901
Speaker 1: see now You know what?

837
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:10,316
Speaker 1: I'm fine with that, but it shouldn't be secret more than a couple weeks.

838
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:15,458
Speaker 0: The thing is No other leader in the world as anything remotely close to that kind of.

839
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:16,964
Speaker 0: yeah But we are leader.

840
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:20,819
Speaker 0: comes the Prime Minister's of most countries just drive to work on in their own cars.

841
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:26,457
Speaker 1: I will agree that I think our president has slightly more to worry about than other.

842
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:34,900
Speaker 0: Yes, I do Obviously, but I think that they go a little bit overboard and it also limits the freedoms of the president in a way that I Would not tolerate if I were the president.

843
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:37,155
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's a totally know.

844
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:41,636
Speaker 1: the president, you know There'd be video on the news of me like running away from the Secret Service.

845
00:59:41,656 --> 00:59:42,500
Speaker 0: You wouldn't get away.

846
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,890
Speaker 0: They would get you so fast.

847
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:44,837
Speaker 1: and then the awesome.

848
00:59:44,937 --> 00:59:47,210
Speaker 1: every day There's a video of me getting tackled by the city.

849
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:48,516
Speaker 0: They would hate you so much.

850
00:59:48,556 --> 00:59:49,300
Speaker 0: You'd have a black guy.

851
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,123
Speaker 0: You'd have to explain it.

852
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:52,072
Speaker 0: Yeah punch me in the face.

853
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:54,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just trying to get a burger.

854
00:59:56,303 --> 01:00:01,149
Speaker 0: You got to do the Bill Clinton method where you have a. you know They clear the route to go to the Mickey D's.

855
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,016
Speaker 0: Anyway, you could have the chef make you one.

856
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:03,759
Speaker 0: You don't need any.

857
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,795
Speaker 0: so Well, we went to presidential security.

858
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:18,451
Speaker 0: so yeah The thing is if you actually only classify a little bit of stuff and made it a pain in the ass Those few people who needed all those secrets would have the giant pain in the ass.

859
01:00:18,472 --> 01:00:28,300
Speaker 0: security of physical keys and maybe bio Scanning and you know frickin public-private ultra encryption and computers that are totally physically separate.

860
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,214
Speaker 1: How they made perfect encryption back in World War.

861
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:33,077
Speaker 0: two one time pad.

862
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:38,936
Speaker 1: old ladies Spinning bingo things pulling out random letters and handwriting one time pads.

863
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:40,160
Speaker 1: That's pretty damn random.

864
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:41,749
Speaker 0: That's about as good as it gets.

865
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:43,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do it a little faster.

866
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,011
Speaker 0: We could use ultra bingo instead of regular Bing.

867
01:00:46,031 --> 01:00:47,760
Speaker 1: We have way more old ladies now.

868
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,778
Speaker 0: That's where five bingo balls come out at once and this is ten old ladies anyway.

869
01:00:53,861 --> 01:00:58,940
Speaker 0: So now you've got so we've told you how to secure the government information and how to be better at being WikiLeaks.

870
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:03,340
Speaker 0: How do you what do you do if you're the guy trying to get the government information and give it to WikiLeaks?

871
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,966
Speaker 1: Well, let's do two things there.

872
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:13,720
Speaker 1: because because I don't want to talk about general personal security But I think our last two sides of this are that I want to release ultra secret information to be cool like WikiLeaks.

873
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:19,300
Speaker 1: And then the side effect is if I'm that person, how do I protect my own personal evil stuff?

874
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,291
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you got a. how do you get the information?

875
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:22,780
Speaker 0: and then how do you not go to jail forever?

876
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,393
Speaker 0: Cuz let me tell you they're not really going after WikiLeaks.

877
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,197
Speaker 0: so much right.

878
01:01:26,217 --> 01:01:26,780
Speaker 0: the authorities.

879
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,800
Speaker 0: They're gonna try to find out there the people who leak these things to WikiLeaks.

880
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,531
Speaker 0: I gotta get the hammer brought down on them so hard.

881
01:01:34,631 --> 01:01:36,878
Speaker 0: What is gonna be like Thor is gonna go.

882
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:39,093
Speaker 0: Oh shit All right, what is the hammer come down?

883
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:39,800
Speaker 1: What is funny?

884
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:49,465
Speaker 1: Is that many of these cables were basically leaders of other Arab nations saying yeah just between you and me fucker on Just bomb the shit out of him.

885
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:50,910
Speaker 1: Well, we care serious.

886
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,251
Speaker 1: Yeah.

887
01:01:51,452 --> 01:01:53,720
Speaker 0: All right, you wanted to all right, so you do it big mouth.

888
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:54,624
Speaker 0: That's what I would say.

889
01:01:54,785 --> 01:01:56,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but a lot.

890
01:01:56,534 --> 01:01:57,800
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't have the balls to do it.

891
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,704
Speaker 0: That's what I thought a lot of.

892
01:01:58,744 --> 01:02:00,632
Speaker 1: it was basically the entire Arab world being.

893
01:02:00,994 --> 01:02:05,219
Speaker 1: yeah, we can't say this publicly But they're the biggest threat to the Middle East right now.

894
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:11,780
Speaker 1: And Ahmadinejad came out today after you know, obviously he read all this and that's it's funny.

895
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:19,074
Speaker 1: It's kind of like seeing a group of friends where someone just like played back the phone Conversation that no one else had heard and now everyone's pissed.

896
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:20,480
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he came out.

897
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:27,460
Speaker 1: He basically tried to say that the entire cable leak was orchestrated by the US government to discredit his regime.

898
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:33,217
Speaker 1: Anyway, but if you want to do the leaking you basically one.

899
01:02:33,257 --> 01:02:34,120
Speaker 1: you should use true crypt.

900
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,440
Speaker 1: You gotta have denial encryption.

901
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:36,624
Speaker 1: You've got to be.

902
01:02:36,744 --> 01:02:43,145
Speaker 0: you've got to actually like if you care about this level one take advantage of the really shitty Security that we just described.

903
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:51,960
Speaker 0: Yes, if their security is really high don't even bother because if the security is high enough It'll basically be impossible for you to actually do anything, right?

904
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,414
Speaker 0: You know, you'll have your own key and then they'll know up.

905
01:02:54,555 --> 01:02:55,440
Speaker 0: That was the key that was used.

906
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,120
Speaker 0: We know who did it and even if you didn't do it was your key.

907
01:02:58,301 --> 01:02:59,873
Speaker 0: So odds of you doing it a very high.

908
01:02:59,933 --> 01:03:00,840
Speaker 0: so you're going to you know.

909
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:05,466
Speaker 0: But think you might think of number one Munch the data.

910
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,794
Speaker 1: that's a technical term for say you thought you've got a photograph of like American soldiers committing a war crime or something like.

911
01:03:11,814 --> 01:03:12,840
Speaker 1: you've got the photograph.

912
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:22,339
Speaker 1: Don't just put it on the internet because there's a not unreasonable chance that there's some sort of Saginographic key or watermark that might identify it back to you.

913
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,608
Speaker 1: Especially don't put the actual file that you got.

914
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:31,330
Speaker 1: what you here's is one to open it up in the gimp and save it as A couple of times.

915
01:03:31,793 --> 01:03:32,820
Speaker 0: that's not the best idea.

916
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,355
Speaker 1: Here's what you really want to do take a picture of the monitor and then use that as the photo.

917
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:37,460
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

918
01:03:38,622 --> 01:03:40,940
Speaker 0: What a really the thing is they might even get the information out of that.

919
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:45,556
Speaker 0: What you really want to do is you want to get some really good photo doctoring.

920
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:46,540
Speaker 0: We're talking about a photo, right?

921
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,780
Speaker 0: So let's say I got a photo of rim shooting somebody right and oh my god, that shouldn't happen.

922
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:54,598
Speaker 0: He's like just hosing civilians down babies, right?

923
01:03:55,582 --> 01:04:00,380
Speaker 0: Let me doc let me doctor this photo to get a picture from the other angle.

924
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:05,279
Speaker 0: So now you don't even realize, you know, it's still a picture of right what it is.

925
01:04:05,904 --> 01:04:07,801
Speaker 0: But you don't even you know It's.

926
01:04:07,902 --> 01:04:12,400
Speaker 0: it's basically a completely doctored photo that looks like and they might come out and say all that photo was done.

927
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,899
Speaker 1: I was about to say there's the danger and the more you manage something the more people might try to discredit it.

928
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:17,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

929
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:22,340
Speaker 1: But that's why the insurance file and this is this is part two.

930
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,059
Speaker 1: We'll get to that later.

931
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:29,660
Speaker 1: If you take the original original and you put it out there encrypted and you've got the private key say you get arrested.

932
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:33,232
Speaker 1: You can use that as straight-up blackmail.

933
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:35,299
Speaker 1: Yep to possibly get out of it.

934
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,339
Speaker 0: And the thing is right, you know.

935
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:38,846
Speaker 0: even if you what are they gonna do?

936
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:43,285
Speaker 0: even if they give you the death penalty and you go to death row you still get To mail a letter to somebody.

937
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:46,880
Speaker 0: you just write that key down in the mail into the post office.

938
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:50,477
Speaker 1: Obviously if they if the government was serious, they just wouldn't deliver that letter.

939
01:04:50,497 --> 01:04:51,120
Speaker 1: They just take it.

940
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:54,772
Speaker 0: The point is you can still get it out somehow right.

941
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:56,460
Speaker 0: you get last words that are then published.

942
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,527
Speaker 0: What are your last words?

943
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:59,519
Speaker 0: a Q are seven?

944
01:05:00,581 --> 01:05:01,830
Speaker 1: You know what they would do.

945
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:02,978
Speaker 1: they'd manage that shit.

946
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:06,834
Speaker 0: The thing is it would you know people it would work out.

947
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,040
Speaker 1: You've got to be more clever about it.

948
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,846
Speaker 1: Your mom's got to have it.

949
01:05:08,907 --> 01:05:13,487
Speaker 1: Maybe you wrote it on the wall Somewhere like you defeated it somewhere.

950
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:14,391
Speaker 1: No one would ever look.

951
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:16,680
Speaker 0: you got to do the Hannibal Lecter trick with the classified ads.

952
01:05:16,923 --> 01:05:17,878
Speaker 1: That's a good trick.

953
01:05:18,601 --> 01:05:21,011
Speaker 1: Actually, I would argue that that's what a lot of spam is that.

954
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:31,374
Speaker 1: in fact if I was going to distribute You know text data or munge photographs in a way that I really Needed to be there in case I got offed spam guy a good idea.

955
01:05:31,454 --> 01:05:32,820
Speaker 1: Spam is how I would do it.

956
01:05:33,081 --> 01:05:41,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean because the guy who sent the spam he just says I don't know I got this spam and I got some money from some bank account and I sent my spam and now everyone in the world Has this picture.

957
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:56,061
Speaker 1: so say are not even just the picture staying in a graphic spam even Staganography in terms of distribution Especially because usually you're not alone like there's an image in the spam and then in the image is the is the private key and then Everyone.

958
01:05:56,101 --> 01:06:00,676
Speaker 0: you have the key to decrypt the actual photo of the horrible war crime.

959
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:02,020
Speaker 1: like say you're a guy.

960
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:03,267
Speaker 0: Someone would figure it out.

961
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:04,655
Speaker 0: Look at the shit that nerds figure out.

962
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:05,359
Speaker 0: They would figure it out.

963
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,698
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean say you're a guy who gets this information and obviously you need to munge it.

964
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:13,065
Speaker 1: I mean Say it's just a text file.

965
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:18,120
Speaker 1: there might be purposefully misspelled words throughout secret documents that are different for every person who accesses them.

966
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:20,109
Speaker 1: That's how I would protect documents.

967
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,099
Speaker 1: So it'd be really trivial to figure out, you know?

968
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the word road was misspelled six times in this document.

969
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,255
Speaker 1: The only person whose document was like that was Joe Bob who works in Alabama.

970
01:06:29,275 --> 01:06:30,360
Speaker 1: arrest his fucking ass.

971
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anything has access logs, right?

972
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,314
Speaker 0: For example, this WikiLeaks guy.

973
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:40,411
Speaker 0: He dumped basically all these Embassy things, right If he just downloaded them all at once.

974
01:06:40,432 --> 01:06:44,739
Speaker 0: they can just look in the access logs and be like Oh, here's the only person who downloaded everything at once.

975
01:06:45,841 --> 01:06:51,726
Speaker 0: You want to download like one at a time here and there and it's got to make sense in terms of stuff that you would Be looking at here and there.

976
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:54,296
Speaker 0: also you can't have any sort of usage pattern.

977
01:06:54,316 --> 01:06:55,260
Speaker 0: that is out of the ordinary.

978
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,660
Speaker 1: You have to be careful not to reveal too much.

979
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:02,675
Speaker 1: Like if you take a whole dump of something and put it out What you did not include is very telling.

980
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:04,499
Speaker 1: as to what access yeah It's like, you know.

981
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:08,415
Speaker 0: so if I dump everything all at once and then release it all at once we know who did it.

982
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:13,432
Speaker 0: if I only look at Ten documents and the release has those ten documents and say huh who has access?

983
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:15,760
Speaker 0: who looked at these ten documents and no other documents?

984
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:21,955
Speaker 0: Oh that guy right your access pattern and your usage patterns cannot match up with the don't.

985
01:07:21,995 --> 01:07:24,020
Speaker 1: I just realized there's probably some schmuck somewhere.

986
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:29,899
Speaker 1: Who was told by like an IT manager to take a like an archive and he downloaded everything like a week ago.

987
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:39,120
Speaker 0: better Better yet someone else right does all the using and You know, it's all the access logs have their name on it, right?

988
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,748
Speaker 0: So your friend looks at a document.

989
01:07:41,009 --> 01:07:43,120
Speaker 0: you you dump it and you get the document from him.

990
01:07:43,441 --> 01:07:44,746
Speaker 0: Someone else looks at a document.

991
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:45,790
Speaker 0: get the document from them.

992
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:47,417
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna else gets a document.

993
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:48,240
Speaker 0: you get the document from them.

994
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,229
Speaker 0: So now you're collecting documents all these different users of the system.

995
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,800
Speaker 1: and I'll point out you want all these documents easily be an IT guy.

996
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,174
Speaker 0: Yeah So you've collected a hundred documents from you know, 50 different people.

997
01:07:59,234 --> 01:08:00,900
Speaker 0: and then when they go and they say who does this dump?

998
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:03,556
Speaker 0: You know who has an at usage pattern that matches this dump?

999
01:08:03,978 --> 01:08:04,240
Speaker 0: nobody.

1000
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:06,910
Speaker 0: So now it's like well what the who the fuck did it?

1001
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:07,774
Speaker 0: We have no way to tell.

1002
01:08:08,115 --> 01:08:08,838
Speaker 1: so you've got a munch.

1003
01:08:08,859 --> 01:08:09,441
Speaker 1: the data You know.

1004
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:13,233
Speaker 1: do some seds throw some random stuff here and there just to throw it off.

1005
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:16,424
Speaker 1: if you can do a statistical analysis Look for any anomalies.

1006
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:16,987
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1007
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:20,160
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't really have any advice on specifically how to do that.

1008
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:26,580
Speaker 1: I also don't want to aid in a very felons be a computer scientist or a math statistician.

1009
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:32,256
Speaker 0: And then now you've got to get these Documents and you got to give them to the WikiLeaks.

1010
01:08:32,296 --> 01:08:34,466
Speaker 0: guys, you know They have a procedure for general.

1011
01:08:34,546 --> 01:08:42,493
Speaker 1: in general if you you've you've gotten some sort of document and you want to get it out To the public through an intermediary as opposed to directly.

1012
01:08:42,795 --> 01:08:44,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why WikiLeaks exists.

1013
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,629
Speaker 0: You don't want to put up your own thing.

1014
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:49,102
Speaker 1: Staganography and strange Basically.

1015
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:50,305
Speaker 1: here's an example.

1016
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:57,167
Speaker 1: So I go to a Counter-Strike server and I spray the picture on the wall And someone looks at it.

1017
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:00,140
Speaker 1: who the fuck is going to be monitoring that?

1018
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:15,160
Speaker 0: You go into a Counter-Strike server spray the URL of some IP address of some machine that you set up and a Starbucks right You know on the wall and then people start visiting the web server that's hiding in the corner.

1019
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:24,380
Speaker 0: You just you left the laptop under the couch in a Starbucks connected to the wireless Plugged into an outlet that's behind the couch and it's running this web server that's serving up all this shit.

1020
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:29,134
Speaker 0: It'll take them a long time to go find that and by then people have downloaded everything from the laptop.

1021
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:33,613
Speaker 1: now not that useful For direct or distribution to people.

1022
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,582
Speaker 1: you don't know that well because you either have to set They're gonna.

1023
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:38,300
Speaker 0: the thing is they're gonna check the security cameras in the Starbucks.

1024
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,930
Speaker 0: So make sure that you're in with the Starbucks before or drive-by.

1025
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:42,693
Speaker 1: do it outside.

1026
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:44,779
Speaker 1: use a Pringles can from a car down the road.

1027
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, make you got to do it somewhere where there is no security cameras because they'll see you setting up this computer.

1028
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:54,863
Speaker 0: You know, you got to do it like in you know, but the back alley behind the Starbucks, you know And

1029
01:09:54,884 --> 01:10:00,556
Speaker 1: I played it late at night Car battery hooked up to a netbook or even just a netbook with dress battery

1030
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,042
Speaker 0: dressed in all black Right

1031
01:10:02,163 --> 01:10:04,614
Speaker 1: with a with an Ubuntu live CD.

1032
01:10:04,775 --> 01:10:08,450
Speaker 0: Yes, just sitting there Transmitting the data that is something right.

1033
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:15,536
Speaker 0: when law enforcement gets a computer Basically what they do is they examine the hard drive on you know, the bit level.

1034
01:10:15,556 --> 01:10:16,860
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't have a hard drive.

1035
01:10:17,364 --> 01:10:19,060
Speaker 0: Oh, there's no hard drive in this computer, right?

1036
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,730
Speaker 0: They probably made a stupid move and turned it off.

1037
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:23,496
Speaker 0: and now everything that was in RAM is gone.

1038
01:10:23,516 --> 01:10:24,520
Speaker 0: and what's left in the computer?

1039
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:27,598
Speaker 0: A live CD that's got a blank OS with nothing on it.

1040
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:27,960
Speaker 0: They lost.

1041
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:35,070
Speaker 1: You know, I think we've talked about that specific idea before because that's like 101 how to distribute data.

1042
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:36,800
Speaker 1: but a good plan.

1043
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,795
Speaker 1: This is more for the people who are really serious about this paranoid types physical giving to someone.

1044
01:10:41,815 --> 01:10:47,190
Speaker 1: Oh No having Predefined codes among people you trust.

1045
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:51,629
Speaker 1: I'll give you an example a very personal example And this is something I did with some friends.

1046
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:53,135
Speaker 1: This isn't even FRC people.

1047
01:10:53,176 --> 01:10:55,810
Speaker 1: This is just some other people I know out in the wide world.

1048
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,299
Speaker 1: I haven't talked to some of these people in years.

1049
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:12,480
Speaker 1: there's a code word that we came up with and it was our oh shit code word and Basically it refers to a place a Time a color a whole bunch of different unrelated things and to know what it's referring to requires context.

1050
01:11:13,086 --> 01:11:17,208
Speaker 1: So if the shit hits the fan We know if we don't hear anything from anyone.

1051
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:20,537
Speaker 1: meet at the place referred to by Daedalus at the time.

1052
01:11:20,597 --> 01:11:21,600
Speaker 1: referred to by Daedalus.

1053
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:22,906
Speaker 1: That's my word.

1054
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:25,800
Speaker 1: You'll that no one's gonna remember this and I don't plan to use this word.

1055
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,619
Speaker 1: But mmm, so, you know have your Daedalus word.

1056
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:37,255
Speaker 1: So say I tell Scott I'm being arrested and I yell the color Daedalus and Scott knows that's the color purple Which we also know refers to this diner.

1057
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,759
Speaker 1: We ate at Otacon four years ago, and I probably left something in the bathroom there hidden.

1058
01:11:43,643 --> 01:11:47,840
Speaker 1: Yep, you know something like that a code and actually is hiding something in a bathroom.

1059
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:49,110
Speaker 0: Is it really still gonna be there?

1060
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:50,420
Speaker 0: All right, you got to do a better job than that.

1061
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:56,538
Speaker 1: Well when I say in a bathroom, I mean like when I found those drugs in the wall behind the urinal At that rest stop.

1062
01:11:57,561 --> 01:11:59,148
Speaker 1: There are ways to hide things in places.

1063
01:11:59,209 --> 01:12:00,052
Speaker 1: No one will ever look.

1064
01:12:00,374 --> 01:12:01,740
Speaker 0: the thing is right is like.

1065
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:11,980
Speaker 0: I've seen people hiding stuff like in telephone, you know booths in payphone thingies in New York City, and it's like Yeah, you know that's not really a very good.

1066
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:14,212
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what the long-term or short-term is.

1067
01:12:14,273 --> 01:12:21,720
Speaker 1: and usually when I say these codes So those are just examples the long-term codes are the ones that are contextual to where you use the code.

1068
01:12:22,102 --> 01:12:22,485
Speaker 1: Like say.

1069
01:12:22,525 --> 01:12:29,540
Speaker 1: you say, you know, I've got the data I'll give it to you a data list and your friends out there know what that means.

1070
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:41,168
Speaker 1: Maybe they remember that that means log into this counter-strike server You know X hours after you make that statement and it'll be there in a specific form Mmm, and just have you.

1071
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:43,920
Speaker 0: definitely that's the thing with a game like counter-strike, right?

1072
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:54,060
Speaker 0: You're pretty good because you can run the server yourself in a safe place and not have any logs or anything And you can even connect to it in an encrypted way with SSH tunnels and those are probably better.

1073
01:12:54,441 --> 01:12:58,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, no MMOs are actually probably worse because there are logs on some server.

1074
01:12:58,616 --> 01:13:01,188
Speaker 0: You do not control though You know the blizzard server or whatever.

1075
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:02,474
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what.

1076
01:13:02,515 --> 01:13:13,668
Speaker 0: however, you know It's like if I have a counter-strike server Everyone can SSH to it perfectly secure and then through the SSH tunnel connect to the counter-strike server or IRC server That's running on localhost only on that server.

1077
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,759
Speaker 0: Right and then that's it doesn't get better than that.

1078
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:19,860
Speaker 1: Maybe you've got a hamachi out there just waiting for someone to connect.

1079
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:20,783
Speaker 0: No, but he's gonna.

1080
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:22,570
Speaker 0: you know, there's no way that they're gonna.

1081
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:23,372
Speaker 0: they're just gonna see.

1082
01:13:23,653 --> 01:13:25,500
Speaker 0: someone's got a hosted machine at line node.

1083
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,180
Speaker 0: It's running a website for some WordPress blog.

1084
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:41,475
Speaker 1: I guess though the moral of all that because obviously we jumped around a whole bunch just now is Have a data list of some kind which I'm just gonna say means Way before you plan to engage in any sort of espionage or anything like this.

1085
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:52,026
Speaker 1: You have to have already established An intelligence groundwork as in drop locations trusted friends codes between friends You have to lay the stuff down.

1086
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:55,140
Speaker 0: even public-private keys don't work unless you share public keys with everybody.

1087
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:03,735
Speaker 1: You've got to lay this stuff down years before you decide to do anything shady if you actually really care About the security and effectiveness of said shadiness.

1088
01:14:04,097 --> 01:14:08,900
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, we're basically giving people the like the solid book for how to commit crimes.

1089
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:11,655
Speaker 0: It's not how to commit crimes, but it could be used for that.

1090
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:13,705
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter There's nothing wrong with that.

1091
01:14:14,066 --> 01:14:25,011
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I mean what's if it's criminal to tell people Hey people look use the publicly and freely available Open-source SSH technology to do whatever you want.

1092
01:14:25,412 --> 01:14:26,435
Speaker 0: It's like it's.

1093
01:14:26,535 --> 01:14:28,180
Speaker 0: I'm surprised the government is not an Italian.

1094
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:33,337
Speaker 1: You know the fact government they did remember when the government tried to declare PGP.

1095
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:37,130
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that I'm surprised they haven't made illegal.

1096
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,957
Speaker 0: I'm surprised they aren't using it themselves.

1097
01:14:38,997 --> 01:14:39,720
Speaker 0: They're so than stupid.

1098
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:46,383
Speaker 1: We already know why because there's too much classified information and as a result too many people need access and it's too much of a Pain in the ass.

1099
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:48,816
Speaker 1: So the security is dumbed down to the lowest common senator.

1100
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:51,893
Speaker 1: So to be secure That's my new term the LCS the lowest common senator.

1101
01:14:51,914 --> 01:14:56,794
Speaker 0: So TLDR To steal information find someone who's not being secure enough.

1102
01:14:56,915 --> 01:15:01,359
Speaker 0: and to be secure Go through the pain in the ass of all this stuff you have to do to make it.

1103
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:12,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think it would be a real pain in the ass for me and Scott to now Establish a whole series of dataless words and drop points and procedures and plans.

1104
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:17,889
Speaker 1: and if any of us gets arrested and X days go by do you know all these things that you've just got memorized?

1105
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:23,157
Speaker 1: and It would take we'd have to set this up now if we wanted to do something the four years from now.

1106
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,954
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe we should set this stuff up now.

1107
01:15:26,336 --> 01:15:26,819
Speaker 0: It's all you.

1108
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:32,058
Speaker 0: Because I'm not into it's not my department.

1109
01:15:32,701 --> 01:15:37,180
Speaker 1: I'll take a departure because I don't know if we'll be able to do a Thursday on WikiLeaks.

1110
01:15:37,381 --> 01:15:40,795
Speaker 1: We got other Thursdays coming up, but from a moral perspective.

1111
01:15:40,815 --> 01:15:55,684
Speaker 1: I would just like to say that I while I respect the fact that people may die as a result of WikiLeaks, I Am currently of the mind that an organization like WikiLeaks is very important to the well-being of the world because too much is too Secret right now.

1112
01:15:55,825 --> 01:15:56,006
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1113
01:15:56,066 --> 01:15:57,313
Speaker 0: I'm also basically my.

1114
01:15:57,434 --> 01:16:12,886
Speaker 0: my general feeling is If you are in a situation where just the availability of information is a serious threat to you then that means that you have security through obscurity and not actual security and That's the real problem.

1115
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:17,180
Speaker 1: But at the same time for example say there is a top-secret document.

1116
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,279
Speaker 1: Obviously there hasn't really been anything top-secret on WikiLeaks like this.

1117
01:16:20,521 --> 01:16:24,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, you know, we've got a real operative who's I'm just gonna make up something crazy.

1118
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,960
Speaker 1: He's in the inner circle of the North Korean government.

1119
01:16:28,522 --> 01:16:39,400
Speaker 1: Basically when the time comes to invade he is there ready to basically shut down the command-and-control system To prevent the artillery from going off to Seoul and we're just waiting to activate him when the invasions happen.

1120
01:16:39,883 --> 01:16:42,740
Speaker 1: I'm okay with the government keeping that secret.

1121
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:44,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda.

1122
01:16:45,106 --> 01:16:45,929
Speaker 1: I'm a hundred percent.

1123
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:46,612
Speaker 1: Okay with that.

1124
01:16:47,114 --> 01:16:52,471
Speaker 0: However, but I mean if we Just for my ideals you don't even need that guy.

1125
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:54,176
Speaker 1: Yeah pragmatism we need that guy.

1126
01:16:54,296 --> 01:16:55,079
Speaker 0: Yeah pragmatism.

1127
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:55,560
Speaker 0: We need that guy.

1128
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,330
Speaker 1: I'm gonna argue why ideals don't work in this situation.

1129
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,714
Speaker 1: We have to go with rationalism.

1130
01:17:00,774 --> 01:17:04,460
Speaker 1: and rationalism and pragmatism Is that what is the moral of trygun?

1131
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,880
Speaker 1: Not that pacifism is a failed philosophy that you should try for anyway, but that one gigantic asshole can ruin everybody's day.

1132
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:16,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are gigantic assholes and until we solve that we have to be pragmatic.

1133
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:23,420
Speaker 1: I'm okay with keeping Espionage secret as long as the espionage is being used ostensibly for the betterment of the world.

1134
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,809
Speaker 0: But if people weren't dicks, you wouldn't need to espionage them.

1135
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I agree, but people are dicks.

1136
01:17:29,142 --> 01:17:30,487
Speaker 0: Stop being dick, dude.

1137
01:17:30,668 --> 01:17:33,980
Speaker 1: I ran into a dick on the sidewalk on the way home from work.

1138
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:36,789
Speaker 1: He was yelling at some guy who bumped into him like a dick.

1139
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:38,755
Speaker 1: I mean, there's people like that.

1140
01:17:39,336 --> 01:17:40,500
Speaker 0: Those people are not good.

1141
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,828
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know what to do about that.

1142
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:49,160
Speaker 1: that's a separate problem, but Considering that most of what WikiLeaks has released are things that I don't think should have been hidden.

1143
01:17:49,240 --> 01:18:04,171
Speaker 1: Anyway, like while the Iraq war stuff was harmful in a lot of ways and possibly did kill people I would argue that the that Hiding war crimes is a worse crime Almost than having the war crimes having been committed because that is willful.

1144
01:18:04,512 --> 01:18:07,500
Speaker 1: that is willful on a level that I just can't abide in.

1145
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,682
Speaker 0: Yeah You know.

1146
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:16,163
Speaker 0: yet they really examine each different piece of information that was leaked and make a judgment on each and every one Individually,

1147
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:17,832
Speaker 1: I mean I'll say this say I

1148
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:26,445
Speaker 0: and the thing that you know The fact is the vast majority of the state the text that was leaked is of no interest to anyone and so therefore You know, really?

1149
01:18:26,726 --> 01:18:27,369
Speaker 0: What's what's?

1150
01:18:27,389 --> 01:18:35,060
Speaker 1: the first two examples say I found on my own Evidence that the Democrats and the Republicans colluded together to control government some vast conspiracy.

1151
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:49,540
Speaker 1: I would leak that like without even thinking say I found direct evidence that the United States was directly right now planning a Joint coalition invasion and pacification of North Korea followed by an occupation and I somehow had all the plans for it.

1152
01:18:50,124 --> 01:18:51,071
Speaker 1: I wouldn't leak that shit.

1153
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:53,104
Speaker 1: I Just let it go.

1154
01:18:53,184 --> 01:18:54,531
Speaker 1: I'd let them do it first.

1155
01:18:54,973 --> 01:18:59,365
Speaker 0: now once it happened Within a real thing.

1156
01:18:59,686 --> 01:19:01,491
Speaker 0: what if you didn't want them to do it?

1157
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:04,680
Speaker 1: Well, then I'd leak it also, right?

1158
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:05,704
Speaker 0: Think about this.

1159
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:08,260
Speaker 0: All right, theoretically at least right?

1160
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,079
Speaker 0: They have this plan to do this thing.

1161
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:17,133
Speaker 0: If the plan is a good really good plan Then the plan will work whether the other guy knows our plan or not.

1162
01:19:17,213 --> 01:19:25,748
Speaker 1: now because I think it's a really good plan to have A 20-year agent who is now like the head of the Korean military who when the invasion happens It's just like I'll launch all the artillery.

1163
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:29,102
Speaker 1: you guys get in the bunker and then he's like, yeah, they're all down there Come on in.

1164
01:19:29,384 --> 01:19:30,750
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, it's a great plan.

1165
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,040
Speaker 0: It depends if it's like straight really great plan.

1166
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:33,582
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

1167
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:36,271
Speaker 0: Is it stratego or is it advanced wars?

1168
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:36,712
Speaker 0: Right?

1169
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,759
Speaker 0: Is there fog of war or is there not?

1170
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,072
Speaker 1: So here's the thing in the real world fog of war.

1171
01:19:41,093 --> 01:19:45,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda Yeah, I think we've gone on enough.

1172
01:19:45,631 --> 01:19:46,053
Speaker 1: I'm tired.
