1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,345
Speaker 0: It's Thursday January 15th.

2
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:12,770
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,618
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:16,300
Speaker 0: It's a Thursday.

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,539
Speaker 0: We talk about faking one's death.

6
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:31,283
Speaker 1: Let's do this Now.

7
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:40,934
Speaker 0: longtime listeners might have expected me to or Scott to open with the classic woman Because it's a little cold up here in beacon.

8
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,600
Speaker 1: It is like the coldest day.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,945
Speaker 1: I think it might have been colder like today and yesterday than like any Rochester day I can remember.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,318
Speaker 0: no no no no no no you know.

11
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:56,860
Speaker 1: granted My memory is not you know like in Rochester all the cold days sort of blur together into one.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:08,120
Speaker 0: When we lived in Rochester we were becoming Lichened unto the gods in terms of the ability we had like I was thinking more lichened unto the abominable snowmen.

13
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,570
Speaker 0: We had like plus 15 cold resistance.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,140
Speaker 0: you needed at least a fifth level spell of cold to get us.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,270
Speaker 1: I mean there was that wizard on the quarter mile.

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,360
Speaker 1: He cast Kona cold at everyone, but no one noticed.

17
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:22,908
Speaker 1: I Was the only one who saw him there.

18
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:28,274
Speaker 1: like does anyone notice this guy, but people are like hey It doesn't hurt anybody in fact if you miss the saving throw.

19
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:29,399
Speaker 0: It's kind of balmy.

20
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:53,724
Speaker 0: But now I think today warrants the bringing back of a Terminology that I haven't really used since I was at RIT because it only ever really applied at RIT and once we left Rochester Until today I had not encountered Temperatures worthy of it, but you see at RIT like every student when we got there It's fucking cold.

21
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,811
Speaker 0: It was it was real cold.

22
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:59,506
Speaker 1: We had not yet learned about the coldness of space And how woman it is.

23
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,400
Speaker 0: I mean I'd grown up in Michigan.

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:07,940
Speaker 0: I was used to cold, but what I wasn't used to is walking long distances in said cold.

25
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,660
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm Connecticut is not a warm place in the winter either.

26
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,432
Speaker 1: But it was not like part of it that Rochester.

27
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:17,700
Speaker 0: when you're a freshman all right you get to class.

28
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:24,720
Speaker 0: Even if you take like the scary frat tunnels and every tunnel you can get to get as close to the academic side as possible.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,235
Speaker 0: even if you use buses You've still got to walk a long way in the cold.

30
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:36,500
Speaker 0: even if you drive You have like I had to park further from my classes when I drove to campus.

31
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,939
Speaker 0: Then like I had to drive to get to work.

32
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:43,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I drew I would drive sometimes the other side of campus.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,380
Speaker 1: But because I didn't have a fancy permit I had to park in this faraway lot and in that faraway lot

34
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:51,385
Speaker 0: I

35
00:02:51,445 --> 00:03:01,585
Speaker 1: had to walk to the building and that walk to the building Was just as far almost as far as the walk like across campus You know using tunnels.

36
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:02,227
Speaker 0: it was.

37
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:06,540
Speaker 0: it was like two minutes less far, which is the only reason we drove all the time.

38
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:19,438
Speaker 0: yeah, right, but I I remember very specifically that when I would walk outside and when any of us would walk outside in these cold winter mornings Only one syllable could be uttered and that syllable was fuck.

39
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:21,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you wouldn't expect it.

40
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:33,551
Speaker 0: you walk outside and You start to go and suddenly you realize how cold it is that warmth that you built up from being inside and the coat is Gone and all you can do is stop and say fuck

41
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:43,646
Speaker 1: even if you got the fancy coat where you tie it down low to keep the wind air from getting in and you got the fancy gloves that seal around with the wrist velcro like I have and The whole rubber bands around the legs.

42
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,280
Speaker 1: even the hot air just as soon as you walk out through it escapes.

43
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:48,629
Speaker 1: I don't know where it escapes.

44
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:49,939
Speaker 1: It just gets right out.

45
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,326
Speaker 0: now We used to say and by we I mean everyone at RIT when it was cold out you'd walk out you go It's fucking cold.

46
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,712
Speaker 0: Fuck this fuck.

47
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,304
Speaker 0: we would say fuck a lot But it doesn't.

48
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:07,228
Speaker 0: it got to the point to where we had our own language where the word fuck Meant very specifically cold.

49
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,300
Speaker 0: if it was cold out you didn't say woman it is cold out there.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,904
Speaker 0: That's who we didn't.

51
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:12,708
Speaker 1: we didn't learn that yet.

52
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,439
Speaker 0: No, we didn't learn woman until I got to IVM.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,512
Speaker 0: But you would say good friend who was a sophomore at RIT.

54
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,720
Speaker 0: It is fuck outside today.

55
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,427
Speaker 1: Why not only is it fuck outside today?

56
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,613
Speaker 0: It is also fucking now fucking.

57
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,860
Speaker 0: it was equivalent to snowing.

58
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:36,760
Speaker 1: Yes, you like the Eskimos we develop new words for snow because the Rochester snow was never that nice like snowball snow.

59
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:43,802
Speaker 0: It was always that like it would come down and freeze on things to where you had to spend about 10 minutes chipping your car Out there.

60
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:45,353
Speaker 1: also those two ice storms.

61
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:53,790
Speaker 0: Oh my god I was driving back to RIT from IVM for an anime music night When that second ice storm came.

62
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,360
Speaker 1: I mean the first time there's an ice storm.

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,945
Speaker 1: I'd never seen an ice storm like that.

64
00:04:57,086 --> 00:05:01,440
Speaker 0: I did a 180 on the freeway in that ice at like 60 miles an hour.

65
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:07,419
Speaker 0: I mean you're going down you're walking right and then 180 was followed by another 180 so I didn't die.

66
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,087
Speaker 1: there there are trees right and The trees have no leaves because winter obviously.

67
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:20,784
Speaker 1: but every single branch down to the tiniest tiniest branch on every tree is Covered in ice.

68
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:27,666
Speaker 1: it's like it's like someone made an ice sculpture of a tree and then put a tree in it And it matched that's.

69
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:42,538
Speaker 1: it was like there would be literally like you would have a branch That was like the tiniest branch like we're talking like millimeter diameter branch With that with like a two centimeter thick cylinder of ice just perfectly around it like a candle With a wick in it.

70
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,558
Speaker 1: You know where the ice is the wax and the wick is the tree.

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,498
Speaker 1: Of course remember and that's every single branch and every single tree.

72
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:58,480
Speaker 0: remember I think it was two katsu kansa go driving down to DC Over that Delaware bridge when there was like an inch and a half of ice covering every piece of that bridge.

73
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,686
Speaker 1: Oh, that was there.

74
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,640
Speaker 0: It was like falling down in sheets into the two side lanes.

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,968
Speaker 0: We had to like hide in the middle lane.

76
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,296
Speaker 1: That's pretty scary shit.

77
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:16,692
Speaker 0: That was awesome Yeah, but I think where these words came from specifically might I don't think it was just the fact that the only word the only syllable you could utter when stepping out into this cold was Fuck and the fuck wasn't so much.

78
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:22,320
Speaker 0: It wasn't just the surprise It was also the fact that you were resigned to the fact that you had to walk through it.

79
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,344
Speaker 0: You couldn't give up.

80
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:24,751
Speaker 0: You couldn't say fuck.

81
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,193
Speaker 0: It's cold.

82
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:25,776
Speaker 0: Never mind.

83
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:26,660
Speaker 0: It was fuck.

84
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:28,285
Speaker 0: I got to keep walking.

85
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:32,096
Speaker 0: my journey has just begun and it is nowhere near completion.

86
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:38,153
Speaker 1: So needless to say It's really cold here in New York, yeah, we're talking.

87
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:40,700
Speaker 1: I'd like to move you know to a tropical island.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,284
Speaker 1: Don't be nice.

89
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:43,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all the jobs are here and all the like.

90
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:44,020
Speaker 0: anime screening.

91
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,660
Speaker 1: Well, there actually is a job that is not here on a tropical island.

92
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

93
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:51,220
Speaker 0: I applied for that along with everyone else in the world.

94
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's cold.

95
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,758
Speaker 0: just for perspective for anyone out there.

96
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:06,146
Speaker 0: When we say cold in the fuck or woman perspective We mean below zero Fahrenheit saltwater freezing people.

97
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:11,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took a photo and like my car has a thermometer that tells you the temperature outside the car.

98
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:13,391
Speaker 1: I took a little picture of it this morning.

99
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,464
Speaker 1: It's a negative 11 C. That's cold.

100
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:19,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, but see who uses C. We're in America.

101
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:25,720
Speaker 1: I See, you know, in fact, it's like I use C to the point where I have.

102
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:35,140
Speaker 1: I have actually a little difficult time like it's weird as the temperatures get higher Right, like we're talking like, you know, 60, you know 50 60 70.

103
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:44,015
Speaker 1: It's like I understand Fahrenheit more, but when you get colder near the zeros like the freezing area I like I understand see more, you know,

104
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:52,980
Speaker 0: I think part of it is When you're going up hot a hundred degrees as is the point at which it moves from it's hot to it's unbearable

105
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:53,923
Speaker 1: Hundred degrees.

106
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:57,577
Speaker 1: C is you're boiling like a lobster, but it's not good.

107
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:58,440
Speaker 0: I'm talking about Fahrenheit.

108
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:12,169
Speaker 0: The magic number is a hundred but in Celsius the magic number where it starts getting kind of cold is zero Even though I think it depends on where you grow up because you know growing up in Michigan the number we worried about was zero Fahrenheit.

109
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,405
Speaker 0: because when saltwater freezes is when frostbite goes from That distant concern.

110
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:23,663
Speaker 0: if you go off hiking - I hope I don't get frostbite on my way to school today Mm-hmm.

111
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:32,480
Speaker 1: because saltwater freezes at that temperature and saltwater is yeah The ferry to a Newberg like what isn't running because there's so much ice in the Hudson River now.

112
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:40,960
Speaker 1: Usually the river doesn't get ice because the water is moving so it doesn't like to freeze But it's so cold that the ferry can't even bust the ice up.

113
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,080
Speaker 1: you

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:09:00,351
Speaker 0: know what though because this happened a couple times last year and the year before with that ferry but that I Beacon must be coming up in the world because they actually were announcing in Grand Central over the loudspeakers continuously before like whenever there was a train going up north at all saying the Beacon Newberg ferry is currently down due to ice conditions.

115
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,320
Speaker 0: Please go to the bus go to whatever and use the bus.

116
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:08,635
Speaker 1: Well, it's you just take the train as usual But instead of getting on the ferry you take a bus and they drive over the bridge.

117
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:09,500
Speaker 1: The bridge is just fine.

118
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,390
Speaker 0: Hey, it's better than what I used to live in poquoi.

119
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,159
Speaker 0: They were doing all that track work back in the day.

120
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:23,840
Speaker 0: So I would take the train to Southeast get off get on a school bus But then stop and all the different stations and basically go up the rest of the route.

121
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,565
Speaker 1: That's the worst thing I ever heard.

122
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:40,000
Speaker 0: the thing is it was always me and a bunch of like really hoity-toity Like older upper middle-class liberals because that's who lives in that area in a school But I mean the last time I say it would be me, right?

123
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,300
Speaker 0: I was off like visiting Emily or seeing like a movie or a show in the city and all these like very well-dressed Older couples who are in the city for a day of shopping.

124
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:55,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was on a school bus recently, you know, I went to earlier in the year.

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,620
Speaker 1: I was I went to a giant six the Giants 49ers game, right?

126
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,628
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we took one of these before.

127
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:06,648
Speaker 0: when you mean Emily went to that baseball game - yeah Yeah, but I mean you you know the.

128
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,760
Speaker 1: all the stadiums in the New York area are like they're building new ones.

129
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,980
Speaker 1: There's like a new new stadium in the Meadowlands new Met Stadium new Yankee Stadium, right?

130
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,580
Speaker 0: Yankee Stadium has its own train station.

131
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:26,707
Speaker 1: Yeah so they build these stadiums in the parking lots of the old stadiums and then they take the old stadiums down and make a new Parking lot.

132
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,760
Speaker 1: that's how this works, right?

133
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,960
Speaker 1: But you know, they need to play in the old stadium while the new ones being built result less parking during that time.

134
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:38,939
Speaker 1: So, you know all the sporting events have gone to in the past year or two, right?

135
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:50,480
Speaker 1: Unless you're the lucky guy who has a parking permit You got a park way far away and take a little shuttly bus, right which sucks Well and to use the vernacular.

136
00:10:51,564 --> 00:11:01,644
Speaker 0: Well, it's rare that I'm in a school bus but I'm sure you've had the similar experience where you get into a school bus and suddenly all your brain can think is Shit is small Exactly.

137
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,732
Speaker 1: I mean like you look at the outside of a school bus.

138
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,479
Speaker 1: Shit is big right.

139
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,712
Speaker 1: and You remember when you were a kid on the school bus.

140
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,379
Speaker 1: there was you know, pretty roomy.

141
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:23,930
Speaker 1: I got in a school bus like all these Giants fans and like Like what you was a three-seater when I was a kid is like a one-seater For like me a normal-sized person and legroom.

142
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,440
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess they assume people don't have legs.

143
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:28,947
Speaker 1: It's a bus for for.

144
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,033
Speaker 1: you know paraplegics.

145
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:31,098
Speaker 1: I don't know.

146
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:34,871
Speaker 1: but And then I accidentally sat on the hump.

147
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:36,116
Speaker 1: I sat on the hump.

148
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:37,140
Speaker 1: that was a bad move.

149
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,311
Speaker 0: Why did you sit on?

150
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:39,119
Speaker 0: I didn't realize?

151
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,680
Speaker 1: Cuz I I was still stunned at how close and small the seats were.

152
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:46,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I remember as a kid the back of the bus was so far away from the front.

153
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:52,780
Speaker 0: It was like its own world Like you'd be hanging out in the back of the bus like it was this private little apartment in the middle of nowhere.

154
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, I sit in the back of a school bus now and it's like.

155
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,680
Speaker 0: I feel like I can reach out and grab the bus driver.

156
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,893
Speaker 1: Maybe not that close but if it's a guess if it's the the tiny but the short bus.

157
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:10,389
Speaker 0: mostly I feel Exposed because I think when you're little like remember you're a kid in the school bus you're sitting there and You're shorter than the seat in front of you.

158
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:11,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're hiding.

159
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,140
Speaker 0: you feel like you're like you're invincible.

160
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,918
Speaker 1: No one can see what you're done made a lot of mischief in the school bus.

161
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:26,169
Speaker 0: that way No one can see what you're writing on the seat Or the fact that you're eating and drinking even though you're not supposed to be or that you're playing punch for punch Or mercy.

162
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,657
Speaker 0: ah Mercy, I never played mercy because I knew better and I had more than one friend.

163
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,953
Speaker 1: get broken fingers Fingers, you're supposed to break wrists.

164
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:36,678
Speaker 1: You're doing it wrong.

165
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,271
Speaker 1: Broken wrist is probably you know, you're playing properly if it's broken fingers.

166
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,156
Speaker 1: Someone is just not playing it correctly.

167
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:46,266
Speaker 0: So, uh There was some other interesting news today.

168
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:50,018
Speaker 0: It's not really breaking news anymore, but it has a personal connection to you.

169
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,535
Speaker 1: I think oh Yeah, well that also involves the cold.

170
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,704
Speaker 1: yeah the cold Basically, there was.

171
00:12:56,764 --> 00:13:02,719
Speaker 1: it was all over the crazy news like OMG plane crashes in river right which is right where we work.

172
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:09,200
Speaker 1: And apparently on that, you know, my company was recently bought by another company.

173
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:12,360
Speaker 1: That is well relatively recently as in before.

174
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,473
Speaker 1: Well, the economy was bad, but we didn't know it.

175
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:23,260
Speaker 1: yet when this happened And as CEO of that company right was on that plane, that's it.

176
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,439
Speaker 0: Didn't he like call you from the plane like hey, yeah, I didn't call us.

177
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,851
Speaker 1: He called you know, I guess his person or whatever.

178
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:34,485
Speaker 1: Oh, and then there was like a company email That's a CEO.

179
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,313
Speaker 0: So I guess he has a person he was in.

180
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:45,700
Speaker 1: basically it was like, you know You know, it's like hey, you know, he was in our office yesterday and then some and then it's like playing from New York to Charlotte.

181
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,523
Speaker 1: It was like huh?

182
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:47,989
Speaker 1: Wasn't he flying out today?

183
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,720
Speaker 1: How many planes to Charlotte could there be in one day?

184
00:13:51,760 --> 00:14:01,250
Speaker 1: And that was that is I don't know, you know I have only like talked to the guy once and that was to say hey fucker Why didn't couldn't you wait until after Thanksgiving to lay people off?

185
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:02,875
Speaker 0: Did you say the word fucker?

186
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:07,589
Speaker 1: No, no No, that's the only thing I've said to this guy besides.

187
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,451
Speaker 1: Hey, what's up?

188
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,480
Speaker 1: So yeah, but yeah, that's it.

189
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:13,307
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird though.

190
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:14,735
Speaker 1: It's like usually you see a plane crash.

191
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:15,480
Speaker 1: You don't know anyone.

192
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:18,112
Speaker 1: Then suddenly there's a plane crash and you know someone.

193
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:21,978
Speaker 1: it's like ooh weird But no one died.

194
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:25,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the cool thing is they floated the plane down to Jersey.

195
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,520
Speaker 1: Well, I mean basically takes off right?

196
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:35,897
Speaker 1: And the planes not doing so well so you sort of just Give it as much go as it's got left in it and then figure out a way to.

197
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:44,316
Speaker 1: you know Take as much energy out of it as you can on the way down you know and then land somewhere where you're not gonna crash and explode.

198
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:53,960
Speaker 1: and then You know use all the life rafts and shit and you know, usually a lot of that stuff on the plane You know, it's like hey, is this shit gonna work?

199
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,260
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I guess they told the people in the emergency exit rows and they did what they're supposed to do.

200
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,644
Speaker 1: So I guess the shit does work.

201
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,447
Speaker 0: All right.

202
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they you saw they were like photos.

203
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:10,020
Speaker 1: everyone's standing on the wing Plane floated for a while, you know, I think is the funniest part is on the on the radio.

204
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,099
Speaker 1: They were like the plane is now tied up in Battery Park.

205
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:20,633
Speaker 1: So, I guess it's like a plane just like tied up on the on the shore Which is but I think that'd be a funny thing to go see.

206
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:21,659
Speaker 1: I'm sure there'll be a picture of it.

207
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should turn it into a little I don't know.

208
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,418
Speaker 0: sculpture or something.

209
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:27,550
Speaker 1: Make a plushie.

210
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,523
Speaker 0: Yeah plushie.

211
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,499
Speaker 1: the Hudson River crash.

212
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:41,159
Speaker 1: So in sort of a an unavoidable thing that you know to not talk about, you know, Steve Jobs health How could we not discuss this right?

213
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:59,152
Speaker 1: So Steve Jobs is a Pretty important person even if you know Apple is doing some things that are not so cool like they still have DRM on their movies and the iPhone is really locked down and Macs are overpriced and they only have one mouse button, etc.

214
00:15:59,192 --> 00:15:59,673
Speaker 1: Etc.

215
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:00,135
Speaker 1: Right.

216
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:01,960
Speaker 1: See jobs is pretty important.

217
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:08,072
Speaker 1: I mean without Steve Jobs Probably wouldn't have computers so much.

218
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,620
Speaker 1: Heck we might not even have gooeys, you know.

219
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:22,057
Speaker 1: I mean the GUI might have been invented but it would not have been like, you know This thing that everyone had on their computers everywhere, you know Probably would have kept with the DOS the Mac wouldn't have pushed on Windows to come out etc.

220
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:22,258
Speaker 1: Etc.

221
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:24,219
Speaker 1: We'd be in a different place.

222
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:28,896
Speaker 1: So it's sort of significant that he's ill in and could be dying.

223
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:29,660
Speaker 1: We don't know.

224
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,986
Speaker 0: Well, it raises a lot of.

225
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,995
Speaker 0: I mean Thursday is usually the fun days.

226
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,000
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into all this.

227
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:48,854
Speaker 0: I was kind of saving this for Monday now because it's not really technology Talking about more that there are other ramifications like very cold calculated ramifications that like investors because Steve Jobs is such a that's not what I want to talk about I know.

228
00:16:48,874 --> 00:17:10,653
Speaker 0: but because he is such a like Demigod for Apple like he is he is like this face this avatar of the company that His personal life and his health and who he is and what he does Have an undue effect on the health of the company itself because so much of the company Either really internally or superficially.

229
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:16,378
Speaker 0: I mean obviously we can't know Relies on him and things that he doesn't do directly in the course of his work.

230
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:23,423
Speaker 1: Yep, but anyway, the thing I want to draw attention to is not so much the Apple end of things You know.

231
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:31,731
Speaker 1: it is that if you don't know the story, right and I think in 2003 or 4 Steve does you can find out all this info online.

232
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:34,440
Speaker 1: um he had pancreatic cancer, right?

233
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,114
Speaker 1: Which is not lucky, but he was lucky to have.

234
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:43,980
Speaker 1: is it sort of weird that he was lucky I guess to have a rare type of pancreatic cancer?

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,499
Speaker 1: I guess he would have been luckier to have none.

236
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:52,367
Speaker 1: But the thing is the most common kind of pancreatic cancer is pretty much you're gonna die And it's not it's not looking too good.

237
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:57,506
Speaker 1: this rare kind of pancreatic cancer that he had was actually Resurvivable.

238
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:02,003
Speaker 1: if you just go to the doctor and get a little surgery It's not pleasant But you're.

239
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:07,680
Speaker 1: you got good chances much better chances than if you have regular more common pancreatic cancer.

240
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,778
Speaker 1: So he found out he had this.

241
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:19,132
Speaker 1: But because you know despite all those things I just said about him He's sort of a hippie vegan kind of guy you know.

242
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,135
Speaker 1: so he was like.

243
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:21,919
Speaker 1: you know be in his hippie ways was like you.

244
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,640
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do this real medicine surgery.

245
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,695
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go on a diet now and that'll cure my cancer.

246
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,603
Speaker 0: my question to you is how Verified is this?

247
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:33,144
Speaker 0: I mean do you have?

248
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:34,829
Speaker 1: it's ours technica reports?

249
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,954
Speaker 1: alright, so I'm.

250
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,862
Speaker 1: there's multiple other places that report this as well I know.

251
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,734
Speaker 0: I'm just doing my due diligence to avoid a libel.

252
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:43,397
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,502
Speaker 1: There's no libel It's it's.

254
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,007
Speaker 1: plenty of places are reporting this.

255
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:53,695
Speaker 0: I didn't make it up because I do also see that he required no Chemotherapy or radiation therapy of any kind because they can know he just needed a surgery.

256
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:57,520
Speaker 0: yes the whipple procedure Which I'm reading about now, and it's actually kind of interest.

257
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:58,446
Speaker 1: It is very interesting.

258
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,680
Speaker 1: all he needed was his surgery, but he refused to get it.

259
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,037
Speaker 0: You know what it involves the duodenum which came up in conversation like three times with me yesterday.

260
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:18,864
Speaker 1: duodenum is a good word It's funny duodenum duodenum All right, so he doesn't want to get this surgery and he said goes on a diet thinking that I'll care it right and of It doesn't.

261
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:27,353
Speaker 1: so like six months or so later of course it gets a lot worse And he's forced to have the surgery right after he has the surgery.

262
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:27,895
Speaker 1: He's better.

263
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,520
Speaker 1: Oh my god real medicine works.

264
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:30,904
Speaker 1: It's a miracle right.

265
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:33,072
Speaker 1: actually it's not anything close to a miracle.

266
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,500
Speaker 1: It's perfectly ordinary real medicine working.

267
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:50,619
Speaker 1: So now of course he is illin again and his illin appears to be more serious than the I guess hormone imbalance that he said it was like a week ago or so and You know he hasn't given enough details for anyone to really know.

268
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:58,592
Speaker 1: But you know many doctors are taking the evidence that you know the information We do have and sort of you know saying what is common?

269
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,338
Speaker 1: What is likely you know etc?

270
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,188
Speaker 1: What is probable probably wrong with him?

271
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,074
Speaker 1: You know because we know the symptoms.

272
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,819
Speaker 1: He's getting real thin.

273
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:12,915
Speaker 1: We know some of his medical history had pancreatic cancer waited too long to get the surgery right.

274
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:16,065
Speaker 1: so based on that a lot of Doctors you know I've said it.

275
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:29,018
Speaker 1: It's probable that because he waited to get the surgery and tried the phony You know it's not so much phony medicine, but you know it is not real medicine That that you know that waiting could have you know?

276
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:37,914
Speaker 1: Contributed to his current health woes and perhaps if he would have had the surgery right away He probably would have been a lot better off right now than he is right now.

277
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:41,849
Speaker 0: all I really have to say to that is That it's really really sad.

278
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:55,233
Speaker 1: it is pretty sad and the thing is right is that I mean we look at famous people who have tried to do phony medicine and Either suffered needlessly or died too early because of it like Martin Luther King's wife.

279
00:20:55,735 --> 00:21:00,179
Speaker 1: right she could have you know gotten better But instead of going to get treatment at the hospital.

280
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:05,142
Speaker 1: She went to a like alternative clinic in Mexico And then died.

281
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:15,151
Speaker 1: you know Andy Kaufman went to get psychic surgery in the Philippines died right and those are just famous People that I happen to know about doing this shit right.

282
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:30,837
Speaker 1: there are millions and probably you know thousands maybe millions of non-famous people who have turned to fake medicine or have at least turned away from real medicine and needlessly suffered and or died because of it when real medicine could have just helped him out.

283
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:34,066
Speaker 1: just fine, so Learn from Steve Jobs.

284
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,208
Speaker 1: Do not be like him.

285
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,860
Speaker 1: if there is something wrong with you right go get real medicine.

286
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,367
Speaker 1: I don't care if insurance sucks.

287
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,794
Speaker 1: I don't care if you know the health care is.

288
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,620
Speaker 1: the pharmaceutical companies are evil.

289
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:53,003
Speaker 0: There is a caveat of if you can't afford real medicine or don't have access to it What do you do?

290
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:56,400
Speaker 1: you go to the emergency room in the u.s.. You go to the emergency room where they have to treat you?

291
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, but whatever you know do not go do The fake man.

292
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,146
Speaker 0: don't do what Donnie.

293
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:04,670
Speaker 0: don't die.

294
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,233
Speaker 1: all those other problems.

295
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:08,018
Speaker 1: You know insurance companies suck.

296
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:15,376
Speaker 1: pharmaceutical companies Are evil whether those are true or not right those things are not as important as you not dying.

297
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:19,560
Speaker 1: so For now you have to deal with that bullshit.

298
00:22:19,761 --> 00:22:21,185
Speaker 1: You can worry about that later.

299
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:32,836
Speaker 1: if there is something wrong with you or something wrong with someone you care about or anyone you know Make sure real medicine only no fake medicine if you actually care about any.

300
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:36,360
Speaker 1: I guess if you want someone to die And they're sick tell them to go try fake medicine.

301
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,680
Speaker 1: That that's a good idea, but I guess if you're even.

302
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,139
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day on a somewhat lighter note.

303
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:59,519
Speaker 0: now It's a lighter note and that it's not sad, but at the same time It's a serious note because I worry as to how many people will do well on this test.

304
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:11,724
Speaker 0: oh I found this little quiz out there on the internet, and it's a very simple very short quiz and all it does is test your ability to think Logically and it will.

305
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:28,112
Speaker 0: it is designed in such a way that certain questions particularly question 12 for anyone who's paying attention They will lead you in a certain direction in order to point out the differences between say Inductive or deductive logic and all those sorts of things.

306
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:29,477
Speaker 0: I just thought this was neat.

307
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:31,065
Speaker 0: I'll point out I got a hundred percent.

308
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:34,441
Speaker 1: I got 93 percent, but the last question I did.

309
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:47,187
Speaker 1: I was rules lawyer on it because I was rules lawyer II on the rest of it and but being rules lawyer II on the final question You know sort of backfired But actually I'll give it to him the answers.

310
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:58,893
Speaker 1: the answer sheet admits that the final question is up for philosophical debate and Actually if there was a philosophical debate I would have debated on the side of my answer which they said was incorrect.

311
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,158
Speaker 1: so what I get?

312
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:00,820
Speaker 1: the rest of them, right?

313
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,626
Speaker 1: That's what really counts.

314
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,486
Speaker 1: yes, but so if you get the last one wrong It's okay.

315
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:11,840
Speaker 0: if you get less than 93 percent That's not okay you suck, but I mean part of the thing to keep in mind here Is that this kind of reveals the difference between?

316
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:24,194
Speaker 0: Like you look in law you have the preponderance of evidence kind of argument, and then you have the beyond a reasonable doubt argument Mm-hmm, but then you have the beyond a shadow of a doubt argument.

317
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:25,399
Speaker 1: see the thing is is that?

318
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,467
Speaker 1: Because it's sort of like.

319
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 1: what this is is a like what you do in math problems, right?

320
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,486
Speaker 1: There's always the word problems.

321
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,054
Speaker 1: You know it's basically the same as all the other problems.

322
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:40,848
Speaker 1: only instead of saying What's 24 divided by 6 right.

323
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:44,820
Speaker 1: they say I have 24 apples and six friends.

324
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,688
Speaker 1: We want to share the apples evenly.

325
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,515
Speaker 1: how many apples do I give to each friend?

326
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:49,500
Speaker 1: right and it?

327
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,780
Speaker 1: It's the same exact answer, but you have to think about it differently.

328
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,897
Speaker 0: Clearly you give everyone one, and you throw the rest away, that's right, so what this does?

329
00:24:56,957 --> 00:24:57,419
Speaker 1: what this?

330
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:03,501
Speaker 1: Test does is actually it's a discrete mathematics Twizz.

331
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:05,387
Speaker 1: that's what they're really asking you.

332
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:09,020
Speaker 1: you know you've got transitive relationships and all that business going on.

333
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,684
Speaker 0: Well actually the way in layman's terms.

334
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:13,491
Speaker 0: really simply when you when you think about logic.

335
00:25:13,531 --> 00:25:14,273
Speaker 0: They're different.

336
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:21,357
Speaker 0: There is basically practical logic and Philosophical logic kind of like with you know real-life free will solipsism all that stuff.

337
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:24,225
Speaker 0: I mean Philosophically and physically.

338
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:29,503
Speaker 0: I can't prove that I have consciousness or any of those things, and I'm forced to admit that Solipsistically.

339
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:35,803
Speaker 0: the only thing I can prove that exists is myself, but practically Scott's sitting right there And I got a computer in front of me.

340
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:42,179
Speaker 0: so my practical logic has to get past the philosophical logic in that you have to.

341
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:49,620
Speaker 0: You can use fuzzy logic to live your real life Because things are not black and white in the real world because you don't have all the information.

342
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:53,380
Speaker 0: But if you use pure philosophical logic.

343
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:56,953
Speaker 0: And as and your precepts are correct like the.

344
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,924
Speaker 0: if A is true and B is true Then C is true.

345
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:03,620
Speaker 0: logic is used and you know for sure that A and B are true.

346
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:08,054
Speaker 0: Then you know one hundred percent sure that C is true.

347
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I said it's discrete mathematics.

348
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:15,016
Speaker 1: You know A and A you know A and B therefore C.

349
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:34,530
Speaker 0: You know it also for a the fundamental Paradox of existence that the more sure you are about something or the more Close to a hundred percent veracity a statement is the less applicable or globally useful such statement is so kind of.

350
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:39,185
Speaker 0: the more right you are on a philosophical level the less Applicability you have.

351
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:42,879
Speaker 0: and if you're a hundred percent, right you have zero applicability.

352
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:59,860
Speaker 0: Mmm-hmm It's interesting stuff, and if you're not well versed in the true ideas of philosophical and mathematical logic this test If you're intelligent you will be able to learn almost all of it simply by taking and passing or failing this test.

353
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're a computer scientist you need you can't pass this.

354
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:08,467
Speaker 0: you got problems find a new job You have a thing of the day.

355
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,295
Speaker 1: yeah kind of okay all right.

356
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:19,562
Speaker 1: so this this article It's more it's mostly an editorial and it's not full of a lot of evidence really and it's sort of written in a silly Fashion.

357
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:22,271
Speaker 1: so don't don't take it to be like you know.

358
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,740
Speaker 1: This is true for reals.

359
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,290
Speaker 1: There's a scientific study.

360
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,800
Speaker 1: OMG right even though I think it does reference a study you know as a little citation for it.

361
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,211
Speaker 1: But basically what this guy is saying is he saying?

362
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:42,438
Speaker 1: he's suggesting in a somewhat humorous manner That peanut allergies are an invention of yuppies.

363
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:53,114
Speaker 1: and While I don't know if it's a hundred percent true, and I'm very dubious and skeptical of the actual You know veracity of this suggestion it is.

364
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,520
Speaker 0: So I use the word veracity because I just used it a bunch of times a little while ago to got stuck in your head.

365
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,251
Speaker 1: I don't know I use that word.

366
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:00,754
Speaker 0: I don't know.

367
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:02,807
Speaker 0: just it seems I feel like that word.

368
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,597
Speaker 1: am I supposed to use truthiness?

369
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:21,512
Speaker 1: no All right, but basically what he's suggesting here right is that basically there was a There are only four percent of kids with food allergies yet 25% of parents believe their kids have food allergies.

370
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,760
Speaker 1: It's a mismatch here, right?

371
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:30,240
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the the old mean-world syndrome where you know their X percentage of people are subject to violent crimes.

372
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:35,471
Speaker 0: But if you ask people Themselves the perception of how much violent crime is out there.

373
00:28:35,832 --> 00:28:46,813
Speaker 0: every individual person perceives a lot more than there really is Mm-hmm like how every person in the like if you quiz people Far more than 50% of drivers think that they are an average or better driver.

374
00:28:47,274 --> 00:29:01,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, right so You know he's talking about things like how you know these crazy overprotective yuppie parents You know well think their kids have food allergies and their kids like no I get the peanut butter away from me But they don't really have a food allergy.

375
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:10,100
Speaker 1: you know and maybe you know in some cases I mean, there's there's evidence of this in other things where you know maybe you're not actually allergic to something.

376
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:20,083
Speaker 1: But if you have this like extreme Psychological aversion to something that it can sort of cause a reaction like if I sort of you know really instill in you the fact That you know.

377
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:20,605
Speaker 1: you know.

378
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,097
Speaker 1: I keep telling you you stay the fuck away from peanut butter.

379
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:26,052
Speaker 1: Oh my god You'll die you know and you actually believe this.

380
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:33,183
Speaker 1: and then peanut butter comes along Even if you don't have an actual allergy just because you're gonna freak out You're gonna have these other.

381
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:39,429
Speaker 1: you know whenever you see or smell peanut butter that they're freaking out in your in your mind Cause you know results in these other problems.

382
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:40,636
Speaker 1: You know the stress now.

383
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:41,500
Speaker 0: This is very true.

384
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:56,940
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of studies, and this has been pretty verified that if someone believes they have sensitivity to something they can Generate psychosomatic responses that will actually cause hives to appear and physical symptoms of a minor nature to appear.

385
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:57,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

386
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,760
Speaker 1: actually you know this happens a lot.

387
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:04,244
Speaker 1: This is where you get those people who say like you know that cell phone towers You know give them headaches

388
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:12,680
Speaker 0: or in like a school where like a girl smells something and then like she feels sick And then like all the other kids in the class start feeling sick - it's like this mass hysteria thing.

389
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you know.

390
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,131
Speaker 1: they like they've done like studies.

391
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:20,440
Speaker 1: basically you find someone who says that they're you know sensitive to.

392
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:29,113
Speaker 1: You know electromagnetic waves and basically whenever this person this person says that whenever they're near a cell tower They start to get headaches, and it sucks right, so what do you do?

393
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,459
Speaker 1: you put the person in a room right and?

394
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:40,687
Speaker 1: You go around and behind the wall where they can't see you have an antenna right and basically you turn it on and off But they don't know whether it's on or off.

395
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:44,498
Speaker 1: and then you ask them like you know is it on or off right now?

396
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,420
Speaker 1: and Basically if they decide that it's on they will actually have headaches, and they will tell you they have headaches.

397
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,706
Speaker 1: And they'll tell you they think it's on.

398
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:54,600
Speaker 1: and if they think it's off they won't have headaches.

399
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,978
Speaker 1: And they'll tell you they think it's off.

400
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,229
Speaker 1: Meanwhile it doesn't actually matter whether it's on or off.

401
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:07,102
Speaker 1: it only matters whether they think it's on or off which shows that the electromagnetic Waves from the radio are not actually the cause of their headaches But just their own.

402
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:17,623
Speaker 1: psychology is the cause of the headaches and and it's like it's very it is possible that a large amount of these you know reports of allergies and increase.

403
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:24,137
Speaker 1: I mean there's definitely been a. he says here that there has been a What percent?

404
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:28,472
Speaker 1: 18% increase in childhood food allergies between 97 and 2007.

405
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,837
Speaker 1: That definitely seems.

406
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:33,050
Speaker 1: I mean it's possible that that could be you know a genetic thing.

407
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,270
Speaker 1: You know just that the gene has emerged due to the way things have gone.

408
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,159
Speaker 0: There's also the option that it might be environmental.

409
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,547
Speaker 1: it could be endemic because there is possible.

410
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:50,790
Speaker 0: there is other evidence pointing to Allergies in general being in a higher rate of occurrence when cleanliness is above a certain standard.

411
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, too much antibacterial soaps and things are you.

412
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,950
Speaker 0: but the thing is these are all very loose correlations right now.

413
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,556
Speaker 0: There's no there's all of you.

414
00:31:57,656 --> 00:32:08,650
Speaker 1: causation all of these are possible explanations all this But mass hysteria is just as plausible an explanation as the others cats and dogs living together.

415
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:11,060
Speaker 1: Yes, and it's you know.

416
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,509
Speaker 1: this little article is funny and interesting.

417
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:21,759
Speaker 1: Especially you know if you're like one of those if you're trying to send your kid to school with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich And they won't let you and you're pissed off.

418
00:32:22,383 --> 00:32:23,390
Speaker 1: You know you'll like this article.

419
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,673
Speaker 0: Well the the real answer is peanut butter with a baseball bat Peanut butter jelly.

420
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:28,497
Speaker 0: peanut butter jelly.

421
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:29,982
Speaker 1: peanut butter jelly baseball bat.

422
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:31,006
Speaker 0: That's one thing.

423
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,070
Speaker 0: we were ahead of the curve.

424
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,532
Speaker 0: We were.

425
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:33,838
Speaker 0: we were all about that song.

426
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,505
Speaker 1: You know when I was about that song.

427
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:36,630
Speaker 1: I was about that song.

428
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:44,669
Speaker 1: I first heard it in Summer camp I guess I was a counselor and after the it was between my first and second years at RIT.

429
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,506
Speaker 1: so 2001 I had peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat beat up.

430
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:49,530
Speaker 1: that was way ahead.

431
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,539
Speaker 1: That was before the dancing banana at that point.

432
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,769
Speaker 1: It was just a song by the buckwheat boys and nothing more.

433
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:00,886
Speaker 1: Right not many people can come close to that except the other people at the summer camp.

434
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:18,467
Speaker 0: so What I have learned from the news recently is that one if you are going to fake your own death You should at least make sure there's enough fuel in your planes that it will actually crash over the ocean without your body in it instead of Nearby without your body in it with the door open.

435
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:21,456
Speaker 1: well You know well, I guess you got closing the doors key.

436
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:31,859
Speaker 0: first of all - if you're gonna fake your own death liquidate your assets Before you disappear not after.

437
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,483
Speaker 1: yeah, that's also a very good idea.

438
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,047
Speaker 1: the Swiss banks exist for a reason.

439
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:43,208
Speaker 0: so to the you know tiny islands in the Caribbean three if you jumped out of your plane and landed in a swamp and needed help and Go find the police.

440
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:51,460
Speaker 0: Have a better story than I was in a canoeing accident And don't give them your real driver's license.

441
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,626
Speaker 0: say you lost it in the canoeing accident.

442
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,869
Speaker 1: Did the guy really yes?

443
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,138
Speaker 1: Yes, Wow yes that just either.

444
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:10,348
Speaker 1: I mean that tells me like I didn't realize that he was that stupid this guy That he wasn't really trying that hard that he really didn't want it.

445
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,514
Speaker 1: He wasn't committed He didn't really want it to go.

446
00:34:12,614 --> 00:34:14,804
Speaker 0: all the way people try to do too much with it.

447
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,248
Speaker 0: You did not try.

448
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think he really wanted it.

449
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,543
Speaker 1: that badly enough either.

450
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:21,045
Speaker 1: that or is it?

451
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:22,489
Speaker 1: he couldn't have been that stupid.

452
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,639
Speaker 0: It might have been a cockamamie plan like maybe he's on the plane, and he's like oh crap I just suddenly realized how screwed I am.

453
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,166
Speaker 0: time to fake my own death.

454
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:31,829
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

455
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, he probably.

456
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:36,184
Speaker 1: yeah, it could have been a spontaneous thing in which case.

457
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,915
Speaker 1: There's no way it's gonna succeed I don't know.

458
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:52,949
Speaker 0: I it seems like running away in that capacity like faking your own death or disappearing or even being a willful bum if You're smart would be really easy and could probably be very cool.

459
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:59,206
Speaker 1: Faking your own death is significantly more different difficult than just running away right away.

460
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,875
Speaker 1: It's kind of easy I think faking your least.

461
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:05,329
Speaker 1: in a free country faking your death can be difficult if you know.

462
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like South Park.

463
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,810
Speaker 0: You just need to have a pig in butters clothing.

464
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean to fake your death.

465
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:17,455
Speaker 1: right you need to do one of two things basically at least in a country like the US right one.

466
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:20,425
Speaker 1: you either need to fake a corpse.

467
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:21,910
Speaker 1: That's really hard.

468
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:28,790
Speaker 1: I mean something that like uh you know what's what's the guy at the morgue's name the mortician or the corner?

469
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, something that a corner or a mortician is gonna be fooled by.

470
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:33,856
Speaker 1: Good luck.

471
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:40,984
Speaker 1: I mean maybe you could get an actual corpse But even then they're gonna DNA and they're gonna dental record.

472
00:35:41,024 --> 00:35:42,530
Speaker 1: and what are you gonna do about that?

473
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,917
Speaker 1: It is fucking hard.

474
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:51,170
Speaker 1: It would cost you the amount of money It would cost to fake the corpse and fool even like the lazy corner really hard.

475
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,681
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe you could bribe the coroner that would might do it.

476
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:57,510
Speaker 1: But even then that is not a guaranteed thing.

477
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,029
Speaker 1: You're the fewer people you have to trust the better, right?

478
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:08,576
Speaker 1: So the other way to do it is to die in some way Where there is no corpse.

479
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:11,565
Speaker 1: for example your plane crashed a lot of times.

480
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,170
Speaker 1: planes crash and there's no corpse.

481
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,839
Speaker 1: You get eaten by sharks in the ocean.

482
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,324
Speaker 1: There's or piranhas.

483
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,270
Speaker 1: There's nothing left that that the piranhas come, right?

484
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,530
Speaker 1: What

485
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:43,770
Speaker 0: about in that movie where all you have to do is have a dentist friend find a hobo corpse somewhere Get him to dental I'm gonna use that as a verb or dentify the teeth to where upon an examination Especially it just they'll think it's you like they already think it's you because they found your wallet and you burn the body or something And they find the skull in the teeth and they do their quick x-ray in their tests and it matches up with your dental records.

486
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:52,150
Speaker 1: They say well unless there's it as long as there's no suspicion of like murder and it's not part of like a big case They're not gonna dedicate resources to investigate further.

487
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:53,488
Speaker 1: So that probably would work.

488
00:36:54,016 --> 00:37:06,610
Speaker 1: but if they do investigate further like they think there might be some foul play and it gets all on the news and they got to do bringing the Real forensic experts and not just like the local cop schmucks then they're gonna look and say hey these teeth were doctored.

489
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:07,589
Speaker 1: See, this is a fuck.

490
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:10,166
Speaker 0: This is one of the problems with their CSI bullshit.

491
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:15,325
Speaker 0: see more Reason you have to fake your death the harder it becomes because more people are looking for you.

492
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:17,798
Speaker 0: if I fake my death People would go.

493
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:19,489
Speaker 0: well rim had a good run.

494
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:26,501
Speaker 0: I mean, it'd be really easy to all I do is say I'm going to breakneck Ridge hiking or something And then just I would leave town.

495
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:27,285
Speaker 0: I would just like drive.

496
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:38,562
Speaker 0: I'd like ditch my car I'd like walk real far away and then I'd start hitchhiking and once I got far enough away, I just like Lay down outside a hospital at night and fall asleep.

497
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,230
Speaker 0: Wait till someone finds me and claim amnesia.

498
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,870
Speaker 0: Eventually, they'd assume I was dead in the wilderness.

499
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:47,069
Speaker 1: Hmm get to be really good at acting though because they'll check for that brain damage.

500
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:50,389
Speaker 1: those Neurologists will come and you might get caught.

501
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:58,783
Speaker 1: You had to be Really good with the acting to claim amnesia or just act like you're stupid.

502
00:37:59,344 --> 00:37:59,966
Speaker 1: I guess that work.

503
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,089
Speaker 1: you gotta be really good at acting.

504
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,040
Speaker 1: So the other ways you got it.

505
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,167
Speaker 1: you got to die where there's.

506
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:11,930
Speaker 1: the Already said that where no one expects to find a body you got drop in a vat of acid.

507
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:12,532
Speaker 1: Right.

508
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,539
Speaker 1: Now the thing is dropping a vat of acid.

509
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,041
Speaker 1: Okay.

510
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:17,650
Speaker 0: I was that vat of acid there - what were you doing?

511
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,251
Speaker 1: Hanging out.

512
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:19,796
Speaker 1: Oh think about this though.

513
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:20,960
Speaker 1: It's not just that it's.

514
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:23,950
Speaker 1: how do you fall and create the impression?

515
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,765
Speaker 1: That you have fallen in the vat of acid?

516
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:30,606
Speaker 1: yet You did not actually fall in the vat of acid because then you didn't fake your death.

517
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:31,670
Speaker 1: you committed suicide.

518
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:32,914
Speaker 1: You had to.

519
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:37,550
Speaker 1: so you have to like take a fake you toss it in the acid and then somehow escape.

520
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,054
Speaker 1: That's it's a little harder than I mean.

521
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:41,899
Speaker 1: jumping in the vat of acid is easy.

522
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:47,010
Speaker 1: now try surviving that but having people believe you didn't That's hard.

523
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,330
Speaker 0: Maybe one way to go is just cut yourself and get a bunch of blood like in your bedroom or something.

524
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:55,030
Speaker 0: Here it is make it look like you were murdered and then just disappear.

525
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:57,418
Speaker 0: Like drive your car out somewhere.

526
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,010
Speaker 0: cut yourself cover your car in your own blood.

527
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:03,807
Speaker 0: Maybe someone else's blood - if you've got someone else's blood handy, of course.

528
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:07,478
Speaker 0: if you do You're probably a bad person in the police.

529
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:09,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you're trying to just escape.

530
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,813
Speaker 1: You're not trying to be bad It's just you're trying.

531
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:14,023
Speaker 0: I'm saying what if you have like you work in a hospital.

532
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:15,629
Speaker 0: All right, you've got access to like blood.

533
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:21,430
Speaker 0: All right, put some other blood there too just to make it weird and suspicious and then like that's not good.

534
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,550
Speaker 1: But if it's weird and suspicious living a lot more investigating.

535
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:28,970
Speaker 1: But then just push the car off a cliff Then they'll go and pick the car off off the bottom of the cliff and there's no bodies in it.

536
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,774
Speaker 1: This is a lot of blood.

537
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,662
Speaker 1: Yeah where the bodies go.

538
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're gonna look for bodies.

539
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,830
Speaker 0: They're not gonna look for you alive and well in Albuquerque working as like a busker.

540
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's gonna be one of those things.

541
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:48,350
Speaker 1: They do the manhunt on the news and they're looking with Are you a pretty young white woman?

542
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:54,286
Speaker 0: You are well pretty and young.

543
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:57,048
Speaker 1: yes mostly the white woman.

544
00:39:58,615 --> 00:40:05,108
Speaker 0: Anyway Yeah, yeah See, but it's kind of like the same thing with being a bum.

545
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:12,210
Speaker 0: I mean Or a lot of situations like if I personally became homeless or became a bum or needed to fake my own death.

546
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,267
Speaker 0: I feel like I could get away with it.

547
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:23,310
Speaker 1: But I think Scott - and I think a lot of smart people could kind of like how well running it see the thing is I don't know if I get faked my own death because it's actually kind of hard.

548
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:26,023
Speaker 1: But I mean, I guess I could have really tried.

549
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:33,109
Speaker 0: I think if you were to turn running away You spent like a month planning it as opposed to I don't know 10 minutes on a radio show off the cuff.

550
00:40:33,913 --> 00:40:38,494
Speaker 1: running away is actually really easy because Right.

551
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:42,250
Speaker 1: I am over the age of 18 years old, right?

552
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:47,790
Speaker 1: I'm just you know, if I just get up and leave and you just don't see me I don't come back tomorrow.

553
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:52,450
Speaker 1: You can't really file and like a you know, a missing person's report or anything.

554
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,116
Speaker 0: I'm allowed to go.

555
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:57,741
Speaker 0: I can file a missing person's report But the police won't act on it for X days or X weeks or whatever.

556
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:58,826
Speaker 1: They're not gonna really.

557
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:00,733
Speaker 1: I'm just allowed to go Wherever I want.

558
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,114
Speaker 1: I can't know.

559
00:41:01,175 --> 00:41:07,258
Speaker 1: as long as my like taxes end up getting paid and stuff like that You know, no one's gonna come looking for me.

560
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:10,230
Speaker 1: And as long as I can get a new identity.

561
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:12,623
Speaker 0: But that's the tricky part in the u.s.

562
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:13,910
Speaker 0: They're making that more and more difficult.

563
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:15,718
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm more difficult.

564
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:16,523
Speaker 0: have the amnesia.

565
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:22,450
Speaker 0: you show up in a hospital and You just like you don't remember who you are or anything and eventually hope that they give you something.

566
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:30,269
Speaker 1: I think a better idea is just go to a small town and live a small town life Maybe like marry someone in the small town where how you gonna get the marriage license?

567
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,731
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

568
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:33,337
Speaker 0: You don't have any ID?

569
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:34,440
Speaker 1: It's a small town.

570
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,203
Speaker 1: They don't freakin.

571
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:36,487
Speaker 0: Yes, they do they.

572
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:37,230
Speaker 0: they they'll check.

573
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,073
Speaker 1: Just a stranger comes to town.

574
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:42,279
Speaker 0: things are getting increasingly interlink idly data vase.

575
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,323
Speaker 0: if I'd They like that term interlink idly data vase.

576
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:52,310
Speaker 1: if I'd that is you know Whether you fake your own death or try to run away, right if you do try really want to do it go to Mexico.

577
00:41:52,611 --> 00:42:05,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you do try to create a new identity in a civilized, you know developed fancy high-tech society It is very difficult because like okay, so you either a get real papers or be forged some papers, right?

578
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:09,002
Speaker 1: Well, if you forge some papers that's harder and harder to do.

579
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:15,890
Speaker 1: but if they're forged papers remember Someone eventually is gonna take those papers and then look them up in a database.

580
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:24,130
Speaker 1: Like maybe a cop will pull you over and take your fake driver's license Even if the driver's license is really you made it at the DMV with a corrupt DMV person.

581
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,990
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can get into bars and drink easily, right?

582
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:36,592
Speaker 1: But when a cop takes it and types in your driver's license number into his computer and it says not valid you are Fucked.

583
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:40,544
Speaker 1: so you got a hack the DMV database to get that info in there.

584
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:52,965
Speaker 0: That is really hard as I am bordering on the thing is it's really hard and it's also really easy because People like us have technological skills and contacts.

585
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,986
Speaker 0: I Don't think it would be that hard for me.

586
00:42:56,852 --> 00:43:02,869
Speaker 1: Well, are you even here's where it gets interesting problem Is that when you you can pull that off?

587
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:15,090
Speaker 1: But it requires either a you to be in a position say you work at the DMV or something like that or the social Security office or be you're trusting someone who does and remember.

588
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:21,650
Speaker 1: Well, even if you can have someone you can trust and it is probably gonna work but a loose lip will sink the ship.

589
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:30,728
Speaker 0: Well, one option is how is the age-old tradition of hacking by leaving USB keys with auto-inject Trojans just like on the street outside of the DMV?

590
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,540
Speaker 0: Mmm, so you got to be clever.

591
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,696
Speaker 1: if you can pull off a move like that Then then the winner is you.

592
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:40,010
Speaker 1: but but remember DMV computer is not likely to be on the Internet's.

593
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:55,450
Speaker 0: The point I really want to make is that a lot of these things and this applies broadly crime running away faking your death being a terrorist all those things are Trivial in many ways for people who are smart.

594
00:43:56,073 --> 00:44:04,285
Speaker 0: But the reason we don't see this happening is because if you're smart You can do something more worthwhile with your life and sad people do that's the same thing.

595
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,970
Speaker 1: We always talk about with terrorism, right?

596
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,115
Speaker 1: It's like look at the real.

597
00:44:07,175 --> 00:44:20,823
Speaker 1: to the terrorists the people who actively hate the u.s Don't mind killing people in fact want to kill people right as much as there's a lot of fear-mongering And it's the problem of terrorism is very inflated in the media and sensationalized.

598
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:22,367
Speaker 1: those people do exist.

599
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,370
Speaker 1: They're out there, right?

600
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:29,810
Speaker 1: They they they would really like it if bombs exploded in New York City and every other major city and such.

601
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,555
Speaker 1: They are people who would like that.

602
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:34,204
Speaker 0: luckily luckily do he died.

603
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:42,446
Speaker 1: They are luckily they're all stupid Very very stupid and not smart, but it's the same thing like look at our homeless.

604
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,450
Speaker 0: people are a good example.

605
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:58,392
Speaker 0: A lot of studies show that many many people who become homeless Who don't have mental problems and are otherwise, okay But had a run of bad luck will become non homeless within a relatively short span of time Mm-hmm.

606
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:02,310
Speaker 0: And now obviously there are exceptions to this and homelessness is a huge problem in the u.s.

607
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,015
Speaker 0: But a lot of the people you see who are homeless I would especially.

608
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:11,770
Speaker 1: the thing is the homeless people that you see are the like the street wandering type.

609
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,310
Speaker 0: I was about to say they're taking the begging type.

610
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,605
Speaker 0: There are the willful homeless who refuse to like.

611
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:27,942
Speaker 0: they know about the shelters they know about the help and they refuse to do it because they prefer to be homeless or they're crazy and they're the people who Have mental problems that really should be in institutions getting help.

612
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:32,857
Speaker 0: but because of the way the US systems work There's nowhere for these people to go.

613
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,568
Speaker 0: and it's it's really this freedom conundrum where.

614
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:35,990
Speaker 0: think about it.

615
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,875
Speaker 0: You have the freedom to do whatever you want.

616
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:53,867
Speaker 0: These people they're not Stabbing themselves or like doing the things that would get them arrested and sent to Not showering collecting nasty shit doing little dances and pooping occasionally.

617
00:45:53,947 --> 00:45:55,010
Speaker 0: now, here's the problem.

618
00:45:55,471 --> 00:46:00,790
Speaker 0: What's the line between someone who just doesn't want to make better of themselves?

619
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,775
Speaker 0: versus someone who has a mental problem?

620
00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:04,120
Speaker 0: and they can't and they need help?

621
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:13,159
Speaker 0: because in one case you have to Forcibly intervene in their lives to help them But in another case is that intervention justified?

622
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,730
Speaker 0: if the person is a rational thinking adult who has chosen this lifestyle?

623
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:25,709
Speaker 0: yep, and You either are going to infringe on someone's freedom or let someone who really does need help not get help And I don't know what to do about that.

624
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:39,861
Speaker 0: but if someone like me or one of us or a lot of you out there were homeless suddenly like your house blew up and You got fired from your job and someone stole all your money and the government wouldn't help you You had no insurance.

625
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:44,180
Speaker 1: you could probably Figure something out like I mean at the worst right.

626
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,886
Speaker 1: you can get a job at the McDonald's.

627
00:46:46,187 --> 00:46:47,857
Speaker 1: live with a friend You know.

628
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,612
Speaker 1: live with your parents You know.

629
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:51,341
Speaker 1: find you somewhere to crash.

630
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:57,010
Speaker 0: or even if you're completely alone in the world Especially at our age and your age like what would I do right now if I had no friends in the world?

631
00:46:57,512 --> 00:46:58,034
Speaker 1: Go to Europe.

632
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,962
Speaker 0: I suddenly lost everything I owned.

633
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:01,187
Speaker 0: I had no assets whatsoever.

634
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:01,830
Speaker 1: Go to Europe.

635
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:04,237
Speaker 0: No go to a college campus.

636
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,099
Speaker 0: hang out.

637
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,950
Speaker 0: make friends with people especially stoners and drunk frat guys.

638
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:14,701
Speaker 0: They will totally hook you up and give you places to stay as long as you're cool And then you can get yourself on your feet that way.

639
00:47:14,721 --> 00:47:15,405
Speaker 0: hmm.

640
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:16,349
Speaker 0: I mean that.

641
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:17,973
Speaker 0: Do that?

642
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:31,329
Speaker 1: I mean especially like if someone if you find a college campus find some college kids living around there Right and you go to work at say like Home Depot all day while they're in college Doing their college thing and you're hanging with them

643
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,598
Speaker 0: You have more money than they do.

644
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:39,330
Speaker 1: you are bringing in so much money And if you pay a significant portion of the rent they're totally helping you out, and they got mad monies.

645
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,193
Speaker 0: You know weed.

646
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:41,216
Speaker 0: they got weed.

647
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:42,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

648
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,190
Speaker 1: you can really you know and work in Home Depot ain't so bad?

649
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:46,358
Speaker 1: It's better than nothing.

650
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:50,688
Speaker 0: yep, right, so It you know well like all right like.

651
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:57,750
Speaker 0: How many people did I convince to feed me when I had no money and no food in college?

652
00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:02,829
Speaker 0: I think I could seduce my way across the country getting people to feed me if I needed to.

653
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,132
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

654
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,642
Speaker 0: I tell stories like I do.

655
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:06,870
Speaker 0: geek nights live for people.

656
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,223
Speaker 0: I just hang out and be cool and get people to give me stuff.

657
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:12,199
Speaker 0: mmm Maybe I should do that.

658
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:13,309
Speaker 0: that might be a more fun life.

659
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:21,863
Speaker 0: I should give up the glamour of the stock market and all the money and all this stuff and just Wander around being one of those traveling troubadours.

660
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:24,455
Speaker 1: No, not bad idea.

661
00:48:24,555 --> 00:48:25,057
Speaker 0: No, why not?

662
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:25,479
Speaker 0: why not?

663
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,523
Speaker 1: no it's not good see.

664
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:33,510
Speaker 0: the only problem with those plans Is that the seduce your way across the country or hang out with the college kids thing?

665
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,870
Speaker 0: Really tapers off as age increases.

666
00:48:37,971 --> 00:48:38,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's.

667
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:47,151
Speaker 0: I mean when you're 45 and you're hanging out at the frat house That is when people start looking at you as a borderline pedophile Borderline.

668
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:50,064
Speaker 0: well, they're college people so they're above the age anyway.

669
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:50,947
Speaker 0: It's just it's creepy.

670
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:54,890
Speaker 1: well I mean, you know it's not any more creepy than like Hugh Hefner.

671
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,512
Speaker 0: right yeah, but society Vindicate.

672
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:02,707
Speaker 0: not doesn't vindicate, but society rationalizes him because he has money.

673
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:09,969
Speaker 0: yeah But there's a lot of situations of you know young girls really old guys But you don't have anything to bring to the equation you're a bum.

674
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,977
Speaker 1: Hey, you know there are bums.

675
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:14,804
Speaker 1: They get like mad booty.

676
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,250
Speaker 1: it happens.

677
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:20,586
Speaker 1: Usually though it's like they're not bums, but like hobos.

678
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:25,649
Speaker 1: like there was a hobo I heard about who ran a pirate radio station and that in like a little shack.

679
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,970
Speaker 0: well There is a big distinction between hobo bum and all those different.

680
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:40,407
Speaker 1: But he had mad ladies like hot college ladies because his radio station was apparently really hip and cool yeah, and they'd come out to his shack and It was part Radio Shack part.

681
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:43,201
Speaker 0: Love Shack See at this point.

682
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:47,109
Speaker 0: I'd say hey well What would we do right now if we had to do a couple of one of those scenarios, but?

683
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,666
Speaker 0: They're so specific like what would I do if X happened?

684
00:49:50,826 --> 00:49:53,375
Speaker 0: I have like a thousand Pretty much.

685
00:49:53,395 --> 00:49:55,601
Speaker 1: what it boils down to is I'm smart.

686
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:56,844
Speaker 1: I have skills.

687
00:49:57,727 --> 00:50:12,821
Speaker 1: I would be okay Unless it was you know unless it was a situation that was sort of Unrecoverable like hey a nuke dropped real close to me, and I have nasty radiation or all right I'm locked or airtight stone room.

688
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,408
Speaker 0: Yeah naked with no tools.

689
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:17,129
Speaker 1: Oh shit It's Mad Max, and I'm not on top.

Speaker 1: I know you know I'm not Ken Shiro.

692
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:26,430
Speaker 1: I'm some guy who's like you know asking Ken Shiro to punch a hole in the ground to get water.

693
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,555
Speaker 0: You're one of those farmers.

694
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:30,750
Speaker 0: You know what it's not good to be a farmer in the Mad Max world.

695
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:33,141
Speaker 1: No, no, it is very good to know.

696
00:50:33,181 --> 00:50:34,326
Speaker 1: hooked on a Ken too bad.

697
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,009
Speaker 1: I do not know it.
