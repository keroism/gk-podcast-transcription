1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,398
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday March 21st.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,382
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,548
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night.

4
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,242
Speaker 1: tonight We review one of our favorite anime ever.

5
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:18,630
Speaker 1: here is Greenwood.

6
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,364
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:25,101
Speaker 1: Damn you Netflix.

8
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:37,427
Speaker 1: damn you See we have this love-hate relationship with Netflix Which started as pure love and the hates really kind of new because this is a recent development that only seems to occur with ghosts in the fucking shell.

9
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,445
Speaker 0: oh I think it occurs with some other things.

10
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,644
Speaker 0: it's happened to us before But it's happened with ghost in the shell a whole bunch of times.

11
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:55,006
Speaker 1: well in general I've noticed that we use Netflix a lot, and we've alternated between spending most of our Netflix's on South Park We missed or Simpsons or Futurama and for a while.

12
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:55,950
Speaker 1: We watched a bunch of movies.

13
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:12,251
Speaker 0: It seems like a higher percentage of anime DVDs are scratched up cracked or broken than any other kind of DVD we get Pretty much, I mean usually what happens is we'll put an anime DVD in and it'll work and then eventually it'll get to a scratch Part.

14
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,958
Speaker 0: we'll take it out and look at it and go shit.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:25,565
Speaker 0: today when I put well yesterday when I took the ghost in the Shell DVD out of the little you know Netflix slip case the edge of it Like for about I'd say a quarter to a half inch of the disc.

16
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:30,670
Speaker 0: in one spot It looked like I don't know someone stabbed that part with a knife or something.

17
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:36,261
Speaker 0: It's ripped in two, but since it was near the edge of the disc That's the last part of the DVD.

18
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,810
Speaker 0: so maybe that's just the extras.

19
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,637
Speaker 0: Maybe that's just the last episode.

20
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,826
Speaker 1: see the thing is while we reported it to Netflix.

21
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:42,810
Speaker 1: We're gonna get our new DVD.

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,317
Speaker 1: They always send it right away even though.

23
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,149
Speaker 1: I forgot to report it yesterday, so I'm gonna report it after this.

24
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,516
Speaker 1: But we couldn't risk.

25
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:54,290
Speaker 1: we had to watch at least an episode because the last DVD ended on this crazy cliffhanger.

26
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:57,803
Speaker 1: We're about to stand in there with one of the bad guys TM.

27
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,510
Speaker 1: He's got a gun named at his face.

28
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:01,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it the DVDs?

29
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:06,210
Speaker 0: they seem to be doing a pretty good job of making the last episode on the DVD a crazy cliffhanger.

30
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 1: It's always Episode that has nothing to do with the plot episode.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,686
Speaker 1: that has nothing to do with the plot episode.

32
00:02:11,726 --> 00:02:15,670
Speaker 1: That's pretty interesting Episode that ends on a crazy cliffhanger.

33
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,999
Speaker 1: So then you ah and you wait for the next DVD.

34
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,335
Speaker 1: you get the next DVD and you gotta watch a bunch of episodes to Get any sort of resolution.

35
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,681
Speaker 0: It's good though.

36
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's real good real good.

37
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,645
Speaker 1: I gotta say I really want to talk about standalone complex second gig.

38
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:30,890
Speaker 1: so much we finish it finish it.

39
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,494
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna review it pretty quick Pretty much that week.

40
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:40,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but yeah, I'm wondering if maybe though anime fans are less careful with DVDs.

41
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:44,424
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a higher percentage of punk kids with Netflix is getting anime.

42
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:44,965
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:46,270
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what it is.

44
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,323
Speaker 0: I remember that when the anime club got DVDs they made everyone before.

45
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,469
Speaker 0: they cuz you know VHS is they can rent them out.

46
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,638
Speaker 0: Crazily they don't care.

47
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,069
Speaker 0: Well, what are you gonna do to a VHS?

48
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,710
Speaker 1: Hey, this was also back when it was a big step to decide to put DVDs in the anime club library.

49
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:11,003
Speaker 0: Yep But they realized the one problem would be that if you're renting out DVDs that you spent a lot of money on and you're not Blockbusters you can't just buy a bajillion DVDs if someone scratches one.

50
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,167
Speaker 0: That's a big freaking deal.

51
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:14,773
Speaker 0: That's like 20 bucks Lost plus.

52
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:19,210
Speaker 1: it's real hard to break a VHS tape unless you're a consummate jackass.

53
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:26,990
Speaker 0: It's real easy to break a DVD if you just put it on a surface face down or if your CD-ROM is full of sand?

54
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,849
Speaker 0: I don't know.

55
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:36,197
Speaker 1: Yeah we actually made anyone who wanted to check out DVDs sign this agreement saying that they would pay for the DVD if there was so Much as the slightest blemish.

56
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:49,130
Speaker 0: Yep, and every time people brought return discs The library would inspect all of them by hand to make sure that they weren't scratched That there was no way that you could say it was the person before me who scratched it.

57
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,556
Speaker 0: We knew it was.

58
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:52,139
Speaker 0: it was you.

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,863
Speaker 0: you just took it.

60
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,009
Speaker 0: you're responsible for it.

61
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,810
Speaker 1: Yep Now I'm surprised that Netflix doesn't actually be very proactive about this.

62
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,392
Speaker 1: I mean I went ahead.

63
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:03,390
Speaker 1: I wonder if maybe they are and they just send the discs out anyway to see it.

64
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,249
Speaker 1: But maybe they don't check it.

65
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,995
Speaker 1: Maybe they just get a complaint and they send it out again and again and maybe if they get ten complaints Then they pull it off the line.

66
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,180
Speaker 0: I don't know.

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,591
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people just might not complain About.

68
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,115
Speaker 0: you know a disc that's scratched?

69
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:16,697
Speaker 0: or people aren't?

70
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:24,106
Speaker 0: don't realize you know disc scratching and what the whole issue is because they don't understand DVDs or at all and they just get a disc.

71
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:24,710
Speaker 0: it doesn't work.

72
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,410
Speaker 0: So they mail it back without saying anything and then they add it to their queue again because they don't know any better?

73
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:30,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

74
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:33,510
Speaker 1: I had a fun idea for a patent that I've mostly written up.

75
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:44,330
Speaker 1: I just don't feel like paying the money to actually get it put forward of a system that would allow Netflix to Trivially figure out on average who was damaging discs in order to kick them off the service.

76
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's very likely.

77
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:49,710
Speaker 1: It's a small number of users relative to the total user base of Netflix.

78
00:04:50,231 --> 00:05:00,230
Speaker 0: yeah, pretty much you're either the kind of person who scratches DVDs or you're the kind of person who doesn't and The kind of people who do can be punished and the kind of people who don't can get better discs.

79
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:03,630
Speaker 1: I never understood how you could be the kind of guy who scratches DVDs.

80
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:07,409
Speaker 1: What do you just not put it back in its case after you watch it?

81
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,847
Speaker 1: Do you just carry DVD players around with discs in them?

82
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:11,490
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

83
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,555
Speaker 0: I don't know.

84
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:15,412
Speaker 0: people just don't understand DVD.

85
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:20,545
Speaker 1: I had a DVD at work way back at IBM and I lent.

86
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,690
Speaker 1: I lent anime DVDs to people there fairly often.

87
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:27,148
Speaker 1: I was always trying to promote anime and usually when I gave someone a DVD they'd open it up.

88
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:27,670
Speaker 1: They look at it.

89
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,870
Speaker 1: Maybe they'd watch it on their work computer.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:36,177
Speaker 1: I don't know, but one time I lent it to this guy who wasn't in my department and he opens the case and He was looking at the DVD.

91
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:44,270
Speaker 1: he's like I'm gonna put this in my laptop right now and he Hamfist this DVD out of the case by like cracking the case to the side to pop it out.

92
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,920
Speaker 1: He puts his finger right on the data part.

93
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,245
Speaker 0: Did you yell at him?

94
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,361
Speaker 1: I was like, dude, never mind I didn't give it to him.

95
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:53,980
Speaker 1: Good job I don't think he liked me after that, but there's no.

96
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,888
Speaker 0: you explained to him why you said dude.

97
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:56,955
Speaker 1: Never mind Oh, I did.

98
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:57,500
Speaker 1: He's like chill.

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,186
Speaker 1: It's just a DVD.

100
00:05:59,192 --> 00:05:59,634
Speaker 0: That fine.

101
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:00,457
Speaker 0: Give me the 20 bucks.

102
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,200
Speaker 0: I'll sell it to you.

103
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:06,224
Speaker 0: if DVDs are free Chill because I just get another one.

104
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:14,473
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, well, luckily the next ghost in the shell will come and luckily the cliffhanger that we were most recently ended on was not that Bad.

105
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,567
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't as bad as the previous one.

106
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:19,642
Speaker 1: granted It was kind of bags of the disc hadn't been scratched.

107
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,490
Speaker 1: We probably would have watched the whole disc.

108
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:21,972
Speaker 0: I don't know.

109
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,700
Speaker 0: We could have watched the remaining two episodes.

110
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,730
Speaker 0: That's that damage could have been on the extras now.

111
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,386
Speaker 1: See I wasn't gonna risk it because I also wasn't.

112
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:31,090
Speaker 1: you know how it goes?

113
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,127
Speaker 1: We would have been halfway through the last episode like the major would have been shot in the face and right.

114
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,023
Speaker 1: then it would Have just blacked out.

115
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:42,069
Speaker 1: Yep We were to spend an hour trying to get past the spot just to.

116
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,029
Speaker 0: well No We could tell from looking at the bottom of the disc that there was no way past the point of no return.

117
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:50,346
Speaker 1: We've been Trying to push the data part back together instead of take a tape on it.

118
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,350
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

119
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,633
Speaker 1: I've gotten that to work before.

120
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,536
Speaker 0: it doesn't work.

121
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,522
Speaker 1: So anyway, you got any news?

122
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember that cup noodle freedom action.

123
00:06:58,952 --> 00:06:59,575
Speaker 1: I remember that.

124
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:02,146
Speaker 1: I remember being funny because Emily found it way back.

125
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,978
Speaker 1: It was like, oh my god Here's something that rim and Scott won't know about.

126
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:08,172
Speaker 1: this is really cool and she comes back and she's hey guys Guess what?

127
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:11,204
Speaker 1: I'm like wait before you tell me and we showed her this cup noodle thing.

128
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:11,707
Speaker 1: We'd seen.

129
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:22,112
Speaker 0: yeah I think she listened to the show actually and heard it is the thing of the day and she was like no anyway So that cup noodle freedom thing It's also.

130
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,986
Speaker 0: it was originally a commercial for cup noodle and then it was an OVA.

131
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,270
Speaker 0: we've seen one episode of it.

132
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:35,330
Speaker 0: Well bandai who is the licenser of cup noodle freedom or just freedom OAV or OVA?

133
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,521
Speaker 0: Whatever you want to call it has decided a good thing.

134
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:48,780
Speaker 0: They are going to release it on DVD simultaneously in North America and Japan With Japanese audio only and English subtitles.

135
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:52,470
Speaker 0: hot damn, but wait, there's bad news.

136
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,299
Speaker 1: I'm gonna guess I haven't read this news.

137
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,343
Speaker 1: if I were them I probably would packages You know how a bowl noodle is about the size of a DVD.

138
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:04,450
Speaker 0: That would be a good news if they did that.

139
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,455
Speaker 1: What's the bad news?

140
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,149
Speaker 0: All right, first of all, well actually there's one other good news about it.

141
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:15,705
Speaker 0: It will be the first high-definition release of an anime in North America ever.

142
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,050
Speaker 1: wait high-definition.

143
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,557
Speaker 0: Well, but it's on a disc.

144
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,270
Speaker 0: That's HD DVDs slash DVD twins.

145
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,321
Speaker 0: So one side of the disc is an HD DVD and the other side is a DVD.

146
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:24,883
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

147
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:25,625
Speaker 0: So it's alright.

148
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:26,970
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

149
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,698
Speaker 0: They seem to think Because they're not licensed.

150
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,950
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like they're licensing it to America.

151
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,730
Speaker 0: It looked because it's like a simultaneous release with no dub that it looks like it's being released by the Japanese company.

152
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,461
Speaker 0: So this thing's gonna be $40, huh?

153
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:51,581
Speaker 1: I'm going to make a guess as to how many Americans are going to buy this DVD I will wager that three will be sold.

154
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:52,043
Speaker 0: wait.

155
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:52,384
Speaker 0: Wait.

156
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,126
Speaker 0: Wait now.

157
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,209
Speaker 0: Here's the worst part.

158
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:54,550
Speaker 0: You're ready.

159
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,977
Speaker 0: I don't know how many episodes are in this OAV.

160
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,369
Speaker 1: for 40 bucks that would have to get at least 10 episodes per disc.

161
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:05,170
Speaker 0: But I don't know how many episodes are in the OV OAV total.

162
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:09,284
Speaker 0: But it's going to be released across a total of six volumes.

163
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:09,966
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

164
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,190
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

165
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,195
Speaker 1: So $40 times six.

166
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,137
Speaker 0: Yep.

167
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,230
Speaker 1: I didn't pay that much for box sets of popular anime ten years ago.

168
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:24,837
Speaker 0: I mean their anime that I could get the entire like 26 episode series of.

169
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:28,128
Speaker 0: I could get all of asa manga dial for 60 bucks or less if I wanted to.

170
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:31,922
Speaker 0: I could Probably get it for 40 at the cheap anime ATV set.

171
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:34,693
Speaker 1: I got all of eska flown a for $23.

172
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:41,519
Speaker 0: I got all of Ava for $19 and they're gonna sell Probably one or two episodes of freedom.

173
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,910
Speaker 0: I don't know how many episodes per disc for 40 bucks.

174
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,081
Speaker 0: So I guess my kids in HD.

175
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,007
Speaker 0: it's in HD.

176
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:48,529
Speaker 0: So it's an.

177
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,340
Speaker 1: But I got a couple 40 bucks one.

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,509
Speaker 1: it in terms of making the media HD doesn't cost that much more than D.

179
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,966
Speaker 0: Well, it is an HD on one side and DVD on the other.

180
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,455
Speaker 0: So still the Can't be that much.

181
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,006
Speaker 1: You can't claim the production costs are that much.

182
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:12,490
Speaker 1: now to HD is well and good for live action, but in terms of anime, what are you gaining?

183
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:14,897
Speaker 0: Well, I think the anime was made in HD.

184
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,040
Speaker 0: we saw it.

185
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,648
Speaker 0: it was definitely an HD anime originally.

186
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,789
Speaker 1: even then I wonder if many people could even tell the difference.

187
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,099
Speaker 0: I imagine a double-blind test.

188
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,002
Speaker 0: a lot of people could not tell the difference but Regardless, you know, there is a difference.

189
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,277
Speaker 0: if you looked at him side by side You can always pick it out which one is better and go.

190
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,706
Speaker 0: it does look nicer, but it doesn't look $40 nicer.

191
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,270
Speaker 1: Maybe some good will come out of this.

192
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:47,501
Speaker 1: Maybe now a Japanese company will take a bath trying to sell DVDs for 40 bucks in America and maybe then they'll realize that Americans won't pay 40 bucks for a DVD no matter what it is.

193
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:53,369
Speaker 0: or maybe they'll say hey look at this Americans won't buy things that aren't dubbed.

194
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:58,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I'm hoping they'll be smart because maybe the Japanese companies.

195
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:06,186
Speaker 1: The reason the licensing costs are so high is that they just assume maybe they don't know that American Companies sell DVDs for like 20 bucks.

196
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:12,730
Speaker 1: Maybe they think that they're selling over here for 40 and they wonder why the American companies are always bitching about licensing costs.

197
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:14,189
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

198
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:26,650
Speaker 0: But the point is every time someone is gonna do something good with anime distribution in America They always seem to accompany it with something bad and then they they the good thing never happens again.

199
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,603
Speaker 0: You know Viz is like we're gonna put Death Note on the internet.

200
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:29,684
Speaker 0: Yay.

201
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:30,970
Speaker 0: We're gonna put DRM on it.

202
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,107
Speaker 0: No, we're gonna put freedom out right away on DVDs.

203
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:38,264
Speaker 0: Yay We're gonna give you like barely any episodes per disc in HD for 40 bucks.

204
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:41,487
Speaker 0: No, it's like ah Just do what we say.

205
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:54,590
Speaker 1: For some reason I have a feeling that the anime industry is not listening to geek nights and anime world order to figure out Their business plans even though they should be and that's why they're losing making less money than they were making four or five years ago.

206
00:11:54,891 --> 00:12:02,542
Speaker 0: Well, not that we actually know how much money anyone makes but that's a whole pretty sure if you look at the number of shows That are being licensed the show's coming out, etc.

207
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:02,623
Speaker 0: Etc.

208
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:10,048
Speaker 1: Oh If I look at my own personal when was the last time we bought anime that wasn't five bucks at a con.

209
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,795
Speaker 0: Yep It's in there.

210
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,070
Speaker 0: They're definitely not making as much money as they were four or five years ago.

211
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,133
Speaker 0: I mean all that.

212
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:22,308
Speaker 0: remember what Otakon like every major every anime company set up a huge booth at Otakon and now they don't Do that anymore?

213
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,135
Speaker 1: Yeah.

214
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:34,683
Speaker 1: So speaking of licensing issues, I find this rather hilarious, but according to the anime news network Libre which publishes b-boy and b-boy gold in other words a yaoi.

215
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:35,225
Speaker 1: Yeah.

216
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:43,150
Speaker 0: Well Central Park media Who's almost out of business that gave rim stuff for free that provided the prize for our contest?

217
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, all them.

218
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:51,410
Speaker 1: Well, they have been publishing these things in America, which everyone assumed was just legitimate.

219
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:56,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a lot of different companies now licensing yaois for.

220
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,589
Speaker 0: you know Distribution in America and they always put a different name on.

221
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:02,617
Speaker 0: you know Cuz it's all imprinting.

222
00:13:02,677 --> 00:13:06,090
Speaker 0: if you're a publisher of books you have a different imprint for your different books.

223
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,059
Speaker 0: You know like Marvel also publishes like.

224
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:10,704
Speaker 0: I forget.

225
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:15,401
Speaker 0: but DC also publishes vertigo And it doesn't say DC on it, but it's the same company.

226
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,530
Speaker 0: They just put a different publishing label on there.

227
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,232
Speaker 0: It's called an imprint.

228
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:23,950
Speaker 0: So when CPM makes yaoi, they don't say CPM they say be beautiful on it.

229
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:40,943
Speaker 1: Yep, well according to Libre and a statement on their website Be beautiful has been releasing many of their works in America without any permission or license or anything whatsoever And they've issued a cease-and-desist and there's.

230
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:42,630
Speaker 1: there's probably going to be a lawsuit.

231
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:44,576
Speaker 0: That's pretty awesome.

232
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,623
Speaker 1: I wonder is this true.

233
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:50,477
Speaker 1: Maybe this is some sort of Marketing BS thing.

234
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,967
Speaker 1: Maybe there's just gross and confident somewhere.

235
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:53,790
Speaker 1: How could this happen?

236
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:55,313
Speaker 0: I don't know.

237
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:58,121
Speaker 0: CPM didn't seem that doesn't seem that confident overall.

238
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,569
Speaker 0: Maybe they thought they licensed something and didn't.

239
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:06,590
Speaker 0: Maybe that company licensed something and didn't realize what it did get lost in translation.

240
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:12,568
Speaker 0: Maybe CPM just took a manga translated it and printed it said haha.

241
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:13,210
Speaker 0: No one will notice.

242
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:24,636
Speaker 1: I just really wonder if this was a an act of actual maliciousness for hey maybe we'll get away with this or if they just there was some sort of technicality in the contract and Libre is just going nuts about it.

243
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,323
Speaker 0: It does give me an idea though.

244
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:32,793
Speaker 0: We could totally get cancellations of manga print them and Covertly sell them.

245
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:38,810
Speaker 0: as you know bootleggers totally illegally totally on the black market of manga.

246
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:45,174
Speaker 1: Well, I find something interesting that they're asking fans to not purchase these items Which I would.

247
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:49,990
Speaker 1: I would think that if they were gonna sue CPM that they would just sue them and that would be the end of it.

248
00:14:50,211 --> 00:14:55,230
Speaker 1: They wouldn't have to worry about telling fans to stop buying it because they could definitely recoup losses for everything sold.

249
00:14:55,813 --> 00:15:08,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could be some sort of Backdoor, you know hidden information that we don't know about such as They saw the releases in English and they don't like them or you know CPM.

250
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,410
Speaker 0: They had a deal and maybe they didn't realize that the deal was in CPM scam them.

251
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,870
Speaker 0: So they're trying to get back at CPM or something.

252
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:27,410
Speaker 0: It's kind of stupid to say fans don't buy these because if you say that someone's doing something illegally You just make it it more likely that fans are gonna run out and buy them real quick before they're gone.

253
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,964
Speaker 1: I really wonder if there's gonna actually be a lawsuit or if they're just telling them to stop.

254
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:42,290
Speaker 0: if they just tell them to stop And they don't sue them I say we go and find out all the Yahweh this company publishes Translate it and print it cuz they're not gonna do a goddamn thing about it.

255
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:55,836
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna watch it too because this will test a lot of ideas I have about how copyright law works internationally and I want to see if this company can actually follow through and Bring charges against or not.

256
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:59,729
Speaker 0: if they can't I'm taking fan subs putting them on DVDs and selling them.

257
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,737
Speaker 0: It's not a goddamn thing.

258
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:02,700
Speaker 0: Anyone could do about it.

259
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:10,185
Speaker 0: But of course, I'll only do it with anime that Aren't licensed in America and no one will ever license in America because they're too awesome.

260
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,690
Speaker 1: and I got one more little bit.

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,299
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna mention this briefly work.

262
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,190
Speaker 1: We'll probably talk about it in more depth later.

263
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:25,150
Speaker 1: what's more details come out, but it looks like in 2008 there's going to be a dragon ball online a massively multiplayer online dragon ball.

264
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:25,750
Speaker 0: So wait.

265
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:34,922
Speaker 0: So all you do is you you really only have like four or five characters designs to choose from like green guy bald guy Girl and yellow hair electric guy.

266
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,690
Speaker 1: Have you ever actually seen your dragon ball?

267
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,877
Speaker 1: There's more to it than that.

268
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:45,068
Speaker 0: and then you're in a big Sky flying around and when you see someone you yell into your microphone at them.

269
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:49,038
Speaker 0: come And then you hit your spacebar as fat.

270
00:16:49,158 --> 00:17:03,050
Speaker 0: you can tend to finger your spacebar as much as you can to see who grows Brighter and has a bigger number on the screen 9,000 and his power level is over 9,000.

271
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,950
Speaker 1: Apparently this is set several hundred years after the events of Dragon Ball, huh?

272
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:14,873
Speaker 1: And don't forget players can freely customize their hair Uh-huh.

273
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,279
Speaker 1: Oh god, I didn't even notice that there's screenshots.

274
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:17,981
Speaker 1: All right.

275
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:29,632
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about this in more depth later just so you are aware things of the day Now.

276
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:39,269
Speaker 1: we've known about the Mario manga for a long time and we really want to read it But there don't seem to be many fans Translations of it meaning there aren't any as far as I can see.

277
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:48,527
Speaker 0: yeah, and we've known about the Mario show and some other Mario shows from other countries and We've known that there's at least one Mario anime that we saw one episode of.

278
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,210
Speaker 0: that was pretty bad.

279
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,776
Speaker 1: Well, it looks like there's another one.

280
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,583
Speaker 1: That's wild pretty bad.

281
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:56,610
Speaker 0: Not quite as bad It's kind of bad.

282
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:06,127
Speaker 0: I think it's more faithful to the video game than a lot of the other ones Which is why it doesn't seem so bad in the first place Yeah, but at the same time it's far less faithful to what King Koopa should actually be.

283
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:08,696
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean a Koopa that just goes.

284
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:09,579
Speaker 0: he's like Godzilla.

285
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,382
Speaker 0: He doesn't talk.

286
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:11,807
Speaker 0: He doesn't seem too intelligent.

287
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:16,410
Speaker 0: He just goes And picks up the princess and walks away.

288
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:24,329
Speaker 1: well, someone seems to have uploaded the first three or four minutes of this thing, which is moderately entertaining mostly because you know You don't have to actually watch the whole thing.

289
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:39,005
Speaker 1: And all I really want to point out is that you'll probably enjoy this if you've watched anime long enough Even if you don't speak Japanese, this isn't subtitled obviously, but you might be surprised how much you Understand despite not speaking Japanese.

290
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:43,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Understood Me like enough of what they were saying.

291
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:47,588
Speaker 0: I felt like, you know, like what a one-year-old in Japan would understand.

292
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,839
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, that's where I feel as opposed to a zero-year-old.

293
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:54,010
Speaker 1: I guess we've watched way too much anime.

294
00:18:54,773 --> 00:19:03,750
Speaker 0: Perhaps we have but that's good because now I don't really you know I mean for something complex like ghost in the shell pretty much fucked without subtitles.

295
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,830
Speaker 1: God even with subtitles I have trouble with ghost to me too.

296
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:17,647
Speaker 1: But it was that one episode in standalone complex where we're just sitting there and they talked for like 10 minutes Just about deep hard to understand political bullshit.

297
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,702
Speaker 0: Yep I still don't understand half of the shit that's going on in that show.

298
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,430
Speaker 1: I've started to figure out what's going on.

299
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:29,810
Speaker 0: I think I have I got the general idea enough to enjoy the show But I don't think it's worth the time and effort to go back and figure out all the details.

300
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:35,667
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I understand what all the different parts of the government have at stake and why they're all involved.

301
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,570
Speaker 1: and we're section 9.

302
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:43,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I got that but like all the little tiny You know things that they just keep going like oh this and that and this and that like what?

303
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:46,855
Speaker 0: just give me the main Gist and go shoot somebody.

304
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,086
Speaker 1: most of that isn't really as complex as you might think if I know.

305
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:50,768
Speaker 0: it's just the way.

306
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:56,189
Speaker 0: the subtitles Is there like a big two big sentences and they'll only be there for a real quick and then they'll be two more.

307
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,390
Speaker 0: and it's like Ah, I'm still processing the last one.

308
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,388
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine reading a manga adaptation or anything of that because it'd have to be crazy.

309
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,817
Speaker 1: kanji No one's ever seen before.

310
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,844
Speaker 0: well in English.

311
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:05,589
Speaker 0: It'd be okay.

312
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:10,826
Speaker 0: But yeah, this Mario anime worth your four minutes of time.

313
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly Alright, so there are a lot of martial arts out there.

314
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:23,326
Speaker 0: There's a kung fu Karate Krav maga kra, that's krav maga, whatever.

315
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:34,976
Speaker 0: Yeah Taekwondo judo all kinds but one kind that is extremely entertaining perhaps the second most Entertaining martial art to watch.

316
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,380
Speaker 1: what's the most entertaining?

317
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:37,825
Speaker 0: I kiddo nah, huh?

318
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,390
Speaker 1: What about capoeira?

319
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,060
Speaker 0: Capoeira is pretty cool, but it's much.

320
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,549
Speaker 0: It's more like dancing even though I guess it is a martial art.

321
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:55,790
Speaker 0: Plus kung fu is my favorite martial art to watch especially fake Hollywood kung fu or a Hollywood kung fu is a separate martial art though It's not the same as Shaolin kung fu.

322
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:59,930
Speaker 0: But yeah Jujitsu is really entertaining.

323
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:05,510
Speaker 0: I had a friend in high school who was super into jiu-jitsu and the way he explained it to me back in those days.

324
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:07,350
Speaker 0: You know, I didn't look this up or anything.

325
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,396
Speaker 0: This is just going by what some guy told me that.

326
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:29,884
Speaker 0: what I remember is that the majority of real fights in the street Like if you're at a bar and some guy starts to mess with you or you know If you're in a town and a crazy hick starts to come around and push you around Most fights like that end up with two guys rolling around on the ground, you know There isn't a whole lot of stand-up punching in the face fighting going on.

327
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:34,040
Speaker 0: when it comes to real You know street violence in the United States.

328
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:36,690
Speaker 1: Well, I remember when I was a little kid at elementary school.

329
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:39,500
Speaker 1: I was attacked by this other thug kid.

330
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,490
Speaker 1: I went to downtown Detroit schools and this kid just attacked me.

331
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,870
Speaker 1: We never really found out why but the fight ended up on the ground after about two seconds.

332
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:57,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean people, you know, it's like there might be a punch or two but then you're grabbing the other guy and you're rolling around on the ground and Jiu-jitsu is all about step one get the guy on the ground.

333
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:04,899
Speaker 0: step two when you're on the ground Jiu-jitsu will tell you how to do the most physical damage possible in the least amount of time.

334
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:10,480
Speaker 0: Now this isn't the most impressive video because the guy is obviously fighting.

335
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,117
Speaker 1: You know his students who are what you expected him to go around in the street picking fights.

336
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:15,880
Speaker 0: Hell's yeah.

337
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:19,740
Speaker 0: But no, it's not at least the competition where the other people are trying to fight back.

338
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:23,339
Speaker 0: This is his students basically letting him do what he wants to them.

339
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:31,224
Speaker 0: But he shows you the crazy ways in which he puts someone on the ground and then pins them there And I particularly.

340
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:37,809
Speaker 1: they're like the one where the guy tries to punch him and he just kind of takes the punch like grabs the Guy's arm and lets the punch come in.

341
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:43,079
Speaker 1: then he jumps off with his legs Which his whole body on top of the guy and just pulls him to the ground.

342
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:48,312
Speaker 0: You know back in the olden days, you know Just fighting around as kids where kids would just fight.

343
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:49,860
Speaker 0: I've done stuff like that.

344
00:22:50,040 --> 00:23:00,259
Speaker 0: Just is natural kind of like someone grabs my arm and then I'll like just swing my legs up onto their body And then they'll be weighted down by me and then eventually they'll fall.

345
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:07,623
Speaker 0: It wasn't quite as elegant, you know and practiced is what this guy's doing But that's sort of a natural fighting move of mine I don't know.

346
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:14,666
Speaker 1: my generic idea if I ever get into a fight again is simply punch them in the nose quickly and then run Away, that's a good move.

347
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:19,859
Speaker 1: or the classic kick him lightly in the shin as soon as they look down punch him in the nose And then run away.

348
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:32,604
Speaker 0: I just kind of like jiu-jitsu because it seems slightly more practical than a lot of other martial arts at least on paper and As far as I know it doesn't have a lot of that hokey-chee malarkey But it probably does.

349
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:36,618
Speaker 1: it probably doesn't have as much punch yourself in the gut for ten minutes.

350
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:37,340
Speaker 0: That's true.

351
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of punching or kicking knuckle push-ups and keep doing until everyone in the room is done ten And if someone can't do ten you're stuck there doing a hundred.

352
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:50,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, jiu-jitsu just doesn't have a lot of punching and kicking and all that sort of stuff.

353
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,439
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of striking at all.

354
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:00,283
Speaker 0: It's mostly grabbing and pinning and twisting and holding and that sort of thing only more practical than say judo Which is similar.

355
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:02,189
Speaker 1: so not too long ago.

356
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,634
Speaker 1: We there's an anime.

357
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:04,657
Speaker 1: We're really excited about.

358
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:13,154
Speaker 1: we're gonna talk about it Once we've seen more of it, but it's called Moonlight Mile and it looked like it was everything We wanted out of an anime and we released according to the preview.

359
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:16,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, the trailer and the preview were like This is not Brim and Scott's alley.

360
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:26,407
Speaker 1: it's got nothing but politics robots technology drama serious geeky guy kind of action outer space and Without ruining anything.

361
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,640
Speaker 1: it basically was space orgy and then nothing.

362
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:36,980
Speaker 1: It wasn't what we expected completely and I was so pissed off that I'm not even ready to talk about it yet.

363
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:41,680
Speaker 0: We're gonna have to see it probably the second episode and then we'll be pissed off enough to talk about it.

364
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,360
Speaker 1: So as a result this week we had to talk about something good to get that out of our mind.

365
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:48,190
Speaker 0: It helped that.

366
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:49,740
Speaker 0: I think it was was it?

367
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the most recent episode of animal order the one where they played all those voicemails.

368
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:06,719
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that one and someone sent him a voicemail and said hey if you heard of this anime here is Greenwood And I was like, oh shit's we needs to do an episode on that before anybody else.

369
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:08,004
Speaker 1: Yeah Here is Greenwood.

370
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:17,760
Speaker 0: is is very near and dear to rim and sky and it's a great Awesome anime and manga that not too many people know about hence perfect for a geek nights episode.

371
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:20,900
Speaker 0: So, how did we find out about here is Greenwood?

372
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,280
Speaker 0: Well, you see basically, I mean this anime was obscure when we were in college.

373
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:30,060
Speaker 1: It was also hard to get because the VHS was out of print and there was no DVD for a while.

374
00:25:30,682 --> 00:25:33,250
Speaker 1: I remember the club had three tapes.

375
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,360
Speaker 1: It had the basically these tapes that had the whole away the on it.

376
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a six episode OAV and each tape had two episodes on it and people kept stealing the second tape.

377
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:46,414
Speaker 1: Yes, like literally people constantly would steal this.

378
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:48,080
Speaker 1: what you wanted to check out here is Greenwood.

379
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,623
Speaker 1: We had to get.

380
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:53,740
Speaker 1: we had to get special permission and make sure that you were in a scuzzy, dude Because they kept getting stolen.

381
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:55,226
Speaker 0: It was that good.

382
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:57,515
Speaker 0: people would rent it from the anime club library and keep it.

383
00:25:57,797 --> 00:26:03,200
Speaker 1: see the thing was Here's Greenwood is one the official anime of the RIT anime club.

384
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,408
Speaker 1: That was the largest anime club in the country.

385
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:10,647
Speaker 1: Yes when we were in it now, this was true before we got there God, this was true for like a decade before.

386
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,721
Speaker 0: we didn't know anything about here's Greenwood when we got there until they showed it To us.

387
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:22,700
Speaker 0: now the official motto of the RIT anime club is we are the no-brand heroes Which is the closing song of here's Greenwood.

388
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:27,274
Speaker 1: It's also a fairly well-known and popular phrase among older anime fans.

389
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:31,177
Speaker 0: it is indeed of course the official mascot of the RIT.

390
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:35,440
Speaker 0: anime Is the great messenger which has nothing to do with here's Greenwood?

391
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:43,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the tradition was that not every year because that would get old but every few years Maybe every two or three years depending on what kind of people were coming.

392
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:50,500
Speaker 1: through RIT The club would show here is Greenwood all in one go as one showing and without fail.

393
00:26:50,902 --> 00:27:02,362
Speaker 1: People would wonder what the hell this show is that they'd never heard of and by the end of the episode People were crying and jumping around and yelling and screaming and then there'd be a mad rush for people to check the tapes out to Show it to other people.

394
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:06,274
Speaker 0: Well, luckily now if you're smart and cool, you can get all of.

395
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:11,360
Speaker 0: here is Greenwood on a single DVD Six episodes one disc beat that Yeah

396
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:20,620
Speaker 1: And I usually don't bother trying to tell people to buy anime because you can Netflix it or you can watch the fan subs before It comes out or you can buy the super box set years later borrowed from a friend.

397
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:29,900
Speaker 1: but here's Greenwood is one of those shows where it's good to own it because it's the kind of thing that every few years you're Gonna want to whip out and show to someone who's never seen it or lend it out to people.

398
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:35,094
Speaker 0: I would go so far as to say that no anime DVD shelf is complete without.

399
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:36,157
Speaker 0: here is Greenwood.

400
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:40,593
Speaker 1: now as for the manga I really like the manga, but you don't have to buy the manga.

401
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:45,132
Speaker 1: The manga is in no way Integral to actually watching the anime.

402
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:46,540
Speaker 1: You don't need to know anything about it.

403
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,308
Speaker 1: The anime is completely self-contained.

404
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, the manga is only nine volumes though.

405
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,079
Speaker 0: So if you really like the anime, then if you want the manga go and get it.

406
00:27:56,461 --> 00:28:00,536
Speaker 1: All I'll say about the manga is that is pretty much exactly like the anime.

407
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,680
Speaker 1: It's just not only more.

408
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,740
Speaker 1: It's just not animated and it doesn't get old.

409
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,230
Speaker 1: You might think that something like this could get old but it doesn't.

410
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:13,202
Speaker 1: I've read a good half the manga and I've got the rest Of it and I really really like it probably more than I should Alright.

411
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:20,645
Speaker 0: so now I'm gonna tell you what here's Greenwood is about and you will quickly see why is the official anime of the RIT Anime Club.

412
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:20,887
Speaker 1: Yep.

413
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:25,949
Speaker 1: Now originally the manga is by Yukinasu and she's really cute and that's all I'll say.

414
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:26,571
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

415
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,295
Speaker 0: Well, here's Greenwood.

416
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:29,498
Speaker 0: It's about this guy.

417
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:30,100
Speaker 0: What's his name?

418
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,727
Speaker 1: Hasekawa Kazuya.

419
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:40,960
Speaker 0: Yes, Hasekawa Kazuya, whatever he lives at home with his brother and His brother's girlfriend.

420
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,960
Speaker 1: Yes, they're there to be married their fiance.

421
00:28:44,326 --> 00:28:52,373
Speaker 0: Yes But it turns out that before they were engaged This kid had a super crush on that girl.

422
00:28:52,494 --> 00:28:54,000
Speaker 0: That is now his brother's fiance.

423
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:57,479
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like his older brother stole his woman from him.

424
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:02,180
Speaker 1: Yes, Sumire is in this manga and in the anime utterly adorable.

425
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:11,454
Speaker 1: They go out of their way to make her as adorable as possible and not adorable in this modern You know moe almost kind of sense like adorable anime characters now.

426
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:16,428
Speaker 1: She's adorable in this very old-school Ranma mazani koku kind of way.

427
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:16,910
Speaker 1: Yep.

428
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:27,110
Speaker 0: Like imagine if you were a kid and The girl you had a super crush on all of a sudden was your older brother's fiance And with the parents are dead or something, right?

429
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,757
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't that doesn't really matter.

430
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:29,480
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

431
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,854
Speaker 0: You hardly know about them and they don't come into it, but the parents aren't there.

432
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:34,200
Speaker 0: He's pretty upset.

433
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:47,180
Speaker 0: So when it comes time to go to school But he can't stand being in that house seeing his brother and this girl be an all lovey-lovey Mostly because he knows what they do in the bedroom at night and he just can't deal with that.

434
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:58,140
Speaker 1: Yep Also, he's been driven by stress of trying to get into high school and stress of living with the woman He loves and the man she loves gave him an ulcer and all sorts of complications.

435
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:10,199
Speaker 0: So when it finally comes time to go to high school, he goes to the local high school But he decides to stay in the dorm even though he lives in the same exact town, but he shows up late.

436
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:14,600
Speaker 0: He doesn't go to school on the first day because of the ulcer that rim just talked about.

437
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:23,176
Speaker 0: So when he finally shows up to the not first day of school, but his first day of school late He is put in the dorm known as Greenwood.

438
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:31,439
Speaker 1: now Greenwood I recall if you look at the kanji basically means something along the lines of den of thieves or forest of thieves or something like that.

439
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,471
Speaker 0: Greenwood is a dorm full of craziness.

440
00:30:36,113 --> 00:30:36,816
Speaker 0: Oh snaps.

441
00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:39,426
Speaker 1: It's It's hard to really explain.

442
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:43,080
Speaker 1: It's not zany like Excel saga or any of these modern anime.

443
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,320
Speaker 0: Well, I think for the time it was zany.

444
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not a raised the zany bar, but it's not as zany as stuff we have now.

445
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:53,039
Speaker 0: by today's standards It is pretty tame.

446
00:30:53,261 --> 00:31:00,342
Speaker 1: It's a very low-key zany and a lot of very strange things will happen, but it's not like a modern Everyone.

447
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:01,626
Speaker 1: oh something crazy.

448
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:04,133
Speaker 0: Oh my random animals flying around.

449
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,860
Speaker 0: It's not chromarty crazy, but it's just a gorilla.

450
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:16,115
Speaker 1: Randomly when a crazy thing happens or something weird happens It's taken at face value by all the people and it's not anything weird.

451
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:17,699
Speaker 1: They don't even bat an eye at it.

452
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:26,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, so as you can see It's perfect choice for a college anime club to pick as their official anime when it's about a crazy wacky dorm.

453
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:48,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically Hasekawa or tsukachan as they end up calling him ends up falling under the wing of these three upperclassmen and as a result he basically ends up kind of at the center of all of the goings-on at this high school because it turns out that these Three people are themselves the center of just about everything that goes on at this high school.

454
00:31:49,622 --> 00:32:05,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much each episode has some sort of crazy plot that involves some mostly these four characters And you know stuff goes on and they solve it along the way, but what really makes this show great I think are all these secondary characters.

455
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 0: Just the random people who live about the dorm making it wacky.

456
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:17,565
Speaker 1: I mean, let's see There's one dorm one room where the two people living in it have turned their entire room into a not just an arcade But a profitable arcade.

457
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:23,240
Speaker 0: Yes, they are specifically known as the guys who have turned their dorm room into a profitable video arcade.

458
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,902
Speaker 1: I don't know if they ever get names at least in the anime They don't.

459
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:29,120
Speaker 0: there are also this one guy who's the best character in the whole show?

460
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,362
Speaker 0: Who you know.

461
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:32,270
Speaker 0: in Japan if you have a motorcycle?

462
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,620
Speaker 0: You can't really like leave it outside anywhere.

463
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,260
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of room in Japan for that sort of thing.

464
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:50,531
Speaker 0: So if you have a motorcycle you can carry it up to your room And there's a guy who carries his giant motorcycle up to his room and whenever people go down the stairs He always seems to be on the stairs carrying this motorcycle.

465
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:52,720
Speaker 1: I guess he just carries it up and down all the time.

466
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:57,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty funny when you see this huge American looking guy.

467
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,720
Speaker 0: He's like five taller than all the Japanese people carrying this giant motorcycle or one thing that happens when this kid comes.

468
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 1: He joins the dorm.

469
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,004
Speaker 1: He comes in the first day.

470
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:11,231
Speaker 1: all the clubs are desperate to get people to join But the dorm is cool.

471
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,240
Speaker 1: The people who run the dorm are great.

472
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,760
Speaker 1: They set up this whole policy where the clubs can't try to recruit him on the dorm ground.

473
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,319
Speaker 1: So he has a little bit of sanctuary.

474
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:30,620
Speaker 1: one of the clubs is the crazy Christian group the equivalent of the American campus crusade for Christ and The way they're drawn in the manga and the way they're depicted in the anime are absolutely hilarious.

475
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:34,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've got you know, your stereotypical swirly eyeballs.

476
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:49,180
Speaker 0: They're like They look sort of like zombies and they're holding like, you know a book with a cross on it and they're standing straight up and like oh Now the actual main characters are also would really make this manga anime manga shine.

477
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,428
Speaker 1: I mean hasakawa is a typical kid.

478
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:53,255
Speaker 1: He overreacts to everything.

479
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,720
Speaker 1: He's stressed all the time.

480
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:59,575
Speaker 1: He always has an ulcer any time Sumire comes to see him.

481
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:01,180
Speaker 1: He freaks out and can't deal with it.

482
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:12,880
Speaker 1: He furthermore has to deal with the fact that his older brother who is Dating married to his first loving to be married to is also the male nurse of this dorm of the school.

483
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is an all-male school.

484
00:34:15,228 --> 00:34:18,280
Speaker 0: So his brother a male is the school nurse.

485
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:21,980
Speaker 0: It's like if you're trying to get away, why did you go to the school where he's the nurse?

486
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,627
Speaker 0: You should have gone to a faraway school.

487
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,114
Speaker 0: What was wrong with you?

488
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,219
Speaker 1: This kid has issues.

489
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,299
Speaker 0: He's got definitely the serious issues.

490
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:35,840
Speaker 1: However, despite that when push comes to some shove he's fairly confident and he grows into a real man by the end of the OAV.

491
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:57,755
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean despite having all sorts of stress and Being sort of you know freaked out by all the crazy things that go on around him and the Greenwood dorm of wackiness He's actually sort of the straight man, you know He's not really that wacky himself so much as the other characters and he's not stupid You know, even though he doesn't do as well in class as maybe he should.

492
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:03,657
Speaker 0: but that's just you know To help you identify with the character if you're not a genius, but yeah, he gets along.

493
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:08,194
Speaker 0: Okay So then what you would think there is his first roommate.

494
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:12,027
Speaker 1: I'm not going to ruin Well anything about his first roommate.

495
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:15,056
Speaker 1: suffice to say the anime is going to start with a plot.

496
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,340
Speaker 1: That is so stereotypical.

497
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:23,895
Speaker 1: You're probably gonna want to turn it off because when they introduce what this plot is, you'll think wow What the hell is wrong with rim and sky?

498
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:24,579
Speaker 1: This is stupid.

499
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:30,736
Speaker 0: But that plot that the first plot of the first episode that everyone pretty much goes what?

500
00:35:30,877 --> 00:35:39,820
Speaker 0: Oh, come on, boo What's this BS Stereotypical crap is resolved pretty quickly by the end of the before well before the end of the first episode.

501
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:41,874
Speaker 1: Not only is it resolved really quickly.

502
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:55,724
Speaker 1: It is resolved hilariously and when it happens, I want you to not spoil this for yourself and One remember when you figured it out and there's a moment at which you probably should have figured it out But you didn't.

503
00:35:56,105 --> 00:36:00,180
Speaker 1: and then they've main character is gonna figure it out like 20 seconds later.

504
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:02,424
Speaker 0: It's good times.

505
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:07,440
Speaker 1: Yes, but suffice to say that is not the what this show is about.

506
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:10,731
Speaker 1: Well, I guess what it appears to be is not what the show is about.

507
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:13,599
Speaker 1: how it is resolved is what the show is all about.

508
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:22,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, as soon as you get to the end of that first bit there where there's a reveal of some sort and you go Oh my god, that's how the rest of the show goes from there on out.

509
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:35,794
Speaker 1: So then the two upperclassmen who have kind of taken this kid under his wing are Mitsuru who is a pretty boy all the girls that local junior high and all the girls at this school Not at this school, but at their sister school, whatever really like him.

510
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:37,200
Speaker 1: He's really pretty really popular.

511
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:42,506
Speaker 1: he's the head of the dorm kind of the equivalent of the RA or the RD and He has.

512
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:46,064
Speaker 1: they make mention that he has a special power Uh-huh.

513
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:53,865
Speaker 1: His power is that his face is 100% immune to damage that would in any way disfigure him Uh-huh.

514
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,680
Speaker 1: Now they mentioned this kind of tongue-in-cheek and is kind of a joke.

515
00:36:57,023 --> 00:37:04,240
Speaker 1: But way later in the show There's a point in which a woman slashes his face with a knife and it heals right away and everyone's like, whoa

516
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:22,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone whether you realize they're not seems to have some sort of special power of some sort in this show Even if it's a very small special power or an insignificant special power or something It doesn't even seem like a power at all, you know, and when you figure out what each character does It's kind of like ooh

517
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's done in this casual really kind of way.

518
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:41,039
Speaker 1: but the whole show and even the manga is even worse about this is Really kind of it'll break the fourth wall The manga actually does that fairly often and there'll be little elements like the superpower that come out of nowhere And yet they really really fit and then they're thrown away and you don't worry about him again.

519
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:44,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have really much to do with what's going on.

520
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,444
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like.

521
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:49,480
Speaker 0: it's more of a character thing than a plot thing these power things that people have.

522
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,329
Speaker 1: Well, the characters are all there is to the show.

523
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,620
Speaker 1: the plot exists and there are various subplots.

524
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,047
Speaker 0: Well the plots also.

525
00:37:55,228 --> 00:38:00,870
Speaker 0: it's like there aren't any big plots that all Encompass the entire show or the entire manga or anything.

526
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:04,560
Speaker 0: every plot is sort of a you know, this character.

527
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,828
Speaker 0: We're gonna resolve his bit about this or we're gonna reveal a whole bunch of stuff about this Character and then tie up a couple of the loose ends on it.

528
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:12,270
Speaker 1: Yep.

529
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,580
Speaker 1: The anime generally follows the format of little subplot.

530
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,724
Speaker 1: That's funny little subplot.

531
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:26,420
Speaker 1: That's funny a bunch of those and then the last two episodes are actually a pretty serious Good story arc and then that's where it ends and it ends on a very poignant note.

532
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

533
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,311
Speaker 0: It doesn't keep up the funny level.

534
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,700
Speaker 0: it towards the end of the anime, but it's still funny enough.

535
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:37,855
Speaker 1: Well, it works Well because it has this really good level of funny and then it tapers off into the serious thing.

536
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:42,958
Speaker 1: that's not super serious But it's serious enough to where the show leaves you feeling good at the end.

537
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,549
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, plus out all the people we showed it to.

538
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,080
Speaker 1: they really like the last two episodes more than the rest of the show.

539
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,369
Speaker 0: Usually wasn't there a Halloween episode.

540
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,135
Speaker 1: Well, there was a thing.

541
00:38:52,156 --> 00:38:53,240
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's right.

542
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:57,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show does have a little bit of supernatural kind of action.

543
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,053
Speaker 1: But here's the thing like many times when something appears supernatural.

544
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:03,036
Speaker 1: It's actually not.

545
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:06,307
Speaker 1: now in the anime There's one thing that actually is supernatural.

546
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:10,240
Speaker 1: But even then it's done in this really kind of low-key funny way.

547
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:14,251
Speaker 0: There are also a lot of things that are just like WTF.

548
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:14,940
Speaker 0: what the hell?

549
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,110
Speaker 0: WTF mate like the guy's sister.

550
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,187
Speaker 0: It's just oh, yeah, it's just so Crazy that it's just unbelievable.

551
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:34,020
Speaker 0: The thing is it's crazy more along the lines that this woman is just crazy And as a result a lot of the stuff just makes no sense and all the characters that aren't stupid are just like what?

552
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,622
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the thing.

553
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:45,420
Speaker 1: that characters react to these weird things very nonchalantly because I guess they're used to it But at the same time they react to them the way a normal person who just saw this would deal with it.

554
00:39:45,761 --> 00:40:05,379
Speaker 1: I mean if one of these characters older sister happens to go crazy and kidnap him in this crazy Absolutely insane thing all the other characters deal with that in the way that a normal human being would probably deal with it Insofar as a normal human being who had been living in this dorm would deal with it.

555
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:16,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show also in addition to being generally wacky and you know Generally character driven has a lot of like repeating jokes that they're just.

556
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:24,293
Speaker 0: they're just sort of like these one-line Jokes or innuendos here and there like the two pretty boys would be like, oh We're gay.

557
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:38,699
Speaker 0: And if like ha ha ha ha and then they're not gay, you know just be like, haha We made a gay joke and then someone else makes a joke about you know Something else and these jokes recur every once in a while and they're like, oh they made that joke again.

558
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:41,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yet the jokes never really get tired.

559
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,180
Speaker 1: I guess part of it's that the OAV is very short and sweet.

560
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,485
Speaker 1: I mean, it's only six episodes.

561
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:47,629
Speaker 1: You can watch it in one go.

562
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:50,420
Speaker 1: So it really doesn't have enough time to get cliched.

563
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:56,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the manga really starts expanding on all that to where it never gets to the point where you think ah They're doing that again.

564
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:02,277
Speaker 0: Yeah the anime can repeat itself because it's so short and the manga doesn't repeat itself because it has room to grow.

565
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:04,067
Speaker 0: whereas if the Anime tried to grow.

566
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:06,080
Speaker 0: I think it would not fit in its shoe anymore.

567
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:23,056
Speaker 1: But meets her was kind of the laid-back bad-boy kind of character and his friend the student council president Shinobu is the cool calculated not necessarily evil But definitely always has ulterior motives and it's always manipulating everyone around him kind of guy.

568
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:30,995
Speaker 1: He also is Totally corrupt when it comes to running the student government Super corrupt when it comes to running the student.

569
00:41:31,015 --> 00:41:31,337
Speaker 1: good God.

570
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:39,223
Speaker 1: So in a word if I had to describe here is Greenwood the anime or the manga I would have to use the word charming Maybe.

571
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:44,588
Speaker 1: I guess it's definitely this low-key laid-back Kind of the humor will often build on you.

572
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:58,324
Speaker 1: the humor is usually it won't be the zany thing itself but it'll be the reaction shot or the look on a character's face when something happens or the little side quip that a side character makes as they're walking by or That sort of thing.

573
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:02,419
Speaker 1: lots of little jokes that kind of build up and make you laugh out loud by the end.

574
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:21,239
Speaker 1: Of course I do think that part of the reason I like this show so much and Scott likes the show and all of our friends like The show is that not in terms of events or the way things worked out But in terms of the spirit of the of the work What happens and here is Greenwood is a lot like our lives were when we were at our IT.

575
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:32,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were actually talking about that the other day how we missed the fact that I remember coming home from class or from whatever I was doing and without fail Something weird would happen.

576
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:41,220
Speaker 1: I'd always see like a naked guy running around or there'd be a couch on fire Or there'd be a guy with an ethernet cable running out his window to his car.

577
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:49,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it as much as even though it's about high school in Japan if you're a college student in the u.s Especially at a geeky college.

578
00:42:50,462 --> 00:43:02,728
Speaker 0: There is just so much that is like this is they must have gone to a geeky college and pretended It was a Japanese high school dorm when they made this because it is so dead-on Hence the matching with our IT.

579
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:05,157
Speaker 0: and it really did match with our IT.

580
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:11,000
Speaker 1: so well I mean reading here is Greenwood fills me with horrible nostalgia for living in the dorms in college.

581
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:18,298
Speaker 0: When I was living in the dorms in college and I saw here is Greenwood for the first time It gave me nostalgia for the previous day.

582
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:20,442
Speaker 0: It's like.

583
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,528
Speaker 0: it's like oh, yeah yesterday.

584
00:43:22,588 --> 00:43:24,112
Speaker 0: I saw something crazy like that.

585
00:43:24,713 --> 00:43:27,120
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a good days yesterday and all.

586
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:32,024
Speaker 1: So I can't recommend this show enough the manga I really like.

587
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:33,791
Speaker 1: if you like I'd say buy the anime.

588
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,900
Speaker 1: you have nothing to lose by buying this anime.

589
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,892
Speaker 1: It's one DVD one.

590
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:39,280
Speaker 0: You could probably get it real cheap.

591
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,411
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm gonna look up and see how much it is right now.

592
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,080
Speaker 1: at least put it in your Netflix.

593
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:47,220
Speaker 1: If nothing else there is no reason not to risk watching this anime.

594
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:53,375
Speaker 1: I almost guarantee that you will come out of it liking it And if you like it, then you might want to pick up the manga.

595
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:56,272
Speaker 0: All right I see this thing on eBay for $11 from one person.

596
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:10,380
Speaker 0: So for $15, you could probably get this new six episodes man That's like two dollars and change an episode at the most for an awesome six episodes of anime.

597
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:20,140
Speaker 0: I've said more than $11 on lunch on one disc won't take up too much room on the shelf and You really just can't not watch this show and be an anime fan at the same time.

598
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,119
Speaker 1: Yes, this show should be near and dear to anyone who went to college.

599
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:31,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially it's like if you're not if you didn't go to college or if college isn't fresh in your mind Then this show will be a great show for you.

600
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:39,359
Speaker 0: If you have been to college you were recently out of college or you're in college right now This show will be an amazing show for you.

601
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:43,840
Speaker 1: Well, I guess there's a chance it won't be but if that's the case you go to a really lame college.

602
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:48,320
Speaker 0: Yeah You should think about if your school is if you're in school or you got thinking about going to school.

603
00:44:48,725 --> 00:44:55,700
Speaker 0: Watch here is Greenwood And if that's not the experience you're having then or you that you think you're gonna have go somewhere else.
