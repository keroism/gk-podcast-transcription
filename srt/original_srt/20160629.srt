1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,649
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 29th, 2016.

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,053
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:20,418
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight The Lost Village anime that well, it's an anime.

4
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,397
Speaker 0: All right Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,959
Speaker 0: Well, it was about that time of year.

6
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:35,891
Speaker 0: so I Started doing the thing that I do every few months and I changed all my passwords and I had a few like shit accounts that I hadn't really bothered with for a while.

7
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:47,500
Speaker 0: So I basically did the password Two-factor everything refresh off everything I got, you know to be honest Like I keep bothering other people about like their passwords and you haven't changed your passwords in years.

8
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,860
Speaker 1: Have you all the ones that have two-factor?

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,598
Speaker 1: I trust the two-factor too much and I don't change the passwords that often but they are really really good password Yep, so actually what I did is I because you know what?

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,851
Speaker 0: I usually do that the best when I have it.

11
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,340
Speaker 1: also I am very good.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,269
Speaker 1: I have a different password for everything as do I there's.

13
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,940
Speaker 1: no there's no two things that have the same unless they're really stupid.

14
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,059
Speaker 1: Right, like I don't give a shit.

15
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:19,243
Speaker 0: But yeah like I let's see I have I have two or three stupid throwaway passwords that I use for like literally Garbage account on a website because I have to log in to see you sound like a post and I'll never go to it Exactly.

16
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,320
Speaker 0: Yep, or like shitto forum or whatever.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,688
Speaker 0: But the one interesting thing is that whenever I do this and you're right as much as I talk about like me too Like change your passwords all the time and all that.

18
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,080
Speaker 0: I don't change my passwords that off.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,667
Speaker 1: I should go through and change them all though.

20
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,500
Speaker 0: It was about time because there's been like the longer you wait.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Speaker 0: There's like this accretion of hashes.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Speaker 1: I want to switch to pass phrases because they're easier to remember and even more secure but some websites don't let you pass phrase.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,463
Speaker 0: So here's the problem.

24
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,106
Speaker 0: I ran into.

25
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:50,960
Speaker 0: actually I wanted to do the thing that I used to do when I was young.

26
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:55,460
Speaker 0: I stopped doing because it was a pain and I wanted to do it again.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,240
Speaker 0: And what I stopped doing was my passwords were very very long But they were and they were pretty similar to each other But they had some differences that I could figure out that no one else obviously could.

28
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:09,880
Speaker 0: So it's like a really good password and every site has a unique password.

29
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:16,980
Speaker 0: But the problem was everyone started adding password complexity rules and everyone had different bullshitty rules.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,992
Speaker 0: So like some sites are like it has to have a number in a letter.

31
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:24,462
Speaker 0: some sites are like it has to have a number And the number can't be the first or the last Character.

32
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:29,320
Speaker 0: and some sites like gotta have a special character, but other sites won't let you put in special characters.

33
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:34,900
Speaker 0: So I literally could not make a password that would match all the sites that I use.

34
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:49,067
Speaker 0: so I have a bullshitty password for a few things mostly like health insurance and all those things because those are like my Government stuff like New York State tax stuff for the old gig nights sales tax thing Because they literally like their password.

35
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:53,967
Speaker 0: rules are like it can't be less than six characters But it can't be more than eight characters.

36
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:54,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're very.

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,514
Speaker 1: the thing is nowadays.

38
00:02:55,554 --> 00:03:09,264
Speaker 1: They're actually very few Sites that have this problem right like I think like certain credit card and banks still have the stupid Requirement and almost every government site right but most wet like Twitter and all modern websites Google Passphrase work.

39
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:21,827
Speaker 1: so my recommendation for passphrases is there's a thing called dice where and basically dice where is a bunch of tables In different languages and you roll dice and that picks words and you pick some number of words And that's your passphrase.

40
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,571
Speaker 1: so for example.

41
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,638
Speaker 1: I'm at rempeh us.

42
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,720
Speaker 1: Which is the basically the dice where website yeah?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,531
Speaker 1: And I'm push the button to generate a six word dice where a passphrase.

44
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:41,026
Speaker 1: so my passphrase is Mac Alpha RT as in the letter R the letter T earl as in the earl of something Basin fort.

45
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:45,160
Speaker 1: so Mac alpha RT earl basin for you could remember that because you're only remembering six things.

46
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:59,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you type that like maybe ten times It'll be quit pretty well stuck in your brain and according to the math here It will take four millennia for modern computers to figure that one out Even without any capitals and numbers or anything.

47
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:08,269
Speaker 0: so basically what I have is a passphrase But it's salted with a bunch of different things that I'll know What those things would be for any given website or account.

48
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,340
Speaker 1: it's not even necessary if you just use the past the dice where?

49
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,353
Speaker 0: But then it's the same password for everything or you have to memorize.

50
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,866
Speaker 0: you memorize a bunch of different passphrases But there if they're completely different.

51
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:27,425
Speaker 0: I would not bother because I have like I counted because I did this I have 34 unique accounts on shit online that I care about in some fashion I think.

52
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:29,442
Speaker 1: at least though for the Google I think the past.

53
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:34,660
Speaker 0: oh no Google my Google password changes monthly and holy shit is it like one crazy-ass password?

54
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,222
Speaker 0: And I have the two-factor Google's.

55
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:39,774
Speaker 0: more important than anything like that is literally someone gets your Gmail.

56
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:40,960
Speaker 1: they got your everything yep.

57
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:44,834
Speaker 0: So I actually I bought so part of this was cool.

58
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:52,539
Speaker 0: I checked all the websites I had accounts on to see if they've added support for two-factor since the last time I checked and a lot of people have.

59
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,240
Speaker 0: so I have two-factor now on Amazon on patreon a bunch of other things.

60
00:04:58,062 --> 00:04:58,506
Speaker 0: It's notable.

61
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:01,045
Speaker 0: There's a lot of site like Newegg doesn't have it But Amazon does.

62
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,500
Speaker 1: the other problem is that a lot of the mobile devices?

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,973
Speaker 1: It just sucks to type in a fucking long password.

64
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:12,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah That is actually why I used a. my passphrase is a little more complex than what you.

65
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:16,217
Speaker 0: it's not all words It's more kind of gibberish II nonsense that I just know.

66
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:16,660
Speaker 0: it's also.

67
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,820
Speaker 1: That's another reason though that the lowercase full passphrase is good because on mobile It's a lot easier to type that because you don't have to stop and like press shift and find some weird character or something.

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Speaker 0: yep, but I also bought a YubiKey because I was checking some stuff out and Mine's like the first or second it won't work with anything.

69
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,840
Speaker 0: It doesn't work, but the new one is great because there's a new standard you to you to F or Fido.

70
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:38,566
Speaker 0: So what that means is anything.

71
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:42,860
Speaker 0: that was anything that you would normally do Google off with like that to TP stuff.

72
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,456
Speaker 0: If they support it.

73
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:54,027
Speaker 0: Then if you have a Chrome browser at least or if you use the NFC want to use it with your phone It with your phone you can use it to where your Google off Just shows you the code.

74
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,660
Speaker 0: It can't calculate the code unless you put the key next to your phone.

75
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,787
Speaker 0: It's basically three.

76
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,580
Speaker 1: So Google all the Google off app knows about the YubiKey.

77
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:05,820
Speaker 0: Yes, the Google off app will use a YubiKey Neo.

78
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:13,672
Speaker 0: So the Google off Apple run on iPhone or Android only Android only because iPhones Fucking suck and don't let you'd write any software on them.

79
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:14,214
Speaker 0: Apparently.

80
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:15,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't do the NFC.

81
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I saw like I checked it out because I found someone who had one.

82
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:19,880
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

83
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:29,300
Speaker 0: but the problem is most sites won't support the YubiKey stuff even though they do support Google off, but Google now supports it natively.

84
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,400
Speaker 0: so if you don't want to do the phone thing You can buy a cheap YubiKey.

85
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,765
Speaker 0: It's just a Fido only one and it'll work with any number of accounts and you can just use it as your second factor Instead of a phone.

86
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,959
Speaker 0: and if you set both up you can set it up to use either/or.

87
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 0: So the YubiKey could basically replace that sheet of paper with your 10 one-time codes that you encrypted and hid somewhere.

88
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,766
Speaker 1: Get to hide your YubiKey somewhere.

89
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,934
Speaker 0: My YubiKey is always on me.

90
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,018
Speaker 0: And so is my phone.

91
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,240
Speaker 0: so And even if I lose them remember it's two factor they still got to know my password.

92
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:05,960
Speaker 0: so then Independently, I was like, you know what my work finance what our companies should use this everywhere.

93
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,508
Speaker 0: So I go to go to people like everyone.

94
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,900
Speaker 0: you're fucking setting this up or I'm cutting off your access to shit.

95
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,381
Speaker 0: Good.

96
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:18,040
Speaker 0: God did certain people like really resist doing this or refused to until I told him you won't get your email anymore.

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,419
Speaker 0: Like really didn't want to do it.

98
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,435
Speaker 0: One of them had a blackberry and they were like, well the Google auth doesn't work.

99
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:28,994
Speaker 0: and I was like, I don't care There's an app on the blackberry and if there isn't buy a real phone.

100
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:34,753
Speaker 0: Oh But what was very interesting is that the old people were not resisting.

101
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,743
Speaker 0: it was the young people who were resisting younger than me.

102
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:50,598
Speaker 0: interesting then their passwords all appear to be garbage because I was paying attention when I was setting up lives forcing people to do it and I guess cuz I did IT like baby IT like long long ago like when I worked at RIT.

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,456
Speaker 0: and You sort of get this instinct to not see passwords when people type them because people suck at typing.

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,112
Speaker 0: so bad that you will know Everyone's password unless you consciously avoid it.

105
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:02,880
Speaker 0: and I'd rather not even know the past.

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, the IT guys in my work whenever you type a password they always turn around.

107
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,751
Speaker 0: Yep Like I got real good.

108
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,739
Speaker 1: I would do the same thing, too.

109
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:14,438
Speaker 0: Yeah the problem is if you were bad like you could you can know anyone's password just by watching them because people suck at this.

110
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:22,019
Speaker 0: but While I did not see what their passwords were I saw that their passwords were very short and did not involve the spacebar or the shift key.

111
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 0: So Yeah, so that's what I've been doing.

112
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,631
Speaker 0: I highly recommend if you are out there listening to Geek Nights do two-factor.

113
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 0: if nothing else do two-factor on your gmail Because that is the thing that can fuck you more than any other account that could be compromised.

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
Speaker 1: Do you want to have any like actual Wednesday shit?

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Speaker 0: Got any Wednesday news only I could only find because I think we are in fact the second longest running anime podcast in the world.

116
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,720
Speaker 0: That's great.

117
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:52,194
Speaker 0: So the only anime world order started like a month before us But we have more anime episodes than they have episodes.

118
00:08:52,516 --> 00:09:02,046
Speaker 1: the only The only Wednesday ish news that I could find is that one of our Geek night's favorite comic creators.

119
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,932
Speaker 1: Jeff Lemire has a new comic coming.

120
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,320
Speaker 0: I didn't even finish the last several descender.

121
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,885
Speaker 1: No, I just enders still coming out.

122
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,631
Speaker 0: I know I haven't even come up with them.

123
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, um drill is a killer.

124
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,370
Speaker 1: So the new comment, I mean it's only the issue.

125
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,280
Speaker 1: I'm not buying it because I'm just waiting for the trade.

126
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,844
Speaker 1: It's coming from Dark Horse.

127
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,047
Speaker 1: It's black hammer.

128
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,072
Speaker 1: So it's a superhero thing.

129
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:25,797
Speaker 0: I guess but black hammer.

130
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,740
Speaker 1: All right, and it says Once they were heroes, but that age has long since passed.

131
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,176
Speaker 1: So I guess they're washed up or heroes or something.

132
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:40,747
Speaker 0: It could be Watchmen It could be the Black Order or whatever that vanished from existence by a multiversal crisis Space bullshit.

133
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,419
Speaker 1: It sounds like some DC garbage.

134
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:46,759
Speaker 0: It's a Dark Horse comic, but it could also be some in call garbage.

135
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:53,560
Speaker 1: Right, so that's already that part that beginning part and the alternate art cover looks like old DC corny garbage.

136
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,504
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in.

137
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,996
Speaker 1: but then the description goes on.

138
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:02,673
Speaker 1: it names all the heroes Whatever now lead simple lives in a timeless farming town.

139
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,118
Speaker 0: It's the town for the anime.

140
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 0: We're reviewing today.

Speaker 1: I don't think he's ever written a comic that I did not like reading.

148
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,319
Speaker 0: I'll read the first trade if anything he does unless he starts out betraying me.

149
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, so well who knows there might be some betrayal.

150
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,400
Speaker 1: I don't even know like what it's called Black Hammer.

151
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,010
Speaker 1: It's like dude the title alone.

152
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,559
Speaker 1: I don't even need the description.

153
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:55,163
Speaker 1: Right.

154
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,840
Speaker 1: It's like mouse guard who's like home run with the black eggs.

155
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,294
Speaker 1: Yeah You can hit a lot farther home run with a black hammer than you can with the eggs.

156
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:09,629
Speaker 0: that black axe lived up to everything it should have lived up to - so in The today it looks like it was New York Comic Con.

157
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,432
Speaker 0: get your badge day.

158
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,460
Speaker 1: and did everyone have a profile set up?

159
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:13,787
Speaker 0: Apparently everyone did like.

160
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,040
Speaker 0: I trolled around a little bit on social media networks.

161
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,771
Speaker 0: There didn't seem to be that many people who were confused.

162
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,160
Speaker 1: Well people who had social media accounts weren't confused.

163
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about the normies?

164
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,602
Speaker 0: I care not.

165
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:27,374
Speaker 0: the basics do not care anymore because the reality is.

166
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:33,240
Speaker 0: there was a time when fan conventions And that's why my news is not the comic-con badge situation because everyone's flipping out.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,698
Speaker 0: I think they're already all sold out like no badges That many people made profiles to sell out.

168
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:48,220
Speaker 0: Wow there is not that much overlap between the people who go to Paxes and the people who go to New York Comic Con because no one in my social media was really complaining about this.

169
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:57,460
Speaker 0: it's like this whole other set of people and They were all making like you think like the people who complain about packs at least have been to a lot of paxes and conventions.

170
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:03,799
Speaker 0: So when they complain like while they're wrong about their solutions, they're like several steps beyond babies.

171
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,499
Speaker 0: first Why can't I get a badge?

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,660
Speaker 0: Like they at least are like what if they do a lottery like they've come up with all these crazy ideas like they know the basics of the situation.

173
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:16,811
Speaker 0: The comic-con people are like baby birds Like they're like it's the fucking scalpers.

174
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:18,017
Speaker 0: Oh my god the scouts.

175
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:23,114
Speaker 1: No, dude It's not as far as scalping for this than any convention ever with New York City.

176
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:24,920
Speaker 0: people go there for a day.

177
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,113
Speaker 0: There are like 60 million people who can get there as a day trip if they want.

178
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,200
Speaker 0: there are not 60 million badges for sale.

179
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,532
Speaker 0: But so people have you know that that all happened?

180
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:40,180
Speaker 0: it was interesting to watch that go down But my news is actually from April because it's tangentially related.

181
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:50,978
Speaker 0: So basically New York Comic Con in the old days was a free-for-all and kind of a shit show Like we went every year either as guests.

182
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,927
Speaker 1: Well the Attempted to go the first year.

183
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,934
Speaker 1: I didn't go but I walked past it.

184
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,580
Speaker 0: That was the one the fire marshal shut down.

185
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,100
Speaker 1: I wanted to see what the deal was on the first year.

186
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,216
Speaker 1: So I walked past it and saw crazy lines going out the building and no one getting in.

187
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:07,000
Speaker 1: and the second year I went for like a night after work on Friday.

188
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to see you and it was.

189
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,355
Speaker 1: that's all the time I needed but it's worth telling.

190
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:14,132
Speaker 1: and then like the third and fourth Years, I went went for a day each and that was it.

191
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:20,360
Speaker 0: I went to every Yeah, and I went to a lot of the New York comic cons.

192
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:27,300
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah There was a New York comic-con slash anime festival where I went like only for like Sunday morning to see Makoto Shinkai.

193
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,646
Speaker 0: I think that was the year I did panels But you didn't like.

194
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,975
Speaker 0: you just didn't care didn't even want to go.

195
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:36,718
Speaker 1: I got in Sunday I went in we saw a Makoto Shinkai's movie and then left and but he's got a new movie coming.

196
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,823
Speaker 1: by the way That's another news.

197
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:44,420
Speaker 1: Makoto Shinkai has a new movie and when I saw the screen capture slash poster for it I thought it was just an old Makoto Shinkai.

198
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,029
Speaker 0: I saw it in the distance on Scott's tablet.

199
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,677
Speaker 0: I was like isn't that place promised in early days or whatever?

200
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,605
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like.

201
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,259
Speaker 1: did someone did someone ripping off Makoto Shinkai?

202
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:59,188
Speaker 0: Movie it's coming but in the old days like for many many years New York comic-con was not that well attended.

203
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:08,869
Speaker 0: more importantly like if you went to the panels area No one went to panels at all and the panels were all like nothing But you could just get free badges like we.

204
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,480
Speaker 0: I've never in my life paid for a New York comic-con near to anime festival badge.

205
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:16,739
Speaker 0: Yet I went to a ton of them and we did not perform at all of them.

206
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Speaker 0: Basically, I would just go walk in not even pre-reg and look at every booth and leave now.

207
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,952
Speaker 0: But without a badge I would go up I'd go to like the reg area and I'd be like, I'm a professional I'd like to get a professional badge

208
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:28,699
Speaker 1: and

209
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:37,374
Speaker 0: I would just talk to humans until eventually they handed me this golden badge that got me in Like even before the lot like they let me in early like people would do like.

210
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,183
Speaker 0: I basically do whatever I wanted and I did This every year.

211
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:45,260
Speaker 0: I always had either a professional badge or a press badge or a guest slash presenter badge.

212
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,895
Speaker 0: The badges were different every year.

213
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:53,140
Speaker 0: So the news was for this year a lot of people on the internet and by people.

214
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:57,740
Speaker 0: These are people who have pretensions of being journalists or being in the entertainment industry.

215
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:01,600
Speaker 0: But the reality is a lot of them are smaller time than geek nights.

216
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:02,442
Speaker 1: Okay,

217
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:20,425
Speaker 0: so they were all complaining that New York comic-con wouldn't let them get professional badges because New York comic-con over the last few years Finally tightened up that ship and doesn't give a professional badge to some guy who walks in and says yeah I do a podcast on anime And oh my god are people

218
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,548
Speaker 1: freaking out about

219
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:21,969
Speaker 0: this?

220
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:28,148
Speaker 1: and What are the qualifications you need?

221
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,393
Speaker 0: so they don't tell you?

222
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,980
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell that's a problem.

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,398
Speaker 0: They'd be that you submit your resume and they approve you.

224
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:35,960
Speaker 1: Oh, that's fine.

225
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so quote, please provide a detailed description of your current daily duties as it relates to the pop culture industry.

226
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,111
Speaker 1: So did these people submit their applications?

227
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,560
Speaker 0: that appears they all did and of course they were rejected.

228
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,540
Speaker 0: Okay, what do you have to accomplish by attending New York comic-con as a professional?

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,011
Speaker 0: Please explain how you will integrate what you experience into your profession.

230
00:15:55,372 --> 00:16:02,033
Speaker 0: Please provide and this is the one that no one can answer Please provide the names titles and email addresses of three professional contacts.

231
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 0: We can contact for a professional reference.

232
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,150
Speaker 0: So and also even professional badges, they're not free anymore.

233
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:19,580
Speaker 0: you got to pay pay less and you get in even though it's full Mmm, so I was sort of watching everyone just freaking out about this and then in my social media.

234
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,000
Speaker 1: But if you're actually a professional you should be able to do that really easily.

235
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,836
Speaker 1: So there's only reason to freak out is if you're not a professional now.

236
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:33,220
Speaker 0: in the old days They had some rules that they published about like how many hits your site had to get or whatever to get those badges.

237
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:34,804
Speaker 0: But I'll tell you what.

238
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:37,613
Speaker 0: even back then geek nights qualified like one year.

239
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:47,585
Speaker 0: I literally took our Libsyn stats Printed them brought them with me because the thing said like bring three business cards bring like evidence of your websites traffic and all this stuff.

240
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:53,951
Speaker 0: and I brought it all with me and I handed to the lady and she looked at it and she Was like good because we were way above the standard.

241
00:16:54,212 --> 00:17:00,579
Speaker 0: and I read this was I don't remember what year this was But it was the year I went on Emily's birthday in the morning and then I just left because there's nothing to do.

242
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:06,540
Speaker 0: And then yeah, but is that someone's birthday soon, uh, yeah, okay October.

243
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:16,846
Speaker 0: But I remember while I was handing my paperwork over at the stall next to me was this dude And he claimed to work for some anime journalism outfit.

244
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:26,640
Speaker 0: I didn't recognize him obviously and He was basically trying to explain to the lady why he didn't have business cards and it was just make them dude.

245
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:32,289
Speaker 0: It was obvious that he had never had a business card In his entire life.

246
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,436
Speaker 1: not like you have to do something.

247
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,200
Speaker 1: they make business cards.

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,720
Speaker 1: You can print them at moo.com or even vista print for your money.

249
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,504
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so cheap.

250
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,192
Speaker 0: the lady was given.

251
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,920
Speaker 0: the look on her face was like kid.

252
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,739
Speaker 0: You couldn't even just like fake it and get a free one from staples.

253
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,982
Speaker 1: Yeah You could go to.

254
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:51,888
Speaker 1: you can go to stables and print like 10 business cards on one sheet and cut him with a scissor Like you couldn't even fake it kid.

255
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:55,020
Speaker 0: So and but he's not even saying like oh, I don't have business cards.

256
00:17:55,221 --> 00:18:00,760
Speaker 0: He was literally like telling the sob story about how like his business cards didn't arrive because of something happened.

257
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,660
Speaker 0: But he's got to cover the event for your website your professional.

258
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,568
Speaker 1: Why were you ordering business cards at the last second?

259
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,254
Speaker 1: Shouldn't you've had them because you've been in the business.

260
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:17,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't have a lot of sympathy for the people who are cut out because one if You were cut out and you can't get a professional badge You probably had no business being a professional in New York Comic Con.

261
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,231
Speaker 0: But more importantly you probably don't even need to go to New York Comic Con Because what are you going to do there except be a fan like the new?

262
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:35,092
Speaker 0: the journalists cover the shit out of this car but anyway things of the day.

263
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:39,999
Speaker 0: so This is something, you know black right like the color black.

264
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,908
Speaker 0: Yes, well, this is darker than black.

265
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,874
Speaker 1: Oh that that new material.

266
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:46,756
Speaker 0: That's a black.

267
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:47,398
Speaker 1: I saw that.

268
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,046
Speaker 0: so That's the only 10.

269
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,840
Speaker 1: you can't even tell what shape it is because the light all absorbs into it.

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,933
Speaker 1: So yeah, you had to feel it to see what shape it is.

271
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,060
Speaker 0: So it's kind of cool.

272
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,680
Speaker 0: So this is a really good video one size show You should watch in general because if you even if you're like a short attention fish baby fish kid loud on the internet.

273
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:11,420
Speaker 0: Their videos are like a couple minutes long and they tell you they give you a lot of real science information in a hurry.

274
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:15,375
Speaker 0: But basically in this video they talk about what vantablack is.

275
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,720
Speaker 0: it's darker than black.

276
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:20,551
Speaker 0: It's way darker than that and not darker than black.

277
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:24,043
Speaker 1: It's it's just the most light absorbing material We've made.

278
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,353
Speaker 1: it absorbs like it only reflects like point.

279
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,080
Speaker 1: Oh something percent of light.

280
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,165
Speaker 1: So it's not completely black like black of space But it's it's so.

281
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:35,180
Speaker 1: it's so black that effectively a human can't see it.

282
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,200
Speaker 1: You just look at it and it looks like there's just like a hole in space and you can't.

283
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,511
Speaker 1: Cameras can't see you can't tell what shape it is.

284
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,280
Speaker 1: I mean people can see better than cameras.

285
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:47,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, well in some ways but not unless you have an ultra ultra ultra HDR camera.

286
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,859
Speaker 0: But this might you might seem like okay, whatever they can coat the insides of telescopes.

287
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:57,400
Speaker 0: You need to see this shit because when you see it It kind of breaks your brain a little bit.

288
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,660
Speaker 1: Because you can't because the light doesn't reflect it doesn't have a shape or three-dimensional shape.

289
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Speaker 1: It looks like there's just a hole in space from all sides.

290
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,960
Speaker 0: It's a two-dimensional shape as far as your brain is concerned and human brains really have never experienced that before.

291
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:18,700
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, like it's not something we've ever experienced ever until recently.

292
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,260
Speaker 1: It's like if you had a hole in it and your arm was coming out through the hole.

293
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:32,950
Speaker 1: It would look like this arm was just like dissing behind like whoa Oh Yep, some sort of trippy stoner LSD animation shit yep, but it real it's not fake it real.

294
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:42,210
Speaker 0: this video is really cool and talks about it and I only brought it up because I always make fun of that anime darker than black And I had to reference it at some point.

295
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,080
Speaker 1: how many episode how much darker than black have you seen?

296
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,197
Speaker 0: One episode.

297
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,499
Speaker 1: Yeah What happened in that episode?

298
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:58,507
Speaker 0: there was a wall on the outside of the fucking city or something and There's a bunch of proper nouns of people talking about like wow the walls there But there's all right.

299
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:02,711
Speaker 1: anyone who's actually seen darker than black Tell me how rim is doesn't remember anything about the show.

300
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:07,029
Speaker 0: and then aren't there the demon guys Who their power like they could.

301
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:14,200
Speaker 0: you can get a power like a thing will happen with a contract But then the contract makes you do something weird like all I remember is supernatural dudes fighting on a roof.

302
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:22,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, they like like you'll get the demon power, but then you have to break your finger or you get the demon power But then you have to like dump out a bunch of sand and count all the grains.

303
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:23,144
Speaker 1: Anyway,

304
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:39,159
Speaker 0: anyway that show I'm gonna continue to make fun of it because that one girl in the back and anime Boston when I referenced it a lot of People didn't even get the reference, but that one girl started laughing So hard, I feel like I feel like I hit her with the arrow of comedy if no one else.

305
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,449
Speaker 0: Anyway in the Madam Argus you got a thing today.

306
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:44,860
Speaker 1: Oh, that wasn't the black thing wasn't your news.

307
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,403
Speaker 1: It was thing a day.

308
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,167
Speaker 0: We're in things of the day.

309
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:52,596
Speaker 1: I said, okay anyway things Of the day I wasn't paying attention things No one gives a shit.

310
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:59,137
Speaker 1: so Last year the Mets were very good much better than the Mets usually are.

311
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,547
Speaker 1: this baseball We're talking about.

312
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,700
Speaker 0: you went to a World Series.

313
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,265
Speaker 1: There was a World Series in New York And it wasn't in the Bronx.

314
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,713
Speaker 0: like you were there and the Mets were there.

315
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:13,020
Speaker 1: that hasn't happened since the year 2000 when the entire World Series is played.

316
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:16,846
Speaker 1: Anyway and the met you know.

317
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:20,300
Speaker 1: so you know we didn't win, but hey we can't complain about that.

318
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,568
Speaker 1: That doesn't come very often.

319
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,101
Speaker 0: Yeah like one of my favorite things to say about the Red Wings They have.

320
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:29,077
Speaker 0: they've lost more Stanley Cup championships like final rounds than any team in the NHL.

321
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:29,418
Speaker 1: right.

322
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:32,935
Speaker 1: so anyway This year the Mets ain't bad.

323
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:39,020
Speaker 1: like usual They're not the worst, but they're like in second place, and they're you know they're losing to the first-place team.

324
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,119
Speaker 1: They lost like 11 to 4 the other day.

325
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:45,100
Speaker 1: Right this is expected.

326
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,335
Speaker 1: You're not gonna lose by a little and you know plenty of people.

327
00:22:48,676 --> 00:23:00,569
Speaker 1: you know who are Mets fans Mostly talk about how bad the Mets are but for some reason this video despite being pretty old yet Also despite how old it is still has Citi Field and not Shea Stadium in it Which makes me feel even older.

328
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,077
Speaker 0: 2010 was a long time ago.

329
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:12,619
Speaker 1: Yeah Someone made this really funny video about how bad the Mets are And I for some reason I didn't discover this video until like a week or two ago.

330
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:19,926
Speaker 0: It captures all the beauty of like a public access commercial right down to the production and like yeah It's it's pretty good.

331
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:26,536
Speaker 1: You could just apply the same formula to many other bad things And it would be equally funny, but we got it first so deal with it.

332
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:32,320
Speaker 0: Yeah In the moment the book club books gonna be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood, but there's a problem.

333
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,300
Speaker 0: So I just finished.

334
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,291
Speaker 0: Basically the entire Wheel of Time went around.

335
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,119
Speaker 1: the whole wheel went around the whole wheel.

336
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:43,703
Speaker 0: Actually I went outside the wheel whoa And you know what.

337
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:48,140
Speaker 0: it would be plausible to say that the prince of nothing happens in the same world.

338
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,659
Speaker 1: I mean look isn't it one of those ones you could say anything happens in the same world uh?

339
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:59,379
Speaker 1: It's pretty specific though like there's korai And such was there a spaceship that crashed that bad guys come out of it.

340
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:07,460
Speaker 0: Uh so it is implied that some people may have fled that planet to avoid the dark one and just went to another.

341
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,238
Speaker 1: And so the plants and nothing is the planet they went to.

342
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:11,922
Speaker 1: yeah Evil demons.

343
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,025
Speaker 1: because remember the prince of nothing.

344
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,352
Speaker 1: is there a sarcophagus in a tornado.

345
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:20,245
Speaker 0: Ah there is in the outside Outside of the Wheel of Time.

346
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:29,254
Speaker 0: that's where the dark one is and it's real similar to the outside of the Prince of Nothing And the outside fucking sucks, and you don't want it to get in.

347
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:31,300
Speaker 1: but is the dark one a sarcophagus of the tornado?

348
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:39,940
Speaker 0: yeah, but I don't think he made it into the world or maybe the sarcophagus tornado might have been in the third age anyway.

349
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:51,454
Speaker 0: The one thing you would appreciate about the end of this book is that your complaint about every fantasy book even the prince of nothing Is that the whole time there's all these references to like the old king?

350
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,159
Speaker 0: yeah like the crazy bad?

351
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,246
Speaker 1: Therian the crazy badass.

352
00:24:55,447 --> 00:25:08,193
Speaker 0: if you skip all the other books the Wheel of Time and just read the last one Every single character who is still alive is now a crazy bad leveled up to be like Arthur Hawkwing is like goddamn guys like holy shit, so Arthur Hawkwing is like a chump.

353
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:09,919
Speaker 0: compare their Hawkwing is there?

354
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,738
Speaker 1: well They blow the horn and he shows up right.

355
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,766
Speaker 0: yeah And he look he walks on me.

356
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,074
Speaker 0: a little spoiler are they blowing the horn?

357
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:14,920
Speaker 1: like every five minutes?

358
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,251
Speaker 0: He basically walks over to Matt Cawthon, and he's like son Good job.

359
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:20,199
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

360
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:27,576
Speaker 0: But it is literally everyone casting hundredth level spells going crazy bail fire.

361
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,100
Speaker 0: we got anti bail fire.

362
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,083
Speaker 1: Shit son.

363
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:36,060
Speaker 0: like everything you think every crazy bullshit ancient king thing that you think could happen it happens at one point.

364
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,209
Speaker 0: You're like why don't they just make gateways to lava.

365
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,860
Speaker 0: Yeah fucking gateways to lava all over the place.

366
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:44,126
Speaker 0: It's it's worth the payoff.

367
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:44,668
Speaker 0: Well.

368
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,450
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone else.

369
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,734
Speaker 0: you necessarily read all these books.

370
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,540
Speaker 0: the payoff of the last book?

371
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:55,916
Speaker 0: No, just tell me uh There's a lot going on every level of every crazy level that only care about certain parts.

372
00:25:55,997 --> 00:26:02,925
Speaker 0: all right The second most powerful wizard in the world, maybe the third most powerful on the girls side Picks up.

373
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:04,692
Speaker 0: she basically when chaos strikes.

374
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:06,620
Speaker 0: you know that storeroom where there's all the like angry.

375
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,013
Speaker 0: Oh that no one will touch in the basement.

376
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:10,789
Speaker 0: She just goes down there And she's like what's the fucking strongest one we've got?

377
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,160
Speaker 0: and she pulls out Vora's rod.

378
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:18,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, or his rod is like almost as powerful as Kalindor, and she's like fuck I don't know.

379
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,187
Speaker 1: two statues with the balls.

380
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:22,660
Speaker 0: no Kalindor is the sword that's not a sword all right that showed in Chi.

381
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,770
Speaker 0: I think that's what it is.

382
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,550
Speaker 0: is the two statues It's not that powerful ran destroyed those.

383
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:27,832
Speaker 0: he was like.

384
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,900
Speaker 0: you know what those things we and play God.

385
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,690
Speaker 0: Let's just not use those.

386
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:31,074
Speaker 0: good job.

387
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,571
Speaker 0: I feel like there's a better way to handle that but I digress.

388
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:34,732
Speaker 1: I would.

389
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,519
Speaker 1: I mean I'm sad that he didn't play God though.

390
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:39,972
Speaker 0: Uh actually you get a flashback and find out what happens if you play God.

391
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:40,513
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

392
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,657
Speaker 0: That's why the taint is there.

393
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:45,728
Speaker 0: all right But that's not the problem.

394
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:56,520
Speaker 0: the problem is that Just as I finish that and I'm about to start reading Oryx and Crake The new our Scott backer books like about gonna come out in like the next week or two it's that soon.

395
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,128
Speaker 0: It's like it's actually happening.

396
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,474
Speaker 1: It's not a joke it appears to be.

397
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:00,680
Speaker 1: actually have not a tease.

398
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:08,920
Speaker 0: So we might delay Oryx and Crake and have to do a show on the new Prince of Nothing book It's got are gonna read it pretty much like I gotta reread some old friends of nothing verse.

399
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:12,694
Speaker 0: I gotta reread at least parts of the white luck warrior because not a hundred.

400
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:19,019
Speaker 1: I forgot how to take the shortest path I'm taking like a slightly less suboptimal path here like how am I gonna get across the step?

401
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,679
Speaker 0: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

402
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,395
Speaker 0: Regarding the fetus that was the key to that door.

403
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,660
Speaker 0: and what's behind that door?

404
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,439
Speaker 1: I don't remember a single word that is written on the tusk other than the fact that it's written on the time.

405
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:38,679
Speaker 0: Also something weird happened in the other book with the korai where memora like looked at it And then she like went through it in her brain.

406
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:42,328
Speaker 1: I do remember This fucking dragon and that's always.

407
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,916
Speaker 1: the good part of any fantasy novel is when the dragon shows up.

408
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:55,935
Speaker 0: that dragon is Actually one of my favorite characters in the entire story because the conversation that dragon has where they came in is like son Welcome to earth.

409
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,618
Speaker 1: So I am the last one.

410
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:04,787
Speaker 0: So anyway, we did watch some.

411
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,013
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, we're gonna be a kinetic on.

412
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:13,314
Speaker 0: uh fucking next weekend Here, I'm gonna pull up our panel schedule because I made the entire panel schedule.

413
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:14,960
Speaker 0: I'm gonna log into the group take system.

414
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,086
Speaker 1: I still gotta make the staff schedule.

415
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:20,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do and no one sent me their whatever their schedule they want.

416
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,120
Speaker 1: So I'm just putting I guess they don't care.

417
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,780
Speaker 0: I mean all you have to do because I did all the other work in the department.

418
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:31,792
Speaker 0: All you have to do is make sure everyone in our department who deserves a hotel room has one Has a schedule someone else taking care of the hotel stone.

419
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're responsible for it.

420
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,089
Speaker 0: You think you're some emails about that?

421
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:37,200
Speaker 1: I'll just ask them and be like, hey what happened with the hotel?

422
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:44,508
Speaker 0: Just make sure that happens because I ain't if if some bullshit goes down people even with you if a guest just like where's My panel room they come to me.

423
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,460
Speaker 0: if a guest is like, where's my hotel?

424
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,644
Speaker 0: I guess they're gonna come to me too.

425
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:52,599
Speaker 0: So we have split the duties of who goes who goes on to over this shit.

426
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:56,232
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna link to the actual panel schedule.

427
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:56,794
Speaker 0: It's live.

428
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,520
Speaker 0: It's not on the real kinetic on site.

429
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:00,637
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna even get into why that is.

430
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,939
Speaker 0: It's on a different side.

431
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,312
Speaker 0: And also if you dislike the fonts on the thing, I'm linking to.

432
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,340
Speaker 0: by all means complain to kinetic on about it.

433
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,050
Speaker 0: We didn't do it, please complain to kinetic on about that font.

434
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:14,495
Speaker 0: it is it's a font.

435
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:15,136
Speaker 0: it's.

436
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,360
Speaker 0: I've been looking at fonts a lot.

437
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,327
Speaker 0: It's not Helvetica.

438
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,638
Speaker 0: It's a font.

439
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:23,860
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I did find a really good font to use for printing.

440
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:27,195
Speaker 0: You know like packs is the banner that has like the panel schedule on each room.

441
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:31,560
Speaker 0: I Was trying to figure out what fonts to use for that because it's actually kind of a complex problem.

442
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:34,348
Speaker 1: There's a new feature in the newest Photoshop typekit.

443
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 1: No, cuz if you use typekit, yeah, but typekit isn't isn't a new feature?

444
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,860
Speaker 1: No, but like using type you search for a font and you get it, whatever.

445
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,319
Speaker 1: So the new feature is that you'll see you have a photo and in the photo, there's some letters.

446
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can select the letters.

447
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,638
Speaker 1: Oh shit Photoshop will tell you what the fuck fun it is.

448
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:53,472
Speaker 0: Oh shit I'm gonna find for everything.

449
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:57,726
Speaker 1: It'll also search Typekit and find a similar fun.

450
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,775
Speaker 0: Oh, I did not know about that feature.

451
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:00,780
Speaker 1: That's a brand new feature.

452
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,100
Speaker 1: Yes, this is why you pay for Photoshop you anti subscription morons.

453
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, even without that you pay for Adobe, right?

454
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:09,088
Speaker 0: So I needed a font.

455
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,757
Speaker 0: I did cuz monospace fonts are just garbage.

456
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,871
Speaker 0: I need it But I did I wanted except the ones for program.

457
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,559
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but there's on a poster.

458
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,060
Speaker 1: You know, why the fuck would you use a monospace on a poster?

459
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:31,720
Speaker 0: however for a schedule poster what you want is a font that has a narrow width and a thick width and You want the numbers to not be monospace or the letters do not be monospace to a real kerning.

460
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:37,540
Speaker 0: But you want the numbers to be monospace so you can use them to have a nice lined up schedule.

461
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,472
Speaker 1: You know just use a monospace font for the numbers.

462
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:40,680
Speaker 1: You don't use the same font for both.

463
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I tried that.

464
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,333
Speaker 0: but I was looking around.

465
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:47,139
Speaker 0: monospace fonts All kind of look like shit and most of them have really bad zeros.

466
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:48,959
Speaker 1: Well, cuz the zeros usually have it.

467
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,320
Speaker 1: That's why a lot of them have a lot of variations like, you know dot no dot slash no slash.

468
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:58,782
Speaker 1: Yep, because they know you might be programming and you need to see the zeros are different from the O's but you might not be Programming.

469
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:01,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I digress the schedule is pretty good.

470
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:04,020
Speaker 0: There are a lot of pretty good-looking panels.

471
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,875
Speaker 1: Well, cuz the con ends at 9 so you're able to cut out all the shitty panels.

472
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,720
Speaker 1: Sorry shitty panels.

473
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:16,059
Speaker 0: Yep I also had to cut out a lot of good panels because we probably had double the submissions we've ever had Despite the fact that we have like 30% fewer spaces to put them.

474
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:22,140
Speaker 0: So I rejected like a lot of good stuff alongside the really bad good put on the waitlist.

475
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,246
Speaker 1: Okay, someone bails.

476
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:24,835
Speaker 0: we're doing like four or five panels.

477
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:33,170
Speaker 0: We can't do a lot because Well, two of them are anime openers from around the world good and more Anime openers from around the world.

478
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,959
Speaker 1: and you said you rejected a good panel for that.

479
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,309
Speaker 0: That's actually really popular.

480
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,420
Speaker 0: Whatever people like really like that stuff.

481
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,808
Speaker 0: Also the panel I would have put in instead would be like Charles Dunbar's anime opener panels but he is not attending this year because I was.

482
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,969
Speaker 0: I unfortunately cannot give hotel rooms or Real accommodation to professionals like.

483
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,073
Speaker 0: I can't get people shit.

484
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:53,940
Speaker 0: the most I can get you is a badge.

485
00:31:54,381 --> 00:32:00,480
Speaker 0: So anyone that the other guest departments won't bring I can't bring them because I can't give them money or anything.

486
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,089
Speaker 0: That's a shame, but that's not my mandate.

487
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,293
Speaker 0: I don't want a bigger mandate.

488
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:05,256
Speaker 0: kinetic guns coming.

489
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:06,240
Speaker 0: We're doing those.

490
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:10,675
Speaker 0: We're doing writing game rules, which is a variant on a panel that we did before that.

491
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,900
Speaker 0: We're probably gonna do at PAX Prime.

492
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:16,097
Speaker 0: I think I'm putting in an overwatch panel that if Scott doesn't want to do it.

493
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:16,619
Speaker 0: I'll just do it.

494
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,360
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about other than oh, it's an FPS Blizzard made.

495
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,000
Speaker 1: It's like Team Fortress, but more skills want to be on the panel anyway.

496
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,529
Speaker 1: Everyone I know plays it constantly and I don't.

497
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,338
Speaker 0: so you'll be on the panel you be the hater or at least the.

498
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,382
Speaker 1: I've already Said everything.

499
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:30,952
Speaker 0: I have to say you should be playing this game Scott.

500
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't play netrunner.

501
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,705
Speaker 0: Uh This is way better than netrunner.

502
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:40,426
Speaker 0: I doubt that Scott remember how we felt when we played tribes like remember that era That's somehow.

503
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:41,070
Speaker 1: why do I know?

504
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:41,755
Speaker 1: it's not tribes.

505
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:42,238
Speaker 1: There's no way.

506
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:42,904
Speaker 0: no It's not.

507
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,220
Speaker 1: tribes doesn't even have vehicles.

508
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,869
Speaker 0: But remember the feel of like you come home and you just log into tribes and all your friends are already playing tribes and you Join a gameplay tribes.

509
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:52,179
Speaker 0: I get that every night.

Speaker 0: Oh good 13 messages of people who want to play right now.

00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:14,053
Speaker 0: But yeah, Connecticut will be there.

00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,720
Speaker 0: pecs prime will be there.

518
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,789
Speaker 0: I hope we'll have panels, but I can't say yes We will until we get the confirmation.

519
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:26,339
Speaker 0: I would never assume pecs dev I'll be there if nothing else because I'm just going as an attendee if I even if I don't have panel.

520
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:31,438
Speaker 0: That's all the better.

531
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,525
Speaker 0: You've seen those dogs, right?

532
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:05,047
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I kind of want to make a t-shirt.

534
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 1: doesn't someone own that photo?

535
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,498
Speaker 0: No, I want to make a t-shirt that is inspired by that those dogs and us in some fashion.

536
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,755
Speaker 0: A stylized photo stylized design, I don't know.

537
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,399
Speaker 0: I'm coming up with it.

538
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:20,059
Speaker 0: But I'm doing chicken surprise first because goddamn do I want that chicken surprise shirt?

539
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:33,400
Speaker 0: So when we did our panel at anime Boston our annual panel judge anime by its cover one of the anime we judged By its cover was the lost village and we said, oh this looks like it has an interesting concept.

540
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:38,856
Speaker 1: It looks like it's sort of got one of those like scenario situations like nine doors nine.

541
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:40,020
Speaker 0: Whatever is nine something?

542
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,446
Speaker 1: You know the things that they saw

543
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,310
Speaker 0: doors nine dogs

544
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:59,345
Speaker 1: a lot of Japanese and Asian You know in all mediums books movies, you know, especially, you know I think the oldest one I remember is like battle royale where you get a bunch of varied characters and they get somehow get stuck Separated from society in an

545
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:01,250
Speaker 0: oddly specific predicament

546
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:09,739
Speaker 1: right in a in a scenario with a bunch of rules and Or mysteries and is something supernatural or something sinister.

547
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,746
Speaker 0: now This is a common trope outside of anime Like there's a bunch of like.

548
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:14,660
Speaker 0: if you go to Netflix just go through random movies.

549
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:19,740
Speaker 0: There's a lot of like American movies that you don't even remember that are this exact same thing.

550
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just in anime.

551
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:25,120
Speaker 0: There seems to be an acceleration of these over the last five or six years.

552
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,890
Speaker 1: Also, you know video games visual novel type thing.

553
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, just nine nine.

554
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,440
Speaker 0: Whatever's is the one I always think of.

555
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:36,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the sequel to that but virtues last reward, but when we reviewed it We also said it kind of had a bokurano vibe.

556
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:41,017
Speaker 0: We weren't sure if it would be like this because bokurano is basically one of those ones.

557
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:41,700
Speaker 1: only good, right?

558
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know these kids they're not completely separated from society in that one.

559
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,040
Speaker 1: It's actually that's what make bokurano cool is that they sort of aren't separated from society.

560
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:55,438
Speaker 1: I like they go to like the military like yeah, like they go to the cops right away Yeah, well right away ish.

561
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,677
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically they go as right away as you could like you can understand why someone would but it's still.

562
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:10,680
Speaker 1: it's silly group Of varied characters that get into a predicament with a lot of specific rules Governing the scenario that they have to navigate and horrors and supernatural and you know, so sinister.

563
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,090
Speaker 0: They got to watch the whole thing.

564
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,420
Speaker 0: I've seen the first five episodes.

565
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,718
Speaker 0: I watched up to what I would only go in to describe no real spoilers as The the giant stuffed kappa with a real human face also in it like it's a half.

566
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:28,156
Speaker 0: It's half penguin half face, but like photo of a real person not even like drawn.

567
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,240
Speaker 1: Yeah the supernatural thing.

568
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,188
Speaker 1: but uh You don't need to watch anymore.

569
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:33,510
Speaker 0: You're good.

570
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was gonna ask you should I finish it?

571
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,635
Speaker 1: I'll tell you everything you need to know if you tell me more time.

572
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,646
Speaker 0: Here's the thing from the first.

573
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,790
Speaker 0: this is another situation.

574
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,060
Speaker 0: this happens to us kind of often where the first episode of a show Makes it look like it's gonna be real good.

575
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:52,475
Speaker 1: So the first episode of this show makes it look like about 80% good, right?

576
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,906
Speaker 1: It sets you up in the scenario.

577
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:58,340
Speaker 1: These people are found on the internet about this hidden village.

578
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,860
Speaker 1: They're on a bus that they rented and like a tour group to go find it on an adventure.

579
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,800
Speaker 0: The bus is weird and they're sinister undertones, right?

580
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,433
Speaker 1: They all want to escape their lives for some reasons.

581
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:09,700
Speaker 1: You got to learn about each character.

582
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:15,911
Speaker 1: The only thing about the first episode which holds true for the rest of the show Is that you know, you have a bunch of varied characters.

583
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,116
Speaker 0: I always say a bunch.

584
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,160
Speaker 0: It's not like a normal anime.

585
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,323
Speaker 0: It's not like 9 or 10.

586
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,888
Speaker 1: It's like 30 20 or 30.

587
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,352
Speaker 1: There are 30 people.

588
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,020
Speaker 0: There's a lot plus all the new characters.

589
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:34,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but do you know the trope of these shows is like introduce all the characters give the Backstories and then the writing always seems to come down to well.

590
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,400
Speaker 0: these five are together.

591
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,860
Speaker 0: So let's consult our sheet of their personalities and have them interact in a superficial way like those characters would interact.

592
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:52,937
Speaker 0: This show takes that to such an extreme that after the first episode I actually thought that this show is gonna be like what Nodeshiko was to.

593
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:57,620
Speaker 0: robot shows Gonna be like this is taking the piss out of the genre.

594
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:04,880
Speaker 0: But as I started watching more I worry that that is an unintentional side effect of the really bad writing.

595
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:12,815
Speaker 1: Yeah so the characters a lot of the characters are really really shallow and One-dimensional and really caricatures.

596
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:13,800
Speaker 1: almost yeah.

597
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:22,004
Speaker 1: Like, you know some of them get episodes that like explain their backstory and sort of give a reason for they're so dumb Like the surly guy.

598
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:33,140
Speaker 0: his backstory is I was doing an IT project and something went wrong Vaguely and I got chewed out by my bosses because of it and therefore why I want to run away from society.

599
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:38,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's why you think I have this personality of being angry at everything like you think we're joking.

600
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:39,680
Speaker 0: That is literally it.

601
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:44,391
Speaker 1: Yeah It's a really shallow and not you know complex or interesting.

602
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,399
Speaker 1: and what makes it worse is that even though they show?

603
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:58,326
Speaker 1: Some of the characters pasts and the reasons for the way they are They the way they act is really exaggerated and hyperbolic Which is okay in some senses.

604
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,720
Speaker 0: cuz like one of them love piano love piano love love pond love pond.

605
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,270
Speaker 1: Her backstory is like, you know, pretty serious.

606
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,394
Speaker 1: Did you see her backstory?

607
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:06,318
Speaker 1: No.

608
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:06,900
Speaker 1: All right, whatever.

609
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:13,880
Speaker 1: So her backstory is pretty serious and explains why the way she is, but basically all she does is be like execute people.

610
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:15,547
Speaker 0: He committed a crime.

611
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:21,440
Speaker 1: we should execute that guy and she's literally like hysterically screams Execute him execute him execute him constantly.

612
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:27,727
Speaker 0: I know at least the show follows through on that because like in the third episode She does fucking try to murder someone.

613
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:31,198
Speaker 1: right but it's like just a basically a nut.

614
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:37,540
Speaker 0: She's just like Frantic not and only one who I don't think is a nut is lion.

615
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:42,620
Speaker 1: Anyway, and the other thing is that she they don't develop right further.

616
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,480
Speaker 1: It's like we learn love ponds backstory.

617
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,127
Speaker 0: They're all dead they're all dead.

618
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:58,040
Speaker 1: this is the afterlife no, but we see that she's fucked up now But then she doesn't change after that really very much at all only very slightly The only characters that have any development are like the few main ones.

619
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,328
Speaker 0: Yeah And you know what the main ones suck right.

620
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:08,903
Speaker 1: the main ones because that's the thing that happens in so many stories especially anime is the more main the character is the more Genero they are.

621
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:13,256
Speaker 1: because I there's some idea that writers have that the main character needs to be more relatable.

622
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:15,806
Speaker 0: the best example of this Ever is new to what I do.

623
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:24,100
Speaker 0: No, no, it's a bunch of great characters everywhere And then the main character is literally this vague masked dude with no history.

624
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:34,999
Speaker 1: I think Fullmetal Alchemist is my favorite example because you have all these awesome characters like Hughes and Mustang and shit and Meanwhile, the main characters are like the twins are like the most boring.

625
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,311
Speaker 0: It's like they have some personality they have some.

626
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:38,572
Speaker 1: they're not.

627
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:38,853
Speaker 1: they're not.

628
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:40,239
Speaker 0: nothings right but it's like no.

629
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:45,070
Speaker 0: It's just like you pretend you're that guy But it's like, you know, I wish that the.

630
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:47,139
Speaker 1: they weren't even in it and it was about the.

631
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,459
Speaker 1: you know The other awesome, but like main kid number one.

632
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:54,476
Speaker 0: So again, if you watch just the first episode the show looks like it's gonna be so great cuz it.

633
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:56,042
Speaker 1: it looks like it's gonna Be okay.

634
00:40:56,062 --> 00:41:08,920
Speaker 0: Well, it looks like it's gonna be great in this like nadeshko as deconstructive like the character intros Like it's almost like a parody because literally the bus driver is kind of crazy and like everything's weird.

635
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,592
Speaker 1: The bus driver is actually the most normal person sinister, but he has issues too obviously.

636
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,900
Speaker 0: Not the bus driver the like the sugar bleeder?

637
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:18,394
Speaker 0: Oh, no, he's not but all the characters are like super into it.

638
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,840
Speaker 1: He's like he's like a Mormon type.

639
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:29,946
Speaker 0: They one by one introduced themselves and tell you their backstory or at least tell you something about themselves and that scene goes on for like 10 minutes as Pretty much the whole first episode.

640
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:34,320
Speaker 0: and that was great because some of the characters had like all this anime nonsense.

641
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:38,959
Speaker 0: Some of them were obviously crazy like the one kids like I'm Jack and wouldn't talk anymore.

642
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:42,572
Speaker 1: But and then there's the other Jack who's dressed like a pirate or something.

643
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:43,595
Speaker 0: Jack and Jack.

644
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:49,062
Speaker 0: the characters keep confusing this but actually it's Jack and Judgeness.

645
00:41:49,645 --> 00:42:01,606
Speaker 0: and just saying those words in Japanese they sound similar But it's Jack and Judgeness and these two characters keep fighting about how they have the same name and his bullshit like oh my god You stole my OC.

646
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:05,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, the characters are just so Stereotypical that the first episode.

647
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:09,396
Speaker 0: I really believe that this show was taking that concept of.

648
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,690
Speaker 0: we've got nine characters the mysterious Backstories and just saying fuck it.

649
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,288
Speaker 0: We got I don't know 30 and One of them's like literally just got guns.

650
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:19,376
Speaker 0: One of them is like literally a demon.

651
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:20,540
Speaker 0: Let's just fucking go nuts.

652
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,167
Speaker 0: I thought that's what the show was gonna be.

653
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:28,665
Speaker 0: Mmm the fact that the show is actually just badly written and trying to do this They do find a mysterious village.

654
00:42:28,685 --> 00:42:34,614
Speaker 1: That's Mysterious right because it's empty but it's not like it.

655
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:35,760
Speaker 1: nothing's destroyed.

656
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,365
Speaker 1: it's just like it looks like the people have recently departed and left everything there and It's like what's going on here?

657
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:52,076
Speaker 1: And then as they stay there and sort of try to start a new life, you know of Solitude one by one characters scream and freak out for no reason at nothing.

658
00:42:52,116 --> 00:43:08,040
Speaker 1: people disappear People, you know discover weird things people go off into the woods and shit happens, but it's also dumb which again I. but it alternates as you would expect between Characters sitting around discussing things like a lot in a very Death Note kind of way.

659
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:13,480
Speaker 1: Oh, imagine if L was a bunch of characters like oh is that person up isn't up to no good?

660
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:14,680
Speaker 1: No, that person's up to no good.

661
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:19,360
Speaker 1: Oh that but that person went into the woods and did and that person wants to leave and that person does again.

662
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,542
Speaker 0: why?

663
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:20,837
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be a parody.

664
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:34,280
Speaker 0: because And then stuff happens and then they talk again and it's like The stuff that happens was like really dumb and they were all overreacting pretty much every time up until Overact about everything but to the argue like the discussions.

665
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,226
Speaker 1: Why don't you tell us you must be no good?

666
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:45,319
Speaker 0: the discussions they had were so dumb and fake Like our group of friends playing mafia sounds more together than these kids.

667
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:46,288
Speaker 1: Yes It was like.

668
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:52,526
Speaker 0: it's like a bad game Like at one point I can't start singing a song and there's someone else is like That's not the lyrics aren't the lyrics?

669
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:52,787
Speaker 0: this?

670
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:59,712
Speaker 0: and then some other kids like I thought the lyrics were this and that's what they have This discussion about that just as seriously as well.

671
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:01,076
Speaker 0: So-and-so was murdered.

672
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,100
Speaker 0: So who could have done it?

673
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,688
Speaker 0: Well, so-and-so was somewhere else.

674
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:04,312
Speaker 1: you were like.

675
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,740
Speaker 1: you were the last person to see them.

676
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,423
Speaker 1: What happened?

677
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:09,740
Speaker 1: and we're gonna torture you and make you tell us the best one is the paper-rock-scissors.

678
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:13,140
Speaker 0: They start arguing for like five minutes about how paper-rock-scissors works.

679
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:23,034
Speaker 0: Yeah so all those things led me to believe that this is a parody and if it is if at least from the first couple episodes if This is a parody of that kind of show.

680
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:29,076
Speaker 0: No, it's brilliant No, but as you have just informed me one appears it was released on April Fool's Day.

681
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,400
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.

682
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,444
Speaker 0: That's when it started airing.

683
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,680
Speaker 1: So even better, but I mean baby metals album came out in April first.

684
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:46,054
Speaker 0: But if this show is actually seriously going to try to for real This show is terrible and I'm not gonna watch anymore.

685
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,240
Speaker 1: you don't need to watch anymore.

686
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,029
Speaker 1: So they do resolve and explain everything.

687
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:50,611
Speaker 0: is it dumb?

688
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:56,992
Speaker 1: It's a supernatural explanation as a guest But it doesn't.

689
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:57,758
Speaker 1: there's no.

690
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:05,205
Speaker 1: like Climax or like satisfying resolution is just sort of like it goes out with like a whimper like yeah Here's the only question I have.

691
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:07,473
Speaker 0: is lion the only smart one?

692
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:09,380
Speaker 1: lions barely a character like a side.

693
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I think lions the smartest one because lion seem personality seems to be sitting there.

694
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:24,640
Speaker 1: Yeah lion and then like that that there's like a group of line and like two or three strong girl strong girl lion Strong girl and like two other people there's you know, they're still around I think in the last episode.

695
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,446
Speaker 1: They're on screen for like all right Does the guy they're like?

696
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:29,248
Speaker 1: they're like the least.

697
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,374
Speaker 1: there's some they're amongst the least crazy people.

698
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:34,168
Speaker 0: does the rapey guy from the first episode who disappears die?

699
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:37,263
Speaker 1: rapey guy is He's still missing.

700
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:38,809
Speaker 0: when I stopped why I know he is.

701
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:42,040
Speaker 1: he is only half as rapey as you think and he is not dead.

702
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,764
Speaker 1: Okay But and he only comes back in like one episode Fat guy has to die.

703
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:48,997
Speaker 0: cuz fat guy literally just eats food all the time and bitches about food.

704
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:49,860
Speaker 1: lazy fat guy.

705
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, he basically all he's just lazy fat guy to the end.

706
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:52,912
Speaker 1: That's it.

707
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,700
Speaker 1: There's nothing else going on with him.

708
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,303
Speaker 1: He's just sort of like.

709
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:56,068
Speaker 1: they're like up.

710
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:56,309
Speaker 1: Yep.

711
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,100
Speaker 1: He's a background character.

712
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:02,838
Speaker 1: There's something to be said for the same thing with like the two people who are all like super in love same deal.

713
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:05,068
Speaker 0: Wow Those two reminded they're like.

714
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:06,775
Speaker 1: they're like nothing throwaway characters.

715
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:07,840
Speaker 1: They were like in the show.

716
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,931
Speaker 0: They were like shit-tier versions of the two characters from.

717
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:16,839
Speaker 1: it would have been something if they gave every character a full Episode to explain their backstory the way they gave some of the characters.

718
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:19,324
Speaker 1: But it's like love.

719
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:29,986
Speaker 1: fun isn't any more of an important character than any of them fat guy or in love people or anything but for some reason they gave her an old episode to explain her shit and Some of the other characters.

720
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:30,367
Speaker 1: they didn't.

721
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:33,660
Speaker 1: but she has maybe even less impact on the story than they do.

722
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,385
Speaker 0: It's just like just from the first episode.

723
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,088
Speaker 0: like I guess.

724
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:43,019
Speaker 0: my advice to all of you as anime fans watch the first episode Because like watch it don't watch any more of the show.

725
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,140
Speaker 0: Pretend it was a parody of these kinds of shows and you'll get a lot out of it.

726
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,851
Speaker 0: I think man, maybe the first episode is really good.

727
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,898
Speaker 0: It's kind of like Kazunoyo Jimbo.

728
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:53,680
Speaker 0: You watch the first episode.

729
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:55,859
Speaker 1: This isn't like the worst anime ever.

730
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,820
Speaker 1: It's just not really worth your time even for 13 episodes unless you're really hard up for some anime.

731
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:01,550
Speaker 1: It's.

732
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,180
Speaker 0: maybe you can make.

733
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,993
Speaker 1: At least it's not perverted or you know, it doesn't have any of those kinds of problems.

734
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:15,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's I guess it's animated Normally, what if you just cut out every scene where either nothing happens or a character says their catchphrase?

735
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,813
Speaker 0: How long would the show be?

736
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:18,988
Speaker 1: Maybe 25% shorter than it is.

737
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:22,471
Speaker 0: So that means a lot of like.

738
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:31,240
Speaker 0: alright in the fourth episode I'll just spoil it and one like they're like they have this stupid plan they like split up because some of them gonna go back to the bus and I don't know why they think that's gonna work.

739
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,308
Speaker 0: is The bus like fell off a cliff and like isn't?

740
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:36,560
Speaker 1: for some reason the bus keeps working and never runs out of gas or anything.

741
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:44,325
Speaker 1: It never runs out of gas and never fill it But it just keeps running whenever they need it like whenever the bus keeps doing stuff But it's in.

742
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:45,811
Speaker 1: it's in the show straight to the end the.

743
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:54,900
Speaker 0: but then like they're half the group is like fuck this We're out which when they split into two groups It was obviously like smart kids on that team dumb kids on the stay behind team.

744
00:47:55,582 --> 00:48:00,060
Speaker 0: But the smart kids start numbering the trees like walking away and that's the kind of thing that happens in this kind of show.

745
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:02,119
Speaker 0: So they're numbering the trees on the map.

746
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,865
Speaker 1: They get to tree like 91 and then they get to tree eight.

747
00:48:03,885 --> 00:48:04,025
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

748
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:11,999
Speaker 0: So They got back to the campsite pretty quick.

749
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:20,274
Speaker 0: So it couldn't have been that Someone tricked them by putting an eight there way out on the map, but the map match the.

750
00:48:20,756 --> 00:48:22,320
Speaker 0: so was it just a supernatural thing?

751
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,283
Speaker 0: Because it didn't make sense.

752
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:28,440
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I mean I'd have to explain the whole show which I don't mind doing but people get mad.

753
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,048
Speaker 1: So whatever and I want to go home.

754
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even care.

755
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:35,716
Speaker 0: actually It's interesting like some dumb shows like I'll watch the end cuz I gotta know.

756
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:43,570
Speaker 0: but like Part of the reason I kept going was like I really wanted to know and it was taking me longer to figure out But I don't want to know.

757
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:44,700
Speaker 1: read 15 books badly.

758
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:51,383
Speaker 0: It took me like like I read a bunch of Wikipedia pages to spoil the wheel of time and it was so hard to piece It all together from that.

759
00:48:51,403 --> 00:48:52,968
Speaker 0: It was literally faster to read the books.

760
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:58,726
Speaker 0: But with this show I just Watch the first episode.

761
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,559
Speaker 0: I really think you should watch the first episode to at least see what I mean.

762
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,958
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't need to watch that just watch Boker on.

763
00:49:03,998 --> 00:49:13,377
Speaker 0: Oh instead the first episode was interest like the fact that all the characters were like their screen names and Every one of them was like a different kind of that guy from the internet.

764
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,099
Speaker 0: and Yeah, whatever the show has got bad and I'm not gonna watch any more of it.

765
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:21,886
Speaker 0: We said the show was gonna be good.

766
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

767
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:23,411
Speaker 1: it was.

768
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:25,820
Speaker 1: it was better than most the other shows out there.

769
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel like of the shows.

770
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:36,224
Speaker 1: we said we're going to be like it's like a C. This was the big plus maybe C - so far of every show we had in your mood Pre-reviewed.

771
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:39,880
Speaker 0: this has been the biggest gap between what we expected and what we got.

772
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,706
Speaker 1: I didn't say I never.

773
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:42,560
Speaker 1: I never said it was gonna be like so good.

774
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,760
Speaker 0: I said I have potential which we said had a lot of potential but it fell so far short of that potential.

775
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:50,854
Speaker 1: I mean it fell short of expectations, but only slightly.

776
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:53,508
Speaker 1: Yeah Expectation wasn't that high.

777
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:54,799
Speaker 1: my expectation was B and it got a C.

778
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, but C gets you already into like Armageddon territory.

779
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:04,100
Speaker 0: So It's better than harm again, actually, I think harm again might be like a B minus.

780
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:10,051
Speaker 0: I'm again might be more entertaining in certain scenario Like this gets less entertaining every minute that it goes on.

781
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:12,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't come to the show for entertainment value.

782
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,483
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get that.

783
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:15,028
Speaker 0: Yeah now I've now.

784
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:20,749
Speaker 0: I started scrolling through reviews and the people who say it's great Clearly haven't seen a lot of anime.

785
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:30,451
Speaker 0: and the people who say it's bad or no Sorry, the people who say it's great either haven't seen a lot of anime or they're basically saying it's a shitty B Movie that goes on forever.

786
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:34,832
Speaker 0: if you like shitty B movies You'll love the shit out of it does have that kind of feel like and you'll enjoy it.

787
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:38,179
Speaker 0: if you're literally in it to see How bad the script is written?

788
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,553
Speaker 1: Yeah which it has that kind of feel for sure like I've enjoyed things on that level before.

789
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:44,881
Speaker 0: so I can see that a poorly paced B Movie.

790
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:51,880
Speaker 0: the people who say it's bad seem to be split between people who say they don't get it And there's nothing not to get if you don't get it.

791
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,745
Speaker 1: It's a isn't a show.

792
00:50:53,308 --> 00:50:58,614
Speaker 1: it spells it all out for you and near the end They just tell you everything literally and the anime news network forums.

793
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:03,311
Speaker 0: like in the episode 5 I found a thread where like the giant Kappa gets revealed.

794
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:04,094
Speaker 1: It's not a Kappa.

795
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:05,900
Speaker 1: It's a half penguin half person.

796
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,531
Speaker 0: But it's got the bald-headed Kappa looking thing on it.

797
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:09,314
Speaker 1: It's nice.

798
00:51:09,354 --> 00:51:09,876
Speaker 1: No capper.

799
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:10,639
Speaker 0: So it's a penguin.

800
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,608
Speaker 1: It's half stuffed penguin half person.

801
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:15,300
Speaker 0: because at first I thought it was a penguin, but then I saw the bald head thing.

802
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,359
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, I guess it's just bald and a Japanese guy with like a thin mustache coming in.

803
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever like a photo of him.

804
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:25,640
Speaker 0: But like in the fourth episode they go into the train track tunnel and I'm like alright tunnels a big deal.

805
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:28,674
Speaker 0: But then the kid the one girl the guys that got the flashlight.

806
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,066
Speaker 0: He's like, oh my god There's some crazy shit.

807
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,339
Speaker 0: and then they all scream and run away without saying what it is.

808
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:38,076
Speaker 0: But then when they get back to camp, they're like it was a giant like main character.

809
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,733
Speaker 0: Yeah the that's not.

810
00:51:40,773 --> 00:51:43,903
Speaker 0: that is literally The second.

811
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:47,713
Speaker 0: to last thing I would have expected them to have seen screamed and run away from.

812
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,719
Speaker 0: on my list was number one train.

813
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,509
Speaker 0: Number two ghost train.

814
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,277
Speaker 1: ghost train would have made the show great.

815
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:58,107
Speaker 0: Yeah Number three the bear monster.

816
00:51:58,127 --> 00:51:58,890
Speaker 1: that would have been great.

817
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,879
Speaker 0: to number four like mirrors of all the other kids.

818
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:11,985
Speaker 0: But at near the bottom of the list was things like actual Freddy Krueger black dynamite Evangelion but black dynamite.

819
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, like literally it's Hideaki Anno.

820
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:19,740
Speaker 0: like he is a character in the show now But right at the bottom that's blue blazes.

821
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:28,013
Speaker 0: You should watch that right at the very bottom down there is a bigger version of one of the characters four meters tall.

822
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:30,364
Speaker 0: give or take Whatever.

823
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:31,553
Speaker 0: don't watch this show.

824
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:32,279
Speaker 0: Just watch the free stuff.

00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:09,599
Speaker 1: It's actually recorded at night.

834

00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,323
Speaker 0: It's like pulling teeth to get Scott to do the Q&A episodes.

836
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:22,090
Speaker 0: We were gonna record the Q&A for the previous month now But we had to edit the show at the normal time instead of going late Partly because one of our bunnies is a little sick and we got to do some medicine and take care of him.

837
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:23,770
Speaker 0: So that that's the reason for the delay.

838
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:31,510
Speaker 0: But what I'm gonna do for the June Q&A Partly because I just want to see this happen once is I'm gonna open it up to all the patrons.

Speaker 0: Generally, you've got to be at that tier to answer ask questions normally.

843
00:54:51,355 --> 00:55:09,224
Speaker 0: but that's sort of a Throwout to all the people who give us a dollar because honestly I'd rather see a world where all our listeners give us a dollar and Nobody gives us more than a dollar because that would actually be a lot of money and we could do stuff with it Otherwise, the only other update is that the money has not been spent on anything yet.

844
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:10,590
Speaker 0: I haven't even taken it from patreon.

845
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:18,985
Speaker 0: it's just sitting there waiting for its project and The potential projects are coming and doing a big show at PAX Australia.

846
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:34,010
Speaker 0: I'm talking to some people about that Potentially buying a significant amount of further equipment to start really cranking out videos or Straight up starting a small gaming convention in downstate New York like for real a two-day convention.

847
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:39,088
Speaker 0: The way it would work would be pretty much to start it was Saturday and Sunday.

848
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,950
Speaker 0: only Saturday would be sort of an open gaming thing.

849
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,170
