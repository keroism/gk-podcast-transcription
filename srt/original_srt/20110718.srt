00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,763
Speaker 1: It's Monday July 18th 2011.

2
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,671
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:18,100
Speaker 1: facial recognition technology and the federated cloud.

4
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,357
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:31,600
Speaker 1: So now that I've given notice I can actually talk about this among people other than close friends.

6
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,498
Speaker 1: But I got a new job.

7
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:35,309
Speaker 0: You know when I was.

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:43,570
Speaker 0: I think I've said this before many times but it's like when I was a kid I used to look at like old people who had jobs and kept changing them all the Time to be like what's wrong with those people?

9
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,177
Speaker 0: Why can't they just keep their job?

10
00:00:45,217 --> 00:00:45,840
Speaker 0: What's wrong with them?

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,944
Speaker 1: But now I never.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,189
Speaker 1: I never thought that as a kid.

13
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,212
Speaker 0: I thought that now that I'm like, you know, whatever It's like I've changed jobs bunch.

14
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:54,940
Speaker 1: I mean as a kid I was the opposite.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,099
Speaker 1: I thought man, how could you do the same thing for more than like a year?

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,293
Speaker 0: And now it's just like yeah Get bored of pretty much any job after a few years.

17
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:07,240
Speaker 1: RIT just ruined me that quarter system.

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,312
Speaker 1: I got so in tune to ten weeks something new plus the two-week break that It's kind of hard to get back into working.

19
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,353
Speaker 1: one thing for more than a year Let alone is just.

20
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:26,465
Speaker 0: you know You need a change of scenery and it's like it could be at the same job But usually the same job doesn't change or move quickly enough Depends.

21
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:39,834
Speaker 1: I've had rapidly changing jobs But in this case, I've actually worked where I'm working where I was working as of today when I gave notice that Almost four years That's the longest I've ever held a job in my entire life by far.

22
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:40,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll be.

23
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:41,820
Speaker 0: I think I'm almost three years.

24
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:42,938
Speaker 0: I'm be approaching a Nexus.

25
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:46,424
Speaker 0: soon Sandworm will appear.

26
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:50,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see what happens that the alliances are made or broken.

27
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:58,500
Speaker 1: my Anyway, my Nexus came and went and I am now the vice president of product management for a different company.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how many people are in this company?

29
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,543
Speaker 0: Um enough I'll talk about it.

30
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,491
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, but me it's a small company.

31
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:04,972
Speaker 0: So it's not like.

32
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,943
Speaker 0: it's not like your vice president of IBM It's like your vice.

33
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of vice president.

34
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:12,640
Speaker 0: This is like, you know one room full of people your vice president.

35
00:02:12,902 --> 00:02:14,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but there's other vice presidents.

36
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:19,357
Speaker 1: Uh, I actually don't know who the other ones are if there are any and how many presidents are there one?

37
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,427
Speaker 0: So there's only one person the whole company above you.

38
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:24,876
Speaker 1: Uh, well, I report directly to the CEO.

39
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,644
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Yeah, but you know how many people are underneath the CEO like 20?

40
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:31,920
Speaker 1: Well, I'll talk about that more once it's all get situated.

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,858
Speaker 1: But basically this is this is pretty much the biggest job I've ever had and it's it's one of those things.

42
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:40,260
Speaker 0: every job That that's new is the biggest job you ever had.

43
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,055
Speaker 1: When I worked at the hospital that was far less of a big job than IBM.

44
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:46,480
Speaker 0: really you went you downgraded.

45
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:49,675
Speaker 1: No, just it wasn't wasn't it more money's it was more money.

46
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,800
Speaker 0: Well, then it's a bigger job.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,300
Speaker 0: Nah, cuz money isn't really what drives me, but I didn't say it was a drive you just it's bigger.

48
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,066
Speaker 1: Well, I wouldn't say that's bigger.

49
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,270
Speaker 1: I could have made more money.

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,879
Speaker 1: I had a job offers at other places hospitals and things.

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,279
Speaker 1: I could Have made boatloads more money.

52
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,538
Speaker 1: This job just looks more fun.

53
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:10,160
Speaker 0: Well, I mean if you're making enough money, you're obviously gonna go to the fun place making more money than I need.

54
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:17,580
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'm uh, I got a big career change and pretty much it's all on me.

55
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,758
Speaker 1: So if I cock anything up, there's nobody blame with me.

56
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:29,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not if you're a vice president It's not like there's the usual troubles of like bureaucracy and shit getting in the way for the company is small.

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,857
Speaker 1: Yeah if something even if it's big if you're if you're like your senior enough VP you can get stuff done.

58
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:38,734
Speaker 1: the VP of like the Technology group at IBM could pretty much get what she wanted and get what she needed.

59
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,320
Speaker 0: It's like in Robocop, right?

60
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 0: There's all the V. You know, there's one VPS in charge of the Robo tech project and there's the other guys in charge of the other robot thing.

61
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,509
Speaker 1: Alright you watched a Robocop again recently.

62
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:49,934
Speaker 0: all the Robocop.

63
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,400
Speaker 1: Emily hasn't seen Robocop.

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,585
Speaker 1: We got to pick a night to watch it.

65
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:53,851
Speaker 0: I'm not watching again.

66
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:54,635
Speaker 0: It's good.

67
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,660
Speaker 1: We'll just watch it.

68
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,084
Speaker 1: You don't have to watch it.

69
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,192
Speaker 0: nerd note Robocop written by Frank Miller.

70
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:08,307
Speaker 0: Yes that Frank Miller as in Sparta and What's it called Verhoeven.

71
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,499
Speaker 0: no goddamn Batman no.

72
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:12,676
Speaker 1: Anyway.

73
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,334
Speaker 1: So, uh, there's kind of.

74
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:20,860
Speaker 1: it's not big news But it's news that Scott and I saw independently and had a lot to say about right away.

75
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:22,684
Speaker 1: This is yours.

76
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,391
Speaker 0: Oh my why are you introducing my news?

77
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:24,973
Speaker 0: You're confusing me.

78
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,460
Speaker 0: I thought you were stealing my news for a second.

79
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,971
Speaker 0: I was like you stealing my news.

80
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,897
Speaker 0: No, I let Scott have it.

81
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:30,340
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:53,513
Speaker 0: So so if you don't know When Obama was elected president for the first time ever he appointed a federal CIO Which is a chief information officer, which is not the same thing as a CTO but sort of and basically his job Was not clearly defined so much but you know His name was Vivek Kundra, by the way, and he had to oversee.

83
00:04:53,533 --> 00:05:01,360
Speaker 0: I think it was 80 billion Dollars in like federal spending on technology stuffs, right?

84
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:05,180
Speaker 0: So he is leaving his job in mid-mid August.

85
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:11,378
Speaker 0: So now that he's leaving much like rim he's got stuff to say about the job he's leaving as people do.

86
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:16,934
Speaker 0: yeah So pretty much the two things, you know, the two big things that he had to say.

87
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:21,480
Speaker 0: one was that you know He's all for like data openness, right?

88
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Speaker 0: You know, we all want government data to be open but there's concerns obviously about security like real security.

89
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,072
Speaker 0: Not you know, not the issue of stuff is confidential for no reason.

90
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:35,493
Speaker 0: but you know issues like, you know The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

91
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:36,740
Speaker 0: should we release this data?

92
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,440
Speaker 0: Hmm and they actually discussed it, you know for serious and it's like this is difficult.

93
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:46,277
Speaker 1: Well as opposed, you know just joking about it and then like right you're gone.

94
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:46,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

95
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,569
Speaker 0: And then you know, there's also issues of.

96
00:05:49,609 --> 00:06:02,251
Speaker 0: you know, the government knows combining databases especially if you combine the federal databases with say public information on Facebook and such that That's you know, not so good for privacy.

97
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:04,460
Speaker 0: and well, I don't believe in privacy.

98
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:15,258
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say I don't believe in privacy, but I do not agree that there's any real ethical argument You can make against taking publicly available information and aggregating it.

99
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:20,460
Speaker 0: Right, but the question is should you even make don't make the data publicly available in the first place?

100
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:26,060
Speaker 0: And then the question is, you know, this information is not publicly available, but it is government available.

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,830
Speaker 0: So if the government takes the publicly available information and combines it with the secret government information That is not public right now.

102
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:44,197
Speaker 0: Suddenly the government has now added Information that you know, perhaps under other circumstances it would have needed to warrant Ah, but at the same time that information was also available to average citizens.

103
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:46,402
Speaker 0: No wasn't Cuz?

104
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:58,820
Speaker 0: no because half of the information was you know government information that is in government databases Publicly available, but at the same time that information if they already have it they already have it, right?

105
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,940
Speaker 1: But they even if they already have it They're often evidential evidential rules about whether or not is admissible to pay in order.

106
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,951
Speaker 0: But anyway his you know That was one of his concerns was the opening of data and those.

107
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:18,726
Speaker 0: we could do a show on that maybe I know but anyway His other main concern which is I think more interesting right is the is pretty much the the airplane the air The airport food situation.

108
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,575
Speaker 1: I was gonna use the airport food situation as the example.

109
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:22,939
Speaker 0: that is story everyone tells.

110
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:23,180
Speaker 0: I forget.

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
Speaker 0: I wish I would have remembered where I first heard that story because I keep reusing that metaphor.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,766
Speaker 0: But basically people don't know.

113
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,140
Speaker 0: you ever go to an airport and there's restaurants in the airport, right?

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,615
Speaker 0: But how come the restaurants in the airport aren't like McDonald's or TGI Fridays?

115
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,804
Speaker 1: They're always like weird things You've never heard of.

116
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,212
Speaker 1: they're like Sbarro.

117
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:40,554
Speaker 1: Yes.

118
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,680
Speaker 0: I've never seen this borrows.

119
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:46,514
Speaker 0: The Charlotte Airport is actually also a mall much like in Boston.

120
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:51,360
Speaker 0: the Heinz Convention Center is also a mall But the mall is actually sort of separated from the airport.

121
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,880
Speaker 0: It's not in the airport, right?

122
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,565
Speaker 0: But they're like the same building kinda.

123
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:59,280
Speaker 0: so it's like you can leave go through security go into the mall come back go through security.

124
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:03,080
Speaker 0: And you know, this is a mall food court out there, but most airports are on their own.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,051
Speaker 0: So if you go to O'Hare in Chicago, right what restaurants are in there?

126
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,436
Speaker 0: It's not normal restaurants.

127
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:08,560
Speaker 0: You've heard of it's weird ones.

128
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,808
Speaker 0: So, how do those weird restaurants end up in there?

129
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,900
Speaker 0: Why aren't there normal restaurants people have heard of in there?

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,806
Speaker 0: Why isn't there a Capitol Grill in the airport, right?

131
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,508
Speaker 0: It's instead.

132
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:19,900
Speaker 0: it's like New York strip something that you never heard of.

133
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:20,508
Speaker 0: It's made up.

134
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,360
Speaker 0: It's only in that Airport.

135
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,700
Speaker 0: the reason is the companies that know how to manage the bureaucracy of the TSA.

136
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,940
Speaker 0: and You know the other, you know federal agencies involved in airports to get their restaurant in there are the ones that get in there.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
Speaker 0: It's not based on food quality or anything like that.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,884
Speaker 1: It's just if you're.

139
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:43,120
Speaker 1: the primary skill is I'm good at navigating the bureaucracy.

140
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:51,540
Speaker 0: So whatever restaurants whatever food service company knows how to do that paperwork is the food is the food service company That's gonna get those restaurants and make that money.

141
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,320
Speaker 0: So he's other major complaint besides the data openness was that in technology in the federal government?

142
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,369
Speaker 0: It's much the same way right is that?

143
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:08,180
Speaker 0: you know, they put out to you know Technology for the federal government and there's only a few people who know how to put in bids and deal with that bullshit.

144
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,567
Speaker 0: So these and they're not very good.

145
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:15,480
Speaker 0: They're really shitty tech companies, but they basically have permanent, you know employed.

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,860
Speaker 0: They're basically permanently employed by the federal government because they're the only people who know how to do this.

147
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:24,039
Speaker 1: I mean think of it how easy it would be for this to happen one a lot of people in the government don't know.

148
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:24,946
Speaker 1: like Really?

149
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,139
Speaker 1: What's up technology wise?

150
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:30,916
Speaker 1: To a limited number of bids come in because all the count like IBM doesn't know how to navigate this.

151
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,504
Speaker 1: maybe just to make up An example.

152
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, or at least the IBM is probably the ones.

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like other big tech companies are not.

154
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:37,932
Speaker 1: I mean Microsoft.

155
00:09:37,972 --> 00:09:40,140
Speaker 1: probably by default people have to use Windows for stuff.

156
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:51,180
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean if you need a guy to like set up routers or like pull cables or something You how many companies that do that are gonna apply to these bids to get those jobs?

157
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:59,414
Speaker 0: yeah, the other problem that he you know, the related problem is that the You know, there isn't like a technology committee in Congress or anything like that.

158
00:09:59,474 --> 00:09:59,654
Speaker 0: right.

159
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:04,088
Speaker 0: technology is done very Vertically inside of each little division.

160
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,776
Speaker 0: So the government, you know has what is.

161
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:07,900
Speaker 0: there's a number here.

162
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:19,640
Speaker 0: It's like tons and tons of separate data centers and racks because basically every little government division has its own Technology budget and spending that it decides how to spend its technology and what to buy.

163
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,800
Speaker 0: So everyone has their own different systems, you know.

164
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,865
Speaker 0: It's like where the.

165
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:32,613
Speaker 0: you know, the NOAA has a website and then you know the the F the FTC has a website and FBI has a website and they're all separate.

166
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:33,195
Speaker 0: part of the.

167
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 0: you know budgets for the individual.

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:43,700
Speaker 1: You know federal and no individual department whatever of their own volition give up their power over that tiny domain Even though economy of scale would save the government millions, right?

169
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,100
Speaker 0: So he says look the whole government could have three data centers.

170
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:53,157
Speaker 0: Right, probably because you want to have East Coast West Coast and middle and also safety of redundancy.

171
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:54,160
Speaker 1: real data centers.

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,384
Speaker 1: Have the concept of cages.

173
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,571
Speaker 1: so you have one data center economy of scale.

174
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:03,033
Speaker 1: and then one department say it has a cage I'm steel physical cage around.

175
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:04,117
Speaker 1: it's like 10 rats.

176
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,590
Speaker 0: But what he's saying is that there should be standardization, right?

177
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,192
Speaker 0: So there should.

178
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:13,712
Speaker 0: someone needs to spend the technology money Horizontally across departments and not within each department.

179
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,715
Speaker 0: So there should be one group.

180
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 0: That's the technology group.

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,160
Speaker 0: That's like we're gonna make everyone's website and we're all gonna make all the websites the same way for every federal thing.

182
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,888
Speaker 0: There isn't gonna be separate websites and separate service.

183
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:27,820
Speaker 0: everyone are making the federal website system period for everybody, right?

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,724
Speaker 0: And you're all gonna go into.

185
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:29,748
Speaker 0: it's gonna be standard thing.

186
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,399
Speaker 1: that way when low sec hacks it they'll get everything.

187
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,927
Speaker 0: But be that way technology.

188
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,035
Speaker 0: people will be in charge of it and low sec won't get in.

189
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:41,982
Speaker 1: the thing is will they really be if That's the?

190
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:54,698
Speaker 0: if they get the other component of real technology companies with quality technology You know how to make bids as opposed to those people who got hacked by low sec making the bids right then You know the technology would be good.

191
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:59,060
Speaker 1: The process is just bad for getting government work and I don't know what to do.

192
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,763
Speaker 0: And it's also.

193
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:07,719
Speaker 0: it's also even if you could get a bid in it's potentially corrupt Right, like I might be able to put in a low bid and have better technology than the other bidders.

194
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:12,985
Speaker 0: But if the guy who's deciding doesn't know who I am The other guy.

195
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:21,400
Speaker 1: there are places in government where there's no corruption No, where there are laws saying that if you owe take bids, you must take the lowest bid.

196
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how does that lead to pros and cons?

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,440
Speaker 0: You can't because some guy just puts in a dollar and he shows up with a power book.

198
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:30,180
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

199
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,320
Speaker 1: The problem with laws like that is that the lowest bidder is often not exactly who you want to be handling your important data.

200
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:51,280
Speaker 0: Right, but the point is I feel like if I could just find someone or do research and you figure out how to submit this paperwork I could probably do better technology and a lot of these other pretty much everyone else.

201
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got to get a bunch of people to work for you and actually do it.

202
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,273
Speaker 1: art I mean you want to move down to DC and like pull cables.

203
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:58,991
Speaker 0: Yes the other problems You got to go to DC and do it.

204
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:03,200
Speaker 0: You can't do it in New York But maybe I could do it for New York State or the city, right?

205
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,101
Speaker 0: Like I could send in bids to new if it or how to get New York City tech contracts or New York State tech All right.

206
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,046
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

207
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Speaker 1: This is much like people who become businessmen I have a certain acumen and they're good at or want to do.

208
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:18,279
Speaker 1: or whatever reason do you want to turn your life into?

209
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,272
Speaker 1: Filing paperwork that you hate to people you don't care about.

210
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,200
Speaker 0: No, I get someone else to do the paperworks.

211
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:26,300
Speaker 0: Just I just want to get paid with tax money.

212
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,851
Speaker 1: Everybody who is good at technology has the same idea you do.

213
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:31,116
Speaker 1: who are you going to find?

214
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:32,100
Speaker 1: who will do that paperwork?

215
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,349
Speaker 0: There has to be someone who knows how to do it.

216
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:47,020
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll just go to the companies that are doing it now Find the guy who's doing it now and just say hey Come work in this cool tech company in New York instead of for this permanently employed black crappy boring.

217
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,964
Speaker 0: So you're gonna do that in DC.

218
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:48,949
Speaker 1: You're gonna do that.

219
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,300
Speaker 0: I gotta find who the person is gonna start this company.

220
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,747
Speaker 1: Is this something you're planning to do?

221
00:13:52,867 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaker 0: If I know just if I ever meet one of these people, I'll know I Don't know what to do about it.

222
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,775
Speaker 1: I feel like as much as I could be cynical and complain and say yeah Well, even if they standardized it, it'll still be a corrupt morass.

223
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:07,820
Speaker 0: I think there is an easy way.

224
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,700
Speaker 1: It would be better than the current system.

225
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,034
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's the one thing that needs to change.

226
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:15,434
Speaker 0: right is that you know The government the basically the wing government wants to spend money.

227
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:16,500
Speaker 0: It puts out a call.

228
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,252
Speaker 0: It's like who wants to do this and people say I'll do it.

229
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:19,553
Speaker 0: I'll do it.

230
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,020
Speaker 0: I'll do it and they pick someone right?

231
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,335
Speaker 0: Why doesn't the government instead go shopping right?

232
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:27,472
Speaker 0: It should go out and say Hey Google, can you do this?

233
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:29,805
Speaker 0: Hey Microsoft can you do this?

234
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:33,719
Speaker 0: So as some government contracts do go that way do they cuz I?

235
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,522
Speaker 0: yeah But how does that?

236
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:44,420
Speaker 0: how does the thing is I see while that could work better if the person doing the shopping is doing It well, like they're going at Amazon and picking the thing with the five stars like I do or going to Newegg

237
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:47,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause I was on a new egg or where the government's gonna get its stuff

238
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,771
Speaker 0: I'm just saying or is that person who's going shopping just going?

239
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,855
Speaker 0: hey best friend.

240
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,477
Speaker 0: You want to do this?

241
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,099
Speaker 0: Okay?

242
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,253
Speaker 0: Corruption whatever Happens it happens all the time, but at least sometimes people do actually get fucked for that.

243
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:01,517
Speaker 0: the governor connected went to jail.

244
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:07,442
Speaker 0: Yeah Of course, he went to easy jail for like a year and he's out now and now he's making money again But it's still.

245
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:09,449
Speaker 0: I think it should be permanent jail.

246
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,760
Speaker 0: I think you know fucking corruption in the government should be much more serious.

247
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,632
Speaker 1: Well, I think maybe treason to back up a little bit.

248
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,360
Speaker 0: I tried to fuck the US government jail forever.

249
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,108
Speaker 1: We want to talk about a root problem.

250
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,234
Speaker 1: I mean look we got the airport.

251
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,424
Speaker 1: It's just that there's Bureaucracy.

252
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,307
Speaker 1: navigation.

253
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:24,271
Speaker 0: you fucked with the government.

254
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:25,436
Speaker 0: you tried to ruin you.

255
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:26,420
Speaker 0: very important.

256
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,100
Speaker 1: So that determines a lot of the future for a lot of things.

257
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:32,872
Speaker 1: I mean forget look at law.

258
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:35,708
Speaker 1: look at the bureaucracy You have to go through to like.

259
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,746
Speaker 1: if you're involved in a court case like all this kind of stuff You get it a lawyer to navigate it for you.

260
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:45,818
Speaker 1: There are whole like seas of information that normal people basically Can't navigate on their own.

261
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,068
Speaker 0: Do we exile people anymore at all?

262
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,352
Speaker 1: No, we don't exile people.

263
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,460
Speaker 0: Is that cruel and unusual or do you just don't?

264
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,287
Speaker 1: Where are we gonna exile him to?

265
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,975
Speaker 1: I don't Belgium.

266
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,260
Speaker 0: That's their fucking problem.

267
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,183
Speaker 0: It's exile.

268
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:01,898
Speaker 1: Usually you're exiled to a place and Elba would get pretty crowded pretty quickly.

269
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,520
Speaker 0: Where's Elba?

270
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,380
Speaker 1: You ever heard of a guy named Napoleon Bonaparte?

271
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, what happened to him after he lost after the Napoleonic Wars and his exile to a tiny island?

272
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:12,559
Speaker 0: was it named Elba?

273
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:14,071
Speaker 1: Maybe okay?

274
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:16,645
Speaker 0: Is that?

275
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,017
Speaker 0: it's like south of Spain, right?

276
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,959
Speaker 0: Mediterranean Google, I thought it was called something else.

277
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,432
Speaker 1: Well, you realize he was exiled to two different islands.

278
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,500
Speaker 1: because when he was exiled to his first island, right?

279
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,395
Speaker 1: He eventually escaped.

280
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:37,597
Speaker 1: I know that went back to France fuck shit up again And when they beat him again, they sent him to a further away shittier island.

281
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:38,380
Speaker 0: I did not know that.

282
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,466
Speaker 0: I thought he died on that.

283
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:40,974
Speaker 0: So what was the name of the first island?

284
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:41,920
Speaker 1: You can look this up.

285
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,126
Speaker 0: I think you don't know.

286
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:48,547
Speaker 0: So if I hear it, I would know it because I So Google.

287
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:48,748
Speaker 1: right.

288
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,375
Speaker 1: usually when they do stuff I'm like hells Yeah, but it's easy to forget the things Google does.

289
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:54,380
Speaker 1: that didn't work out so well.

290
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,873
Speaker 1: I mean wave did not quite work out the way we all wanted.

291
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,117
Speaker 0: Apache Foundation has it.

292
00:16:59,137 --> 00:16:59,720
Speaker 0: You can still get it.

293
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not who's doing anything with it.

294
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:07,643
Speaker 0: I'm gonna actually try to see if I can do something with it and Just wait.

295
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,407
Speaker 1: all the stuff that it did that mattered.

296
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:09,729
Speaker 1: It'll be in.

297
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:15,628
Speaker 0: G+ Exiled him to the island of Elba Saint Helena.

298
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:19,945
Speaker 1: There is exiled the second, you know how he died on the second island.

299
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,030
Speaker 0: just disease, right?

300
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,494
Speaker 1: Uh, we don't know the.

301
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:26,369
Speaker 1: there was arsenic in the paint and all sorts of crazy stuff about that.

302
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,195
Speaker 0: He arrived could only recommend pallidus.

303
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:33,934
Speaker 0: He died two days later after after confession, but he had to confess to Christian stuff.

304
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:35,560
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I kind of kid.

305
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,386
Speaker 0: I thought he confessed like I'm sorry.

306
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,491
Speaker 1: I started I Dr.

307
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:38,713
Speaker 1: Lucky.

308
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:44,237
Speaker 1: I've got that game laying around somewhere.

309
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:45,140
Speaker 0: I have that game.

310
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:47,930
Speaker 1: I think I have one too cuz they're what like a dollar.

311
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,669
Speaker 1: so Google Has something called badges?

312
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,787
Speaker 1: badges for Google News.

313
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:56,618
Speaker 0: They news.

314
00:17:56,678 --> 00:17:57,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's the deal.

315
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:59,270
Speaker 0: new Google News.

316
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:05,596
Speaker 0: What you read I can understand Google+ badges like achievements for like posting Achievements for news.

317
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:10,260
Speaker 1: you can work your way up from Browns to silver gold platinum and finally Ultimate.

318
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,149
Speaker 0: how does this fucking work?

319
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:28,450
Speaker 1: So you read articles on Google News about topic X and you start acquiring badges in topic X eventually branding you as an Ultimate in topic X. So if I read a whole bunch of articles on Casey Anthony I'll get a badge saying that I read a whole bunch of articles on Casey Anthony.

320
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,869
Speaker 0: Why would they want to encourage you to read a bunch of articles about the same thing as opposed to?

321
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,330
Speaker 0: Encouraging you to read a bunch of articles about a bunch of different?

322
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,087
Speaker 1: Well, if you do that, you'll get a whole bunch of different badges and level them all up.

323
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:42,710
Speaker 0: Well, but that'll be low-level cuz you won't read a 20. like you'll read 20 articles about f1 you read one.

324
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,009
Speaker 1: Maybe you'll read a whole bunch, but here's the deal.

325
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,424
Speaker 1: They're private by default, but they're there and already on.

326
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,472
Speaker 1: if you have Google web history set up Let me check this.

327
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:54,489
Speaker 1: but now you it might not work for you because you with ABS don't have Google profiles.

328
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:57,721
Speaker 0: yet I don't see anything about badges on my Google News.

329
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you probably don't have it.

330
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,838
Speaker 1: Okay, we're Google Apps.

331
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:09,846
Speaker 1: we're second-class citizens, that's right, so You can choose to share the badges and make them public.

332
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:10,970
Speaker 0: All right, what's the point of this?

333
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,135
Speaker 0: I read more news than you.

334
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:19,190
Speaker 0: Oh, they don't have a stated point, but I Can you can see all my friends know what news I'm informed about?

335
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:19,571
Speaker 1: No, they do.

336
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:24,590
Speaker 1: let you hide specific badges because I'm sure a lot of people will get a lot of surprisingly pornographic badges.

337
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:31,867
Speaker 0: Hey Scott, I see you read a whole bunch of stories about My little pony the Yankees, I thought you're a Mets fan.

338
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:37,070
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I was reading how they suck kind of like how in latitude you can delete times.

339
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:42,215
Speaker 1: You can't like add but you can delete stuff from your history if you want to be like, yeah I don't want anyone to know.

340
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,299
Speaker 1: how is it scandals?

341
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,946
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna delete that.

342
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:45,810
Speaker 1: That's fine.

343
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,020
Speaker 1: My phone was off around that time.

344
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,583
Speaker 1: I don't know.

345
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,577
Speaker 1: I Don't know why Google did this.

346
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:52,982
Speaker 1: I don't know what they're trying.

347
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,010
Speaker 0: sounds like someone is just doing nothing.

348
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:58,792
Speaker 1: It might be someone's internal project that they were like, oh, that's cool Let's turn it on.

349
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,350
Speaker 1: but it seems like this is the kind of mechanism design that leads toward disaster.

350
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:08,825
Speaker 1: yeah, because it encourages people to game a system and to read just click on news article.

351
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,198
Speaker 0: pretty much really gonna go to Google News and Just gonna click on a ton of articles.

352
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:13,525
Speaker 0: How does it know if you actually read them?

353
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:14,410
Speaker 0: Just have you visited them?

354
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,253
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

355
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:23,265
Speaker 1: I didn't really dig into this that much but actually in a way Right that actually it helps Google out in one.

356
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:27,970
Speaker 0: Yeah Just click on a whole bunch of news articles to get these badges.

357
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:31,630
Speaker 1: Google's getting a lot of traffic referrals to those newspapers exactly.

358
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,839
Speaker 0: Google News is pretty great.

359
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:37,159
Speaker 1: But at the same time that's evil mechanism design.

360
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,850
Speaker 0: Google didn't really read those articles or look at the ads on those newspaper.

361
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:41,973
Speaker 1: That's evil.

362
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,340
Speaker 0: This is evil sort of evil.

363
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:45,705
Speaker 1: It is not a good thing.

364
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:55,669
Speaker 0: They're basically doing click fraud against other semi click fraud against other news Papers when they fight so hard to prevent people doing click fraud against them.

365
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,877
Speaker 0: That is if not evil hypocritical.

366
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:02,910
Speaker 1: Well, the interesting thing is if you forget those, you know arguments against it.

367
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,629
Speaker 1: there's also the problem that this is yet one more and it's Google and the internet are kind of pushing people toward.

368
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:19,090
Speaker 1: if you Want to you can basically shut out all information It doesn't agree with your worldview and focus your entire world around the things the bullshit that you believe whether or not it's true.

369
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:21,780
Speaker 0: Google do you know, here's what they could do.

370
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:22,442
Speaker 1: They do.

371
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,489
Speaker 0: instead of doing it badges like this.

372
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,830
Speaker 0: They should make a news game and then we can use game works like this.

373
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,918
Speaker 1: You've got to answer questions and prove exactly.

374
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:55,030
Speaker 0: it goes down the top news stories and it makes you read Like two or three articles about every news story from you know regular sources and also high brow sources and low brow sources of all shapes and sizes from all sorts of crazy conspiracy nuts to You know highly educated papers that are pages long, you know everything and then ask you questions and Gives you badges for answering, you know, there's some movie factual.

375
00:21:55,191 --> 00:22:02,016
Speaker 0: So you'll get your badges based on the factual questions, but also ask you other questions that are sort of you know Interpreted market research.

376
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:04,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, and use that use that data to.

377
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:12,570
Speaker 0: you know Part of the to gauge the public opinion even to compare with to compete with say Gallup poll, right?

378
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,132
Speaker 0: They could be like.

379
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:17,948
Speaker 0: Google knows that X percent of Americans think rainbow - is the best.

380
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:19,709
Speaker 0: of course We're at best pony right with that.

381
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:33,619
Speaker 1: now another way they could go with these badges is If they the Google project like the cool technology project come up with a system that will read the news from Google News internally and Automatically generate the questions and the answers.

382
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,687
Speaker 0: Well, that's definitely the kind of thing Google can do.

383
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,089
Speaker 0: Yes That's definitely within their skills.

384
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:47,810
Speaker 1: You know people have accused me a couple of times in the past of being kind of Overtly pro Google and a lot of techie people accuse people of that sort of thing all the time.

385
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,785
Speaker 1: So right here I'm pointing out Google did some evil.

386
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:51,590
Speaker 1: This is bad.

387
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:52,232
Speaker 0: It's.

388
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:57,310
Speaker 0: it's not the biggest evil night, but it's you know, they did pull out of China, but it is not good.

389
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:59,063
Speaker 1: This is it's not to look is so good.

390
00:22:59,144 --> 00:22:59,990
Speaker 0: It's not a good thing.

391
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,990
Speaker 1: They should get rid of the stupid badges or they should do what we just said, which is much better.

392
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,575
Speaker 0: Well, it's also sort of evil right.

393
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:10,670
Speaker 0: suddenly Google knows that like X percent of Mets fans are you know, who Jews?

394
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,815
Speaker 0: How is that evil too?

395
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:16,769
Speaker 1: fine to root to reveal factual aggregated information?

396
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,034
Speaker 0: because now they're just.

397
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:23,592
Speaker 0: it's evil in the same way that say Right.

398
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:30,170
Speaker 0: How would Wikipedia be if Wikipedia was for profits basically making money off the backs of people's work, right?

399
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,230
Speaker 0: You know unplayed employees.

400
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:39,736
Speaker 0: So when Google takes data generated by you who is just you know Having fun on the Internet's and uses that for profit It's evil.

401
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,170
Speaker 0: in the same way a for-profit Wikipedia would be for evil.

402
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:49,610
Speaker 1: But at the same time the amount of work you're providing is voluntary and so trivial that it's worth zero in and of itself.

403
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:59,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is why I have less of a problem with say Mechanical Turk, even though most of it is spam Because they're at least paying you one cent for your your tiny contribution to lawyer.

404
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,270
Speaker 1: they pay you with badges.

405
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,196
Speaker 0: That's not a baby.

406
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:03,543
Speaker 1: They could set it up with steam.

407
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,150
Speaker 1: You can convert the badges into hats.

408
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:06,004
Speaker 0: Well, I'll tell you what.

409
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:09,910
Speaker 0: now You know when I you want me to go and start the company that gets government contracts.

410
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,039
Speaker 0: Well, I find the person who knows how to do that paperwork.

411
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,205
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna pay him in badges.

412
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,160
Speaker 1: They all say You pay them in badges.

413
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:22,189
Speaker 0: I'll pay him in bitcoins I'll take all the tax monies from the state fill my wallet use it to buy badges and give that day.

414
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:33,920
Speaker 0: Give that to the employees because they'll feed them things of the day.

415
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:40,504
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid watch a show called mask m dot a dot s dot K And it stands for.

416
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:42,311
Speaker 1: it stands for I forget.

417
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,957
Speaker 0: actually, you know, you don't remember.

418
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,246
Speaker 1: I don't remember I never.

419
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,860
Speaker 0: actually I'm gonna be honest, right?

420
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:50,300
Speaker 0: I watched a lot of 80 shows but I guess mask wasn't on in my area.

421
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:55,020
Speaker 0: So I never actually heard of it until I was in college and you remembered it.

422
00:24:55,501 --> 00:25:01,360
Speaker 1: Well, I when I was little was obsessed with it partly because the show I I found on YouTube.

423
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,545
Speaker 1: Here's the first episode.

424
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,693
Speaker 1: I gotta watch it to see how well it holds up.

425
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:05,456
Speaker 1: Not for real.

426
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:06,560
Speaker 1: Probably not that well bad.

427
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:10,269
Speaker 1: It's animated surprisingly better than I expected slightly better.

428
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,593
Speaker 1: Like it's pretty good animation.

429
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,359
Speaker 0: This has to do with what it was later 80s, right?

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,201
Speaker 0: Not yeah.

431
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, also it was pretty.

432
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,917
Speaker 1: it was higher budget than you'd think and there were comics and everything.

433
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:32,184
Speaker 1: but Say comics and toys say what you will about the respective merits of mask and say transformers Mask toys kick the shit out of transformers in terms of playability as a kid I don't know depends on the best.

434
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,251
Speaker 1: toys were so high quality.

435
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,414
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

436
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:38,465
Speaker 0: It's the mobile armored strike command, by the way Command.

437
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,193
Speaker 1: I had almost every single toy.

438
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:41,740
Speaker 1: I had Boulder Hill and everything.

439
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:46,977
Speaker 0: I might have seen some mass toys in my youth But like I didn't know they were mass because the show was never on on my TV.

440
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:49,891
Speaker 0: But yeah So what's your thing of the day?

441
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:50,839
Speaker 0: my thing of the day?

442
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:52,907
Speaker 0: Steal it from you by accident.

443
00:25:52,928 --> 00:26:01,877
Speaker 1: We'll see when they whenever this gets taken down But it's the opening theme to mask and then the entire first season first episode.

444
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:02,920
Speaker 0: Oh, that's your thing today.

445
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:12,896
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, so you're not gonna talk about the entire mass collection on DVD pre-order on Amazon for $60 Which is in fact what prompted me to make this my thing of the day.

446
00:26:12,997 --> 00:26:19,400
Speaker 0: because you understand Transformers I bought the sent transformers season 1 DVD box set right and that was it long time ago.

447
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,520
Speaker 0: Yeah long time ago, but why didn't they just release all of transformers in one box period?

448
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,159
Speaker 0: I don't know.

449
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,264
Speaker 0: There's a lot of episodes.

450
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:31,660
Speaker 1: you want to know why they can make more money doing it this way and the Ninja Turtles is even worse.

451
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,443
Speaker 0: You saw that on.

452
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:34,269
Speaker 0: yeah, but masks.

453
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:34,951
Speaker 0: they did it right.

454
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,620
Speaker 0: all of mask beer every single episode.

455
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,372
Speaker 1: You know why they did it that one box.

456
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:44,865
Speaker 1: They did it that way because Mask is not super well known Popular.

457
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,335
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna hold up.

458
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,019
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be off.

459
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:52,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the animation is so much better than similar shows and the toys were so good.

460
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,619
Speaker 1: I kind of want the toys now anyway, so I would play with them.

461
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,752
Speaker 0: So one of our listeners tweeted this at me my thing of the day here.

462
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:00,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

463
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,728
Speaker 0: But let me tell you so I got.

464
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:07,473
Speaker 0: I bought an SSD for my real computer Because I was having some problems with the disc being real slow and really slowing me down.

465
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:09,400
Speaker 1: big solid-state drive for you kids.

466
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:19,040
Speaker 0: Yes, I bought a solid-state drive and because right I was so smart and you don't know this in Windows If you go into your user folders, you just double click on your the folder that has your name on it.

467
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,020
Speaker 0: That's on the desktop Usually and all your other folders are inside of it like my videos my music my documents, right?

468
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,906
Speaker 0: All those are folders in your user folder.

469
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:33,608
Speaker 0: if you right-click on say for example your my documents folder and go to properties There'll be a tab that says location.

470
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,900
Speaker 0: So let's say you have a one hard drive in your computer.

471
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,669
Speaker 0: Everything is on C right unless you made partitions.

472
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but partitions are so old-school because drives are so cheap.

473
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:45,207
Speaker 0: So, of course you have two or three drives, right?

474
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:57,140
Speaker 0: So now you got two drives C and D. Let's say you want to move my documents to D. You can just right-click on my documents go to location and change it to D colon backslash documents and put up and push.

475
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,860
Speaker 0: Okay, it'll move your my documents folder to the other drive, but you'll still access it from that same place.

476
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:08,515
Speaker 1: So it's transparent, I mean I did that when I first built my computer and I bought a 32 gigabyte.

477
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:21,769
Speaker 0: as you can move all Your all of those folders I moved every single one of them I did as well to another hard drive and the only thing that will be on the C drive will be Windows itself and All the programs that you install.

478
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,740
Speaker 0: so higher, you know Firefox.

479
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:33,359
Speaker 1: now what I did very easily because I built my computer from the beginning with an SSD like that is I just let the Things that are fucked up and can't deal with another drive letter B on my SSD.

480
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,940
Speaker 1: It didn't hurt anything and I just made cuz I got the e drive e drive program files.

481
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:40,719
Speaker 0: I just installed everything that you move program files to a different drive, huh?

482
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:47,060
Speaker 0: Yep, so the thing with that is program files in a different drive as well and good But it has one bend a pirate universe.

483
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,825
Speaker 0: It has one flaw in that.

484
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:58,377
Speaker 0: one of the major advantages of the SSD right is the speed increase from loading Applications when you start them off, but I do that because I only had a 32 gigabyte SSD.

485
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:01,848
Speaker 0: I bought a 128 gigabyte SSD.

486
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:05,882
Speaker 1: that would not have been worth the money when I built my computer is 200 something dollars In fact.

487
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:09,300
Speaker 0: nowadays if I was building a brand new computer, I would get two of those bitches.

488
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:12,171
Speaker 0: I'll for the combine them into a single logical drive.

489
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,038
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm building a new HTPC.

490
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,445
Speaker 0: what I'm thinking Ssd for that.

491
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:16,727
Speaker 1: No.

492
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:22,660
Speaker 1: No what I'm thinking about doing is buying 128 gigabyte SSD and putting it in my current real computer.

493
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:34,179
Speaker 0: So the 32 gig in the HTPC and no other storage cuz everything he needs from a NAS cuz it doesn't need a big hard Drive, I'm not gonna buy an SS It's just gonna get all this bit media for the NAS.

494
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,794
Speaker 1: But the 32 gig SSD is useless to me if I take it out of my current computer.

495
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:39,440
Speaker 0: So yeah, exactly.

496
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 1: So anyway, that's my plan.

497
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:47,838
Speaker 0: So, of course I have a 128 gig so I want to leave as many program files as possible on that SSD until it gets full.

498
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:50,474
Speaker 0: obviously Because that way they'll start up faster.

499
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:52,167
Speaker 0: if I start Firefox I'll just start right up.

500
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:56,370
Speaker 0: But if Firefox is on another drive Well, it's you're right but the problem is a hundred.

501
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,153
Speaker 0: even 128 gigs even 256 gigs if I were to get two of them and combine them is not enough.

502
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:08,080
Speaker 0: if you have steam with a zillion games It is not big enough to hold all back to the old days.

503
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,700
Speaker 1: I remember I'd on the top of our giant computer desk.

504
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,744
Speaker 1: There was just every game box and when I wanted to play a game, I'd be like, all right What am I gonna uninstall?

505
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:19,500
Speaker 0: I need at least a 500 gig drive to hold to install all the steam games.

506
00:30:19,702 --> 00:30:21,418
Speaker 1: Get like four SSDs.

507
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:23,986
Speaker 0: That is so much money.

508
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:24,849
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

509
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:35,091
Speaker 0: So of course the steam games I play often I would like to leave those on the C Drive on the SSD so they can start up very quickly Especially games that have problems with loading times.

510
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:37,159
Speaker 0: Fuck you gloating time games that suck right?

511
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:37,500
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

512
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,210
Speaker 1: But games they're.

513
00:30:40,311 --> 00:30:41,800
Speaker 0: they're a lot of single-player FPS.

514
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:54,400
Speaker 0: Actually, I organized all my steam games into categories and I noticed that I have a lot of single-player FPS is mostly due to the incomplete Yep, that I've been playing a bad company, which has a little bit of loading time, but not that much there.

515
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,389
Speaker 0: But anyway, but you're gonna SSD going on not for that.

516
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,070
Speaker 0: Okay, but anyway, so the thing is I do you know The steam games I play often.

517
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:11,140
Speaker 0: I want to leave on the SSD But the steam games that I might want to have installed but I play rarely but take up a lot of space I would like to move those to a different drive.

518
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,436
Speaker 1: So you want to have some games on the SSD but not all game.

519
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:17,729
Speaker 0: that is you know And that is a difficult thing to manage right.

520
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:21,383
Speaker 0: you'd have to constantly be making sim links and you might want to move games back And forth.

521
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:23,960
Speaker 0: you might be basically it's like going back to the DOS days.

522
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,337
Speaker 0: We had to delete a game to install a game, you know, it's it.

523
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,628
Speaker 0: fuck that Somebody made this amazing program.

524
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,241
Speaker 0: They actually posted it on the internet April 2nd 2010.

525
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:37,875
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's a newer version or if this even needs a newer version.

526
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:38,980
Speaker 0: It might just work.

527
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,306
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it already.

528
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:43,700
Speaker 1: can just scrape your credit card and passwords and send it in Nigerian sky.

529
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,800
Speaker 0: I have yet to test this out, but it's a program called steam mover, right?

530
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,764
Speaker 0: What steam mover does?

531
00:31:50,824 --> 00:32:02,460
Speaker 0: you open it up and it you tell it where your steam folder is and it shows you a list of all your steam games and You give it a destination which is the alternate location for steam games.

532
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,183
Speaker 0: So you tell it.

533
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:13,676
Speaker 0: basically my steam games are in C colon backslash program files back Steam backslash site maps backslash common and I would like to put some steam games.

534
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:15,280
Speaker 0: That's my SSD on the left, right?

535
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:21,839
Speaker 0: I would like to put some of the games that I don't play so often on D colon backslash steam Which is the spare steam folder?

536
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:26,374
Speaker 0: Okay, then next to every steam game in the list is a blue arrow.

537
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:27,900
Speaker 0: you click the blue arrow.

538
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,145
Speaker 0: It moves it to the other drive.

539
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:30,550
Speaker 0: you click the blue arrow again.

540
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,735
Speaker 0: It moves it back where it came from.

541
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:33,000
Speaker 0: steam doesn't know the difference.

542
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:35,695
Speaker 1: Not too shabby is it?

543
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:42,208
Speaker 0: that is Pretty amazing right there and best of all it has a built-in Sort of.

544
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:49,760
Speaker 0: show me your moves Command where you can say I want to run the commands myself and it will show you the windows command line of what it's doing.

545
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:57,599
Speaker 0: It's basically uses xcopy Rd and Make link to move and sim link things back and forth.

546
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:58,824
Speaker 1: shit You know what I realized.

547
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:04,520
Speaker 1: so you will actually realize a lot of our listeners are probably just Amazed at the fact that you can make links in Windows.

548
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:08,153
Speaker 0: I know right but man it shows you on the command line what it's doing.

549
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,538
Speaker 0: so you can actually do it yourself.

550
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:14,534
Speaker 1: you realize kids You don't like doing stuff on top of stuff in Windows the same way you do in Linux.

551
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:17,262
Speaker 0: in new windows if all your drives Are NTFS.

552
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:18,386
Speaker 0: that's the only thing in this.

553
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:21,155
Speaker 0: all of your drives involved had to be NTFS partitions.

554
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:21,918
Speaker 1: It's fine.

555
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:22,580
Speaker 0: It is fun.

556
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:26,695
Speaker 1: I no longer bother with the whole dual boot to have the one virtual box.

557
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:31,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no reason It won't work with fat32 bla bla bla bla bla.

558
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:35,338
Speaker 0: It can only relocate folders not individual files.

559
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:47,916
Speaker 0: so Steam does have some really big files in it like GCF files that are in the steam apps folder itself that aren't actually part of A games in you know folder and you can't move those, but it's like well.

560
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:52,560
Speaker 0: I mean come on right You can leave those there, it's fine, but yeah steam mover is my thing of the day.

561
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,133
Speaker 0: You should check it out.

562
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:55,863
Speaker 0: if you have the SSD That's not so big.

563
00:33:56,425 --> 00:34:11,496
Speaker 1: so in the meta moment the book club book that we just finished that will do a show on Shortly in its separate non Thursday episode stream with a new RSS feed and everything was Isaac Asimov's foundation Which we should have done the show on Thursday, but I hadn't finished it in time because I was busy.

564
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:14,629
Speaker 0: rim fail Yeah, but I just let it be on the record.

565
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:14,748
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:15,813
Speaker 1: I got stuff to say about it.

567
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,360
Speaker 0: double fail you failed twice.

568
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:18,824
Speaker 1: Quite a lot to say about it.

Speaker 0: the next show on it.

570
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,760
Speaker 1: I don't know maybe not tonight.

571

Speaker 1: I'm kind of want to cook my dinner.

572
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:25,560
Speaker 1: We could do it Wednesday.

573
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,565
Speaker 0: Maybe we're doing another show.

574
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:28,630
Speaker 0: We're doing two shows Wednesday.

575
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, or we could do it over the weekend.

Speaker 1: I'm sure we can find time.

577
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:32,994

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,659
Speaker 1: I need to do a Wednesday right after we do that show on something or other.

582
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:43,690

Speaker 1: The game katsu.

00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:03,626
Speaker 1: people came out of the woodwork and we're like hey guys shit.

590
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just so people know.

591
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,247
Speaker 0: New York comic-con a slash.

592
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:12,021
Speaker 0: New York anime festival October 13 14 15 and 16.

593
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,859
Speaker 1: Oh shit, we we should be there doing stuff, too.

594
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, that will be about a month and a half after packs.

595
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:20,378
Speaker 0: So that is that is coming up.

596
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,060
Speaker 0: Do not forget it.

597
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll hold us over until the next packs packs East we will be at doing a bunch of shit.

598
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:30,180
Speaker 0: I do not recommend doing this, but I feel it is my service to share this information.

599
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,036
Speaker 0: New York comic-con, you know, we like the conventions that have one price period right.

600
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,320
Speaker 0: so packs you buy a badge.

601
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:37,145
Speaker 0: It's a badge.

602
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:39,280
Speaker 0: Every badge is a badge end of store.

603
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:42,879
Speaker 0: You can go to anything with the badge as long as it's you know for that day, right?

604
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,640
Speaker 0: GenCon we don't like because they have individual ticketing for individual events.

605
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,787
Speaker 0: So if you want to play it you get.

606
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:52,185
Speaker 0: you buy a badge you get into GenCon and then you want to play in a game you gotta buy a ticket for that.

607
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:54,073
Speaker 1: and now there's the middle-of-the-road system.

608
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:54,996
Speaker 1: some gaming cons do.

609
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:58,090
Speaker 1: that's okay where you get Your badge and it comes with X tickets.

610
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,316
Speaker 1: That's all anyone can get.

611
00:35:59,336 --> 00:36:00,300
Speaker 0: that's that's an okay.

612
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,700
Speaker 1: So that's just to you know, allocate these scarce resources.

613
00:36:03,081 --> 00:36:09,884
Speaker 0: I don't like paying for more things once you're in the convention or having people have more or less privileges based on spending Money, right?

614
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:12,140
Speaker 0: So newer comic-con is against that philosophy.

615
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:21,893
Speaker 0: they sell fancy VIP badges for a lot of money and those badges get you swag and they let you cut lines and they let You see famous people and all that kind of bullshit.

616
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:23,000
Speaker 0: and I'm not a fan.

617
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:24,465
Speaker 0: So do not buy these.

618
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:28,059
Speaker 0: but I have to tell you they're gonna be sold out for this comic-con very soon.

619
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:33,943
Speaker 0: And also San Diego comic-con is like what very like this week Credibly soon.

620
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:34,846
Speaker 1: Oh two cons coming up.

621
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:35,649
Speaker 1: Not that we'll be there.

622
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,380
Speaker 0: But yes, let's see San Diego comic-con.

623
00:36:38,904 --> 00:36:46,385
Speaker 0: Excuse me comic-con international right is July 21 through 24 so this weekend.

00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:46,887
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

Speaker 0: and Otacon I believe is the weekend after that July 29 through 31st.

626
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,135
Speaker 0: It's convention season and the two biggest conventions east and west.

627
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:55,999
Speaker 0: We're not gonna be there.

628
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,560
Speaker 1: Yep Well, we won't be at Otacon because they don't like us anymore.

629
00:36:58,641 --> 00:37:00,075
Speaker 0: But if you are they still like you.

630
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:00,520
Speaker 0: Otacon.

631
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:04,153
Speaker 0: Yeah for your treating of us doesn't mean we don't want to come.

636
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:23,940
Speaker 0: It's like like I'm not gonna hang out with you while you beat me But if you stop beating me, I'd come back, but she does surreptitiously.

637
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,236
Speaker 1: It's like behind your back like you're like she doesn't answer your calls and then you go to bed.

638
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:28,100
Speaker 1: you wake up with the bruise.

Speaker 1: go see the actual creators.

647
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,280
Speaker 1: I mean we heard an anime next a long time ago.

648
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,970
Speaker 1: They just happen to have Rintaro.

649
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,896
Speaker 1: We're like, holy shit.

650
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:47,800
Speaker 0: It's Rintaro Yeah, and the room was like a quarter full and everyone's kind of sitting in there.

651
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,489
Speaker 1: He took questions like no one really had any questions for him.

652
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:52,215
Speaker 1: It was it was sad.

653
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:53,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really sad.

654
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:54,507
Speaker 0: He seemed kind of happy though.

655
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:55,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was like, whatever.

656
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:58,524
Speaker 0: anyway Actual show topic.

657
00:37:58,564 --> 00:37:59,387
Speaker 1: Yeah show topic.

658
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:03,440
Speaker 1: So there is a story one of those things that you know would piss rim off.

659
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,800
Speaker 1: I have a whole like feed of things that pissed me off.

660
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,394
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there you must add ten a day of just reading Fark.

661
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,203
Speaker 1: Oh my god The thing is.

662
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:11,146
Speaker 1: it also makes me happy.

663
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,480
Speaker 1: That's why I don't read Fark because much of Fark is the story of people getting what?

664
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,845
Speaker 0: They deserve that's true.

665
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,720
Speaker 1: You try to you try to rob someplace and oh you got hit in the nuts.

666
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:26,323
Speaker 1: So anyway, this guy John H gasps Again.

667
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,647
Speaker 0: his name is gasps.

668
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,173
Speaker 0: just child must have been great.

669
00:38:29,353 --> 00:38:34,912
Speaker 1: He lives in a masa who sits Okay, and he got his driver's license revoked.

670
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:37,360
Speaker 1: took him two weeks almost to get it back.

671
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:40,291
Speaker 0: Well, it was a revoked because he was driving shit.

672
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,555
Speaker 0: Lee was never had a ticket.

673
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,342
Speaker 0: Oh What the fuck.

674
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:45,027
Speaker 1: it was revoked automatically.

675
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:48,919
Speaker 1: He received a letter saying that it was revoked and it wouldn't even say why.

676
00:38:50,084 --> 00:39:03,369
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, so he not being able to drive had to go to the DMV and like regible I guess whatever they call it in masa who sits and event and you know do an inquiry and everything and eventually he found out That the reason his driver's license was revoked.

677
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:19,179
Speaker 1: Was that an anti-terrorism Facial recognition program that the state is running scanned a database of every picture of every driver's license and determined that he was likely a Fraudulent driver's license and a fake person copied from someone else's driver's license.

678
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:25,416
Speaker 0: But he's a real dude Mm-hmm, and how did he find out that his license was revoked?

679
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:26,460
Speaker 1: Oh, they sent him a letter.

680
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:32,030
Speaker 0: Okay Fake license in the database.

681
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:34,360
Speaker 0: Why would they send a letter to the fake address?

682
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,352
Speaker 1: Also, why don't they send the police to arrest the scammer?

683
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:39,194
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

684
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:40,880
Speaker 0: It makes no sense to me.

685
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:44,019
Speaker 1: So digging into this article more and more here's the gist of it.

686
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,460
Speaker 1: Governments are using this very powerful technology, which I'm gonna call a facial recognition.

687
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:51,808
Speaker 1: It does exactly what you think it does.

688
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:53,573
Speaker 1: it's it's been written.

689
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,700
Speaker 0: UK's been using it for years and years and years.

690
00:39:55,802 --> 00:40:04,772
Speaker 1: It's been around for a long time, dude My camera the camera we use to film like our geek night stuff and our radio free equestria and all that It has really good facial recognition.

691
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:10,273
Speaker 1: I programmed in everyone in the crew and It just shows me their names in the viewfinder when it sees their faces.

692
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:17,266
Speaker 1: when I'm recording when I'm playing back I can look at tags and see who is in what scene when It'll even take a picture.

693
00:40:17,386 --> 00:40:22,100
Speaker 1: anytime anyone on my smile list smiles on camera while I'm recording.

694
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:29,430
Speaker 1: you know, this stuff is already pretty consumer grade and Governments are using it for a lot of stuff Facebook Google.

695
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:30,714
Speaker 1: Everyone's gonna be using it.

696
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,898
Speaker 0: Well, they've been using.

697
00:40:31,938 --> 00:40:32,360
Speaker 0: it's not new.

698
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,440
Speaker 1: We're gonna be using it like it's getting to the tipping point of super.

699
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,850
Speaker 0: It's been an iPhoto for a version or two.

700
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's it's on every notes.

701
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,220
Speaker 1: But we're getting to the point of super cross linking.

702
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,440
Speaker 1: I mean right now Facebook still a lot of times you only show up in that embarrassing picture tag because someone tagged you in it.

703
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,002
Speaker 0: That's true.

704
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:53,297
Speaker 1: Imagine if Facebook just did facial recognition and every face you could figure out.

705
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:56,440
Speaker 0: it just auto tagged Yeah, but it would get some wrong, right?

706
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,960
Speaker 0: So and the problem is if someone tags you in a photo you can now see that photo.

707
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:02,720
Speaker 0: So what if I had a private photo of me naked?

708
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,783
Speaker 0: And then it tagged?

709
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:06,629
Speaker 0: it saw some other guy who looked like me?

710
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,940
Speaker 0: it automatically tagged because I wouldn't tag this private photo.

711
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,099
Speaker 0: What's the purpose of that right?

712
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,472
Speaker 0: I'm just using Facebook to store the photo and then it tags my face as this other guy and Then now he can see my naked photo.

713
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:19,780
Speaker 1: Well, Kenny, I don't know how it works.

714
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,583
Speaker 1: I don't have Facebook.

715
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,932
Speaker 0: that if I tag you in a photo you.

716
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:24,840
Speaker 1: but how would he know to tag you in a private photo?

717
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,865
Speaker 0: No, it automatically tags if the facial.

718
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:29,253
Speaker 1: so obviously unless they're idiots.

719
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,720
Speaker 1: It doesn't auto tag private photos.

720
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,750
Speaker 0: I'm just saying things like that are potential.

721
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:44,040
Speaker 1: but my point was that even if you've got say a Success rate that means that one out of a hundred photos is gonna be mistagged.

722
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,523
Speaker 0: That's true.

723
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:51,455
Speaker 1: And if we've got governments like Massa who sits Using this to deny people's like actual civic services.

724
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:53,463
Speaker 1: That's bullshit Mm-hmm.

725
00:41:53,704 --> 00:42:04,974
Speaker 1: So this made me think a lot about facial recognition because I realized that I am mostly way for Ubiquitous facial recognition and even ubiquitous surveillance as long as it's relatively open.

726
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,920
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's you know, that's the major thing, right?

727
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,560
Speaker 0: So the UK has had facial recognition on security cameras, you know for a long time.

728
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,549
Speaker 0: Basically, they have a huge system where they put facial.

729
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,780
Speaker 0: they put cameras all over the fucking place.

730
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,496
Speaker 0: You know more so than probably almost any country V for Vendetta style.

731
00:42:19,597 --> 00:42:21,079
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly That's what they have.

732
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:35,460
Speaker 0: So and they have a huge database of faces and what they do is if you're walking down the street and your face It's caught in a camera They got a ton of computers that are gonna look you up and especially comparing you to like the wanted felons list.

733
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:46,555
Speaker 0: So if like, you know if the FBI is most wanted walks down the lit the street in London in a camera season It sets off a light somewhere where the people are watching and they'll go pick you up.

734
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:47,358
Speaker 0: That's what they do.

735
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,187
Speaker 0: theoretically Yeah, but they actually do it.

736
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, how often does it work?

737
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,369
Speaker 1: How often do they actually respond?

738
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,556
Speaker 1: how many false positives?

739
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:55,724
Speaker 1: We don't know any of that We don't know.

740
00:42:55,744 --> 00:42:59,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they definitely have this system and you know I'm actually in favor of that kind of system.

741
00:43:00,068 --> 00:43:03,600
Speaker 0: as long as a the cameras are only in public places, right?

742
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,231
Speaker 0: So, you know you get but a camera in someone's house, let's just do right and be.

743
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:10,360
Speaker 0: you can't keep that video footage private.

744
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:10,803
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:15,936
Speaker 0: that video footage needs to be publicly accessible And there's no reason it couldn't be publicly accessible.

746
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:16,400
Speaker 0: immediately.

747
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:21,996
Speaker 0: I should be able to go and see a live view of whatever the camera outside my house is looking at

748
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:22,498
Speaker 1: or

749
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:29,480
Speaker 0: if I know There's a camera in London outside Big Ben I should be able to go online click on that camera and see what it sees in my web browser.

750
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,315
Speaker 0: Go to the entire archives and see what it saw.

751
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:37,560
Speaker 0: cuz maybe you know There's a Rodney King caught on that tape and I don't want the government destroying it.

752
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,179
Speaker 0: That needs to be a publicly accessible video.

753
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:46,060
Speaker 1: So arguments against that not not saying I agree with them would be that one makes it trivial to stalk people.

754
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:53,199
Speaker 0: If people are in public places, and I'm not physically chasing them I'm just watching them on cameras to stalk them.

755
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:57,657
Speaker 0: That's actually better cuz stalkers gonna start to start but it's not gonna stalk.

756
00:43:58,702 --> 00:43:59,708
Speaker 0: Imagine this right?

757
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:01,620
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I'm just saying imagine this.

758
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,047
Speaker 1: I'm just putting forth an idea.

759
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:11,340
Speaker 1: if we combine the ubiquitous cameras Which still require a lot of paying attention with ubiquitous and accurate facial recognition?

760
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:20,159
Speaker 1: I can auto stalk and then just have a database where eventually I'll know Pretty reliably where someone who has reasonably consistent habits will be.

761
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:32,182
Speaker 1: If you're a stalker you can know that anyway Yeah, but if you can't you might see if you if you're a stalker you have to go out and do the legwork So there's odds that someone will notice you, you know The creepy guys.

762
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:36,640
Speaker 0: the thing is I'm not saying that the facial recognition data and system has to be publicly accessible.

763
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:39,929
Speaker 0: I'm just saying oh, no I'm saying that the video footage has to be.

764
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:43,322
Speaker 1: and I'm saying that if the video footage is accessible Then they will.

765
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:49,200
Speaker 1: it will have a hundred percent facial recognition coverage because private people will have access to almost as good software.

766
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,168
Speaker 0: Maybe because the bit it'll happen.

767
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:53,213
Speaker 1: It'll definitely happen.

768
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:58,440
Speaker 1: I guarantee to you I mean already I think Picasa has a thing that'll like write tag people in your photos.

769
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,384
Speaker 0: Well, that's a photo.

770
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:00,529
Speaker 0: does yeah that a lot of them do that.

771
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,800
Speaker 0: It's mostly those are just for organization of photos.

772
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, but don't you can't tell me that within decade if not sooner people will have those capabilities for any video They have access to?

773
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:12,279
Speaker 1: I guess I mean what if YouTube did it?

774
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,980
Speaker 1: I personally would love it if I could go to YouTube and say here's a picture of me find any other YouTube videos that have.

775
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,573
Speaker 0: That'd be awesome.

776
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:24,463
Speaker 0: but at the same or you can take a picture of a person on the street with your phone and then get a list of All the YouTube videos.

777
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:25,988
Speaker 0: they're in and flicker photos.

778
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:27,874
Speaker 0: They're in and Facebook photos all aggregated.

779
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:28,737
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

780
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:29,420
Speaker 0: I should make that.

781
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, wouldn't that be awesome?

782
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:33,257
Speaker 0: if I made an app that did that I'd make so much monies.

783
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:33,780
Speaker 1: now.

784
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:41,580
Speaker 1: My take on all this is that I agree there are Pro societal problems that would come about in this future.

785
00:45:41,921 --> 00:45:47,380
Speaker 1: I also argue that this future is inevitable and we we'd better deal with it now rather than later.

786
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:48,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you know.

787
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,514
Speaker 1: I think that's something we say all with it now when it's not yet a hundred percent ubiquitous.

788
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:56,532
Speaker 0: if we figure out as a society I'm like every other problem which we fail to deal with.

789
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:58,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, we always wait until the last second.

790
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:00,469
Speaker 0: No, we wait until ten years after the last.

791
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:05,759
Speaker 1: Oh, we have an economy based almost entirely on intellectual property That is trivially stolen untraceable.

792
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,609
Speaker 1: How long have people been able to do this?

793
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:12,140
Speaker 0: 20 years good job guys.

794
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,602
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but you know, it's we've said there's a lot of times you know, is that the Right?

795
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:29,260
Speaker 0: is that the government always goes to deal with some sort of you know New situation that is being brought about by technology?

796
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:36,280
Speaker 0: well after it has been brought about even though everyone saw it coming right and The technology is inevitable, right?

797
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,312
Speaker 0: A lot of times they try to fight the technology Itself after the fact that it's already out there in the wild, huh?

798
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:42,056
Speaker 0: Then they try to.

799
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:43,100
Speaker 0: they try to just ban it.

800
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,723
Speaker 0: They're like, oh shit.

801
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,417
Speaker 0: This technology is a problem for us now that it exists.

802
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:46,960
Speaker 0: Let's ban it.

803
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,617
Speaker 0: It's like well, no, what you have to do is you have to accept the technology because you can't fight it.

804
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:52,440
Speaker 0: It's unbeatable.

805
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,020
Speaker 0: It's like trying to slay the dragon.

806
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:02,740
Speaker 1: Is there not an example in the foundation of a nation that forgot how to use nuclear power and had an accident and banned nuclear Power because it was too dangerous?

807
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:04,044
Speaker 0: Exactly.

808
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:05,231
Speaker 1: It didn't turn out so well for them.

809
00:47:05,493 --> 00:47:06,660
Speaker 0: Not at all, right?

810
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:14,320
Speaker 0: What you have to do is instead learn accept that the technology is gonna be there and instead change the things you can change.

811
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,487
Speaker 0: Remember technology is science.

812
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:18,433
Speaker 0: It's just the rules of the world.

813
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:20,480
Speaker 0: You can't fight the law of physics, right?

814
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,525
Speaker 0: We don't know how to do that yet.

815
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:22,830
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll figure that out one day.

816
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:24,156
Speaker 0: not yet, right.

817
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:27,627
Speaker 0: but Society government law politics.

818
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:32,200
Speaker 0: These are completely artificial constructs just created by humans on paper.

819
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,326
Speaker 0: They're just words on papers.

820
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,291
Speaker 0: They're not.

821
00:47:34,371 --> 00:47:36,020
Speaker 0: they're not laws of the universe.

822
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:45,100
Speaker 1: I am so amazed when people argue like strict constructionism of the US Constitution or anyone who even Bothers to debate the intention of the founding father, right?

823
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,783
Speaker 0: It's like I can't.

824
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:51,425
Speaker 1: tension of a guy a couple hundred years ago in terms of what he thought gun law should be is irrelevant To the modern world of guns.

825
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:54,940
Speaker 0: the law the laws of thermodynamics can't change him, right?

826
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,468
Speaker 0: Constitution just a piece of paper.

827
00:47:57,568 --> 00:48:02,395
Speaker 0: we can make the rules whatever we fucking want them to be Right, so we should.

828
00:48:02,415 --> 00:48:13,160
Speaker 0: you know We accept that we can't change the law of thermodynamics and instead we need to change the things we can change in our society to accept those facts.

829
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:20,640
Speaker 0: How the people who as opposed to trying to butt heads with them because then you're just asking for trouble funny.

830
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:20,842
Speaker 1: how.

831
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:39,800
Speaker 1: the people who most feel that the Constitution isn't just a piece of paper and it has some sort of mystical power and that the founding fathers were some sort of like God-emperor Kings enlightened among the masses who made everything perfect and foresaw every possible consequence of technology Are the same people who kind of don't believe in a lot of the fundamental laws of the universe?

832
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,679
Speaker 0: Funny that funny.

833
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,573
Speaker 1: but Government is impotent to deal with this.

834
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:47,459
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna pretend.

835
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,668
Speaker 0: So what's government not impotent to deal with it's.

836
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:56,324
Speaker 1: I know one thing's really good at maintaining a general Status quo for a long.

837
00:48:56,424 --> 00:48:59,434
Speaker 0: I know one thing the government is exceptionally good at wasting money.

838
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:03,949
Speaker 0: if there was a military invasion They would be really good at fending that off.

839
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,395
Speaker 1: Ah, not always though.

840
00:49:05,415 --> 00:49:08,386
Speaker 1: historically a lot of government I mean read up on the Crimean War.

841
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,651
Speaker 0: I said the US government.

842
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:14,347
Speaker 0: right now if someone tried to invade the u.s Today they have that shit down.

843
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:15,291
Speaker 0: They have that shit.

844
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,145
Speaker 0: I'm not saying about all governments over all history I'm saying us government today.

845
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,955
Speaker 0: If somebody tried to invade us 1812 style.

846
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:22,958
Speaker 0: They know what to do.

847
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,472
Speaker 0: Yep They wouldn't even had to think about it.

848
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:26,780
Speaker 0: there wouldn't even be really a debate.

849
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:28,587
Speaker 0: They would they would just go.

850
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,680
Speaker 0: but anyway, I argue there isn't anyone who could do a better job.

851
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:37,280
Speaker 1: We agree that government cannot address the problems that society is going to face with facial recognition.

852
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:39,939
Speaker 1: No, because nobody you can't ban it.

853
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:42,007
Speaker 1: Everyone will have access to it eventually.

854
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:44,316
Speaker 1: and it was bum with a track phone.

855
00:49:44,336 --> 00:49:52,360
Speaker 0: that track phone has facial And the government already has clearly shown as per your FARC article that they will clumsily try to use it clumsily.

856
00:49:52,461 --> 00:49:53,408
Speaker 1: I think it's one step further.

857
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,039
Speaker 1: That's like an akimbo ham fist.

858
00:49:55,802 --> 00:50:00,517
Speaker 1: It's like a man was genetically engineered to have two hands that are at in fact hams.

859
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:02,731
Speaker 1: Okay ham fists I amend my statement.

860
00:50:02,752 --> 00:50:07,109
Speaker 0: they will derpily Try to use the technology that they cannot control.

861
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:13,791
Speaker 1: not quite herp to derpily because herp to derpily would have meant that this Database like crashed and destroyed all the driver's licenses.

862
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,159
Speaker 0: and then they're gonna get in the guillotine.

863
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:19,880
Speaker 1: That's kind of inside baseball.

864
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:31,064
Speaker 1: I Really I was at Emily and I went to this fancy French restaurant and we're like partying during best so One.

865
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:40,576
Speaker 1: the people in the restaurant are wearing the tricolor obviously Republican possibly Jacobins and They're drunk and singing with us.

866
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:47,783
Speaker 1: and you know They like keep giving us alcohol and screaming things in French and they got us up and made us dance around and they're pulling people in The street and kisses.

867
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:50,012
Speaker 1: it wasn't even Bastille day yet.

868
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,638
Speaker 1: It was before Bastille day.

869
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:52,020
Speaker 1: This is the.

870
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,520
Speaker 1: So I really really had to resist the urge to be like Viva la wa right after the saying the Marseille.

871
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,771
Speaker 1: They might have just killed me.

872
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:07,602
Speaker 0: why would they wouldn't have killed you Scott?

873
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:08,906
Speaker 1: they are clearly Jacobins.

874
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:10,531
Speaker 1: They had the tricolor pins on them.

875
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:12,637
Speaker 0: So they're not gonna murder you.

876
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:13,340
Speaker 1: they might.

877
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,132
Speaker 1: That's what the mobs did.

878
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:24,560
Speaker 1: Yeah dishes Oh, so anyway to get back to my point Which I kind of forgot what it was.

879
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:26,488
Speaker 1: Okay, government can't deal with this shit.

880
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:29,260
Speaker 0: la wa wants to use facial recognition to detect the derps.

881
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:42,900
Speaker 1: So I think the best way to handle this is for some enterprising individual or company Maybe Google maybe Facebook though Facebook would derp it too because Facebook's getting derpier derpier and derpier.

882
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:46,716
Speaker 1: You saw these tried to ban like Google+ ads and Facebook, I don't get.

883
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:47,097
Speaker 0: I don't get.

884
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:50,352
Speaker 1: it's like yeah If we don't tell them about Google+ they won't know it exists.

885
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:51,658
Speaker 1: They won't leave.

886
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:56,492
Speaker 0: Okay You know what Facebook really needs to do if they want to fight Google.

887
00:51:56,813 --> 00:52:00,406
Speaker 0: They should just make Facebook email To fight Gmail.

888
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:01,069
Speaker 0: cuz right cuz like.

889
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,780
Speaker 0: even people who are using Facebook are also using Gmail.

890
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:12,680
Speaker 0: but if people it there but even if they're more heavily a Facebook person like they check their they check their email and Gmail and Then they go to Facebook for the rest of the day and they only go to.

891
00:52:13,805 --> 00:52:16,820
Speaker 1: So they still chat in G talk even though they're on Facebook, right?

892
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,480
Speaker 0: It's like if they just had the Facebook chat work and they also made Facebook email.

893
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:24,569
Speaker 0: They could get people completely off of Google.

894
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:25,714
Speaker 1: I don't think they would.

895
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:26,217
Speaker 1: it's too late.

896
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:26,960
Speaker 0: I know it's too late.

897
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,951
Speaker 0: they're not gonna be able to do it, but they should.

898
00:52:29,032 --> 00:52:33,527
Speaker 1: but someone either Google or Facebook or just some nerd like you said.

899
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:39,550
Speaker 1: just put it together yourself make the app or you take a picture of someone and it Finds everything about them in the world.

900
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:40,273
Speaker 1: stalker.

901
00:52:40,313 --> 00:52:48,299
Speaker 1: Just call it stalker Because once you make the technology you've opened Pandora's box, they can't close it.

902
00:52:49,062 --> 00:52:50,628
Speaker 0: Apple could ban it from the App Store.

903
00:52:50,728 --> 00:52:53,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then oh, you know what they're basically jailbreak.

904
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:56,640
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna go back to an old analogy if you outlaw guns.

905
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,827
Speaker 0: But the thing is the problem.

906
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:00,804
Speaker 0: here's the thing as of today very today.

907
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:06,266
Speaker 0: if you were gonna set that up the way you would have to make it architecturally is The same way that Google does.

908
00:53:06,306 --> 00:53:18,600
Speaker 0: their voice recognition on their keyboard is where someone takes the picture The photo is sent to your data center where it's processed and then the results are sent back You know asynchronously to the client and that's today.

909
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:33,140
Speaker 0: So if you set that up today You could be shut down because you would be required just by the laws of technology to have a centralized location in order to make This, you know be able to stand up against someone trying to shut you down.

910
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:33,982
Speaker 1: Local.

911
00:53:34,223 --> 00:53:40,500
Speaker 0: it has to be at the point at where the cell phone or maybe you can plug it into your laptop or something.

912
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:47,927
Speaker 0: Well, here's enough horsepower Storage to hold the database Just on your person.

913
00:53:47,987 --> 00:53:50,460
Speaker 1: Well, this is where I see the real future of personal computing.

914
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,140
Speaker 1: Remember your idea and a few technologies agree with us of everyone should have their own personal cloud.

915
00:53:55,562 --> 00:54:03,310
Speaker 1: That's what I hope should be the result because then I have my phone Connects to my cloud my cloud interfaces with other clouds But I can shut that shit off if I need to.

916
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:06,948
Speaker 0: this is this is you know Something that is not a new idea, right?

917
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:09,056
Speaker 0: There's a thing called foaf friend of a friend.

918
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:10,000
Speaker 0: It's an XML schema.

919
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:10,926
Speaker 1: Yeah,

920
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,662
Speaker 0: I know XML scheme was a kind of Blair these days But the way

921
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:16,713
Speaker 1: foam and there was a time when XML was the hot shit

922
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:26,880
Speaker 0: and the way foaf works You should look it up is that you made an XML document That was basically your social network profile and there were all these different extensions you could add to it.

923
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,760
Speaker 0: So anytime, you know, so it would start off with just like name address Whatever and let's say you wanted to add in like movie ratings.

924
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,468
Speaker 0: Well, there was an extension and it's like.

925
00:54:34,488 --> 00:54:36,980
Speaker 0: well, this is how you add movie ratings to your you know in XML.

926
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,059
Speaker 0: And this is how you add, you know comments and this is how you add.

927
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,767
Speaker 0: You know hearts and all.

928
00:54:41,848 --> 00:54:44,862
Speaker 0: you could basically add anything to it and all these different XML things Imagine

929
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:48,600
Speaker 1: like a super extensible modern version of the old like nerd tag

930
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:57,576
Speaker 0: Writing as writing a Facebook profile in XML and you could just add Anything you could come up with that you might want to be in your profile to it.

931
00:54:57,716 --> 00:54:59,906
Speaker 1: as a pony Rainbow day exact.

932
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,130
Speaker 0: you could add a pony section.

933
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:03,400
Speaker 0: you could add, you know a graffiti wall any right?

934
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:12,129
Speaker 0: So and the idea was that you would host your foaf file on your website and you would have links in Your profile to other foaf files.

935
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:19,894
Speaker 0: So if I put my foaf XML file at Aprache.net/foaf.xml and it would be in the friends section.

936
00:55:19,914 --> 00:55:20,536
Speaker 0: There would be a link.

937
00:55:20,576 --> 00:55:23,180
Speaker 0: It was a friend rim Foaf location.

938
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:30,520
Speaker 0: You know rim.frontrowcrew.com/foaf.xml and rim would host his foaf.xml file at that location.

939
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:35,980
Speaker 0: So now everyone has their own web server hosting their own profiles, but they're all linked to each other.

940
00:55:36,261 --> 00:55:44,769
Speaker 0: So you could still make on top of that a social networking app like Facebook, even though there's no central server Everyone is just hosting their own profile on their own server.

941
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,878
Speaker 0: So, you know the also jabber, right?

942
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:57,700
Speaker 0: So Gchat is jabber, but it's centralized but the idea of jabber is federated Chat, so everyone would have their own chat server, right?

943
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,744
Speaker 0: So we could have frontrowcrew.com chat server and then you would have users would have accounts on your chat server and you would chat With other servers.

944
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:10,756
Speaker 0: So instead of there just being one chat server like there is with say AOL aim this one server It's aim.

945
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:20,480
Speaker 0: Everyone would have their own chat server and if you chatted with other people on the same server as you Those chats wouldn't go over the Internet's they would just stay on that server.

946
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:26,319
Speaker 0: So if I was chatting with rim on the front crew.com server All our chats would be there and they wouldn't go anywhere else.

947
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,678
Speaker 0: So no one could spy on us.

948
00:56:28,102 --> 00:56:35,898
Speaker 0: But if I wanted to chat with someone who has G chat then my server knows how to talk to G check because they both speak jabber and we could.

949
00:56:35,978 --> 00:56:37,168
Speaker 0: it would the Servers.

950
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:43,549
Speaker 0: I would talk to my server He would talk to the G chat server and then the G chat server would talk to my server and send the chats back and forth.

951
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:48,420
Speaker 0: and that's Federation Identica which we used for a while also known as Laconica.

952
00:56:50,464 --> 00:56:51,875
Speaker 0: I don't know what status.net is.

953
00:56:51,895 --> 00:57:01,700
Speaker 0: what they're calling it These days is basically a Twitter that uses this architecture where everyone has their own Twitter server But then all the different Twitter servers know how to talk to each other.

954
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,620
Speaker 0: So you can just tweet and then the tweet will only go on your server.

955
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:14,659
Speaker 0: But if someone in another server is following you then your server knows to send your tweets to that server because you have a follower On it, but if there's a server out there, you don't have any followers.

956
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:16,628
Speaker 0: It's not gonna send your tweet to that one.

957
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:19,079
Speaker 0: It's only gonna send your tweets to the ones that needs to send it to.

958
00:57:19,099 --> 00:57:28,683
Speaker 0: and So the ultimate goal here is that we can take down Facebook and Google and all these places and We could all have.

959
00:57:28,823 --> 00:57:33,240
Speaker 0: everyone could have a server in their house and Microsoft is actually leading the way on this with Windows home.

960
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,408
Speaker 1: So actually though with Google we wouldn't have to take Google down.

961
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:36,553
Speaker 1: They could very easily have.

962
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:38,300
Speaker 1: they have a cloud that has its own.

963
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:47,500
Speaker 0: Yes, of course There are things there still room for these companies to exist and do things and provide many services But the point is is you would have your own server in your own house.

964
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:53,352
Speaker 0: You would put your photos and your videos and all your personal things on your own server Which is completely 100% under your control.

965
00:57:54,541 --> 00:58:10,560
Speaker 0: You would decide what goes out and what goes in and if you needed to share with say your mom who has her own server In her house, you would just say share my photos with my mom her servers over there And when she wanted to look at your photos your server would send its photos to her server where she could look at them.

966
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,420
Speaker 1: Obviously, that's a a high level because the physical reality is you would need multiple locations for safety of data.

967
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,680
Speaker 0: Obviously, there's a lot of things going on there.

968
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:24,458
Speaker 0: But the other the reason that we can't have this nice thing right now mostly is because ISPs are dickwads.

969
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:28,560
Speaker 0: Yep And if ipv6 comes around well, you didn't have this.

970
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:37,323
Speaker 1: It's only relatively recently that a lot of people are doing two-way communication on the internet of any like so We're doing Any size like large quantities of data.

971
00:58:37,424 --> 00:58:44,540
Speaker 1: in the early days Yes, they were because you couldn't send much data.

972
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,489
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was just two-way communication as bandwidth grew.

973
00:58:47,810 --> 00:59:09,920
Speaker 1: notice how when cable modems came and everything bandwidth only grew downstream For a long time it did because and and I'm not gonna say conspiracy or anything, but very obviously media companies and technology companies and many companies do not really like the idea of People being their own publishers and their own distributors in addition to consuming data on the internet.

974
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, the internet is a web.

975
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:18,980
Speaker 0: I can send things directly from my computer to rim But if you've noticed whenever anyone's tried to set up networks with that structure, right?

976
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:30,111
Speaker 0: They've always been fought against by the man, right mighty Napster they fought, you know bit torrent is pretty much the only Surviving like peer-to-peer structured thing.

977
00:59:30,252 --> 00:59:38,284
Speaker 1: now imagine a bit torn like thing for a web browser Browser was also a web server and you just you were publishing your shit Operas trying to do that.

978
00:59:38,304 --> 00:59:41,237
Speaker 1: I know and that's that's what I would say web 3.0 is.

979
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,890
Speaker 0: but you know The thing is we got way off topic here.

980
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,493
Speaker 0: I don't know.

981
00:59:45,196 --> 00:59:45,960
Speaker 1: So that's fine.

982
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:49,650
Speaker 1: We've been a while we can actually a better topic.

983
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:53,011
Speaker 0: that you know, it's like we didn't have that show idea But that would have been a great show idea.

984
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:53,960
Speaker 0: We would have just started with that.

985
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,544
Speaker 1: I guess we got two topics we talked about.

986
00:59:55,624 --> 00:59:56,867
Speaker 1: I guess since we're at the end though.

987
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:57,268
Speaker 1: I do want to.

988
00:59:57,288 --> 01:00:04,880
Speaker 1: I Want to be able to walk home and the camera on my door lets me in.

989
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,560
Speaker 0: I don't know how much I would trust that but that's okay.

990
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:14,100
Speaker 1: I trusted if it got to the point where was trustable or better if My doors, that'd be okay.

991
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,460
Speaker 0: If it was just another factor in a multi-factor authentication or if my door still had a little however it locked.

992
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:24,476
Speaker 1: But the doorman I could give him a list of people who he you know when they walk in.

993
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:27,126
Speaker 1: it shows a little like like Like on his screen.

994
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:29,516
Speaker 1: it shows green like okay going to rims apartment.

995
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:30,420
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

996
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:31,809
Speaker 1: So then he doesn't have to bother them.

997
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:33,440
Speaker 1: But yet someone I haven't put on the list.

998
01:00:33,803 --> 01:00:35,417
Speaker 1: It's like like yellow don't know.

999
01:00:35,438 --> 01:00:40,437
Speaker 0: well you could you can make face just one of like two or three factors and like it could be a password.

1000
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:50,936
Speaker 0: you say like Imagine if you walked up to your door and it saw your face and you said open sesame and you had a thing Right, you know some sort of card swipe or something.

1001
01:00:50,977 --> 01:00:51,238
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1002
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:55,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, the saying not so great because people can hear what I'm saying.

1003
01:00:55,376 --> 01:00:56,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's true.

1004
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:58,696
Speaker 0: But you know just saying like, you know, and I did.

1005
01:00:58,716 --> 01:00:59,220
Speaker 0: that's an idea.

1006
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,527
Speaker 0: You know a multi-factor door opener.

1007
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:06,399
Speaker 0: and then what you could do is you could like if if everyone and let's say everyone had A car like it was a hotel.

1008
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:10,500
Speaker 0: Right, I could come over to your house and I have a card that I used to open my house.

1009
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:15,520
Speaker 0: So I could swipe the card at your house and you could say this card is allowed to open my house.

1010
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,100
Speaker 0: No, no, I could say no one has a set of keys anymore.

1011
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:23,400
Speaker 0: Everyone is exactly one key card for the world and you just add your your company when you go to work.

1012
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:26,260
Speaker 0: They add your key card to the company's security system.

1013
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:30,380
