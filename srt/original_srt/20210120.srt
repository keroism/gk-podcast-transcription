1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,329
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, January 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,329 --> 00:00:10,630
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:14,260
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,625
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:19,160
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about the Chainsaw Man.

6
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:21,959
Speaker 1: I don't think it's the Chainsaw Man.

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,379
Speaker 0: It's just Chainsaw Man.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,659
Speaker 1: It's just Chainsaw Man.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,039
Speaker 0: But it's a... But there is only one Chainsaw Man, as far as I can tell.

10
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

11
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:32,198
Speaker 0: Yep.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,700
Speaker 0: So it is Definite Article Chainsaw Man.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 0: It's about the Chainsaw Man, not just a Chainsaw Man.

14
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,220
Speaker 1: The title of the book is just Chainsaw Man.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,660
Speaker 0: But are we talking about the book or the character?

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,756
Speaker 1: The book.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,439
Speaker 1: That's true.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:52,620
Speaker 0: So there is real news, and we're not going to dwell on this because... Read a book, read the news.

19
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:53,866
Speaker 0: But you didn't notice.

20
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,020
Speaker 0: the actual inauguration happened.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,499
Speaker 0: There wasn't some magic nonsense storm.

22
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,360
Speaker 0: Joe Biden is actually president.

23
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:01,779
Speaker 0: That happened.

24
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:04,259
Speaker 0: Now we can start to make changes.

25
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:11,880
Speaker 0: The thing I want to point out to you, my news is, if you didn't watch the inauguration, I'm not saying you had to, but go watch...

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,397
Speaker 1: It's kind of boring.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,093
Speaker 0: Yeah.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Speaker 0: Go watch the speech that the poet gave Amanda Gorman during the inauguration.

29
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:22,980
Speaker 0: It is phenomenal.

30
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,440
Speaker 1: I would say two things.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,380
Speaker 1: One is that we made it past four years of not good times.

32
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:31,892
Speaker 0: Yep.

33
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,760
Speaker 1: A lot of people did not.

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:44,000
Speaker 0: Do not roll into 2021 with the "I Survived 2020" t-shirt, because a lot of people you're going to encounter know people who didn't survive.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,880
Speaker 1: Or maybe you know people who didn't survive.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Speaker 0: It's also going to kind of get worse before it gets better.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,136
Speaker 0: Like COVID's not getting better.

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:02,137
Speaker 1: I can't find the tweet because Twitter search is garbage, but someone definitely tweeted in 2016, "People are going to die because of

39
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:02,359
Speaker 1: this."

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,120
Speaker 1: And they were right.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,020
Speaker 1: Whoever that person was, they should be in charge.

42
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:13,040
Speaker 1: The other thing is, on the one hand... I'm going to put this in terms like a nerd can understand.

43
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,459
Speaker 1: On the one hand, it's like, yeah.

44
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:24,740
Speaker 1: The executor superstar destroyer crashed into the Death Star, and the Death Star blew up, and the emperor didn't actually die.

45
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:25,840
Speaker 1: Whatever.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,239
Speaker 1: He's not in power anymore.

47
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:34,659
Speaker 1: But there's still a dozen other super star destroyers around the galaxy still.

48
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:40,099
Speaker 1: So on the one hand, the empire is still out there.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,220
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, you can still sing yub nub right now.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,080
Speaker 0: Yup, that's a point I've been trying to make on Twitter and other places.

51
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:52,360
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, we got a lot of work to do, but it is totally okay to celebrate this victory.

52
00:02:53,182 --> 00:03:02,920
Speaker 1: You can sing a yub nub, but just don't forget that that was only one super star destroyer, and there was a lot more than that.

53
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,019
Speaker 1: I guess if you've only watched the movies, you wouldn't be nerdy enough to know that.

54
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,280
Speaker 1: There were so many of those.

55
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:09,756
Speaker 1: That was only one.

56
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,480
Speaker 1: So yeah.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:13,969
Speaker 1: Yup.

58
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,300
Speaker 0: So in some animation news, I got a little bit of a geek bite.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:31,620
Speaker 0: I talked a while ago about Hilda, which is a phenomenal... I used that word too many times already today, but it is a fantastic top-tier A+ animated series that's on Netflix based on some graphic novels.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,680
Speaker 0: Season two of it dropped, and we just finished it, me and Emily.

61
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:40,040
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to go too deep into a geek bite because I don't want to spoil things.

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,108
Speaker 0: You should just watch this.

63
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:42,279
Speaker 0: Everyone should watch it.

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,360
Speaker 0: I can't think of a single human.

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,059
Speaker 0: What's it even about?

66
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,232
Speaker 1: I know what it looks like.

67
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:45,739
Speaker 1: I've seen it.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,956
Speaker 1: I just don't know what it's about.

69
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:47,839
Speaker 0: It's about a...

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,700
Speaker 1: You're only Hilda, right?

71
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:50,540
Speaker 0: So Hilda is a series.

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,519
Speaker 0: It's about a pseudo-Scandinavian, maybe Swedish, pleasant town called Trollberg.

73
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:02,321
Speaker 1: Is it sort of like Heidi of the Alps, only 2020?

74
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:08,940
Speaker 0: A little bit, but it's more like... So imagine a world where there's a lot of fantastical stuff just there, but it's totally normal to everyone.

75
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:10,319
Speaker 0: Like, why is it called Trollberg?

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,678
Speaker 0: Because there's fucking trolls outside the walls that turn to stone every day.

77
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,478
Speaker 0: But it's just like normal life.

78
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,452
Speaker 0: And Hilda goes off on adventures in this setting, and it's just sort of fun.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,899
Speaker 0: Like, kid has adventures and deals with dark forces and usually comes out okay in the end.

80
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:37,680
Speaker 0: But with the twist that it's better than the average children's show that does this kind of thing, because the peril she gets into is a lot more perilous than you might expect.

81
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:48,740
Speaker 0: Like, it gets way more serious and dangerous than a lot of children's media tends to, even though that level of danger is what kids actually want, if you ask them and not their parents.

82
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,180
Speaker 0: So Hilda season two, what I'm going to say about it is that it's just as good as season one.

83
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,240
Speaker 0: Like, the show just continues to be utterly fantastic.

84
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:08,216
Speaker 0: But the last episode looked like it was going to just be like a good season finale and end, and I could think, "Well, now I'll just wait for season

85
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:08,398
Speaker 0: three.".

86
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,239
Speaker 0: Something happened I didn't expect.

87
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:20,980
Speaker 0: The last episode of season two fades out, and then it fades back in and shows you something and it shows you the terrible secret of space.

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,618
Speaker 0: It shows you the kind of thing that you'd see at the end of a VHS tape of an anime where you can't see the next season for a year.

89
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:32,818
Speaker 0: This is an Escaflode level cliffhanger.

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,964
Speaker 1: What was that anime?

91
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,939
Speaker 1: that was a very short one, only maybe it was an OAV.

92
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,960
Speaker 0: Oh, Combustible Campus Gardress?

93
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,680
Speaker 1: No, not that one.

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 1: And it was just like these... I think I remember there were robots and they had alien hats of some kind or something.

95
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,462
Speaker 0: Alien 9.

96
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,919
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was Alien 9 either, but it might have been.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,639
Speaker 1: But there was stuff in the... Basically, when the credits played at the end of the last episode, ridiculous stuff happened behind it.

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was Alien 9.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,540
Speaker 0: It was like, "Oh, all those characters died.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,025
Speaker 0: Wait, what?

101
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:01,551
Speaker 0: What?".

102
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:03,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was Alien 9.

103
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,278
Speaker 0: That's what we were thinking of.

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,057
Speaker 1: Let me Google it.

105
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:07,939
Speaker 1: Yup, that was it for sure.

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,974
Speaker 0: Alien 9 weirdly is in my... It has a lot of brain space for me.

107
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:16,479
Speaker 0: for some reason still, even though I read one volume of the manga and it didn't make sense.

108
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Speaker 1: Literally, what I just said is all that I know about it, other than recognizing it and knowing crazy stuff happens during the credits.

109
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,380
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:39,957
Speaker 0: So, yeah, the end of Season 2 of Hilda, which it'll be a while before there's a Season 3 because the comics have to catch up to where they can even make another season, is quite a cliffhanger and I still haven't quite processed it.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 0: So, watch Hilda.

112
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,279
Speaker 0: It is utterly amazing.

113
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:51,319
Speaker 0: But if you are not good with dealing with spoilers, watch all the way up to the second to last episode of Season 2 and then just wait.

114
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:57,618
Speaker 0: Because if you watched that last episode, it's a spoiler that I was shocked by.

115
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:00,172
Speaker 0: It's a good spoiler.

116
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:07,740
Speaker 0: It's a good... Whatever's gonna happen in Season 3 is gonna be like S-rank, I think, because of this.

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,598
Speaker 0: But now I really want to know what the deal is with that thing that I saw.

118
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,840
Speaker 1: It's a terrible secret of space.

119
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,481
Speaker 0: Yup.

120
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:16,700
Speaker 0: And Season 2 spent the entire time.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,839
Speaker 0: Season 1 didn't seem like it was going anywhere other than Hilda's way more powerful than she should be.

122
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:30,340
Speaker 0: But Season 2 sort of has this thread of things aren't necessarily what they appear or maybe the government is bad.

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,775
Speaker 0: We should look into that, but...

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,939
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't say.

125
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,109
Speaker 1: Yeah.

126
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:34,960
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

127
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:35,798
Speaker 1: You don't say.

128
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,726
Speaker 0: Watch Hilda.

129
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:37,980
Speaker 0: I cannot stress this enough.

130
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,739
Speaker 0: This is one of those shows where I would universally recommend it to anyone, regardless of what else they might like.

131
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:50,277
Speaker 1: So, something else I'd recommend to anyone regardless of what else they might like.

132
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,400
Speaker 0: I do agree with that.

133
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,472
Speaker 1: But maybe not really, because there are some people for whom it wouldn't fly.

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,172
Speaker 0: People are at least over the age of 18 in America.

135
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a webcomic named Ogloff.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,559
Speaker 1: We've talked about it on the show before.

137
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:09,578
Speaker 1: It is excellent, and it is rated X-lent, for sure.

138
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:29,419
Speaker 1: And recently, they had a Kickstarter to kickstart printing the physical Volume 3 compilation of the Ogloff comics, which... The Ogloff website is actually somewhat painful to navigate, and they don't post their comics on other places because of the X rating parts, obviously, right?

139
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:36,360
Speaker 1: So, they'll sometimes post a comic that has extra pages, and you have to click a different link to go to see those.

140
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:42,659
Speaker 1: If you just click Next, Next, Next, you'll skip over different strips because of the way the website is.

141
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,880
Speaker 1: And it's hard to keep up with it.

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,319
Speaker 1: They do come out rather consistently, so if you don't stay on top of it, you'll miss some.

143
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:55,239
Speaker 0: I don't think I have ever failed to read an Ogloff within a day of it coming out for years.

144
00:08:55,561 --> 00:09:00,440
Speaker 1: I thought that, too, but then I read these compilations, and there were several strips I'd never seen before in my life.

145
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:07,959
Speaker 1: And then, also, you hover over your mouse, and there's funny alt text on a lot of the strips as well.

146
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,173
Speaker 1: And those sometimes are funny.

147
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,420
Speaker 1: Not usually, but sometimes.

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,579
Speaker 0: What was the first webcomic to do that?

149
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:14,688
Speaker 1: I don't know.

150
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:15,460
Speaker 1: That's a great question.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,140
Speaker 0: Because I feel like even the early Penny arcades had the alt text.

152
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,871
Speaker 1: It is a misuse of alt text, which is meant for accessibility and reasons, but whatever.

153
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,677
Speaker 1: Not honestly, but kind of, you know.

154
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 1: Anyway.

155
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,010
Speaker 1: But, yeah, they printed, they put this Kickstarter out, and they said, "You know what?

156
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,060
Speaker 1: I'll kick it at the level that gets me all three volumes, and then I can read through all of it again.

157
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:45,940
Speaker 1: Even though I've read most of it from the beginning, I'm sure there'll be parts I didn't remember, or maybe I was correct, strips I'd never seen.

158
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,927
Speaker 1: I somehow missed them.

159
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,740
Speaker 1: And I'll catch myself up, right?

160
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,900
Speaker 1: Make sure I don't miss anything.

161
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:55,260
Speaker 1: And then I'll just keep reading it like I do, and then get volume four one day to, you know, do the same thing.

162
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,268
Speaker 1: Catch up and fill in the

163
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:56,551
Speaker 1: blanks.".

164
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:03,960
Speaker 1: So, yeah, first of all, these printed volumes are a really great way to read Ogloff.

165
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,899
Speaker 1: Much better than the kind of eh website.

166
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,040
Speaker 1: However, the alt text are printed at, like, the side and the top of the page, right?

167
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:23,360
Speaker 1: And this sort of happened to me also with the Adventure Time comic, where they would put, like, a funny, tiny line of text, like, outside the panels, like, at the bottom of the page.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,805
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

169
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,253
Speaker 0: I missed those at first.

170
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 0: Like, I just didn't pay attention to them.

171
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,240
Speaker 1: As sort of like a commentary on the page, right?

172
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:46,680
Speaker 1: And while those often contained awesome content that I was happy to get, it's sort of like you're reading these panels, and then you stop to read this line of text, and it totally messes up the pacing, and sort of, like, hurts my head a little bit, right?

173
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,220
Speaker 1: Not, you know, like, it's hard to read words.

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,460
Speaker 1: But it's just sort of like, if I was reading only panels, I could, like, blitz through the whole thing, right?

175
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,358
Speaker 1: And just take them all in.

176
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,860
Speaker 1: But, like, it's like I'm in panel reading mode.

177
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,800
Speaker 1: Like, it's almost like having a car going 100 miles an hour, and then you hit the brakes and stop at a red light, and then you go to 100 miles an hour to read the next strip, and then you stop at a red light.

178
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Speaker 0: I've always felt like, especially if it's a commentary thing, like, you should read the whole comic, and then whenever you read it again is when you look at that commentary.

179
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,380
Speaker 1: Maybe, but the thing is, all those alt text only make any sense in the context of you just read this comic, now read this alt text.

180
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,400
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you read the comic again, but that, like, the second time through is when you also stop and read all those bits.

181
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:28,802
Speaker 0: Right.

182
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:39,000
Speaker 1: This is as opposed to, say, something that does it, I think, much better, which is, like, Watchmen, where you read the whole comic, and then there's some non-comic part that you read separately, right?

183
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,100
Speaker 0: I feel like we had to admonish a lot of people for not reading those, like, bits between the drawn parts of Watchmen.

184
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,100
Speaker 1: There are a lot of nerds who just don't read those at all, which is, I think, that's way bad.

185
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,460
Speaker 1: But it's like, in Watchmen, you're only hitting, you're going from 100 miles an hour to stop once, right?

186
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:59,240
Speaker 1: You get that feeling one time, and then you read the text, right?

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,379
Speaker 1: Here, it's like, you're reading two rows of panels, and then you're stopping, and it's sort of like, ow, ow, ow, over and over again.

188
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:15,740
Speaker 1: And I think maybe, you know, I might have been happier just not reading those alt texts, because, like I said, only some of them were actually kind of funny.

189
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
Speaker 1: The comics are all great, right?

190
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:19,136
Speaker 1: It's like, the comics are all, like, A+.

191
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,000
Speaker 1: But the alt texts are just sort of like, they weren't that necessary.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,160
Speaker 1: I could have just read all the, you know, if I'd read it again, I would just skip all of them and read the panels only.

193
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, because one thing about Ogloff is they're not, like, particularly funny like they are on some comics.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,772
Speaker 1: That's true, yeah.

195
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:36,260
Speaker 1: Anyway.

196
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:53,237
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you are, you know, talking about, like, web comics, right, and quality level, like, Ogloff is actually, you know, of the web comics I've read in my life, which is quite a few, I think it's pretty high ranking in terms of, right?

197
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:57,700
Speaker 0: It's current level of funniness compared to every other web comic I read.

198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,279
Speaker 0: I think it's the funniest web comic I read right now.

199
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,820
Speaker 1: It might be, like, a top ten all-time web comic period, right?

200
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:04,080
Speaker 1: Oh, easily.

201
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,620
Speaker 1: But it's just sort of, like, under-represented in terms of, you know, its popularity.

202
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,481
Speaker 1: I don't know how popular it actually is, but in terms of its, you know, how much praise it gets, I think it's lessened, and because of its X-rated nature, it's like.

203
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:22,100
Speaker 1: they're not, like, you know, tweeting out and stuff, right?

204
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,460
Speaker 1: Even on their Patreon, it's like, yeah, they only put other stuff on Patreon.

205
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,680
Speaker 1: They don't put, you know, certain things on there, right?

206
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,280
Speaker 1: Even though Patreon has had a history of being full of porn.

207
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,580
Speaker 1: I guess they can start an OnlyFans.

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,279
Speaker 1: If there was an Ogloff OnlyFans, I would make an OnlyFans account.

209
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,216
Speaker 0: I think I might, too.

210
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:52,260
Speaker 0: It is a shame that it's hard to, like, make a space for adult content that isn't just gross, like, just generic content of any kind that happens to also include these sexual and mature themes.

211
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,960
Speaker 0: That is not necessarily pornographic.

212
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ogloff isn't regular old porn.

213
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,240
Speaker 1: It's not, like, Fritz the Cat kind of situation.

214
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:08,380
Speaker 1: It's not a anime porn game on Steam situation.

215
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,920
Speaker 0: It's just like there'll be a joke that's about D&D, but that joke may involve a penis, because penises are funny.

216
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:19,640
Speaker 1: It's funny comic that would be in the Playboy magazine without the rest of the Playboy magazine.

217
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:25,560
Speaker 1: It's like just tear that comics page out of the Playboy magazine and have it on its own situation.

218
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,299
Speaker 1: And also it's better than anything that's ever in a Playboy magazine.

219
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,160
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's what Ogloff's all about.

220
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:41,700
Speaker 1: So you missed the Kickstarter, but you can still buy the books on Topatico, and I'm sure there'll be a Kickstarter for Volume 4 someday.

221
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,560
Speaker 0: At some point I should get those books, but I've been reading it online for so long.

222
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure we've talked about Ogloff on the show before, but reminder, Ogloff exists.

223
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,700
Speaker 0: Pretty sure we straight up reviewed it at one point.

224
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,086
Speaker 1: We may have.

225
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've definitely done webcomic shows.

226
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,479
Speaker 1: So I'm sure we've talked about it on those.

227
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,256
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

228
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:06,980
Speaker 0: What do you got?

229
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:28,973
Speaker 1: So a long time ago I did a thing of the day where it was like an old Groucho Marx TV show, I think, and someone was on the show and they were trying to figure out who this person was or what had happened to them, and it was like, "Oh yeah, this person was like a child who was in Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was assassinated, and the person lived to be on

230
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,577
Speaker 1: television."

231
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:35,400
Speaker 1: To sort of show you how, and it gives you a new perspective on how time has passed.

232
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:48,500
Speaker 1: And I sort of saw that occurring again, because it was MLK Day, and people love on MLK Day to, correctly, I love it too, to post color photos of Martin Luther King to show you how fucking recent that was.

233
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,856
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, if he hadn't been shot, he could still be alive, right?

234
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,277
Speaker 1: It's like Betty White is alive and she's older than he was, right?

235
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:57,538
Speaker 1: That sort of thing.

236
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,680
Speaker 1: And yet that same phenomena came again with a YouTube video I saw linked, and this YouTube video is from 1958.

237
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:16,500
Speaker 1: I guess '50s TV is like the perfect time for this sort of thing, because in the '50s there were still people alive from the 1800s, yet television existed, right?

238
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,660
Speaker 1: And if any of them appeared on television, that sort of bridges that sort of time gap, right, and messes with you.

239
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:33,840
Speaker 1: But yeah, here you have the author of Brave New World, Aldous Huxley, being interviewed by Mike Wallace for 28 minutes on CBS, right?

240
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:41,080
Speaker 1: And the things I want to say about this are A, Aldous Huxley was right about a lot of things and wrong about a lot of things.

241
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,520
Speaker 1: It's not some perfect genius person, either was Orwell, and I think the truth is some combination of the two, right?

242
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:55,220
Speaker 1: Number two, notice the way the interview is conducted.

243
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,080
Speaker 1: It's like Mike Wallace asks a question, Aldous Huxley gives an answer.

244
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,080
Speaker 1: Question, answer, no one's yelling over each other, right?

245
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:06,380
Speaker 1: The questions are actually like they're talking with some amount of depth.

246
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 1: It's more like what you get in a podcast in 2020 than what you get on television.

247
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,619
Speaker 0: I gotta say, in general, 50s and 60s interviews are some of my favorite content compared to later interview styles.

248
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:33,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think, you know, in the first set of questioning in this interview, he asks him about like, you know, hey, what's like hurting freedom in the United-- what are threats to freedom in the U.S.

249
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,980
Speaker 1: and the world that you believe exist?

250
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:40,960
Speaker 1: And I think he somewhat wrongly talks about overpopulation, right?

251
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:50,800
Speaker 1: But then, somewhat correctly, mostly correctly, talks about, you know, technological threats to freedom, which we have seen being very right.

252
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,860
Speaker 1: So this is worth 28 minutes of your time, I guess, right?

253
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,179
Speaker 0: I'm definitely going to watch this like right after we do the show.

254
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:13,140
Speaker 1: But also, I want to say, if anyone knows, right, because the YouTube algorithm has been actually quite bad at recommending more of these to me, even though I've watched all the ones I've confined, I think you sort of have to know they exist.

255
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,899
Speaker 0: Did you watch the Salvador Dali one?

256
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen Dali, yes.

257
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:32,424
Speaker 1: But yeah, if anyone knows any more like super old TV interview with person you think, you know, who you would think wouldn't have been on TV, right, you know, kind of thing, let me know.

258
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,120
Speaker 1: I can make more things for the day or just enjoy watching them.

259
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,357
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make a YouTube playlist, you know, something.

260
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,900
Speaker 1: I've been a fan of the YouTube playlist lately.

261
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,579
Speaker 0: I find that that helps me tune my own algorithm, and also it lets me like bucket types of content that I want to share with other people instead of just going to my own likes.

262
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Speaker 1: Right, also archive.org, right, good venue for this sort of thing.

263
00:18:52,521 --> 00:19:00,220
Speaker 1: The other thing I want to point out is that I did go through the effort to confirm that this was real and not some sort of deep faked thing.

264
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:07,240
Speaker 1: If it was a deep fake thing, god damn you did a great job of posting stuff all over the internet to make me believe it was not a deep fake thing.

265
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:16,880
Speaker 1: But the second thing I want to say is we should make a deep fake thing along these lines.

266
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:27,279
Speaker 1: If we can make it as good as this black and white, we don't even need color, we can make a black and white low res video, right, and voice act it.

267
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:34,079
Speaker 1: Or use some sort of AI on like samples of Mike Wallace's voice to get one half of it.

268
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:47,759
Speaker 1: And all we need is audio of someone else's voice, so we can find like a person who didn't live long enough for TV, but has a lot of radio, and get their voice, right, use AI to then type text and have it speak like them.

269
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:53,077
Speaker 0: You know the worst thing is though, hold on, we could get them to then promote gig nights from the 50s.

270
00:19:54,821 --> 00:20:00,060
Speaker 1: We could do that, I was going to say, they'd be dead, we can't get them to do anything.

271
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,660
Speaker 0: Just drag that corpse out of the earth and get it to sell some products.

272
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,440
Speaker 1: But I'm saying, let's make deep fakes of old public domain people, right.

273
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,480
Speaker 0: I think our code of ethics would be we'd only ever make them say true and righteous things.

274
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:27,940
Speaker 1: Obviously it would be, who knows what we're going to make it say, but the point is, we would not be evil, right, we would put the hint there, right, we wouldn't actually try to deep fake it, we would be like, yeah, this is fake y'all.

275
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:37,160
Speaker 1: You know what the bigger danger to us is, you and me specifically, is-- It would be fake, it would be obviously fake in the way that War of the Worlds is fake, talking about old radio.

276
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

277
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,960
Speaker 0: Now I'm thinking more that we've been podcasting longer than almost anyone has been podcasting.

278
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to deep fake Scott Rim?

279
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:55,360
Speaker 0: I think it would be, with the data set that exists, it would be pretty trivial to train one of those deep fake audio algorithms to get both of our voices perfectly.

280
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:03,260
Speaker 1: I think that is correct, anyone could do that with our Creative Commons licensed MP3s that are freely available on the internet.

281
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,040
Speaker 0: I welcome you to do this, just as long as you never make me or Scott say Nazi shit.

282
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,040
Speaker 1: Please do this, so that way-- Plausible deniability.

283
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:19,557
Speaker 1: If Rim decides he wants to bail, I can make a podcast and just type what he's saying, or vice versa.

284
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,880
Speaker 0: If Scott decides to bail, the problem, what if we both bailed and the AI just starts making geek nights forever, it's just like, I was biking to work today, were ya?

285
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,620
Speaker 0: I just shaved with my safety razor.

286
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:46,657
Speaker 1: Also, I could, for example, go to a-- you could go to a convention, I could just type what I was going to say, and then the deep fake me on the video screen can just do my part, I don't have to go there.

287
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,140
Speaker 1: Lots of good stuff, anyway.

288
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:52,680
Speaker 0: I just miss going to conventions.

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,767
Speaker 0: So anyway, my thing of the day, there is an old, there's an 80s manga.

290
00:21:57,248 --> 00:22:03,700
Speaker 0: that was also an 80s anime that I doubt any of you have seen called Genga Nagaraboshigan.

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:04,977
Speaker 0: I've never heard of it.

292
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,698
Speaker 0: It's about dogs.

293
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,259
Speaker 0: It's about a bunch of dogs.

294
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,479
Speaker 1: Is it like What's Michael, which is about cats?

295
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:19,019
Speaker 0: Uh, so it's about a bunch of dogs who go off to fight this really powerful bear, but it's like-- It's nothing like What's Michael.

296
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,480
Speaker 0: But it's like a war movie, like a war story, but it's just dogs.

297
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Speaker 1: Oh, like the penguin one, the penguin war one.

298
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, except they are just dogs.

299
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:30,300
Speaker 0: Like, there is no-- they're dogs dogging.

300
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,947
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I think I may have.

301
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:35,100
Speaker 1: actually, now that you've described it, I may have seen some images of it.

302
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,059
Speaker 0: You've probably seen images of it, but you've probably never read it or seen even one second of the information.

303
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,059
Speaker 0: I never had either.

304
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:49,914
Speaker 0: So our friend Judith pointed me, because this is up Judith's alley, like dogs doing this kind of thing, like that's a-- You know, like there's weird manga that only I'm into.

305
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:50,780
Speaker 0: This is a Judith thing.

306
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Speaker 0: And Judith pointed me at this YouTube video, and this YouTube video is a condensed version of the musical stage show that was put on very recently.

307
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,860
Speaker 0: that is an adaptation of this manga.

308
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,499
Speaker 1: Is it like cats only dogs?

309
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,260
Speaker 1: Yes.

310
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,920
Speaker 1: And plus war?

311
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:24,380
Speaker 0: It is a bunch of hot guys dressed up as like basically dog furries doing this musical, and this video is ten minutes of like choice bits from it with subtitles.

312
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,186
Speaker 0: I approve.

313
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,360
Speaker 1: I approve strongly.

314
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,754
Speaker 0: This is fucking amazing.

315
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:28,280
Speaker 0: The look.

316
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,860
Speaker 1: That's right.

317
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:40,080
Speaker 0: You've got to see it to believe it, and the thing that I want to point out to you to pay attention to are, look at how hot these guys are, and two, look at the bear.

318
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:46,198
Speaker 0: The bear is basically a Fist of the North Star villain singing his song-- Is it Zangief?

319
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:48,199
Speaker 1: Street Fighter?

320
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,129
Speaker 0: No, he's a little more refined than Zangief.

321
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,499
Speaker 0: He's more like hot, massive guy.

322
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:53,937
Speaker 0: Gaston?

323
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:05,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, with big like bear paw hand glove things, and he just appears like above the stage singing this song about how fucking great it is to be a murderous bear, and how no one will ever kill him.

324
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,360
Speaker 1: So Gaston from 3D and the Beast.

325
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,619
Speaker 1: That was right the second time.

326
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,360
Speaker 0: I don't know if you need to watch the entire musical for real, but watch this video at least.

327
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:24,318
Speaker 0: And if you enjoy this video, it's probably worth your while to see the actual musical, but I don't know if it's worth your while to watch this 80s anime.

328
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:39,020
Speaker 1: I do wonder if in the post-pandemic United States, right, if there is a greater, you know, hunger for, you know, theater, concerts, those sorts of things, right?

329
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,742
Speaker 0: I think there will be.

330
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:45,600
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm gonna go kind of crazy once I can go outside again, like going to theaters.

331
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:55,120
Speaker 1: It's hard to do anything on Broadway because Broadway is owned by a very few small number of people who only let certain things on their stages, right?

332
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:06,060
Speaker 1: It's a very controlled platform, but, you know, I wonder if community theater instead of, you know, most community theaters, they just sort of put on all the old plays, right?

333
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,799
Speaker 1: You know, existing famous plays is what they put on, right?

334
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:18,960
Speaker 1: Would there be some sort of, you know, market, because it seems like in Japan, you see a lot of, "Oh yeah, we put on this, this is like a stage show for a fucking yoga pedal," right?

335
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,520
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, all kinds of stuff has like these, they put stuff on stage that normally wouldn't be.

336
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,486
Speaker 1: It's like, how come no one in the U.S.

337
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:32,779
Speaker 1: is like, and I don't even watch these things, right, but like, you know, what are the popular TV shows in the

338
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:33,099
Speaker 1: U.S.,

339
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,280
Speaker 1: right?

340
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Speaker 1: Why isn't there like The Wire on stage, Sopranos on stage, Breaking Bad on stage, Game of Thrones on stage?

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,399
Speaker 0: Like you don't cover the whole show, you just do like this.

342
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:54,780
Speaker 1: You could just make like a, you know, two hour show, two and a half hour, you know, whatever, just, you know, take whatever popular fucking thing is on TV, you know.

343
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,132
Speaker 1: They tried Spider-Man, that didn't work.

344
00:25:58,876 --> 00:25:59,820
Speaker 1: Avengers might work.

345
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,339
Speaker 0: It turned out that dark, all right.

346
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:04,760
Speaker 1: But that would be on Broadway, Disney owns Broadway theaters, right?

347
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,950
Speaker 0: I think part of it might be licensing issues.

348
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:13,032
Speaker 1: I feel like I worry that more- No, but I'm saying the people that make those TV shows should just do it themselves.

349
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,520
Speaker 1: Don't license it to some, you know, whatever, right?

350
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaker 1: You know, make it, do it yourself, make it happen.

351
00:26:18,862 --> 00:26:22,800
Speaker 0: I, my best guess is that they just don't think there'd be enough return for them.

352
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:23,281
Speaker 1: Right.

353
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:28,700
Speaker 1: If I was a producer at a TV show, I would be like, all right, our TV show ended its run.

354
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:34,000
Speaker 1: Let's try to get it on stages in places just to make more money and see what happens.

355
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,080
Speaker 1: And if it worked to any extent, everyone else would do the same thing and that would start a whole thing.

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:47,720
Speaker 0: You know, like a cross media thing where like every year or two, you just got to make one thing to rekindle interest in your whole like IP back catalog of whatever that thing is.

357
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,759
Speaker 0: Like Adventure Time, they're just releasing this HBO thing every now and then.

358
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:52,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

359
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,802
Speaker 0: But go big.

360
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:56,460
Speaker 0: If there was an Adventure Time musical stage play, I would go see that.

361
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,345
Speaker 1: I'd see that shit.

362
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,451
Speaker 1: Opening night, let's go.

363
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,039
Speaker 1: I don't care how crappy that is.

364
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,100
Speaker 1: Let's see it from there.

365
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,261
Speaker 0: All right.

366
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:12,419
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, I have not read any more Tale of Hanzo yet because I read- I'm going to read it real, I'm feeling a reading mood lately.

367
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,240
Speaker 0: Well, I'm starting to feel it too, partly because I can't go outside anymore.

368
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,099
Speaker 1: The only thing between me and that book is volume three of Ogloff.

369
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:25,960
Speaker 0: Well, I did pre-order Chainsaw Man, volume three, but that does not take long to read.

370
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,833
Speaker 1: Oh, I read the digital edition.

371
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:28,680
Speaker 1: I didn't read the paper one.

372
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,402
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

373
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:32,240
Speaker 0: I pre-ordered the digital version, meaning it'll just appear in my Comixology.

374
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,127
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

375
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:33,714
Speaker 1: Okay.

376
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:34,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

377
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,981
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

378
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:51,939
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you may recall a while ago, we appeared, quote, finger quotes, at MagWest for the first time because it was online and we did a panel that was a- So, we didn't have time to like write a new talk.

379
00:27:52,581 --> 00:28:00,820
Speaker 0: So, we took that old like hour long play dirty to win and we tried to do it as condensed and like fast as possible.

380
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,230
Speaker 0: I almost think this version is better and that it's more usable and practical.

381
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:10,259
Speaker 0: if you just want to win because it's literally just do this, do this, do this, do this, trust us.

382
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:16,291
Speaker 0: So, but they're like, there's no chatter.

383
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,414
Speaker 0: We didn't do anecdotes.

384
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:20,620
Speaker 0: It was really hard to put this together because we are used to talking.

385
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:34,220
Speaker 0: Like we've spent so long doing panels that my brain, when I start talking to people, just says like there's this intrinsic timer of you've got 58 minutes and I just everything ends in exactly 58 minutes for me no matter what.

386
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:39,619
Speaker 0: It was really hard to make this panel happen, but we did it and now it's on our YouTube channel and you can just watch it.

387
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,540
Speaker 0: If you didn't see it live, add MagWest.

388
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:46,100
Speaker 1: I guess you should also mention MagFest as having like a huge drama.

389
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,020
Speaker 0: I was trying to not mention it because I don't want to get involved in nerd convention drama.

390
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,404
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's what I want to say, right?

391
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:54,825
Speaker 1: Is like.

392
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:01,860
Speaker 1: people are aware there's a huge MagFest drama and they might come looking to us since we have appeared at MagFest so many times.

393
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:09,253
Speaker 0: I've been, I've been added in threads about this on Twitter by three different people trying to get me to comment on it.

394
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:12,380
Speaker 0: Someone posted in our forum trying to get us to comment on it.

395
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,180
Speaker 1: Right.

396
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,500
Speaker 1: So the thing is, is like, it's such a drama and I'm not like, even though we appear at MagFest, you know, have gone to it so many years in a row.

397
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,983
Speaker 1: Like I don't know these people.

398
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,005
Speaker 1: I don't know the staff.

399
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:24,366
Speaker 1: I don't.

400
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:31,120
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, I know on the staff, I know, like I know the people that like I work with to set up our gig.

401
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:35,598
Speaker 1: The people in the person in the majors department and the person in the panels department.

402
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:35,960
Speaker 1: That's it.

403
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,331
Speaker 0: We are hired guns.

404
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,039
Speaker 0: We are brought in.

405
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,100
Speaker 1: And we have a friend, we have one friend who is on staff who hasn't told us anything.

406
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,044
Speaker 1: So it's like, there's a drama there.

407
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:52,000
Speaker 1: The drama is so deep and it's not some simple drama that I can just like make heads or tails of easily and be like, yes, no.

408
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,567
Speaker 1: It's like a complex twisted drama.

409
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,051
Speaker 1: And there's all these documents and stuff.

410
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:57,595
Speaker 1: And it's like, I don't have time for that.

411
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:58,037
Speaker 1: Right.

412
00:29:58,117 --> 00:29:59,180
Speaker 1: I can't figure this out.

413
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:03,012
Speaker 1: So I'm basically not touching that drama with a thousand foot pole.

414
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:03,393
Speaker 1: Right.

415
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:04,878
Speaker 1: It's like, it's got nothing to do with me.

416
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:05,380
Speaker 1: Right.

417
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,243
Speaker 1: It's got nothing to do with Geek Nights.

418
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:11,815
Speaker 1: We'll wait until that drama ends when the drama has ended, because it still hasn't ended.

419
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,700
Speaker 1: It's like ongoing continuous drama.

420
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:20,134
Speaker 1: When it ends, then we'll go and we'll see what the right thing to do is.

421
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:22,400
Speaker 1: Until then, I got nothing to do with it.

422
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:27,636
Speaker 1: Magfest isn't happening, so I don't have to decide whether to stop attending to continue attending.

423
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:29,060
Speaker 1: There's no Magfest anything happening.

424
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,120
Speaker 1: So I'm just going to continue in the meantime, not going to the non-existent Magfest until such a time.

425
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:48,200
Speaker 1: If Magfest returns and the drama has been sorted out and we can figure out the drama is, you know, whatever the answer is to it, then we'll say something.

426
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,852
Speaker 1: Until then, don't come looking to us for answers on Magfest drama.

427
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,720
Speaker 1: Go to people who are way more involved in Magfest than we are.

428
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,645
Speaker 0: I will say that Google Drive, you refused to read.

429
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:00,268
Speaker 0: I did read everything in that thing.

430
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:04,096
Speaker 0: And I still have no fucking comment, no opinion.

431
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:06,320
Speaker 0: I could not make head or tails of it.

432
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,633
Speaker 1: I got nothing to say about that.

433
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:12,360
Speaker 1: No comment.

434
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:18,560
Speaker 0: The only convention drama I'll be involved in is when I am running a convention, and I haven't run a convention in a while.

435
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,979
Speaker 0: So, Chainsaw Man.

436
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,660
Speaker 1: So I heard about Chainsaw Man from the Twitters, obviously, other people, right?

437
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,816
Speaker 1: And it sounded like, you know, a Shonen manga with some ridiculousness, sort of like in the One Punch Man zone.

438
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,500
Speaker 1: It has a man in the title, right?

439
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,578
Speaker 0: It's in Shonen Jump, and you'd always see this picture that was like, "A dude with chainsaws coming out of

440
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:43,719
Speaker 0: him.".

441
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,086
Speaker 1: Right, a dude with a chainsaw coming out of his face.

442
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:50,499
Speaker 1: You're like, "That is the anime/manga style that I am all

443
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:50,780
Speaker 1: about.".

444
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,628
Speaker 1: A dude with a chainsaw coming out of his face called Chainsaw Man.

445
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:54,832
Speaker 1: That's amazing.

446
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:57,319
Speaker 1: I think that's all I need to know to know that this is A+.

447
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,255
Speaker 1: But, I read a summary, and the summary had my opinion lowered.

448
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,720
Speaker 1: Quite substantially, in fact.

449
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:12,520
Speaker 1: Because the summary I read talked quite a bit about how this main character, Chainsaw Man, like, his goal was to touch boobs.

450
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:17,979
Speaker 0: Yup, now judge anime by its cover, that is like, that is a red flag, 100 feet tall.

451
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Speaker 1: That is a crimson flag at the top of the flagpole, seen halfway around the world.

452
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,460
Speaker 0: Like start singing the Soviet national anthem.

453
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:30,632
Speaker 1: I was like, "That makes me think Chainsaw Man is not gonna be good, actually.

454
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:34,159
Speaker 1: I should just enjoy the fact that there is a person with a chainsaw coming out of their

455
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:34,420
Speaker 1: face.".

456
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:47,019
Speaker 1: But then, you know, there was so much tweeting, I said, "Okay, I will read, Chainsaw Man is available for cheap in digital form, I will read it digitally, I will not waste bookshelf space on it, let's see what the deal

457
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,139
Speaker 1: is.".

458
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,187
Speaker 1: So, indeed, it was not lying.

459
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:53,580
Speaker 1: Chainsaw Man is a man who wants to touch boobs.

460
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:58,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but somehow that is not the problem that I expected it to be.

461
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:05,920
Speaker 1: They dedicated way more ink to that plotline in the summary than there actually is in the story.

462
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,690
Speaker 1: Spoilers, I guess, he actually touches the boobs quite early on, and that stops mattering.

463
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,140
Speaker 1: Yup, and also- And it's not in the sort of, you know, perverted anime kind of way.

464
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:30,140
Speaker 0: It kind of is, but it's not intrinsically bad in the way that I would say it is fucking intrinsically bad when that comes up in most anime.

465
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:39,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, and actually the lesson that he learns almost immediately is like, yeah, just touching some random person's boobs who consensually lets you touch them.

466
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:40,540
Speaker 1: isn't that exciting, right?

467
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,580
Speaker 1: It's like touching boobs with someone that you're, you know, in love with and in to be with is what you're really after.

468
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:47,724
Speaker 0: So it got bugged me.

469
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,672
Speaker 0: It was like, "Alright, read Chainsaw Man.

470
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:50,616
Speaker 0: It's actually good.

471
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,399
Speaker 0: We'll do a show on

472
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:51,479
Speaker 0: it.".

473
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:03,440
Speaker 0: And I think what you told, because you told me more to try to sell me on it to actually get me to read it, because when neither one of us, if either one of us recommends something to the other one, like it never gets consumed unless there's like the right tickle.

474
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,556
Speaker 1: The right tickle was, "We're doing a Wednesday show on this.

475
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:06,980
Speaker 0: You better read

476
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,040
Speaker 0: it.".

477
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 0: No, the tickle you gave me was- It's cheap and digitally available.

478
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,279
Speaker 0: You said something to the effect of, "Wait till you find out the deal with the Gun Man, like Gun Demon as opposed to Chainsaw

479
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:17,560
Speaker 0: Man.".

480
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,819
Speaker 1: That's right.

481
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:25,230
Speaker 0: And when I got to that point, I went from thinking this is good to thinking this is like legit good.

482
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,780
Speaker 0: Like that was a moment, once I learned the deal with the Gun Demon, I'm down for whatever the hell happens in the rest of this manga.

483
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:33,139
Speaker 1: But- Yeah.

484
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,105
Speaker 1: So the story is, plot summary, right?

485
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:39,891
Speaker 1: It's a world of humans, much like our world of humans in Japan, right?

486
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,411
Speaker 1: I guess, right?

487
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,355
Speaker 1: Because it's a manga.

488
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 1: And there are demon/devils, right?

489
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,552
Speaker 1: Yeah.

490
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:54,580
Speaker 1: And they are a lot like how, you know, sort of like a polytheistic culture will have like God of this, God of that, God of this.

491
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:54,721
Speaker 0: Yeah.

492
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,800
Speaker 0: There's a demon of like a devil of like everything.

493
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,464
Speaker 1: There's a demon or devil for everything, right?

494
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:07,136
Speaker 1: Demon or devil of swimming pools, demon or devil of television, demon or devil of, you know, forks, whatever it is.

495
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:09,820
Speaker 1: And of course, it's a demon/devil of chainsaws.

496
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,132
Speaker 1: Yep.

497
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,382
Speaker 1: It's just one of the things.

498
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,609
Speaker 1: And I guess how powerful a devil is depends.

499
00:35:16,749 --> 00:35:19,033
Speaker 1: It's a lot like RIM's Forgotten Realms, right?

500
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:22,399
Speaker 1: How many people believe in the God, the God gets stronger, right?

501
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:26,520
Speaker 0: So- I'm amazed that you remember that much about the theology of Forgotten Realms.

502
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,387
Speaker 1: You've gone on about it.

503
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,239
Speaker 1: How long for how many years?

504
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,440
Speaker 0: To be fair, that is in fact true.

505
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,089
Speaker 1: So, you know, if people, you know, something like television would be a very powerful demon indeed, right?

506
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:44,554
Speaker 1: But chainsaw, I mean, it's powerful because it's a fucking chainsaw.

507
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:48,500
Speaker 1: But how many, how much, how much do chainsaws take up the mindshare of human society?

508
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:48,993
Speaker 1: Yeah.

509
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,155
Speaker 1: Not a very powerful large demon.

510
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:58,000
Speaker 0: when it comes- At the same time, if you encounter a chainsaw directly, you're probably afraid of it if you're not a master of chainsaws.

511
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,042
Speaker 1: Indeed you are.

512
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:12,100
Speaker 1: So, what happens is this poor, sad kid encounters the chainsaw demon and somehow merges with it, which is, I guess, sort of like the plot, right?

513
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:12,418
Speaker 1: Yep.

514
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,667
Speaker 1: To become the chainsaw man.

515
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:17,720
Speaker 1: Fucking literal chainsaws just coming out of his arms in space.

516
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,324
Speaker 0: There's a pull cord in his chest.

517
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:24,575
Speaker 0: If he pulls it, he transforms into the chainsaw man in a bloody missile.

518
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,600
Speaker 0: Like, it's just horrific and amazing.

519
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:35,829
Speaker 1: And he's actually quite powerful and ends up, right, that there are these demon devil hunters that are sort of part of the police, right?

520
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:46,360
Speaker 1: And they go around stopping demons and devils, but they also have sort of demon devil people on their team to help them, right, fight demons and devils.

521
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,630
Speaker 1: Yep.

522
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,343
Speaker 1: And they sort of keep them under control, right?

523
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:52,751
Speaker 1: So he becomes sort of like, you know, a tool of the police, right?

524
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:58,040
Speaker 1: They sort of have him on a metaphorical leash, right, and use him to fight other demons and devils.

525
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:02,888
Speaker 1: And then you get into the, right, the sort of structure of the manga, right?

526
00:37:02,908 --> 00:37:05,573
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, there's going to be a demon or devil causing trouble.

527
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:09,360
Speaker 1: The police, along with chainsaw men, go out to deal with it.

528
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, the AD police go and can't deal with it, and then they call in the special government squad.

529
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:14,201
Speaker 1: Exactly.

530
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:18,946
Speaker 1: And they do this over and over again, and each one they encounter is a different one.

531
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:21,449
Speaker 1: that provides a different challenge to them.

532
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:24,311
Speaker 1: And it's not always just some combat challenge.

533
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:32,319
Speaker 1: It's, you know, really interesting kind of things happen with different kinds of devils doing weird shit in almost a Junji Ito-esque kind of way.

534
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,005
Speaker 0: That's a good way to put it.

535
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,560
Speaker 0: They are very non-human.

536
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit with each devil they got to deal with.

537
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:50,280
Speaker 1: And then along the way, character development happens for all of the characters, the main ones being, of course, chainsaw men and the other members of this police group.

538
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:56,992
Speaker 1: And then, of course, they're building up to the head boss, which is the gun devil, right?

539
00:37:57,012 --> 00:37:58,896
Speaker 1: Because guns are such a thing for humans.

540
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:00,940
Speaker 1: The gun devil is just, like, ridiculously strong.

541
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,902
Speaker 0: It makes a big point.

542
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:09,060
Speaker 0: Like, there's a mass shooting in the US, the gun devil spawns and starts fucking murdering, like, everybody when it appears all over the world.

543
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:10,002
Speaker 1: Right.

544
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:17,980
Speaker 1: So there's also the societal message about gun control, which is a big deal coming from Japan, where guns are heavily restricted versus the rest of the world.

545
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:29,340
Speaker 0: Now, normally, this is the kind of setup that would just be like a kind of boring shounen fighting show, or fighting manga, but as Scott pointed out, the fights aren't fights always.

546
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,560
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

547
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,340
Speaker 0: And they tend to be pretty quick, or if they're long, it's because, like, real plot stuff is happening.

548
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the longer ones sort of get into an almost Death Note-y situation, like, "What did we do about this devil?

549
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:45,535
Speaker 1: What's he doing?

550
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,939
Speaker 1: Why did we go up the stairs and we're still on the

551
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:48,180
Speaker 1: floor?".

552
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, the bit in the hotel, that's what I was thinking of, where the little blobby guy goes by and they're like, "Well, killing that devil didn't do anything.

553
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:54,118
Speaker 0: Hmm.".

554
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's solve the riddle of this devil, right?

555
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,828
Speaker 1: So it's like, not every devil is the same kind of challenge.

556
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:12,040
Speaker 1: It's almost like a video game where it's like, well, this is a puzzle part, and now this is a combat part, and now this is a, you know, different kind of... Like, it's a different genre, almost, for each devil, of how they get, you know, how the conflict is shaped.

557
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:21,020
Speaker 1: So, the other thing is that artistically, right, you know, it's very good, you know, shounen manga artwork, right?

558
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:21,272
Speaker 1: Yeah.

559
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:35,200
Speaker 1: But, whenever the Chainsaw Man fucking cuts the shit out of some devil, there's like an incredible Blade of the Immortal, like, two-page splash image, and these are just like, fucking incredible.

560
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,820
Speaker 1: Um, and it, you end up, I ended up staring at those for, like, a long-ass time, whenever they happen.

561
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,819
Speaker 1: Well, you turn the page, and you're just like, "Ooh, Chainsaw

562
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 1: Man!".

563
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, the Chainsaw Man just fucking, like, when he chainsaws, it's like, "Oh,

564
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:47,858
Speaker 1: baby!".

565
00:39:48,901 --> 00:40:03,059
Speaker 1: Uh, um, so yeah, it's like, those are just really fantastic, and they have you wanting the Chainsaw Man to chainsaw somebody just to see another one, and the artist, I'm sure, is like, "Please, writer, don't, let's go longer without having the

566
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,320
Speaker 1: chance.".

567
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,755
Speaker 1: "We don't have to draw another one of those, it took me, like, a

568
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:05,997
Speaker 1: week.".

569
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:16,800
Speaker 0: The other thing about it, though, that I cannot stress enough, is that it's very funny, and it's funny in a lot of different ways.

570
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:25,320
Speaker 0: Like, it's not, like, a lot of comics and manga will have, like, very simple jokes, or, like, the same joke happens over, this is just funny in, like, surprising, random ways.

571
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:41,280
Speaker 0: But there's, like, the two things that stand out to me very early, that I laughed out loud, was in the very beginning, when you, when he fights, like, his first devil, and the way the devil talks to him is like a shitbag, 13-year-old internet edgelord.

572
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:54,899
Speaker 0: And the second part that made me laugh out loud, and made me decide that I love this comic, is specifically when the one cop who doesn't like him is, like, beating him up, like, "Yeah, you can't be one of us, like, just go run

573
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:55,220
Speaker 0: away.".

574
00:40:55,862 --> 00:41:00,100
Speaker 0: And then you turn the page, and he just starts wailing on that guy's dick.

575
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:13,900
Speaker 0: He knees him in the nuts, and then starts kicking him in the nuts over and over and over again, and it's this whole bit about how the crotch, when I fight guys, I only aim for the crotch, and you get multiple pages of this.

576
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:23,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of, uh, it's sort of the same vein of humor as, like, One Punch Man, but more mature, definitely like an older audience a little bit, right?

577
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:35,280
Speaker 1: It may be kind of the same, you know, but it definitely, you know, I guess, eh, it just feels, it has a, I don't know, a different target, it's not exactly the same, there's something else about it.

578
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:41,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's kind of like- It's less, I guess it's less cartoony, slapsticky, I don't know.

579
00:41:41,400 --> 00:42:08,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, it's weird, it's a little slapsticky sometimes, but it's always in this, like, kind of brutal, violent way, but it always sends back on how, like, the main character is kind of a, like, dirtbag piece of shit, but you also kind of can't blame him for being that way, considering how he grew up, and you see him trying to improve himself bit by bit, but always from this starting point of being this kind of dirtbag piece of shit.

580
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:19,173
Speaker 1: He is, alright, but it's, like, he also is very introspective, and, like, you know, you'll see the main Chainsaw Man, like, thinking about, like, ah, you know, what, what should I do?

581
00:42:19,193 --> 00:42:20,174
Speaker 1: Hmm, right?

582
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:24,400
Speaker 1: He's actually, like, thinking about his own life, and, like, what are the right and wrong things to do?

583
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:33,409
Speaker 0: Like, he has this really dumb goal, like, I want to touch a boob, like, cause, like, that's the kind of person he is, but the whole time he's thinking, like, oh, what does this mean?

584
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,630
Speaker 0: Why do I want this?

585
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:44,640
Speaker 0: And, I don't know, it's very interesting to read, like, his inner monologue in the context of the story, but then outwardly, his interaction with other characters will just be hilarious.

586
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:50,695
Speaker 0: I also like the main girl, the cop who, like, runs the whole division.

587
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:52,100
Speaker 0: There's something up with her.

588
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,917
Speaker 1: He's definitely, like, that mysterious, um, reminds me of in Eccentric Family, the, the girl.

589
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:00,980
Speaker 1: that's the bad one.

590
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:01,819
Speaker 0: Oh, Benten?

591
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,999
Speaker 1: Who's really, yes, reminds me of Benten.

592
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:04,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

593
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,579
Speaker 1: Kind of character, a lot.

594
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,540
Speaker 0: Kind of mysterious, like, tells people what they need to know, but clearly is omitting something.

595
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:21,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, also in, in Patlabor, there's the, I forget her name, but there's the one that's used in a meme all the time, where, like, she shows up at the airport, and it's, like, business or pleasure, and she's, like, combat.

596
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:22,458
Speaker 1: Yeah.

597
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,595
Speaker 1: That character in Patlabor is very similar to that one in Chainsaw Man, also.

598
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:29,220
Speaker 1: Same kind of character.

599
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,420
Speaker 0: So, yeah, as long as you're down for some, uh, ultra violence from a living chainsaw.

600
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you, like, if you're the kind of person who, you know, likes, takes those ridiculous ideas that are in manga and anime every so often, right?

601
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:58,740
Speaker 1: Guy who punches someone and they explode, you know, sniper who always hits someone in one shot, guy who punches, can beat anyone with one punch, you know, any of those sort of ridiculous ones, Chainsaw Man is the latest in that line.

602
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,842
Speaker 1: You know, a death note, right?

603
00:43:59,902 --> 00:44:01,585
Speaker 1: There's always some ridiculous thing.

604
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:10,080
Speaker 1: This is the latest in that line of ridiculous premise shown in mangas, um, but, and it's a good one.

605
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep, I've read two volumes of the manga.

606
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:15,700
Speaker 0: You can just get it on, like, Amazon or Comixology or whatever.

607
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would recommend getting digital editions or if you really want paper editions.

608
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,620
Speaker 0: The first three chapters are just free to read on Viz, so you can actually read a good chunk of it.

609
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:24,999
Speaker 1: There you go.

610
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,739
Speaker 0: To decide if this is your bag or not.

611
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,220
Speaker 1: That sounds like a great idea.

612
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,979
Speaker 0: And you'll get well past the nut shot that I was talking about.

613
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,320
Speaker 1: Yep, and you will definitely see the Chainsaw Man chainsawing in those first three chapters, for sure.

614
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:44,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, but the, the, the, the proto-chainsaw demon or devil actually reminds- It's really cute, I want, you want, like, a toy.

615
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:53,160
Speaker 0: I do want a little lot of plushie of that, but also kind of reminds me of, uh, it's hard to say anything about this without spoiling it, The Thing in Decadence.

616
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:57,139
Speaker 0: The little pet in Decadence.

617
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:01,657
Speaker 0: Being very vague there for a reason, if you haven't seen Decadence, watch it.

618
00:45:03,343 --> 00:45:04,638
Speaker 0: We reviewed it not too long ago.

619
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:10,540
Speaker 1: It's definitely, you know, got that great combination of cute but also powerful and evil.

620
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,187
Speaker 0: Yep, but is it really evil?

621
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,354
Speaker 0: Because it does the right thing.

622
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:14,279
Speaker 0: It's just a cute little guy.

623
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,582
Speaker 1: Kinda.

624
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:15,596
Speaker 1: Kinda.

625
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

626
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:16,583
Speaker 1: Sorta.

627
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:17,420
Speaker 1: I mean, it is a devil.

628
00:45:18,862 --> 00:45:21,180
Speaker 1: I mean, that's probably going to be a, you know, a plot point at some point.

629
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,469
Speaker 0: I get the impression that devils, like, they're not necessarily bad.

630
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:31,339
Speaker 0: Like, there's definitely an undercurrent of they're not all necessarily bad and they're all- The gun devil is bad.

631
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're driven by- I don't think there's any question about it, you know.

632
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:34,780
Speaker 1: Like,

633
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:52,550
Speaker 0: the, the girl devil that he meets that they kind of partner together, you see, like, you get his inner monologue, but you don't really get these other characters' inner monologue, but you can sort of infer from the way he is that if you look at those other characters, if you understand what they're trying to achieve and what they care about, even the weird things.

634
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,480
Speaker 0: they do seem to actually make a lot of sense and they're almost trying to do the right thing.

635
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:04,699
Speaker 0: They just have, like, weird views on morality because there's this undercurrent of the world is a late capitalist hellhole.

636
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:15,340
Speaker 0: Like, the only reason he's even in this, like, the main character even is the way he is, is because the mafia is going to murder him unless he kills devils for them because of late capitalism.

637
00:46:16,642 --> 00:46:19,640
Speaker 1: That part also reminded me of, like, you know, Kaiji or whatever.

638
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:20,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

639
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:40,240
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like, you know, I've mentioned so many different other mangas, right, and I guess it's sort of like a mixed salad, right, of these, like, components and characters that I've seen all before, but, like, such a wide variety of them all together, right, in a new formulation, right, that it feels completely fresh.

640
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:51,780
Speaker 1: You know, even though I can relate it, I'm relating it to all these other things, at no point when I was reading it did it feel like, "Ah, this is just X redone," right?

641
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,520
Speaker 1: It never felt, it felt like a completely new kind of deal except for the fact that it was a shounen manga with a ridiculous premise.

642
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,735
Speaker 0: Yep, and the last thing I'll say, because we can wrap this up, is it does not drag at all.

643
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:05,080
Speaker 0: It moves pretty quick.

644
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,282
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

645
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:16,760
Speaker 1: All the fights, like I said, are pretty much just like, "I'm gonna chainsaw you, chainsaw, chainsaw, chainsaw," something, and then the two-plate splash where he, you know, chainsaws something like that, and that's it, right?

646
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,107
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, Naruto, "I'm gonna use my wah-wah-wah technique.

647
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:22,269
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I better use my

648
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,331
Speaker 1: wah-wah-wah.".

649
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:24,453
Speaker 1: None of that.

650
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:25,575
Speaker 1: That does not happen here.

651
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:28,140
Speaker 1: The fights are real quick when they happen at all.

652
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,537

664
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:46,030
Speaker 0: But tonight, like honestly, just like breathe a sigh of relief.

665
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,750
Speaker 0: And now, I leave you with something that has nothing to do with that.

666
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:10,639
Speaker 1: I said it.

667
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,073
Speaker 1: Wait!

668
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:13,568
Speaker 1: We have more excellent advice!

669
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,548
Speaker 1: Filthy opaque intruders.

670
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,768
Speaker 1: Wait, I was being haughty.

671
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,148
Speaker 1: Well, we're not.

672
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,286
Speaker 0: Last voice, smack a pair of trash water harpies into our perfect civilization.

673
00:49:27,253 --> 00:49:27,401
Speaker 1: Shorts!

674
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,409
Speaker 1: Take 'em back to the tower, you guys.

675
00:49:30,492 --> 00:49:33,230
Speaker 1: This could be any run-of-the-mill cave hack.

676
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,290
Speaker 0: Why should we believe you even?

677
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:39,850
Speaker 0: Of course, this day is subtle.

678
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:44,930
Speaker 0: Is this what passes through music and cotton candy land or whatever?

679
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,054
Speaker 0: You've gotten warped, princess.

680
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:49,901
Speaker 0: First glass boy, then the fakie Marceline.

681
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:53,510
Speaker 1: Now you're putting faith in a princess even more helpless than you, okay?

682
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,868
Speaker 1: It's just as we predicted.

683
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,086
Speaker 1: Oh, shut up!

684
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,710
Speaker 1: This is the last place the feast will happen.

685
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, get in that death hole.

686
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,249
Speaker 0: So what now?

687
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,435
Speaker 0: Yes!

688
00:50:04,455 --> 00:50:06,108
Speaker 0: We can trap them both in there forever!

689
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,010
Speaker 0: Shutting down the barrier?

690
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,530
Speaker 1: Um, it's not advisable, majesty.

691
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,018
Speaker 1: What a tragic turn.

692
00:50:15,038 --> 00:50:18,550
Speaker 0: I am so sad to tell you that your reign is over.

693
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:19,494
Speaker 0: No, no, no!

694
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:21,090
Speaker 0: Everyone stop taking your clothes off!
