1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,312
Speaker 0: It's Thursday June 20th 2019.

2
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,295
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:15,585
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is the geek nights book club tonight.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:24,568
Speaker 0: We are assuming that you read pages of pain by Troy Denning the Dungeons & Dragons Planescape branded canonical novel.

5
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:26,264
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:36,140
Speaker 0: So I feel like it's a very basic thing to just talk about the weather like we kind of like a home today But don't really talk about the weather like not usually.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,590
Speaker 0: it rained today, but normally I wouldn't say anything about it.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,636
Speaker 1: It's been raining all fucking week.

9
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,250
Speaker 1: I can't bike to work cuz it just keeps raining constantly.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,030
Speaker 0: Yep And I was hoping maybe cuz I'm gonna pick my bike up tomorrow from the shop.

11
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:53,727
Speaker 0: So I was hoping I could get on a city bike tonight to go to that Screening the animation thing and then I'd have the city bike for 24 hours.

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:03,150
Speaker 0: I would use it tomorrow to go to work and then to go to Chelsea to pick up my bike and then drive my real Bike home, but I don't think that's gonna happen cuz it ain't just raining it is fucking rain.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,212
Speaker 1: Well, it stopped but yeah It was.

14
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:19,208
Speaker 1: uh, I was sitting in a meeting at work and then it starts like super raining like boom boom boom Like I very rarely in my life seen rain this persistent and hard in the United States.

15
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:19,368
Speaker 0: the

16
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:41,874
Speaker 1: time it rained The most is in between freshman and sophomore year of college when I was working in a summer camp And at one time I was driving to or from the camp Alone on the highway in Massachusetts like in the Berkshires somewhere Yeah And it rained so hard that with the wipers on the maximum setting and they were good wipers and there's nothing, you know, whatever I Couldn't see shit.

17
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:44,764
Speaker 1: It was just a blur like I had rims eyeballs.

18
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,490
Speaker 1: I couldn't see nothing.

19
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:50,190
Speaker 1: I just pulled over to the side of the road and put the lights on and waited till I could see again.

20
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:54,269
Speaker 0: So I think see I've experienced like you a few times in my life in the u.s.

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,830
Speaker 0: But I spent a lot of time in like Singapore and Hong Kong and parts of Asia.

22
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,996
Speaker 0: This is Singapore rain.

23
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:03,590
Speaker 0: Like this is what it rains like during the rainy season in Singapore.

24
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,527
Speaker 1: It's a lot of fun if you you know don't get caught in it and you're inside and you get caught You know and you don't want a bike to work.

25
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,310
Speaker 0: I mean I was out in it when it started raining really hard again.

26
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,444
Speaker 1: I luckily came from work to here in between to rain.

27
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,110
Speaker 0: I stopped at the grocery store.

28
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,430
Speaker 0: So I'm walking back from the grocery store and eggs are made.

29
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:25,290
Speaker 0: I don't have my umbrella out and It's just like on my back and I feel like one or two drops of rain in my head.

30
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,270
Speaker 0: I think well might as well open up this umbrella.

31
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,203
Speaker 0: Just let me open up the umbrella and then just as I get it open.

32
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:36,039
Speaker 0: It was like a wall of water Simultaneously hit the ground.

33
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,570
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

34
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:41,847
Speaker 0: I watched two cars hit each other like right outside the apartment in the rain on the way in.

35
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:47,909
Speaker 0: don't drive Yeah, and a T and a taxi driver tried to turn illegally onto the bridge.

36
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,735
Speaker 1: Okay, why I was crossing?

37
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:50,960
Speaker 0: so I just stood there.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,364
Speaker 1: only bus can turn they there.

39
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:53,749
Speaker 0: and so I was crossing.

40
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:58,690
Speaker 0: So I just stood there and he couldn't get past me and he rolled down his window to try to yell at me.

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:05,501
Speaker 0: And then the rain started going into his window and he like rolled it up and then he rolled it down a little bit to Try to yell at me and then I was bored.

42
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:05,943
Speaker 0: So I left.

43
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,029
Speaker 0: that was the end of that.

44
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:14,870
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's no news cuz we're not gonna talk about the coming hopefully not actual war with Iran that we shouldn't be doing.

45
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,382
Speaker 0: It's too depressing.

46
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:30,386
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about something similarly depressing painful pages, but first it's time for Things of the day.

47
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:34,200
Speaker 0: So, you know, you watch a speedrun of like especially Zelda games.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,910
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's a SGD Q. is this Sunday?

49
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm hyped for this.

50
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:48,614
Speaker 0: Hi, but This channel terminal montage, one of the things that they seem to do is they make little cute animations You know like that car bot level of animation like those old Starcraft animations.

51
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,520
Speaker 0: It's like that kind of like simple animation.

52
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,890
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about, but okay.

53
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,160
Speaker 0: Remember the little like the cute zergs?

54
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like the little lumpy spanny?

55
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,053
Speaker 0: Wow, really?

56
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:58,540
Speaker 1: I mean I might have you showed it to me.

57
00:03:58,741 --> 00:03:59,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll show it to you later.

58
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:05,520
Speaker 0: So it's similar like cute little ink doing his thing But basically they animate in a jokey way.

59
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:10,172
Speaker 0: What a breath of the wild speedrun like a real one actually looks like.

60
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:16,700
Speaker 0: so it has all the things that happen in a real Speedrun, but animated in a pretty funny way.

61
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:21,700
Speaker 0: Okay, it's a better way to watch a Zelda speedrun than actually watching the speedrun.

62
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,748
Speaker 0: Okay, so what do you got?

63
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,620
Speaker 1: I have for you a man named Jimmy Smith?

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,385
Speaker 1: Jimmy Smith is an amateur boxer.

65
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,956
Speaker 1: his record as an amateur boxer is three, you know, he's a bad.

66
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 1: he's up against another gentleman.

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,369
Speaker 1: I don't know the name of it would be glass Joe.

68
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,217
Speaker 0: He beat the Kaiser, right?

69
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:41,719
Speaker 1: You know, whatever He's up against another gentleman in this heavyweight bout.

70
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,720
Speaker 1: The ring has an advertisement on it for a Schlitz malt liquor.

71
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,219
Speaker 1: Which is me?

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,681
Speaker 1: I don't know.

73
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,949
Speaker 1: rim says probably one of the worst forties you can drink.

74
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:55,180
Speaker 0: Schlitz is one of those beers that well quote-unquote.

75
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,724
Speaker 1: It's a 40.

76
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:04,887
Speaker 0: It's one of those beverages that came out of the fact America had to rebuild its beverage industry from Scratch after prohibition.

77
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:07,740
Speaker 1: Anyway, the title of the video is Jimmy Smith the worst boxer ever.

78
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:16,060
Speaker 1: So Jimmy Smith goes up against this other boxer who is not the champion or anything But clearly has had professional bouts and lived to box again.

79
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,455
Speaker 1: And here they are in a heavyweight bout.

80
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:25,120
Speaker 1: keep in mind Jimmy Smith weighs like 16 something pounds less than the other guy and is like a few inches shorter and has less reach.

81
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,353
Speaker 0: But he's undefeated.

82
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:34,540
Speaker 1: Yeah But none of that matters because you once you see Jimmy Smith fight you will know everything you need to know.

83
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,220
Speaker 1: It's one of those things that really fascinates me.

84
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,324
Speaker 1: I wish there was like a word.

85
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:42,786
Speaker 1: there probably is a German word for it where it has to be where it's like you don't Know shit about something right?

86
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:43,549
Speaker 1: It's like I don't know any.

87
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,416
Speaker 1: I could not be a graphic designer.

88
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:53,973
Speaker 1: For example, no way I can't even draw but if I look at graphic design Right, I can still tell for the most part right?

89
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,700
Speaker 1: Obviously I wouldn't get details, right?

90
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:01,096
Speaker 1: Right, but there's no accounting for taste right but for the most part I can tell that's good.

91
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,460
Speaker 1: That's comic sans, right?

92
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,333
Speaker 1: I don't need to know anything to know that's good.

93
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,300
Speaker 1: That's bad, right?

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,060
Speaker 1: It's like in the same way if you know nothing about boxing you never watched a boxing match in your life.

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,831
Speaker 1: Maybe those people would despise this boxing for mostly rightfully.

96
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:16,240
Speaker 1: So but you know, it's okay to watch old boxing.

97
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:18,954
Speaker 1: I just think we should stop having any more boxing now that we know better.

98
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,181
Speaker 0: see also hockey fights Like.

99
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:28,124
Speaker 0: I get excited watching a 90s hockey fight But I don't ever want to actually see a fight like that in a modern hockey game right regardless We have this old.

100
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:30,535
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is I kind of do but I also don't.

101
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:42,317
Speaker 1: anyway happens I get excited when you watch this fight, even if you know nothing about boxing, you know Even if it wasn't the title of the video you can tell if you are not is the worst boxer ever.

102
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:47,953
Speaker 1: if you were not Human technically a professional because he was in this professional fight being paid to fight.

103
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:56,210
Speaker 0: if you are not a human and you stumbled Upon this video with Jimmy Smith win his three amateur bouts I would love to see what those look like.

104
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,820
Speaker 0: is the other guy doing the same elbow thing that he's doing?

105
00:06:59,101 --> 00:06:59,463
Speaker 1: I don't know.

106
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,974
Speaker 1: The point is watch this and it is amazing.

107
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:02,597
Speaker 0: You watch it.

108
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,240
Speaker 0: She's like buddy.

109
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,391
Speaker 0: That's not where your elbows go.

110
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:11,756
Speaker 1: when you're very funny You're about to get punched in the elbow and therefore it is thing of the day level.

111
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:15,079
Speaker 0: It's It's only a minute and 36 seconds long.

112
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:18,299
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm All right.

113
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,996
Speaker 0: So the context of this as we've talked about a bunch is that there was an.

114
00:07:22,077 --> 00:07:25,771
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I Played Dungeons & Dragons and in Dungeons & Dragons.

115
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,600
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was ever a first edition thing.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,309
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure was the second edition thing mostly right.

117
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:49,192
Speaker 1: there was a. there was a play setting for D&D That was official called Planescape and the idea of the setting was one in which the players Would have lots of access to portals that go between different planes to have a wild and crazy Experience and all sorts of different universes really easily.

118
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:54,568
Speaker 1: and there was one central base of operations Which was a city that we argue over.

119
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:55,370
Speaker 1: the pronunciation

120
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,303
Speaker 0: of the canonical pronunciation, which is stupid is Sigil,

121
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:07,151
Speaker 1: but it is written exactly what the way you would write the word Sigil as in the word Sigil, you know,

122
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,379
Speaker 0: it's funny because when I was playing Dungeons & Dragons

123
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:10,844
Speaker 1: Sigil

124
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:11,614
Speaker 0: like in the 90s

125
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:14,082
Speaker 1: No

126
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:17,840
Speaker 0: one actually knew how any of these things were pronounced because you just pronounced it.

127
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,179
Speaker 0: However, everyone around you pronounced it.

128
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:33,580
Speaker 0: So when I like D&D was a topic on the radio or the TV you would only read about it in Dragon magazine or books Right or you'd meet something like you'd only say the words from Dungeons & Dragons out loud if you were playing Dungeons & Dragons.

129
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,760
Speaker 1: But it kind of makes sense for the word Sigil to be the name of the city, right?

130
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,500
Speaker 1: It's like I inscribed my Sigil upon the wall or something, you know, it's like, you know, you have a Sigil.

131
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,226
Speaker 0: I don't think that really makes sense.

132
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:43,808
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:44,490
Speaker 1: Yes.

134
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,253
Speaker 1: Sigil is like.

135
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:52,200
Speaker 0: it's like a symbol right arcane symbol Yeah, but what would that have to do with the city a city in like some planes somewhere?

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,311
Speaker 1: It's it's a roughly fantasy ish word.

137
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,059
Speaker 1: You wouldn't use the word Sigil in everyday life.

138
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:03,425
Speaker 1: Nah, you don't use it in a D&D fantasy book, but it's a fantasy ish word You mean in real life.

139
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:06,480
Speaker 1: you might use the word rune maybe but even that's a fantasy word.

140
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:10,900
Speaker 0: But case in point I pronounced it dro and I pronounced it so I said drow.

141
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:15,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was random whether or not you knew the right pronunciation unless you like meant just cuz.

142
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:16,940
Speaker 1: dro sounds stupid.

143
00:09:17,362 --> 00:09:21,644
Speaker 0: I think dro sounds better than drow drow drow drow.

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:32,598
Speaker 0: But it's the way it's spelled phonics kid D R O W drow drow drow drow anyway Sigil Sigil.

145
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:40,380
Speaker 0: So the difference in experience between me and Scott is that I had read all the planescape source material before this novel.

146
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,599
Speaker 1: I have never read any planescape material even to this day except this book.

147
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:47,520
Speaker 0: So Scott before we get into what I'm curious about is what do you like?

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,340
Speaker 0: What do you think or what did you think like that sword lady was before you read this book?

149
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,680
Speaker 1: Before I only knew things about D&D Right about these settings that I learned from osmosis hanging around nerds.

150
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,386
Speaker 1: Yeah Who talked about these things or taught me about these things or told me about their character like this is how I know Dark Sun cuz.

151
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,740
Speaker 0: I never played Dark Sun games until way later.

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,260
Speaker 0: So in middle school, I would hear about Dark Sun from the cool kids me play like one Dark Sun session.

153
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,020
Speaker 0: I played a couple of Dark Sun Sun sessions in high school.

154
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,916
Speaker 1: I mean I never even heard of it till we got to RIT and I think we played it once and

155
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:22,660
Speaker 0: played it because you were the

156
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:28,319
Speaker 1: Play like one session and I think all I heard is other people talk about it and say yeah This is what Dark Sun is all about.

157
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,188
Speaker 1: I didn't ever read a Dark Sun book.

158
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:32,960
Speaker 0: pretty sure Dark Sun is not canonically connected to planescape.

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,227
Speaker 0: Like you can't get there from here regardless.

160
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,457
Speaker 1: I did play planescape torment, but it was such.

161
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:40,905
Speaker 1: a. People love that game.

162
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:44,036
Speaker 1: I know but it was such a annoying game for me to play.

163
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:46,987
Speaker 1: just like, you know I met the gold box games.

164
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I so I ended up.

165
00:10:49,575 --> 00:11:04,132
Speaker 1: actually when I was younger There was some other PC games I played on DOS and they would before while the games were loading or installing they would show you like a video trailer for planescape Torment because it was like made by the same publisher company or whatever.

166
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:13,599
Speaker 1: Anyway, I actually played the game later in life And I didn't really absorb too much of the lore because I was just sort of reading a fact to get through it.

167
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never would have gotten like Baldur's Gate.

168
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,440
Speaker 1: I got through like to the town and that was it.

169
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:21,779
Speaker 1: I can't really get very far in those games.

170
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 1: So the only reason I even beat it was from cheating and I didn't learn too much from cheating.

171
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,427
Speaker 1: I didn't read a lot of the lores and stuff.

172
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:33,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the deal is I only know what I absorbed from other people talking Like yeah, there's a city.

173
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,513
Speaker 1: It's got a bunch of portals to other planes.

174
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,560
Speaker 1: It's the center of the multiverse.

175
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,647
Speaker 1: There's some lady there who's made of swords.

176
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,618
Speaker 1: You've seen pictures of her everywhere because you've been in a game store before.

177
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:47,914
Speaker 1: Yeah She comes if she's mad at you in the city and kills you.

178
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,080
Speaker 1: She's the lady of pain.

179
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:50,486
Speaker 1: She runs the show there.

180
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:51,933
Speaker 1: She's all mysterious and shit.

181
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:53,440
Speaker 1: She's a terrible seeker to space.

182
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:56,198
Speaker 1: So here's something about God's not coming there.

183
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,814
Speaker 1: and yeah If you pray to her she gets mad because then she would become a god and that would be bad.

184
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:03,249
Speaker 0: because the context it's bad To be a god there the context you wouldn't have.

185
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,203
Speaker 0: that came up a lot in the book is a few specific Planescape things.

186
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:12,840
Speaker 0: number one is that in Planescape like it's different from the prime material planes.

187
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,466
Speaker 0: Like people there are just different.

188
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:21,960
Speaker 0: like if you're on a prime material plane like I got it around and you just die Your soul just goes straight to the plane of whatever God you worship.

189
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:26,279
Speaker 0: Planescape fuck you now what like gods aren't gonna help you you're out.

190
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,368
Speaker 0: It's like being in a city versus being in like the provinces.

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,411
Speaker 0: number two.

192
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaker 0: The other weird thing is that there are these factions.

193
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:36,180
Speaker 0: It's like a big part of the original Planescape setting.

194
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:46,399
Speaker 0: I got a vague hint of that in Planescape 2 because every character except the Thrasin were Earthration or however the amnesian hero Theseus maybe.

195
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:57,120
Speaker 0: Every one of them is basically in one of these factions like Tesali the elf the Barrier like the goat centaur who believes that he's the center of the universe.

196
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:08,445
Speaker 0: Every one of them is like in one of these factions and in the game world The factions are like something characters join and it's part of the plot and they're all very simplistic Philosophy nonsense things like.

197
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:16,730
Speaker 0: one of them is a faction of hedonists and the leader is of course Yeah, exactly The leader that's for me.

198
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,373
Speaker 1: give me the grapes.

199
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:21,405
Speaker 0: the leader of that faction Is a my lounging chair.

200
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:24,093
Speaker 0: It's a woman who is a werecat because cat girl.

201
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:25,757
Speaker 1: Oh, baby.

202
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:28,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, sign me up I already chose.

203
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,139
Speaker 1: I don't need to hear the other options.

204
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:35,240
Speaker 0: You are objectively correct because you've the ones you encountered in this fucking book that you're all garbage compared to the one you just described.

205
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:39,080
Speaker 0: Let's see this one awesome cat girl pleasure forever.

206
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:43,319
Speaker 0: Awesome, the dustman everything sucks and we're all gonna die.

207
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,471
Speaker 0: Yeah I am literally the center of the universe next.

208
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:48,792
Speaker 1: next.

209
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:49,194
Speaker 1: Yes.

210
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:50,739
Speaker 0: They're all dumb like that.

211
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, those guards in the big those are another faction.

212
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,535
Speaker 1: Nope, not better than cat lady.

213
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:56,920
Speaker 0: None of them are good news.

214
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,588
Speaker 1: No, the cat lady's the only good one.

215
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,980
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, there's literally the only good one.

216
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,482
Speaker 1: So that brings up.

217
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:08,939
Speaker 1: the first point about this book that I want to make is that you don't need To know any D&D stuff to read this book.

218
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:20,560
Speaker 1: But it really sure helps because they basically just assume you know a lot of things Right proper noun wise which you know other fantasy novels with the proper nouns right like say Prince of Nothing.

219
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,467
Speaker 0: We love the Prince of Nothing.

220
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:32,786
Speaker 1: two words in it's all right But you know They lead you in and through Context and through reading you sort of begin to understand what the proper nouns mean and what's going on without having just being told to You right?

221
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:41,162
Speaker 1: However There is a lot of things that just go straight over your head because the book isn't that long and doesn't have that much Context.

222
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:46,160
Speaker 1: so you learn enough to understand what's happening in the book, but there is a greater context.

223
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:56,260
Speaker 1: I feel that's not necessary to understand the main story and its main characters But that will be missed if you are not steeped in the planescape lore and I probably missed more than half of

224
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:08,019
Speaker 0: it Yep, and the other part of that the context that's important is that Pages of Pain was kind of as far as I can tell was kind of written to try to introduce people to the setting because the setting had Only been out a couple of years.

225
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:26,901
Speaker 1: Okay Another thing is that even stuff that you could understand what was going on for example right at the beginning of the book he goes To wait in this line Yeah to go talk to someone at a window and you get the idea that like there's this bureaucracy in the city Right and has a thing going on and like I understood the deal basically Yeah,

226
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:27,663
Speaker 0: but I

227
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:32,936
Speaker 1: felt like if I was a planescape nerd I would be reading this right now

228
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:37,964
Speaker 0: like oh that's so-and-so Bullshit, right like oh, baby Because

229
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,551
Speaker 1: I hadn't read any planescape stuff.

230
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:40,595
Speaker 1: It was all right.

231
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:41,278
Speaker 1: I get it.

232
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,764
Speaker 1: There's some bureaucracy thing.

233
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:46,660
Speaker 1: you wait in a line and talk to someone and you can get stuff from because there's no government.

234
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 1: That's like a real government or it's definitely not democracy.

235
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:52,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a bureaucracy.

236
00:15:53,081 --> 00:16:00,537
Speaker 0: Generally the people we people play and run planescape at least in my experience is they tend to set it in Sigil as opposed to doing a lot of planes hopping.

237
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:04,592
Speaker 1: well I mean when you set it in Sigil you can planes hop easily.

238
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:08,323
Speaker 1: yep as we see in the book and Sigil is sort of like A mishmash.

239
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:12,737
Speaker 1: It's like if you started it and say I don't know the plane of fire, and you're immune to fire.

240
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:18,780
Speaker 1: I guess yeah Usually you'd be playing a fire is just like you make a portal to throw someone into fire.

241
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,931
Speaker 1: right right You can you set a game in some other plane.

242
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:25,339
Speaker 1: the idea would be it's like all right.

243
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:30,938
Speaker 1: well You had to leave the plane somehow which might not be so easy, but when you're in Sigil You can hop around a lot of playing.

244
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:31,843
Speaker 0: well That's what I'm getting.

245
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:34,333
Speaker 1: so it's like start your New York game in Grand Central.

246
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,321
Speaker 1: don't start your New York game in distant Brooklyn.

247
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:43,703
Speaker 0: Sigil is basically New York City of the multiverse because it's the center of the like Multiverses economy.

248
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:48,360
Speaker 1: right you start your New York game out in Long Island and there's one LIR station, and it's on a weekend.

249
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:51,555
Speaker 1: It's like the player characters getting to Manhattan is gonna be rough.

250
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,620
Speaker 1: you start in Grand Central.

251
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,059
Speaker 1: It's like yeah You could get out to Long Island pretty easily.

252
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,067
Speaker 0: Your analogy is better than you realize.

253
00:16:57,107 --> 00:17:01,412
Speaker 0: remember all those bits about the people falling in the river through the portal and the wine and All that in the beginning.

254
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:07,058
Speaker 0: kinda There's an idea of play of uh portal keys Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,451
Speaker 1: Well they got into that a little bit when they were in the tavern.

256
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,380
Speaker 0: that's a big deal in the planescape setting.

257
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:11,877
Speaker 0: What was that?

258
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,128
Speaker 0: You gotta have the key or the portal doesn't do shit.

259
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:16,238
Speaker 1: that was actually one of the scenes that made the most sense.

260
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:21,740
Speaker 1: was Tavern and basically the police equivalent is coming after them.

261
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,202
Speaker 0: I guess.

262
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,915
Speaker 0: well because the tavern is it serves illegal human meat.

263
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:32,760
Speaker 1: yes They need to hide so they go through a door in the back of the tavern which is and they do a special key thing.

264
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:41,040
Speaker 1: So actually when they go back there They actually go through a portal to some other like room somewhere a warehouse where they actually store this expensive wine and stuff, right?

265
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:53,913
Speaker 1: it's like it's like a portal to a warehouse in another plane and When the police come they go through the door in the back to the back room and they're just in a back room Because they didn't do the special thing to activate the portal the other plane.

266
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:56,020
Speaker 1: So that was pretty clever and fun.

267
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,057
Speaker 1: But then things develop from there.

268
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:01,545
Speaker 0: So what I remember?

269
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:06,999
Speaker 1: reading his book that was a very D&D thing like aha I escaped the guys by doing a clever You know, that's it.

270
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:13,916
Speaker 0: I remembered reading his book and it was Standard D&D book for like the first fifth and then it went way off the rails and got surreal.

271
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:17,660
Speaker 0: and that's why I remembered it Why I liked it why I felt this weird need to read it again.

272
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:23,180
Speaker 0: And that first bit was very typical D&D nonsense like every Forgotten Realms book has that kind of clever shit.

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,988
Speaker 1: Well, it also had some kind of core.

274
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,636
Speaker 1: The character's name is Jake the snake.

275
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:34,782
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god I'll totally watch a dumb guy in your party names their character, but that's kind of on brand for the faction She's in.

276
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:36,408
Speaker 0: okay, they're all.

277
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:36,910
Speaker 1: I guess.

278
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,552
Speaker 1: then that is.

279
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:42,126
Speaker 1: I guess you couldn't blame the author of this book But instead the author of the setting for D&D.

280
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:42,607
Speaker 1: shit in.

281
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:47,380
Speaker 0: yeah, like imagine that faction is literally just reaper from overwatch.

282
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,620
Speaker 0: They're all just like edgelord pieces of shit.

283
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,586
Speaker 1: So your edgelord friend who you let in the game and didn't kick out for whatever reason is always gonna pick that Always gonna pick that.

284
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,472
Speaker 1: why aren't they picking the cat lady faction?

285
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:57,994
Speaker 1: That's how you know.

286
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,923
Speaker 1: if basically here's what you do Planescape game.

287
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,892
Speaker 1: you were you list all the factions list the cat lady one last.

288
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:09,086
Speaker 1: anyone who doesn't pick the cat lady one Just kick him out of the game.

289
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:14,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're no good because you know if they ever get into a real multiverse situation They're gonna make poor decisions.

290
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:15,499
Speaker 0: That's right.

291
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:22,940
Speaker 0: So but yeah like normal D&D stuff like that just happens with really stereotypical plot and everything and then it goes way off the rails.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,899
Speaker 1: The characters act like PCs act in a D&D game of Teenage Nerd sitting around a table.

293
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,445
Speaker 0: Yep I look around the corner.

294
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:30,991
Speaker 0: former make our formation.

295
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:33,180
Speaker 0: We're doing a trick like let's do a thing, right?

296
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:41,206
Speaker 0: But before we get into the crazy stuff that beginning bit one thing I noticed is that when I played Planescape and when most people Would run Planescape they tend to run.

297
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:49,273
Speaker 0: Sigil is like a Perdido Street station kind of like really dirty Dismal like people are knifed in the back alley.

298
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,660
Speaker 1: looks like in Planescape Dormant.

299
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,478
Speaker 0: Yeah And that's how people tend to play it.

300
00:19:52,921 --> 00:20:01,740
Speaker 0: But this book takes it to like and this book does not at any point give you a view Into any part of Sigil that's even remotely livable or nice.

301
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,769
Speaker 0: No, it's just awful awful awful.

302
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,888
Speaker 1: every single person you talk to on the street is like Violence.

303
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:08,652
Speaker 1: you yeah.

304
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,100
Speaker 1: Oh you're talking to me.

305
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,314
Speaker 1: I assume you would like some violence or some thieving.

306
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:14,760
Speaker 1: at least he bumps into that one guy.

307
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,545
Speaker 0: It's like pulls out a knife instantly.

308
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:17,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

309
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, but is it?

310
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:28,160
Speaker 0: I don't want to give Troy Denning that much credit here But is it that they described Sigil in this like horrific way?

311
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,512
Speaker 0: Because this book kind of has a lot of horrific themes?

312
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:36,300
Speaker 0: or that's how they viewed Sigil as opposed to like someone who read the setting book and might take a more nuanced approach to it?

313
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:42,680
Speaker 0: Or is that what Sigil looks like to the narrator the lady of pain herself?

314
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,619
Speaker 0: Who cannot perceive anything but pain?

315
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,962
Speaker 0: Because she only experiences the painful parts of Sigil Mm-hmm And that's like.

316
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:58,860
Speaker 0: that's that like that allegorical storytelling is there and I feel like it was on purpose Coupled with the fact that the other way to look at it is the Thrasin.

317
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:09,905
Speaker 0: He comes from a nice place upstate So he gets into this dirty city and is afraid of it and everything's not nearly as bad as he is acting like it is Because he just doesn't understand.

318
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,693
Speaker 0: like you it smells like pee and people have knives.

319
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:14,419
Speaker 0: They're trying to see he's also.

320
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:20,154
Speaker 1: really It's sort of a thing where on the one hand the story is about the Thrasin.

321
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:21,257
Speaker 1: Who is he?

322
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:22,280
Speaker 1: What's his deal?

323
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,111
Speaker 1: How'd he get here all this mystery?

324
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:27,180
Speaker 0: as a nerd as a kid I didn't give a shit.

325
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,120
Speaker 0: I just wanted to know is this gonna tell me what the lady of pain is, right?

326
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,763
Speaker 1: That was also.

327
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,558
Speaker 1: that's the real secret of space kind of does sort of.

328
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:46,397
Speaker 1: But on the same time by having this main character be it's sort of a trope right where the main character has amnesia They're learning everything just like you are reader, right, you know about Sigil in the war.

329
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:47,220
Speaker 1: They've never been here.

330
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:47,959
Speaker 1: They don't know what's up.

331
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,500
Speaker 1: You're learning along with them.

332
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:58,734
Speaker 1: So by combining that trope with also the story being about the character recovering the memory it sort of Overcomes the cliche in a way.

333
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:07,559
Speaker 0: Yeah Right to a degree it works and I like how because basically there is a plane that is just ancient Greece with Greek gods Of course.

334
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,563
Speaker 1: So it just makes sense.

335
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:14,960
Speaker 0: and he is clearly just like a Theseus like figure like he's just a Greek hero and Zeus.

336
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,451
Speaker 0: Zeus and Poseidon were like literally there.

337
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:26,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, Poseidon literally gave him a mission and If you don't know anything about Greek mythology, he remembers that.

338
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,260
Speaker 0: yeah only thing you remember that we'll get into that.

339
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:29,965
Speaker 0: That's.

340
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:31,679
Speaker 0: that's a very important point about this book.

341
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,124
Speaker 0: What is a memory?

342
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:35,230
Speaker 0: but which is it like?

343
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:41,519
Speaker 0: it treats memories the way a lot of good sci-fi books treat memories a free market Almost literally.

344
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:43,946
Speaker 0: but Imagine we're like.

345
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,500
Speaker 0: we already talked about reading this book.

346
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:56,780
Speaker 0: If you don't know anything about Planescape imagine some basic person who likes D&D and reads this book, but doesn't know anything about Greek mythology Like it kind of is important to understand Poseidon's deal.

347
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,747
Speaker 1: You at least need to know the main.

348
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:04,337
Speaker 1: you at least need to know basic characters and like, you know Poseidon Yeah is kind of a dick.

349
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:06,945
Speaker 0: He's a Don't drown me, right?

350
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,529
Speaker 1: You need to know at least that much.

351
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,252
Speaker 1: maybe a little more.

352
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,020
Speaker 0: don't worship Poseidon, but you gotta respect Poseidon.

353
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:18,296
Speaker 0: Also Egyptian gods cuz I guess sure that's how Planescape works.

354
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:20,445
Speaker 1: Greek and Egypt pretty tight Yeah, Poseidon.

355
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:26,540
Speaker 0: and I guess set just make a deal to sell off a woman into slavery And or marriage maybe the same thing.

356
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,970
Speaker 0: So, yeah that that all starts like standard D&D plot.

357
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,700
Speaker 0: and then the Dabu's which you know about if you read the source books.

358
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:43,927
Speaker 1: So this is the part where I think the book's biggest flaw is but also maybe Intentional but still in my opinion bad.

359
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:50,880
Speaker 1: Is that as As you read the book even in the beginning parts, but especially once the Dabus show up, right?

360
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,003
Speaker 1: That's where it goes off the rails.

361
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:58,300
Speaker 1: Yep in many ways, but any individual scene you can understand what's happening.

362
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:03,072
Speaker 0: Right, like like he is waiting in line and arguing and that breaks that guy's arm.

363
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:16,257
Speaker 1: the transitions from literally every Scene to every other scene are basically instantaneous Like a Complete jump cut in some movie from one place to another place across the universe.

364
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:22,309
Speaker 0: at one point evening It's lampshaded like he runs away with Jake the snake and then it has a little paragraph.

365
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,305
Speaker 0: That's like After a whole bunch of bullshit.

366
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:27,209
Speaker 0: they ended up in this alley, right?

367
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:30,386
Speaker 1: It's like Sentence almost doesn't even exist, right?

368
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,510
Speaker 1: It's like one sentence.

369
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,040
Speaker 1: They leave that the tavern I was just talking about, right?

370
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,000
Speaker 1: They were dudes that deal with the portal in the back and writing right and then suddenly they're like outside.

371
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:43,297
Speaker 1: I don't know how the hell they got outside, but I guess the deal was over there.

372
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:48,120
Speaker 1: outside There was some Dabus building a wall for a maze nearby on the street.

373
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:52,056
Speaker 1: Some other stuff happens and then they're just in the maze.

374
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:52,980
Speaker 1: It's like what what the fuck?

375
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,448
Speaker 1: It's like how the fuck did that, you know.

376
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:55,352
Speaker 0: now that's another.

377
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,970
Speaker 0: if you knew how Dabus work They're basically like the minions of the Lady of Pain.

378
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,974
Speaker 1: I understood that much.

379
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:00,175
Speaker 1: They

380
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:01,320
Speaker 0: don't talk out loud

381
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:02,325
Speaker 1: really

382
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:18,237
Speaker 0: make like rebuses and symbols appear around them and You can interpret what they're trying to tell you by looking at all these symbols floating around their heads and all they do is if you fuck with them they kill you and Otherwise, they just build walls around you and if they build a wall around you you're in the mazes,

383
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:18,920
Speaker 1: right?

384
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,646
Speaker 1: but it's like the the the.

385
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:29,680
Speaker 1: the text was written in such a way that it's not like The rocks were encircling them and they tried to climb over and the Dabu pushed them.

386
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were.

387
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:32,573
Speaker 1: it was just like oh, there's some Dabus.

388
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:33,839
Speaker 1: We're in a maze.

389
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:34,140
Speaker 1: What?

390
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:41,980
Speaker 1: It's like there was no smooth transition showing how Things got from this scene to the next scene.

391
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:52,737
Speaker 1: So on one hand anywhere any scene change in the whole book was just instant until they're in the very and basically So you spent the first portion of any scene trying to figure out what the fuck just happened.

392
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:53,680
Speaker 1: Where are they now?

393
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,503
Speaker 1: What is going on?

394
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:58,056
Speaker 1: Because like you could tell like what we're not in this past scene anymore.

395
00:25:58,096 --> 00:25:58,799
Speaker 1: We're somewhere else.

396
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,349
Speaker 1: now What is happening?

397
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,620
Speaker 1: as I was constantly?

398
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:09,046
Speaker 1: Reorienting myself which in a way is thematic like if I was getting pushed through a bunch of portals to different planes constantly But they're not.

399
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,575
Speaker 1: this is almost entirely in sigil.

400
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:18,863
Speaker 0: Yeah But in terms of that bit like I feel like some of those missing scenes might have been Missing.

401
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:19,185
Speaker 1: it's not.

402
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,496
Speaker 1: missing scenes is just well, there are no transitions.

403
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:30,263
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of missing scenes that are sort of like skipped over where I wonder if he had written a longer book and they Dude Dude,

404
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:33,130
Speaker 1: I also wonder how much of this corny stuff is

405
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:34,072
Speaker 0: the right

406
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:39,879
Speaker 1: author's fault or the fault of sticking to the source material Of the settings like you just talked about Jake the snake.

407
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:45,540
Speaker 0: Well, I get one point and it it matters a lot for such a weird Dungeons and Dragons.

408
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,420
Speaker 0: He's seen he's in a random ass alley and he tries to jump over that puddle of mud.

409
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,852
Speaker 0: Then it tries to pull him in and turn him into goo.

410
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:54,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's very D&D.

411
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:55,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is so.

412
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:55,425
Speaker 0: there's.

413
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:58,340
Speaker 0: there's the four elemental planes fire water earth air.

414
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:02,875
Speaker 0: There's also two other planes the positive energy plane and the negative energy plane.

415
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:04,240
Speaker 1: Well slime princess and hotdog princess.

416
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:15,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's that exact kind of like specific cosmology but like if you guessed a healing spell in regular D&D you're channeling energy from the positive plane and Necromancers channel from the negative plane.

417
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:25,939
Speaker 0: So where those four elemental planes intersect with each other They make these like para elemental planes like water and earth together form the para elemental plane of ooze.

418
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:30,869
Speaker 0: It's the border between the two Water and they're all next to each other.

419
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,940
Speaker 0: They're all next to each other in this multi-dimensional thing.

420
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,414
Speaker 0: I know more about this than I should feel like air Next to the positive elemental or the positive energy plane.

421
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:40,800
Speaker 0: I think it makes like the plane of lightning.

422
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:53,197
Speaker 0: Ooh, if I recall correctly and next to the negative plane the negative energy plane makes the plane of vacuum which is not the same vacuum that spell jammers fly through.

423
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,559
Speaker 0: Spell jammers don't really fit into this kind of cosmology directly.

424
00:27:58,163 --> 00:27:58,967
Speaker 0: You can make it work.

425
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,743
Speaker 0: So that is such D&D like Bullshit.

426
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:16,019
Speaker 0: Yep, but and it would have just been a throwaway scene except it matters like deeply for the rest of the book Yep, and it's it was weird that that was one of the transformative moments for this character.

427
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:26,212
Speaker 0: like it just stood out to me as being a strange way to make the Allegorical transformation of the character become a literal transformation of the character.

428
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:27,856
Speaker 0: and you can see how that.

429
00:28:28,297 --> 00:28:41,776
Speaker 0: and then when they cut the foot Off and they replace it with the hand and then to Solly's hands get cut off It's sort of making this meta point around how like when you're injured Physically you have a wound that you and everyone else can see.

430
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:47,260
Speaker 0: but when you're injured Spiritually or mentally you carry that pain and it's invisible.

431
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:51,519
Speaker 1: Anyone but you except for the lady of pain and the threats and eventually can see it.

432
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:54,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, the lady can see those husks.

433
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:58,903
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of colored husk pustules on your body and they can get popped I guess somehow.

434
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:00,267
Speaker 1: so there really hurts.

435
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:03,077
Speaker 0: there is consistency in the color of those pustules.

436
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:03,899
Speaker 1: I figured that out.

437
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:07,239
Speaker 0: Yeah I did not care enough to try to remember figure out.

438
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,136
Speaker 1: no I didn't figure out which ones were which but I did figure out that person has those colors.

439
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,240
Speaker 1: this person is those colors.

440
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,407
Speaker 1: They're kinds of pain.

441
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:15,775
Speaker 1: They're all flavors of pain.

442
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:22,160
Speaker 1: Yep, right It's like your pain comes from I don't know self-loathing and yours comes from fear of death fear of sun, right?

443
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,178
Speaker 0: Or you know existential crisis doubt anguish loss, etc.

444
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:30,813
Speaker 0: Whatever I did like how even car Fudd who is like the most badass.

445
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:32,820
Speaker 0: I am a demon I give no fucks.

446
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:37,580
Speaker 1: That's another example of a. I just want to bring that up as a sudden scene change.

447
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:38,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

448
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,980
Speaker 1: it wasn't just the fact that it was a sudden scene change.

449
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,430
Speaker 1: It was just like there's a demon guy here now.

450
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:47,026
Speaker 1: There was no foreshadowing of this demon guy It's just the threats.

451
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:50,824
Speaker 1: and went somewhere and there was a demon and he met him and said hi and now the demons.

452
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:52,332
Speaker 1: a major character who's there for the rest of the book.

453
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:55,593
Speaker 1: and it's just like No intro.

454
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,980
Speaker 1: No No, nothing to tell you that this is right.

455
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,096
Speaker 1: It's just you see someone meets and it's such a D&D thing walk into a tavern.

456
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:03,960
Speaker 1: There's an NPC.

457
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,247
Speaker 1: I'm looking for an NPC.

458
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:05,810
Speaker 1: There's one.

459
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:06,835
Speaker 1: talk to him now.

460
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:07,660
Speaker 1: They're in the party now.

461
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:18,608
Speaker 0: They're part of your plot, right, but it doesn't really make for great novel Yeah, but it works in a sense because he's like the only person who is in the mazes on purpose that's true, like he locked himself in there.

462
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:35,889
Speaker 0: and There's sort of this meta plot that ties so much into just like planescape nonsense that there's this idea in planescape that gods are basically collections of people who had similar ideas that formed into like a bigger being that has that same idea and mass.

463
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:43,417
Speaker 0: and Sigil is at the center of the multiverse on top of an infinitely tall spire and No gods can get there.

464
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:50,025
Speaker 0: and there's one God who's been climbing up that tower for billions of years trying to get to the top and he can't because it's infinitely tall.

465
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:50,426
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

466
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,533
Speaker 0: and If it truly is the godless center of the multiverse could be.

467
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:11,706
Speaker 0: but if it truly is the godless center of the multiverse and All meaning springs from belief then you get the impression that this demon guy Went there to try and figure out the meaning of the universe and/or take over the universe.

468
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:13,010
Speaker 1: He's making maps of everything.

469
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,519
Speaker 0: He's trying to map the center of the universe.

470
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,967
Speaker 1: He's very protective of his maps.

471
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:19,443
Speaker 1: Yep Like he's a lot of work until almost comically.

472
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,190
Speaker 0: so when he just skins the barrier later.

473
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:23,379
Speaker 1: And yeah, well, he says he didn't but he totally did.

474
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's a chaotic evil demon like Even more.

475
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:27,715
Speaker 0: what do you want?

476
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:28,598
Speaker 1: It's like you can't forget.

477
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:37,149
Speaker 0: He's an evil demon yet somehow he is like Literally the only character in this party making rational decisions at any point.

478
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:43,527
Speaker 1: He's kind of competent and powerful and has goals and while he lies has lost his memory.

479
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:45,835
Speaker 0: while he lies That's what demons do.

480
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:47,482
Speaker 0: He doesn't renege on his deals.

481
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:48,305
Speaker 1: He's.

482
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:49,932
Speaker 1: he made it like a blood pact I think he.

483
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:51,641
Speaker 1: I think he physically can't renege.

484
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:52,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

485
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:53,933
Speaker 1: That's all deal He's not.

486
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:56,210
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe if he just said the deal he could renege easily.

487
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,673
Speaker 1: But it's another.

488
00:31:56,713 --> 00:32:00,514
Speaker 0: one of those things were like if you know if you know D&D shit You know what a tanari is.

489
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:07,142
Speaker 0: and then he's like, ah, I smell a marilith like yeah, that's the snake ladies He wanted to quote-unquote.

490
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:08,429
Speaker 0: enter the frenzy.

491
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:18,190
Speaker 0: It's a steven pon far empty the granaries That was that was very D&D that.

492
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:24,850
Speaker 0: But Yeah, he's there trying to think where I was going with all that just these characters.

493
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:27,310
Speaker 0: He's the only competent interesting character.

494
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:31,962
Speaker 0: The main character is competent but makes stupid decisions because of the wine woman.

495
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,970
Speaker 0: Jake makes terrible decisions.

496
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,659
Speaker 0: Yep, that's why Jake was going to be locked up.

497
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,887
Speaker 0: She was probably locked up for good cause.

498
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:48,789
Speaker 1: Yeah Tassali actually is pretty reasonable like the elf guy is a reasonable intelligent You know person is just sort of on the wrong side of things a little bit.

499
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,337
Speaker 0: Well, he runs the asylum.

500
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:53,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and from his perspective Jake is crazy.

501
00:32:53,971 --> 00:33:00,497
Speaker 1: I mean at first you sort of feel at the beginning of the book you feel like he's just wrong and it's like an Evil guy who locks people up for no reason.

502
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then as the book goes on it's like oh that guy's rational.

503
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jake is crazy.

504
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:07,122
Speaker 0: Jake has clearly been going around just murdering people.

505
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:09,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you totally should listen to that guy.

506
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:13,810
Speaker 0: I feel like he might have been a little overzealous and trying to lock up the threson.

507
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:14,452
Speaker 1: Right.

508
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:20,501
Speaker 1: the threson clearly isn't crazy because you but we know the threson hasn't lost memory But it's obvious from their perspective.

509
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:22,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the threson is crazy.

510
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, for knowing what Dane, you know because at the start of the book I didn't know what they knew.

511
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:35,075
Speaker 1: but then once you know what they know Yeah, as you learn more about what you know It's like if I knew what I knew at the beginning of the book I would also think this guy was crazy.

512
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:41,123
Speaker 0: like imagine if some someone from upstate New York came to New York City and Wandered around the street asking random people.

513
00:33:41,243 --> 00:33:42,109
Speaker 0: I need to see the mayor.

514
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,313
Speaker 0: Take me to the mayor.

515
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:48,732
Speaker 0: in a universe where the mayor kills anyone who talks to them Right.

516
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:49,418
Speaker 0: I saw a dragon.

517
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,244
Speaker 0: And this is known.

518
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,955
Speaker 0: Yep Like literally everyone knows.

519
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:56,729
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if you run into de Blasio, he fucking stabs you like that.

520
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,054
Speaker 0: That's just common knowledge.

521
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,519
Speaker 0: Like it's on the news every night.

522
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,587
Speaker 0: How many people did de Blasio stab today?

523
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:05,700
Speaker 0: Yeah So that also kind of works.

524
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,154
Speaker 1: so to say his name three times he appears And he's pissed.

525
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:10,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, be quiet bro.

526
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:10,859
Speaker 0: Yup.

527
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,304
Speaker 1: Go away from this guy.

528
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:13,989
Speaker 0: And then you got this jerk comes to town.

529
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,054
Speaker 0: He's like yo dog.

530
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:19,998
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep saying his name like in your house like oh good god Run away, please arrest this nut job.

531
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:20,601
Speaker 1: Put him somewhere.

532
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:21,083
Speaker 1: We're safe.

533
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 0: Yep, so Is he really Theseus?

534
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,850
Speaker 1: I don't think it matters.

535
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:36,429
Speaker 1: What I think does matter is that they suggest that he's Theseus and his body Memories and physical body are the ship of Theseus.

536
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,290
Speaker 0: I see what you did there that that works.

537
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,429
Speaker 1: That's all that matters right because he could be just a dude for all you know, it doesn't fucking matter.

538
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,413
Speaker 1: There's no way to know.

539
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:51,010
Speaker 0: he replaces his memories with new memories bit by bit and then to drive the point home.

540
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,389
Speaker 0: It's easy body parts bit by bit, right?

541
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,878
Speaker 1: He replaces his memories with the memories of Theseus.

542
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,725
Speaker 1: Does that make him Theseus?

543
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:03,942
Speaker 1: He replaces his Leg with a but I guess does that is he still Theseus?

544
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:04,845
Speaker 1: doesn't have these?

545
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,190
Speaker 0: is he still the amnesian hero?

546
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,210
Speaker 0: Is he still the Thrasin which it almost like it excuses the fact that the book keeps calling him by different names?

547
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:19,270
Speaker 0: Depending on the perspective even within the same paragraph, but then at the end like that actually really does make allegorical sense.

548
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:22,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the writing wise prose wise.

549
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,490
Speaker 1: it was on purpose prose wise.

550
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,420
Speaker 1: It was annoying that there was just this pattern of.

551
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,966
Speaker 1: you got two names for him.

552
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:30,352
Speaker 1: alternate between the two All right.

553
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:31,625
Speaker 1: Now we got three names for him.

554
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:49,650
Speaker 1: zoom B. We're gonna alternate between the three names right just to mix up the text a little bit right and did not just keep saying Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin Thrasin right, they just made more names for him and kept cycling through them like, you know Like a like a like a pattern on the American flag red white red white red.

555
00:35:49,690 --> 00:36:02,314
Speaker 0: I'll admit the writing of that could have been a lot more elegant But I think it was on purpose and the craft was Okay in the sense that the name used because it's not just the name he used for himself was the you know Amnesian hero.

556
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:06,810
Speaker 0: I am the amnesian hero because that was the identity made from set for himself from his own memories.

557
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:15,746
Speaker 0: but then every other character he interacts with has their own memories of him and has their own perception of him and Give it a different name because those are all very different people.

558
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:16,108
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

559
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:19,766
Speaker 0: But that theme is explored in a lot especially the barrier.

560
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:24,579
Speaker 0: Yeah That barrier is just like dude.

561
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,764
Speaker 0: really yeah, he deserved to get.

562
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:29,150
Speaker 1: yeah, not really he wasn't bad he was just dumb.

563
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:32,121
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that faction is dumb.

564
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:40,024
Speaker 0: no, yeah, cuz it's not the cat lady fact, yeah Can't have more than one person in that faction in the same party.

565
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,068
Speaker 0: guys, that's true.

566
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:48,590
Speaker 0: He was alone to their credit, yeah, I probably because his friends were like listen and just threw him over the wall.

567
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,674
Speaker 0: Also, I love how not only was he kind of dumb, but he really fucked everything up by picking up the other end of that Thread.

568
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:56,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, really?

569
00:36:56,907 --> 00:37:05,590
Speaker 0: Yeah But Otherwise like the naming of the character really does fit the theme and I think you're right.

570
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:12,570
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if he's Theseus But I will say that a lot of sci-fi books have handled the concept of what is a person?

571
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:13,873
Speaker 0: What is a memory?

572
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:17,270
Speaker 0: do memories make you much better than this with much more elegance?

573
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it does handle him in a pretty good way.

574
00:37:20,432 --> 00:37:24,389
Speaker 0: And if you'd never read one of those other books, this is that's a. it's kind of like people who?

575
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:27,359
Speaker 0: Encountered philosophy from the matrix for the first time.

576
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:33,896
Speaker 0: Mmm, like yeah like welcome to the party But I'm glad you have at least come to the table now With you.

577
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:35,686
Speaker 0: you've learned about shadows on the wall.

578
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:36,410
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

579
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:44,610
Speaker 1: It's always hilarious just to see like in all aspects of you know, I guess intellectual philosophical thought especially on the internet, right?

580
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,544
Speaker 1: I saw like I see these threads posted like on like board game reddit or something.

581
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:52,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, where someone's like, ah Something something something.

582
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:57,128
Speaker 1: it's like they just discovered babies first and it's like all right.

583
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:59,802
Speaker 1: on the one hand It's like I want to say to them bro.

584
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:02,830
Speaker 0: That's babies first, bro You should have learned that in middle school, right?

585
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:11,488
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, it's like ah This person has just found the small door to the larger world of thinking about how games work.

586
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,086
Speaker 0: Welcome yep, right and I can think like.

587
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:23,450
Speaker 0: The reasons book stuck with me is that I had read good science fiction and good fantasy And I also read a lot of garbage Dungeons & Dragons fuck items fantasy.

588
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:32,081
Speaker 0: but this book stood out because it addressed all those kinds of things that a like freshman in high school rim would think a lot about.

589
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:36,601
Speaker 0: so the book would feel like the book would introduce or Expand on those kinds of concepts.

590
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:40,622
Speaker 0: and when I was older I read a lot more and learned a lot more about philosophy.

591
00:38:41,024 --> 00:38:47,569
Speaker 0: and if I read this book today Without having this previous experience no new concept was introduced to adult rim in this book.

592
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:49,556
Speaker 1: Well, but what?

593
00:38:49,616 --> 00:38:53,990
Speaker 1: maybe if you had never read this book there would have been right because you read this book previous.

594
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:56,360
Speaker 1: Yeah true, but that it being said I hadn't.

595
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,589
Speaker 1: and no new concept was introduced to adult Scott's.

596
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, because even 1996 rim had the idea of what is a memory and does that make a person?

597
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I had already encountered that core concept.

598
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:17,185
Speaker 0: Yes But I had never encountered it in a Dungeons & Dragons book before right never even encountered it in a fantasy setting before Always sci-fi hmm, at least in my youth.

599
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:25,538
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm but it I'm impressed that this book deals with those concepts and Read like what do you see?

600
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,970
Speaker 0: a branded Dungeons & Dragons kind of book?

601
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:38,862
Speaker 0: You don't expect it to take a like a pretty heavy concept like that and push it all the way into surreal Nonsense, that is not what happens with.

602
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:43,692
Speaker 0: like popular culture works Like the good place is a really good show But it's not.

603
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:48,810
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna get full-on secret of space like end of Evangeline.

604
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,082
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be a few steps away from that.

605
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:52,229
Speaker 1: You know Netflix real soon.

606
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:53,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, see what happens.

607
00:39:53,930 --> 00:40:04,609
Speaker 0: but this book goes like full-on into like crazy crazy crazy like the world like everything gets abstract and weird and Like the ending is so abrupt.

608
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:10,330
Speaker 0: It gets away with the kind of stuff that I would never expect a light officially licensed anything to get away with.

609
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,150
Speaker 0: And that really stands out in my mind.

610
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:20,598
Speaker 0: Like it is notable that this book was allowed to be published with the content It has in it considering its target audience.

611
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,927
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I I'm impressed with that.

612
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:26,360
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Are you glad you read it?

613
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:35,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I mean basically the way I see it is like, you know, I read those Timothy Zahn Star Wars novels which everyone said were the best.

614
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:37,267
Speaker 0: I feel like this is better than those.

615
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:50,750
Speaker 1: right and If people say those are the best Star Wars novels and my opinion of them was Thrawn is a cool character But otherwise maybe Mara Jade or whatever her name is there's a character, but I can barely remember the story.

616
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,780
Speaker 1: It's kind of and whatever right.

617
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:54,870
Speaker 1: if that's the best you got I ain't reading anymore.

618
00:40:55,352 --> 00:41:02,965
Speaker 1: So I mean it basically is like sort of along the same token or is like, all right If this is the best D&D novel, you don't read any other D&D books.

619
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:08,016
Speaker 1: I'm not reading anymore right But I can see how a it's like.

620
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:08,838
Speaker 1: yes it is like.

621
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:09,340
Speaker 1: rim said.

622
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,746
Speaker 1: it's notable that you know some.

623
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:16,842
Speaker 1: it was a licensed You know an official, you know IP license on your book.

624
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:24,570
Speaker 1: you managed to go off the rails a bit Right in just instead of just you know telling a straightforward, you know, pulp adventure story.

625
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:31,521
Speaker 0: That's notable and it goes pretty far off the rails like the monster in the maze, which is Sufficiently horrifying.

626
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:39,401
Speaker 0: Yeah tears its own skin Fluffy and getting in the way and that is not even the most group.

627
00:41:39,421 --> 00:41:42,310
Speaker 1: like gruesome thing that happens that that we're eating the dude's hand.

628
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:43,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was just funny.

629
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:47,226
Speaker 1: Also, right it is.

630
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,349
Speaker 1: Was I gonna say I forget.

631
00:41:52,492 --> 00:42:05,718
Speaker 1: You started talking about the about the pop culture like some parts like it did got away with this stuff Just by as you know for the audience right for this book being like tea, you know Young teen D&D whatever.

632
00:42:05,738 --> 00:42:08,346
Speaker 1: this book is probably way good for someone like that.

633
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:13,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, right for sure Right, especially because it almost like just like there are.

634
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:13,589
Speaker 1: I'm not right.

635
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:21,842
Speaker 1: There are a lot of like young adult novels that are actually good just for all ages even though they're you know Branded as young adult novels, right?

636
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:22,969
Speaker 1: They're just good for everybody.

637
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:28,250
Speaker 1: Regard like the Hunger Games is is young adult novel and I mean it's perfectly fine for everyone.

638
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:43,170
Speaker 1: It's like some great novel but it's it's better than this Right, it's fine for all ages reading right, but You know I think this is definitely a young adult novel that is good for the teen preteen and for the adult less.

639
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:49,487
Speaker 0: Oh, yep What about one aspect I really liked about it because I remember the ending being abrupt and reading it again.

640
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,477
Speaker 1: that really read Ending is abrupt.

641
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:00,296
Speaker 0: I love how like it just accelerates and accelerates to this feverish pace and the end is literally like a series of burning wheels wheel Style like.

642
00:43:00,598 --> 00:43:02,450
Speaker 0: are you going to abandon Jake or the mission?

643
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,550
Speaker 0: Are you gonna abandon the like abandon this or the mission or the mid?

644
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,342
Speaker 0: But but but but but and then in the end It's just this fever page and then he's lost his limbs and everyone's gruesomely deformed.

645
00:43:11,563 --> 00:43:15,957
Speaker 0: and then look they just wake up on the street Like nothing had happened.

646
00:43:16,298 --> 00:43:21,917
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, except they carry all these wounds both physical and mental Like you get the impression.

647
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:25,150
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a loop situation maybe which is a little cliche.

648
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:30,427
Speaker 0: Well, he even says out like he says to himself looking at the River Styx how many times have I done this?

649
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:31,530
Speaker 0: fuck right.

650
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:33,858
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't remember the name of the river.

651
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then he's calling it something else The River Styx or the river lead?

652
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:42,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me you know, it's all like if you drink from it.

653
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,210
Speaker 0: You know it by a different name like that's kind of a thing and it right you lose your memory when you drink from it.

654
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,830
Speaker 0: Yep, and the lady of pain like it just like with him.

655
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,250
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if she is that woman from his memories or not.

656
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:59,964
Speaker 0: most likely I think Poseidon like canonically in this is just a piece of shit.

657
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:14,046
Speaker 0: who's trying to take over sigil and put these memories in a Giant amphora and tried to trick the lady of pain into remembering stuff that may or may not have been true just to destroy her Like that tracks with the kind of shit Poseidon would do.

658
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,536
Speaker 1: Yeah Or is it?

659
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:21,269
Speaker 1: you know a thing where it's like, you know the memories are for.

660
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:23,797
Speaker 1: You know the thoracic guy.

661
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,238
Speaker 1: somehow if he opens it when the lady of pain is there Armed with those memories.

662
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:30,965
Speaker 1: He'll be able to like mess with her or something.

663
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:35,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, right I mean, I couldn't really tell but there was like a net in there also or something.

664
00:44:35,587 --> 00:44:38,137
Speaker 1: Yeah Poseidon Maybe the net would catch her.

665
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:41,290
Speaker 1: he would regain his memory and then be able to take her out or something like that.

666
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,987
Speaker 0: Yep, something like that Poseidon had a plan and he had other great gods on board like the wine woman.

667
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:56,110
Speaker 1: Yep Like that's all just sort of explained actually in a pretty succinct way Yeah, and then so the only thing let's talk about is like the real big picture is like what's the lady of pains deal?

668
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:56,690
Speaker 1: Right.

669
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,011
Speaker 0: Yeah,

670
00:44:57,251 --> 00:44:58,354
Speaker 1: so cuz it's definitely

671
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:17,164
Speaker 0: D&D books like they like to do this thing of Concepts elemental concepts like air or fire or pain or love have physical embodiments and like the Necessity of good and evil like you can't have good without evil to justify having all the evil shit in the world for you to fight.

672
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:20,257
Speaker 0: And it does that with pain without her.

673
00:45:20,678 --> 00:45:35,057
Speaker 1: all the things that are like all the parts of the book that are narrated by the lady Of pain from her perspective They always have like these weird things going on Like my feet was my feet touch the ground that I appear or the feet come off the ground and yeah There's something like that.

674
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:44,597
Speaker 1: So you get the impression like she's invisible going around Extremely self-aware like ah, this is a trap for Poseidon, but I'm gonna fall for it Right.

675
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:50,937
Speaker 0: I can't help it or pain sucks But if I don't keep making pain out there Then the world will fall apart.

676
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,967
Speaker 0: cuz without pain people cannot know.

677
00:45:53,048 --> 00:46:01,802
Speaker 0: joy right could also be read as the lady of pain is deluded and that's the rationalization for the Ridiculous painful bullshit.

678
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:17,130
Speaker 1: She's up to yeah It's like you can sort of see what the lady of pain is thinking and like sort of understand how she works like she goes around invisibly and then appears in places but Sort of just maybe isn't in complete control of her own stuff.

679
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,862
Speaker 1: it's just sort of thinking and sort of doing what she has to do.

680
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:31,783
Speaker 1: or is, you know, like Like there's a consciousness that is In this body that does all this pain shit, but doesn't control the pain shit Almost watches it happen.

681
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:33,606
Speaker 0: a lot of almost fiction.

682
00:46:33,626 --> 00:46:35,910
Speaker 0: I've read both D&D and like good.

683
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:43,310
Speaker 0: Often when they portray the way a deity thinks or an all-knowing being thinks they tend to portray it very similarly.

684
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:58,699
Speaker 1: It almost feels like the narrator is a lady of pain But is also out of the lady of pains body and is like, you know watching the you know It's yeah, it's like it's having an out-of-body experience Narrating while watching itself do stuff.

685
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:05,800
Speaker 0: But I've seen that like writing pattern in a lot of fiction involving gods and omnipotent or omniscient beings, right?

686
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,201
Speaker 1: It's like.

687
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:11,999
Speaker 1: it's like oh I see myself, you know touch the ground and appear and do these things to the people and you know.

688
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:13,345
Speaker 1: So it's like.

689
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:16,440
Speaker 1: is it even in that it always says me but it's like, you know, it's a lady of pain.

690
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,227
Speaker 1: It's not like who else could be.

691
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:26,424
Speaker 1: yeah, especially, you know, if you had any question about it There's a part where it's like, ah, then I appear and everyone's like, oh shit lady of pain It's like duh, bro.

692
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:35,254
Speaker 0: I like the little tiny bit at the end where it it Repeatedly points out Jake the snakes eyes and how you can read her moods based on that.

693
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:43,480
Speaker 0: and Carfa the demons eyes Because they blaze maroon, which is like a demon thing and like his eyes were like betray him.

694
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,160
Speaker 1: It's all setting stuff, right?

695
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:53,070
Speaker 0: But then in the very end when the threson is looking into the river sticks and deciding where they're not drink from it It makes a point of that.

696
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:54,760
Speaker 0: He sees his eyes flash purple.

697
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:58,092
Speaker 0: No, I didn't see any says something to the effect of.

698
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:09,343
Speaker 0: I'll never turn my back on a tannery again almost implying that the path to becoming a demon like that is to do the horrible things that he keeps doing because he keeps Forgetting his like.

699
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:16,125
Speaker 0: he keeps drinking from this river forgetting himself and making the same horrible mistakes over and over again Like making demon packs.

700
00:48:16,406 --> 00:48:20,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, like may almost turning into a people's hands off and putting them on his feet.

701
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:22,108
Speaker 0: Well, like to be fair.

702
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:23,900
Speaker 0: He was not on board with that plan.

703
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:34,574
Speaker 0: He still did it and to be fair cart like car foods plan they're Probably the best possible plan considering the circumstances which is an interesting point.

704
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:39,670
Speaker 0: I would say that but it is yeah Yeah, but that's it bit by all.

705
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:53,385
Speaker 0: the decisions they make once they meet the demon are Rational in the context of what they're doing, but they're also tiny steps toward being evil Tiny steps toward being a demon.

706
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:54,669
Speaker 0: at what point do you say?

707
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:55,872
Speaker 0: No, fuck this.

708
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:58,420
Speaker 0: I'd rather just die than continue this quest.

709
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:12,428
Speaker 0: But at the same time it's very easy to justify those steps he takes and car foot is right in a way About everything except maybe the core concept of maybe you just shouldn't have put yourself in this maze in the first place And they didn't put him in.

710
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,527
Speaker 1: the guys came and like shoved him in So I didn't know how they got in.

711
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:17,236
Speaker 1: there was just net there and then they're in it.

712
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:22,240
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, so yeah, this book is memorable.

713
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:25,151
Speaker 0: I think it is the best D&D branded book.

714
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:26,015
Speaker 0: having read it again.

715
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:31,599
Speaker 0: I Would recommend if you're an edgelord teen who is into D&D read this book.

716
00:49:32,343 --> 00:49:41,716
Speaker 1: Sure, like yeah for sure if you're in high school I guess if you have to read a D&D branded officially licensed book, I guess this.

717
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:44,339
Speaker 1: not knowing any other ones I guess this is the fucking one.

718
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:48,053
Speaker 1: But if you're an adult, I think there's other books you could be.

719
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:49,700
Speaker 1: really you don't need to read this.

720
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:57,107
Speaker 0: But I feel like to people who have read this book versus people who have not Run planescape games very differently.

721
00:49:57,569 --> 00:49:57,890
Speaker 1: Sure.

722
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,460
Speaker 1: If you're gonna run a planescape game, you probably should read this book.

723
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:03,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, or if you're into planescape, you should probably read this book.

724
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:06,706
Speaker 1: if you've seen other planescape stuff and haven't read this book Maybe you should.

725
00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:08,419
Speaker 1: this is probably like the core planescape deal.

726
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:15,164
Speaker 1: maybe if you're gonna play a planescape video game like planescape torment and you actually want to play it properly and not just Sort of skim through it.

727
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:18,340
Speaker 1: This will give you a lot more context make the game a better experience for you.

728
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,676
Speaker 0: Of course, the other thing you could do is just read all right or vice versa.

729
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:22,500
Speaker 0: I have it over there.

730
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,088
Speaker 0: You can just read the planescape book.

731
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:25,535
Speaker 0: that just explains everything about the setting.

732
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:28,990
Speaker 1: if you're a super RPG nerd I feel like that's the necessity to read, you know, the core.

733
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:29,974
Speaker 0: it ain't bad reading.

734
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:31,420
Speaker 0: It's interesting reading that book.

735
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,084
Speaker 0: It's not long.

736
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:35,200
Speaker 1: I feel like that's the necessity if you're you know, a super nerd like dude.

737
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,010
Speaker 0: It's like half as thick as the Forgotten Realms book probably Probably more interesting to yeah.

738
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:48,170
Speaker 0: Yeah Forgotten Realms is Not actually that interesting It's just fantasy world.

739
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 0: Yeah elves dwarves Whatever like Forgotten Realms is on the same level of fantasy world is like the Wheel of Time war two planescapes credit.

740
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,083
Speaker 1: It's a fantasy world.

741
00:50:56,123 --> 00:51:00,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the multiverse is a cliche, but there's no other multiverse that's messed up like this one.

742
00:51:00,906 --> 00:51:10,052
Speaker 0: Yeah Right and the planescape setting does a really good job of making all the pieces like make sense in context of each other In a way that other settings like this tend not to.

743
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:16,860
Speaker 0: the only problem with the planescape setting Is that no edition of Dungeons & Dragons is good at telling that kind of story?

744
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,533
Speaker 0: You know a story where belief makes power like will to power is a real thing.

745
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:30,211
Speaker 0: Like I feel like you would need a completely novel like Mechanical engine to roleplay a good planescape game.

746
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:30,593
Speaker 0: Hmm.

747
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,660
Speaker 0: All right, so I think we're done here.

748
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:34,009
Speaker 1: You want to talk about the next book?

749
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:34,835
Speaker 1: What are you gonna pick?

750
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:35,420
Speaker 0: It's your pick.

751
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:41,680
Speaker 1: Oh, so I had a few books that were potential selections, right a little list going on.

752
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:44,394
Speaker 0: I'm ready to type this into Amazon in case I've never heard of it.

753
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:45,138
Speaker 1: You heard of it.

754
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:52,440
Speaker 1: Okay You know, they were you know, heaven and home going back and forth had justifications for all of them, right?

755
00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:02,529
Speaker 1: You know my justifications like book on the shelf that I already own and haven't read something that's an Odyssey a Sci-fi book about a post-apocalypse something.

756
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:05,420
Speaker 1: Oh, you know the kind of things that we would choose as a book club book.

757
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,110
Speaker 0: Right what I'm thinking about for my next one.

758
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:12,152
Speaker 1: Hmm a movement role book Comics though, usually you can read it in like five minutes.

759
00:52:12,353 --> 00:52:12,795
Speaker 0: other books.

760
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:17,124
Speaker 1: They're also expensive anyway, so You know.

761
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:17,888
Speaker 1: suddenly though.

762
00:52:17,908 --> 00:52:19,394
Speaker 1: I think it was was it Sunday.

763
00:52:19,415 --> 00:52:20,560
Speaker 1: It wasn't Sunday.

764
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:30,213
Speaker 1: I woke up in a reading Twitter early in the morning and I see some tweets and one of the tweets is like hey Scott You know one of those books you're considering for the book club.

765
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:32,080
Speaker 1: that was sort of like pretty high up on the list.

766
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like an exhibit about it at the Met and it's closing today.

767
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,052
Speaker 1: It is the last day to go see this exhibit.

768
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:40,680
Speaker 1: So I went over to the Met.

769
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:44,059
Speaker 1: I was like, well, I guess it's fucking raining might as well just go over there.

770
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,469
Speaker 1: It cost me zero dollars to go in there.

771
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:57,159
Speaker 1: I actually paid one dollar for two people Went in there I checked out there the fashion thing that's going on and some other stuff and I went to the exhibit about this book.

772
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:02,859
Speaker 1: and Yeah, so I knew as soon as I saw that tweet, I'm like, well, I guess that's the fucking book, isn't it?

773
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:08,048
Speaker 1: And then the exhibit only even more Reaffirmed my decision.

774
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:10,780
Speaker 1: so rim, you know most of our book club selections.

775
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,660
Speaker 1: I think we've done maybe one or two non-fictions, but they're almost all novels.

776
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:17,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I figure we're reading all these novels.

777
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:21,639
Speaker 0: Wait, if you're gonna pick non-fiction, I have avoided non-fiction only because I didn't want to hear you bitch about it.

778
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:25,516
Speaker 1: If we're doing all these novels Shouldn't we do?

779
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:33,665
Speaker 1: The first novel that was ever written by any human being ever Get a mesh.

780
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:35,291
Speaker 1: No, that is not enough.

781
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,660
Speaker 1: Okay, that is like an epic poem or some shit.

782
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:39,832
Speaker 0: All right, don't say Canterbury Tales.

783
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:40,475
Speaker 1: That is not.

784
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:41,400
Speaker 1: the Fred is waiting.

785
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:47,588
Speaker 0: Oh, it's making sure because I do not like the Canterbury Tales I do not ever want to read them again.

786
00:53:47,608 --> 00:54:04,117
Speaker 1: The first novel that was ever written by any human being ever is the tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, I read a translation of that in High school so I have done extensive research on the many translations.

787
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:08,180
Speaker 0: sadly There is no amazing love lets you attack six times.

788
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:14,097
Speaker 1: There is no amazing new translation written by some genius woman for us to read.

789
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:14,880
Speaker 0: god damn it.

790
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:16,183
Speaker 0: No, Emily Wilson.

791
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:19,733
Speaker 1: There is no Emily Wilson equivalent tale of Genji for us to read.

792
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:21,377
Speaker 1: Otherwise, that would have been the obvious choice.

793
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:36,856
Speaker 1: So apparently the Looking around and apparently the best translation according to many sources on internet is the royale Tyler Translation which you will find in the penguin classics deluxe edition.

794
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:39,846
Speaker 1: Don't get the not deluxe edition That's abridged or some bullshit.

795
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:47,353
Speaker 1: Okay, you got to get penguin classics deluxe edition And that will give you the right translation with no abridged ness.

796
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:49,119
Speaker 0: All right, I'm into it.

797
00:54:50,442 --> 00:54:55,466
Speaker 1: And also so the thing of the exhibit that I got talked about right is that This is the first novel ever.

798
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:59,000
Speaker 1: and what the exhibit was about it was you actually get the book from the exhibit.

799
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,060
Speaker 1: I just saw it on Amazon.

800
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:09,979
Speaker 1: It's called the Illustrated tale of Genji because the exhibit was all sorts of ancient works of art, you know Well, not ancient but centuries old works of art, right?

801
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,440
Speaker 1: About the book right like Scrolls wall Scrolls folding screens all sorts of crazy stuff like that.

802
00:55:17,801 --> 00:55:21,209
Speaker 1: Is that first of all first novel ever.

803
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:32,020
Speaker 1: there are people who are insane about this book right like crazed fans The same kind of crazed fans we see going over like TV shows today or whatever sounds right bands, right?

804
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Speaker 1: I saw this exhibit a loads of fan art Not just of the character in the book Genji and scenes from the book But also the art it be the author of the book right Murasaki Shikibu.

805
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:51,239
Speaker 1: There was tons of art of people like imagining her like drawing pictures of her writing the book, huh?

806
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:58,532
Speaker 1: Alright, she had crazed fans like stalker fans Like, you know like the Beatles do it whatever or kpop boy groups do.

807
00:55:59,354 --> 00:56:00,437
Speaker 1: there were not.

808
00:56:00,477 --> 00:56:13,854
Speaker 1: there were several Scrolls depicting imaginary poetry battles Between Shikibu and other great poets who did not live at the same time that she did.

809
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:18,079
Speaker 0: this just proves once again that humans fundamentally have not changed.

810
00:56:20,283 --> 00:56:37,160
Speaker 1: So this is a human being who was such a fan of this author that they Drew and wrote a poetry battle that is that it was made up by them But is imagined to be a battle of poetry battle between this person and another person.

811
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:43,860
Speaker 1: So it'd be like if I animated a fight between Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali.

812
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:45,280
Speaker 1: right.

813
00:56:46,728 --> 00:56:54,947
Speaker 1: Then I could draw Right, and I I couldn't box but I instead I boxing Jimmy Smith, right?

814
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,030
Speaker 1: It's like who would win in a fight.

815
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,014
Speaker 1: Superman was whatever.

816
00:56:57,034 --> 00:56:58,780
Speaker 1: right go ahead and right.

817
00:56:59,121 --> 00:56:59,423
Speaker 1: It's like.

818
00:56:59,463 --> 00:57:06,280
Speaker 1: this is some crazy shit that's going on and this is the first novel ever Which means this has literally been going on as long as books have existed.

819
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:09,931
Speaker 1: So it's good, but I just have to see in that shit.

820
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:11,859
Speaker 1: How could we not read this book?

821
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:21,260
Speaker 1: That is you know, probably what I imagine when I read this book I'm gonna see like oh my god, all these things have been referencing this for my whole life and I didn't notice.

822
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:25,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's I figured that reason alone was enough to bring it high on the list.

823
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:32,520
Speaker 0: before even knowing there was an exhibit over In high school, I didn't read the whole thing, but I read several long excerpts from it as part of a class.

824
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:37,048
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, get ready adults cuz this motherfucker is 1224 pages.

825
00:57:37,068 --> 00:57:38,220
Speaker 0: so we'll do this on the next Thursday.

826
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:42,778
Speaker 0: Get ready, we'll probably finish it faster than we did.

827
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:43,421
Speaker 0: pages of pain Cuz.

828
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:46,320
Speaker 0: we didn't actually read pages of pain until like right before we did the page.

829
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, but actually I'm reading in other books.

830
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:49,680
Speaker 1: I won't start this until I finish the other book.

831
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:57,220
Speaker 1: Okay, you got some time But you gotta you have a lot of time for this one and you're gonna need it for twelve hundred and twenty six unabridged Translated pages.

832
