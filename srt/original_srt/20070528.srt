1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,268
Speaker 1: It's Monday, May 28th.

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,390
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:14,353
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:18,266
Speaker 1: We're sick, and this is geek night Tonight.

5
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:25,400
Speaker 1: we're gonna continue getting into it week Which we stopped prematurely last week with how to get into computer programming.

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,617
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:33,960
Speaker 1: So as I'm sure you all noticed we missed two shows last week.

8
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,490
Speaker 0: I wonder why that was well.

9
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:44,179
Speaker 1: I got actually pretty sick and Sadly it's a sickness that was going through much of my work and many of us got sick with it.

10
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:52,134
Speaker 1: And it seems I brought it home because now that I'm back from my trip Scott seems to be just having the beginning of the exact same sickness.

11
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,846
Speaker 0: Yes, but meanwhile Well, you were sick.

12
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:57,695
Speaker 0: We had to cancel the show when I'm sick.

13
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:58,640
Speaker 0: That's just fine.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,615
Speaker 0: We'll do the show anyway because I'm not a wuss.

15
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:15,540
Speaker 1: see now I will point out that well Wednesday I pretty much came home from work chugged some NyQuil and went directly to bed And I was really sick mostly due to the secondary bacterial infection that I gained in my sinuses and the sore throat and such.

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:21,739
Speaker 1: but Thursday I was actually feeling a lot better, and I was 50/50 on doing the show and I could have done it.

17
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:25,365
Speaker 1: But I'll point out that always said Scott I think I'm up for doing the show.

18
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:33,038
Speaker 1: Scott basically looked at me and said I don't think you are and I think his ulterior Motive was that he really didn't want to do the show.

19
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,288
Speaker 1: He wanted to just I don't know cop out.

20
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,731
Speaker 0: well if you were so badass as I am to do the show when sick Why didn't you just do the show alone?

21
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:44,260
Speaker 0: so on Thursday?

22
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:52,175
Speaker 0: We got to share the responsibility for the show Wednesday a hundred percent of the responsibility goes to your wussiness for not doing the show.

23
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:52,737
Speaker 0: I will now.

24
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:58,080
Speaker 0: hey We're doing the show which and I'm sick, so I guess I'm a badass and you're a wuss.

25
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:01,775
Speaker 1: We'll see because you're in day one of the sickness and day two is the bad day.

26
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:02,900
Speaker 0: I was kind of sick yesterday.

27
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,031
Speaker 1: No, that's like the precursor day.

28
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:05,815
Speaker 0: I don't know.

29
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:06,780
Speaker 0: I was sick yesterday.

30
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,743
Speaker 1: We'll see.

31
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:08,245
Speaker 1: well.

32
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,856
Speaker 1: I think that really comes down to if you get the secondary bacterial infection.

33
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:12,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see about that.

34
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but actually I'm not gonna talk about this in any great detail But it was quite an eventful four-day weekend because we obviously didn't go to work today.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be a lot less eventful But it turned out to be too eventful, and I didn't get done a lot of things.

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,830
Speaker 0: I wanted to get done, but I also got done things.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,436
Speaker 0: I wanted to get done so yeah.

38
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:31,777
Speaker 1: Well.

39
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:32,480
Speaker 1: It was pretty great.

40
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:33,466
Speaker 1: I mean first off.

41
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,640
Speaker 1: I think I mentioned that I was going hiking.

42
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,487
Speaker 1: I don't know if I did or not in the show because I got sick, but We plan to go hiking with our friend James.

43
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,884
Speaker 1: not by we I mean all of us other than Scott who thinks hiking is stupid Wasn't all of us.

44
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:49,900
Speaker 1: It was like you and Scott Johnson and James and his whole family and Laura.

45
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:50,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

46
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:58,087
Speaker 1: And I think Alex would have gone And I'm pretty sure Pete and all them would have gone if they could know Alex had stuff to do like me Yeah, but he probably would have wanted to go.

47
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:58,831
Speaker 0: I don't know.

48
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:03,993
Speaker 0: maybe you're the one who doesn't like hiking Yeah, why walk around and do nothing when you could do stuff?

49
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:10,360
Speaker 1: well the thing is when we first said Oh, we're gonna go up to the Adirondacks Lake Placid and go hiking Scott Johnson, and I like oh alright.

50
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:15,500
Speaker 1: So we're gonna get our gear gonna do some camping and then James tells us that no we're just gonna stay in a hotel.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,164
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a day hike and I guess I didn't really think about the way his family is now seriously they take hiking.

52
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,818
Speaker 1: so I immediately thought oh, well, this is gonna be easy.

53
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:34,458
Speaker 1: and After I got to the top of the fourth mountain After trudging through snow banks at the top and stood at an elevation of cold up there.

54
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,379
Speaker 1: little shit It wasn't too cold because it was stupidly hot on the bottom.

55
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:45,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it by the time we got to the top It was warm enough that even with the wind I was okay up there, which is good.

56
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:52,639
Speaker 1: Low air pressure yeah at the lower air pressure I didn't really notice it except that I was breathing a bit more heavily than I expected.

57
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:57,635
Speaker 1: and I really noticed it when we're going back down the mountain quickly and my ears started popping.

58
00:03:57,776 --> 00:04:02,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what goes on Yep, but standing on the top of the 4,000.

59
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:04,516
Speaker 1: Whatever foot mountain gothic up there.

60
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, we climbed a lower.

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,210
Speaker 0: Well, that's an actual mountain not some hill.

62
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,060
Speaker 1: well the thing is Mount beacon is classified a mountain by all the local law.

63
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:15,743
Speaker 0: It's a yeah, no no it's a mountain It's a hill.

64
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:23,232
Speaker 1: the thing is because a lot of mountains up there are really small too But the 46 high peaks are the ones that are over 4,000 feet.

65
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:24,617
Speaker 0: yeah, that's called a mountain.

66
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:26,684
Speaker 1: well see There's no law or anything.

67
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,788
Speaker 1: There's no official standard.

68
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,177
Speaker 0: Oh there isn't but it's this is a hill.

69
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 0: all right regardless.

70
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:38,120
Speaker 1: I can now say pretty straightforward that I'm a mountain climber because I've now climbed several very tall mountains.

71
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,866
Speaker 0: All right, I guess you can.

72
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:56,240
Speaker 1: I guess the biggest thing was that we climbed them all in one day and we went well over 20 miles up and down and up and down and Walking out after we got back to the lodge refilled in water And then had to walk a further three miles at night to get out to the cars.

73
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:57,769
Speaker 1: I felt like Sam.

74
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,580
Speaker 0: why don't they put the cars next to the lodge?

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,169
Speaker 1: Because the lodge is in the middle of the wilderness.

76
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,379
Speaker 1: That's where you stop to camp and refill your water.

77
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,286
Speaker 0: Put a parking lot out there.

78
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,490
Speaker 1: There's no roads.

79
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,834
Speaker 1: There's no way to put a road.

80
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,774
Speaker 0: gotta put a road you can't All right, Scott.

81
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:14,280
Speaker 1: anyway

82
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:29,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, so for those of you who do not live in the United States or are not familiar with the customs the United States today is The day we observe Memorial Day Which is supposed to be a day where like you remember veterans from all the American Wars and stuff like that.

83
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:34,460
Speaker 0: But really all it means is that everyone in the whole country doesn't go to work except people who work retail.

84
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,950
Speaker 1: Well what it actually means is that pretty much.

85
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:38,712
Speaker 1: It's gonna rain.

86
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:39,394
Speaker 0: Yep.

87
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:48,280
Speaker 1: This is probably the first year in my life I can remember where it didn't rain on Memorial Though I guess technically it did because it rained at about midnight for about an hour.

88
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:57,349
Speaker 0: Yeah it means people will go to bars and get drunk people will barbecue people will hang out with each other and They generally won't work, and it's kind of fun.

89
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,674
Speaker 0: and people have parades.

90
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,200
Speaker 0: also parades lots of parades.

91
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:15,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, the really fun thing was we're gonna do a whole show on this now but we got back from Lake Placid early because after the one day of Excruciating hiking where I can say was certainty that the final trudge out and all that by the time we were done That was the second worst pain.

92
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:16,931
Speaker 1: I've ever experienced in my life.

93
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,640
Speaker 1: Uh-huh very clearly the second worst pain.

94
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:27,360
Speaker 1: I definitively put it on the list at number two Uh-huh number one being the food poisoning that resulted in a not the bicycle spoke through the leg.

95
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:29,007
Speaker 1: No, that was like number five or six.

96
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:29,710
Speaker 1: that wasn't that bad.

97
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,840
Speaker 1: It didn't hurt so much as it was disgusting.

98
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty disgusting.

99
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,932
Speaker 1: right there I'm trying to explain to the doctor.

100
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,743
Speaker 1: No, it's fine It's just a little dud.

101
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:47,124
Speaker 1: and he says uh because you turn around and I turn around and he pulls the q-tip all the way Out of my leg, and I'm like oh, I guess it's deeper than I thought and he's like yeah You're gonna need some stitches.

102
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:49,031
Speaker 0: Yeah speaking of disgusting.

103
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:50,216
Speaker 1: Oh god.

104
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:51,300
Speaker 1: I know what you're gonna talk about.

105
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,412
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if everyone listening is aware of what a tonsilis is.

106
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:56,420
Speaker 1: well is a tonsilis or tonsilis?

107
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,962
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

108
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,100
Speaker 0: the internet sort of doesn't have a definite answer, but I've seen tonsilis more often.

109
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:01,863
Speaker 1: I believe.

110
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:06,740
Speaker 1: these scientific term are those white rocks that occasionally appear in your tonsils.

111
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically the tonsils you have tonsils that are these things in the back of your throat way back there.

112
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:21,360
Speaker 1: Well, unless you're one of those sorry folks who had them cut out for no good reason before doctors realized that they're actually kind of Useful yeah, and basically what they do is they clean shit that goes down your throat.

113
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,406
Speaker 0: You know what they do.

114
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:22,667
Speaker 1: is they?

115
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:34,260
Speaker 1: as far as I've been able to read there are crypts in them which are like these folds of skin yeah, and there's little crevices in there and Bacteria that you're gonna be infected with will often come in through the eye nose throat area first.

116
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:39,659
Speaker 1: So there's a decent chance they'll get in there and colonize before they begin to infect the rest of you.

117
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:49,840
Speaker 0: So basically your tonsils are like this little house that attracts all the nasty things coming in through your head And you hope that stuff gets caught in there instead of going into your body and infecting you now.

118
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,819
Speaker 1: Well more that it gets caught there.

119
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:57,420
Speaker 1: Then your body recognizes it and develops an immune response before it starts infecting the rest of your body.

120
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,745
Speaker 1: It's like an early warning system.

121
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,006
Speaker 0: Yep.

122
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,471
Speaker 0: It's pretty good now.

123
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:06,535
Speaker 1: I'm sure a doctor can get going to better detail Or tell us where we were wrong about that description, but of course that's all we know.

124
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:07,660
Speaker 0: we're computer people.

125
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,520
Speaker 0: What do you want from us, but on occasion your tonsils will have these lifts basically?

126
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:22,973
Speaker 0: In those crevices where the bacteria grow they will grow and grow and grow and you'll get like these white rocks that That are like sticking out of your tonsils and like if you have.

127
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:32,515
Speaker 0: really if you don't you know If you have a dirty mouth and you take a flashlight and look at the back of your mouth or your tonsils are You'll probably see a lot of white rocks grow in there, which is kind of disgusting.

128
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:36,652
Speaker 1: It's not so much a dirty mouth It's just your lifestyle and your what your tonsils are set up like.

129
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,400
Speaker 1: I mean you might happen to have big crypts or whatever.

130
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:40,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, our friend are one of our friends.

131
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:46,740
Speaker 1: I'd realize not to mention the name has pretty big tonsillets and if I were this person I would have a doctor cut them out.

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,087
Speaker 0: Well, the doctor doesn't cut them out.

133
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:48,972
Speaker 0: I actually found out there.

134
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:50,300
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean I cut out his tonsils.

135
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,600
Speaker 0: No, maybe but doctors have a tool called a curette which and they buy a process known as curette age.

136
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:59,552
Speaker 0: I guarantee that's exactly what the internet said curette age.

137
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:00,939
Speaker 0: They will can remove them.

138
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,188
Speaker 0: Granted it's like thanks.

139
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,232
Speaker 0: You have a screwdriver.

140
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,099
Speaker 0: I'm gonna apply some screwdriver II.

141
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:08,995
Speaker 1: Believe the term is screwdriver II.

142
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,148
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, but you don't know before.

143
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,137
Speaker 1: you're not supposed to pick them out unless they become a problem.

144
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:21,280
Speaker 1: Just let him sit there Gouging at your tonsils with a piece of metal and you're not a doctor that you can hurt yourself.

145
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,360
Speaker 1: That's a recipe for not good things.

146
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,778
Speaker 0: Yes, basically what will happen on occasion is you'll cough out a tonsillets because that's what happens.

147
00:09:28,798 --> 00:09:29,380
Speaker 0: you cough them out.

148
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,503
Speaker 1: They're easily identified.

149
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,210
Speaker 0: They're little white rocks and they smell really bad.

150
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:36,640
Speaker 1: They smell like the worst bad breath imaginable.

151
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:37,987
Speaker 0: That's basically what they smell like.

152
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:42,910
Speaker 0: So, you know, I would cough these out on occasion Yeah, and I would ignore them mostly.

153
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 0: I'd be like hey, why am I coughing up weird rocks?

154
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,955
Speaker 0: And then I found out oh, it's tonsillets that I'm supposed to cough those out.

155
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:48,759
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong here.

156
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:51,219
Speaker 0: But I think it was like a month ago.

157
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:59,298
Speaker 0: I felt something in the back of my throat like something was living there and it was kind of bothering me like it was as If a rock was stuck back there and I actually felt it.

158
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:03,300
Speaker 0: Usually you don't feel tonsillets because you don't have feeling receptors in your tonsils.

159
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:07,499
Speaker 0: So if you can feel one that means it's so big it's touching other parts back there.

160
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:11,375
Speaker 0: So I tried to get it out and I thought I was successful.

161
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,560
Speaker 0: I poked back there.

162
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:15,362
Speaker 0: I figured out a method with a flashlight and a Toothpick.

163
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:20,500
Speaker 1: that was now I point out from my perspective Scott out of the blue kind of says I'm gonna go get this thing out.

164
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:21,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, it goes upstairs.

165
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,658
Speaker 1: I've been a minute later.

166
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:33,840
Speaker 0: I hear Yeah, I figured out how to poke around back there without gagging myself and vomiting which is a useful skill I imagine in case you get something stuck back there that could be dangerous.

167
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:39,420
Speaker 0: But yeah, and I thought I removed it, you know, I didn't feel it anymore and I didn't see any white rocks.

168
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,649
Speaker 0: So I thought I was done today.

169
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:44,200
Speaker 0: I felt one back there and it was so bad.

170
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:57,380
Speaker 0: So I said I got up and I said, alright, I learned how to do this before I will do it again I will remove this tonsil it and I looked back there and I couldn't really find it And I saw a little white bump for a second and then it was gone, but I still felt it.

171
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:03,471
Speaker 0: So I went at it and I went at it and I basically Discovered there's a crevice in my tonsil on the right side.

172
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:08,459
Speaker 0: and it's so strange because if you look at it the wrong way It looks just like flat skin completely flat.

173
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:25,048
Speaker 0: But if you poke it just right it opens up and there's basically this Grand Canyon back there And all I saw with the flashlight was a tiny white bump like blue I got it wasn't even sure that it was like wasn't just a white bump on the skin itself as Opposed to a tonsil.

174
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,499
Speaker 0: it that just touching the skin.

175
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:31,555
Speaker 0: But I figured out how to get it out of there and what came out was the largest.

176
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:37,476
Speaker 1: most hideous in this game was like Crazy the fact that Scott decided to come downstairs and show it to everyone.

177
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:42,340
Speaker 0: It was just so crazy And even though it was disgusting it had to be shared with the world that it was so large.

178
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,627
Speaker 1: You didn't take a picture of it.

179
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,632
Speaker 1: Ah shit cuz.

180
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,120
Speaker 1: then that could have been your thing of the day.

181
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,869
Speaker 0: I never I always forget to take a picture.

182
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,230
Speaker 0: like I've been taking a picture of my tomato plant every day I forgot to do it today.

183
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,479
Speaker 1: you go do it right now.

184
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,140
Speaker 0: No, cuz it doesn't help because then it's not gonna be that different from the tomorrow morning picture.

185
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,152
Speaker 0: Okay, it's got to be like 24 hours to keep it.

186
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:02,060
Speaker 0: even so I'll just skip one and it'll be better.

187
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:05,550
Speaker 1: There's gonna be one sudden burst of growth in your animation.

188
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,937
Speaker 0: tomato plant grows frickin quick.

189
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:13,298
Speaker 0: I gotta tell you Like it was really small few days ago, and now it's pretty awesome.

190
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,949
Speaker 1: Yep I guess suffice to say I'm still.

191
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:21,211
Speaker 1: I mean I was starting to recover from my sickness And then I hiked a long way.

192
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:26,615
Speaker 1: it probably the most physical exertion I've ever put myself to and I think as a result.

193
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:27,640
Speaker 1: It's lingering a little bit.

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,955
Speaker 1: So I'm like just getting better and Scott is just getting sick.

195
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:35,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm illin I got some Sudafed in me right now, and I'll probably take Nyquil and go to bed.

196
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:44,269
Speaker 1: Scott hates to take medicine so the fact that I convinced him to take a pill because he hates pills I don't take medicine unless absolutely necessary.

197
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,257
Speaker 1: the fact that he took a pill is when I realized.

198
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,586
Speaker 1: Oh, he's really sick He's not just complaining.

199
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,715
Speaker 1: Ah yep back up a little bit.

200
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:55,436
Speaker 0: There's gonna be some Sniffling in this show there's gonna be some Nyquil and tonight.

201
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,750
Speaker 1: I met well Nick home Nick.

202
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,780
Speaker 0: well whatever you bought instead of the actual No, you know get the real deal with Sudafed in it and not the BS can't make meth out of it Nyquil.

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, those laws.

204
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:08,912
Speaker 1: I can't see in America here.

205
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:24,298
Speaker 1: There's a problem in rural places with methamphetamines which are made by some people by buying drugs that contain Sudafed erin and basically an illegal drug that you can produce By using a chemical process on over-the-counter drugs.

206
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaker 1: now It just so happens that the drug they use to make this bad drug is probably the best decongestant known to man.

207
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:37,116
Speaker 0: So if you want to buy it at the store just to decongest yourself and your sinuses.

208
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,006
Speaker 0: you have to sign For it, and it's not easy.

209
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:46,179
Speaker 1: to get even worse all the good brands of medicine started Just not selling it anymore because they didn't want to deal with that.

210
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:52,980
Speaker 1: Because a lot of people aren't gonna go through the trouble of going and showing ID and signing a logbook Just to buy some cold medicine.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 1: They'll just buy some other cold medicine not knowing that it doesn't work as well.

212
00:13:56,611 --> 00:14:08,452
Speaker 0: Yep so it generally sucks for people with colds here because your choices are do a bunch of bullshit to get the real medicine that works or Buy bullshit medicine, but I was gonna say what about homeopathy?

213
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:15,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just said or buy bullshit medicine That zinc I won't even I won't even give it the the honor of calling it medicine.

214
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,897
Speaker 0: buy bullshit bullshit.

215
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:25,764
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we're still a shade better than Japan where it's basically illegal to sell any kind of Decongestant actual drug.

216
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:30,338
Speaker 1: working drugs any kind of allergies and suffering like that'd be.

217
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:33,891
Speaker 1: the biggest reason I couldn't move to Japan is that I couldn't take my allergy medicine.

218
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:36,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what the fuck is wrong with those people?

219
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:36,680
Speaker 1: I don't know.

220
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:48,740
Speaker 1: I've heard a lot of explanations about that and it just it really kind of bothers me because Japan is one of the most modern scientifically advanced industrialized nations When it comes to medicine except when it comes to allergy and cold medicine.

221
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:56,369
Speaker 0: So the thing is there are a lot of like Japanese doctors who are like the world's foremost leading expert on some kind of crazy Kidney surgery or so.

222
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,134
Speaker 0: I just picked something.

223
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:02,780
Speaker 0: I have no idea But you know, they have all that kind of high-end medicine like surgeries and things like that.

224
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,113
Speaker 0: How come you can't wait a day-to-day over-the-counter medicine?

225
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:09,746
Speaker 0: They just don't let you have it because they're all Something I don't know.

226
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:10,890
Speaker 1: I mean, what are they afraid?

227
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,660
Speaker 1: that if the Japanese man takes lorata Dean?

228
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,388
Speaker 1: He'll suddenly become a serial killer?

229
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:19,680
Speaker 0: and maybe they're right that maybe yeah.

230
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,056
Speaker 0: Anyway, some news besides us.

231
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:22,560
Speaker 0: All right.

232
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:31,020
Speaker 1: so there's been a lot of news for a long time about the issues between Google News and the rest of the news industry combined.

233
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:33,008
Speaker 1: There have been some recent developments.

234
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:40,655
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into any of them because It's really not worth it to go about the intricate details of all this.

235
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:45,560
Speaker 1: but suffice to say The mainstream media don't really like Google News.

236
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:54,780
Speaker 0: No, because they want people like if you live in I don't know, Kansas They want you to read the Kansas newspaper and whether it's not they want you to read it online.

237
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,277
Speaker 0: They want you to read the actual paper, you know, they don't want you going to Google News.

238
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:06,620
Speaker 0: then Then ending up at the Kansas News or maybe if you live in Kansas you end up reading like the Missouri News or something.

239
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,650
Speaker 0: Well, the main issue the Mississippi News.

240
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:16,578
Speaker 1: Here's the issue as it boils down Google Indexes news that is publicly and freely available all over the internet like they do with everything else.

241
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:18,768
Speaker 1: They index Yeah, and they don't even really copy it.

242
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:19,672
Speaker 1: They just link to it.

243
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:20,094
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

244
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:31,112
Speaker 1: However Almost every source of news in the United States every single one Gets almost all of its news from the wire services.

245
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,760
Speaker 0: You have the AP wire the UPI Reuters.

246
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:35,892
Speaker 0: Is there Reuters and I think there's one more.

247
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,300
Speaker 0: I forget but those are the big ones.

248
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:40,215
Speaker 1: So those people actually go out and make the news.

249
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 1: well not make the news.

250
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:45,740
Speaker 0: Make the local news like the Kansas newspaper gets news from Kansas.

251
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,130
Speaker 0: But you know some of them.

252
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:51,873
Speaker 0: they put on the AP wire I guess and I'm sure eight people but but a lot of the news out there.

253
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 1: if you go to 20 different newspapers They're running the same story.

254
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,020
Speaker 0: They all got the base story from the wire and then they might have someone edit it and write it differently.

255
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,494
Speaker 1: You know, but it's the exact same facts the exact same news a lot of times.

256
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,638
Speaker 1: They just publish it verbatim

257
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Speaker 0: Yep,

258
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:12,308
Speaker 1: and they pay for this privilege hoping that they'll make the money back in the ads They show you on their free newspaper site,

259
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,576
Speaker 0: but or in their newspaper that you pay for

260
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:23,618
Speaker 1: but with Google News Say the news is I don't know president watching McCall it of Tasmania Shot someone and there was a coup.

261
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,144
Speaker 1: something like that.

262
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 1: the AP wire reports on it and Rogers reports on it and Every other newspaper in America just runs that exact same story.

263
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:38,636
Speaker 1: The facts are known freely available and the same no matter where you get the facts from.

264
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:39,699
Speaker 0: you have c8 the wet.

265
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:45,100
Speaker 0: the wire Services make their money because the newspapers pay them so they don't really care who sees the news.

266
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,790
Speaker 0: they don't care if the news is all over the internet.

267
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:52,048
Speaker 0: that doesn't bother them because Newspapers can't print that news unless they pay.

268
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:56,100
Speaker 0: and if they do print it without paying they get sued and they make their money anyway.

269
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,788
Speaker 0: So the wire or if they get the news independently Yeah, the wire service just doesn't give a shit.

270
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,335
Speaker 0: who sees the news they want?

271
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:02,260
Speaker 0: they just don't care.

272
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:15,639
Speaker 1: So if I'm looking for that news, you know, they want newspapers want us to do is anytime I want news They want me to go to the Sun or the Times or whatever and always look at the news there because then I see all The news and I see their ads and everything's great for them.

273
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:24,407
Speaker 1: But if all the newspapers have the same news if I go to Google News and they just show one of the thousand papers That all have the same news and I click on it.

274
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,660
Speaker 1: Every time I look at a news article I go to a different paper.

275
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:31,160
Speaker 1: I never stay on one paper because there's no point is the same as every other paper.

276
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:33,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, a Google News is so smart.

277
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,753
Speaker 0: What it does is it sort of figures out which stories are the same.

278
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:38,916
Speaker 0: so it groups together.

279
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:40,220
Speaker 0: like I found a story.

280
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:49,527
Speaker 0: I found the same story in this other paper I found the same story in this other paper and it groups them all into one unit and you can just click on that one Unit and bet that you're all good.

281
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,230
Speaker 1: Now.

282
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,260
Speaker 1: The newspapers obviously don't like this.

283
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:56,496
Speaker 1: Here's a quote from Sam Zell than the owner of tribune company.

284
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:57,520
Speaker 1: This is from the article.

285
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,225
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to a quote.

286
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:06,710
Speaker 1: if all the newspapers in America did not allow Google to steal their content How profitable would Google be?

287
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:09,100
Speaker 1: the answer not very?

288
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,430
Speaker 0: How much money does Google make from Google News?

289
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,880
Speaker 0: not much well go makes its money from elsewhere.

290
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,448
Speaker 1: Yes notice that Google doesn't put ads on Google News.

291
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:24,066
Speaker 1: part of that is because there's been a lot of lawsuits a lot of threats of lawsuits and The funny thing is it goes both ways.

292
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:32,129
Speaker 1: because early on a few newspapers said hey Google don't index our stuff and Google Being Google said alright fine.

293
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,576
Speaker 1: We will remove you from the Google News database.

294
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:37,774
Speaker 1: We will not track your site We will not link to you in any way.

295
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:38,560
Speaker 1: How's that?

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,348
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you asked for.

297
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:48,378
Speaker 1: and then those sites realize that Most of their traffic comes from Google and no one got to their site anymore and no one looked at their ads.

298
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,948
Speaker 1: Yep so now these newspapers.

299
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:58,449
Speaker 1: the news now is that a lot of them are starting to realize that they can't just Pretend that Google is somehow the enemy.

300
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:07,060
Speaker 1: they can't just fight or ignore Google because Google Much like the people who make Starcraft when it comes to Korea have them by the balls.

301
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:14,374
Speaker 0: And all that tells me is that in within the next 10 to 20 years I think Google is just gonna buy every goddamn newspaper.

302
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:15,559
Speaker 0: That doesn't go out of business.

303
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:16,925
Speaker 1: Why even buy?

304
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:20,860
Speaker 0: they might even buy just the wire service and then all the newspapers to go out of business.

305
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,400
Speaker 1: They wouldn't even need to because the thing is most of these wire news services.

306
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:32,699
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna very much get on some sort of soapbox But I think the future of news reporting is going to be straight-up citizen self-organized.

307
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:42,695
Speaker 0: Yeah I think the thing is though is that you still need people who are career reporters because oh Yeah, citizens are not gonna go to some crazy war zone and report.

308
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,260
Speaker 0: No, I'm not gonna fly around the world.

309
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,565
Speaker 0: They're not gonna get information.

310
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,920
Speaker 0: that citizen they're getting information citizens can't get but yes, they get press passes to things.

311
00:20:50,141 --> 00:21:07,680
Speaker 1: Yes, they will because if the mainstream media is so unprofitable which when it comes to news they are they're not doing well and a lot of newspapers are going out of business every single day and For the last several years every year the median age of the people who read newspapers has gone up by exactly one year

312
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:08,202
Speaker 0: Yep,

313
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:09,347
Speaker 1: which says a lot.

314
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:16,480
Speaker 1: Mmm, and also I mean we do this podcast Completely on our own and pay for it for fun if we didn't have this.

315
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:19,991
Speaker 1: I know there are a lot of people who would as a hobby just be reporters.

316
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:30,655
Speaker 1: the problem also also there are Professional organizations that would step in and fill the void By providing professional news and either pay for content like a lot of places do.

317
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:40,640
Speaker 1: now a lot of the specialty places Some newspapers are doing very well because instead of just reporting on the wire They actually go out investigate on their own and have stories that only they have.

318
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,300
Speaker 0: Yep, the thing is, you know when it comes to reporting on some topics most topics, that's just fine.

319
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:51,300
Speaker 0: But there's certain things where you know, we don't even know if the real news is true.

320
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:54,432
Speaker 0: How are you gonna trust, you know, you see what comes on dig?

321
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,520
Speaker 0: they can't even report on video games without lying.

322
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,833
Speaker 0: How are they gonna report on politics in the war and stuff like that without?

323
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:10,211
Speaker 1: well, you know how you know currently people For some reason because it used to be the case where you'd have to trust the gatekeepers Which were the newspapers to filter out what was and wasn't true.

324
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:17,119
Speaker 1: you expected that once the story got into the newspaper It had already been checked by multiple sources and was guaranteed to be true.

325
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:27,477
Speaker 1: Nowadays, not only do the newspapers really report shittily and don't even get me into how absolutely atrocious The writing is in almost every newspaper in the world these days.

326
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,615
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, they got a appeal to the lowest common denominator to get more readers.

327
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:34,459
Speaker 0: if they wrote it Well, most people wouldn't understand what it was saying and it wouldn't sell.

328
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,020
Speaker 0: They write to a fifth grade level in the newspapers.

329
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:41,140
Speaker 1: Usually I mean when I see in an actual printed newspaper misspelled words.

330
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:43,778
Speaker 1: That's really bothersome to me.

331
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:52,619
Speaker 1: But nowadays with the internet the new all the information is out there from many many many sources and you can't trust any one source and a lot of people.

332
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:54,165
Speaker 1: You have to be intelligent.

333
00:22:54,205 --> 00:23:00,789
Speaker 1: all the people who say Oh Wikipedia or the internet are unreliable are just too dumb To filter information on their own.

334
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:11,804
Speaker 1: if I see a news story from any source these days I really don't trust it until I personally verify it from multiple other source and those sources can't just be a blog that links to The original story.

335
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:18,200
Speaker 0: Yeah to make sure these are people who got it independently of the first piece And that's why Google News is so great because it'll lump them together.

336
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 1: So like say I see a story about something in a high school that outrages me.

337
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:29,560
Speaker 1: Well, if I go on Google News, and there's only one other reference to it probably not true Yeah, because if it's true, there's gonna be like 400 references to it.

338
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,514
Speaker 0: The other thing is you got to be able to interpret stories correctly.

339
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,860
Speaker 0: that don't say things accurately.

340
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:41,966
Speaker 0: Like if some story says guy in Britain invents Like perfect free energy device you have to say Oh, this doesn't news.

341
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,640
Speaker 0: story doesn't say a guy in Britain made a free energy device.

342
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,154
Speaker 0: The story is some guy in Britain says he made a free energy device.

343
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:49,520
Speaker 0: That's the actual story.

344
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:53,775
Speaker 1: I guess my long point is that Google is basically showing us the future of news.

345
00:23:54,197 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 1: and the future of news Is that you can't trust the gatekeepers to accurately report news to you because that makes you effectively their slave.

346
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,285
Speaker 1: I mean, what's the old saying?

347
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:08,200
Speaker 1: any man who withholds you information wishes to be your master or something like that?

348
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:15,640
Speaker 0: The only thing I disagree with is I think the news wire and professionally paid journalists will continue to exist for a long time.

349
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:17,197
Speaker 1: Well, how are they going to make money?

350
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,866
Speaker 0: Because people I mean they're.

351
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:27,220
Speaker 1: hey to get the information most people aren't most people With few exceptions and those exceptions are things like the Wall Street Journal.

352
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:32,965
Speaker 1: People won't pay for the news if they can get it free and most people don't care about the news enough to even seek it out.

353
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,691
Speaker 0: regardless Someone's gonna pay at some point.

354
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:36,538
Speaker 0: I don't know.

355
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:42,222
Speaker 0: I mean, even if Google's got to get to pay for them to something who knows Whatever.

356
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,717
Speaker 0: We still need that people to do that sort of thing.

357
00:24:44,737 --> 00:24:46,845
Speaker 0: Yeah Pay for it or not.

358
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,829
Speaker 0: We need people to do it.

359
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean maybe governments will step in.

360
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:52,480
Speaker 1: Maybe people will just do it for the hell of it.

361
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,908
Speaker 1: Maybe nonprofit organizations will spring up and do.

362
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:58,540
Speaker 0: I don't see like TV news going anywhere because TV news is just trash.

363
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,062
Speaker 1: It's not new.

364
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:02,640
Speaker 0: I know but they still they're gonna hire people to go make that trash news.

365
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:08,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then again with YouTube as video becomes more and more accessible on the internet It's gonna be the same thing all over again.

366
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,180
Speaker 0: I know but not for a while.

367
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,772
Speaker 1: No, not for at least three or four more years.

368
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:12,740
Speaker 0: Okay?

369
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,740
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if people out there use many of the social networks sites on the internets.

370
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,340
Speaker 0: You know, we use the Orcutt way back and then we stopped when Brazil took it over.

371
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know and since then there have been many other comers and you know There's big popular ones like the live journals and the Facebook's in the my spaces.

372
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:37,660
Speaker 0: Well Facebook has just done something quite extraordinary And I don't think any other site has done this and it's gonna be pretty interesting how this turns out.

373
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 0: Basically what they've done is they've opened up Facebook.

374
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:52,971
Speaker 0: They told people how it works not how it works 100% but they gave out enough information that you can make and enough You know openness so that you can make Applications within Facebook.

375
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:58,672
Speaker 0: so like I can make a Facebook Clock and now you can add it to your Facebook and now you have a clock there.

376
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:01,400
Speaker 0: or I know Facebook has a photo feature.

377
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:10,949
Speaker 0: I could go out and make Scott's special Facebook photo manager and it would replace your existing Facebook photo manager with my Better Facebook photo manager.

378
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,094
Speaker 1: now think about this.

379
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:13,420
Speaker 1: This is pretty revolutionary.

380
00:26:14,561 --> 00:26:24,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, Facebook is basically gone for being just an applique a website that allows people to connect with each other to an Applications platform.

381
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:36,665
Speaker 0: like you could make things on Facebook the same way you make things on Windows or Firefox or any other platform and What's gonna end up happening?

382
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:38,451
Speaker 0: Is that see Facebook?

383
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:40,056
Speaker 0: They're just letting people do this.

384
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,420
Speaker 0: They weren't charging them any money.

385
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,933
Speaker 0: They're not putting really any restrictions on what you do.

386
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:47,766
Speaker 0: Like I could make a special geek nights thing for Facebook.

387
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:58,161
Speaker 0: that is like ads in it that I sell and make money off of and the more people who Add it to Facebook the more money to their Facebook's the more money I get and the more advertising I do for geek nights and Whatever.

388
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:08,860
Speaker 0: and Facebook just doesn't care because they know that this sort of thing is what's gonna bring a lot of people to Facebook And it also means they're not going to have to do as much work as they were doing.

389
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:12,496
Speaker 0: Because now oh if the Facebook photo feature sucks, that's fine.

390
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:13,420
Speaker 0: Someone will make a better one.

391
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the Facebook this feature sucks, someone else will make a better one if people use that.

392
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:19,620
Speaker 0: so they basically cut their costs.

393
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaker 0: they brought in a whole bunch of users who are going to be attracted by all the things that Facebook can do and Someone else is doing all the work and Facebook is also actually a decent site.

394
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,666
Speaker 1: Meanwhile myspace is a cesspool.

395
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:37,320
Speaker 1: myspace is what the internet was if you looked at geocities over a decade ago.

396
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,633
Speaker 0: Yep, and I really think that this is the sort of thing that's gonna.

397
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:45,040
Speaker 0: you know myspace right now It's like a hundred million people and Facebook is like 20 million.

398
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:57,440
Speaker 0: But I really think that at least in the US with this if myspace doesn't make a move Facebook's gonna do them in well in the very least over time anyone with sense is gonna be on Facebook.

399
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:05,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, Facebook has basically said Well, we're just gonna make ours the best and suddenly the best end of story.

400
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:08,715
Speaker 1: Yeah It's a far cry from the days when we used or cuts.

401
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:14,556
Speaker 0: Yeah I just want to see what kind of interesting Facebook applications show up like.

402
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:18,500
Speaker 0: I mean someone might make a Facebook application somehow.

403
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:24,060
Speaker 0: That's just doesn't exist elsewhere on the web on its own and you might be worth it just to get Facebook accounts.

404
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:27,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, just to use some of the applications people make on Facebook.

405
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:33,800
Speaker 1: I'm I'm honestly not that far if this goes as we're hoping it will from just getting a geek nights Facebook.

406
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:38,620
Speaker 0: Geek nights Facebook is good Cuz I. I mean like this geek nights myspace that I registered just to save it.

407
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,394
Speaker 0: But I don't know how to use fucking myspace and the interface is so shitty.

408
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:42,460
Speaker 0: It wasn't even worth my time.

409
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I looked at it and if any of you out there use myspace.

410
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:49,057
Speaker 1: I'd like to know so I can track you down and get rid of you.

411
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:55,179
Speaker 0: Good God Yeah, but you know, I had a Facebook since I was at RIT, but I just barely used it.

412
00:28:55,461 --> 00:29:02,989
Speaker 0: but now I see that like, you know the one generation behind us like my brother and My cousins and they all use the Facebook crazily.

413
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:09,213
Speaker 0: and I imagine that if I went to college like three years later than I did I would also be using the Facebook crazily.

414
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:12,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean It was either that or Napster.

415
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,516
Speaker 0: So I'll take Napster.

416
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:15,626
Speaker 1: I Wow, yeah.

417
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:27,247
Speaker 1: Yeah Napster came and went and most people today I've never actually seen what Napster used to be it be every song ever available instantly No waiting, it just downloaded.

418
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:28,531
Speaker 0: you could find everything.

419
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:29,092
Speaker 1: Yep.

420
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:31,680
Speaker 1: I mean at least everything popular.

421
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything that was like released by a record label in the United States was there.

422
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:38,500
Speaker 0: everything else maybe there but it was off course.

423
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,454
Speaker 1: Remember the win MX and the open nap days right after that.

424
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were also good days.

425
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,640
Speaker 0: They're also good days, but Facebook the new hotness.

426
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:57,720
Speaker 0: I barely use my Facebook now like I Recently went on to it because it was my birthday and a bunch of people messaged me because I guess Facebook tells them that It's my birthday, but like I went in and I like oh, it's pretty nice, but I have no use for it.

427
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,860
Speaker 0: But if people make the right applications, well, I point out I'd suddenly have a use.

428
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:13,120
Speaker 1: I think one of the main reasons that we Personally and our group do not have a use for social networking software is that we have our own private Widely trafficked forum on the internet and that is true.

429
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:17,260
Speaker 1: We don't need anything to coordinate our social activities because we already do so actively.

430
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:21,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the thing is the social networking sites do things besides.

431
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:23,225
Speaker 0: Coordinate social activities like.

432
00:30:23,245 --> 00:30:29,866
Speaker 0: you can meet new people with similar interests in your same area and you can find people who are like Oh my god, randomly.

433
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:32,417
Speaker 0: There's a person very similar to myself that I did not know about.

434
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:35,216
Speaker 0: look at that true And that's really what the point of them is.

435
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:52,899
Speaker 0: plus I think there was a great article a long time ago That was like why social networking sites are really popular and it's because there's a you know While they probably don't do this quite often Basically the deep psychological instinct of using them is you think you're gonna get laid using them?

436
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:57,638
Speaker 0: Ah, and it the K had a pretty good case for that so well

437
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:09,640
Speaker 1: I think equally important is the idea that Culture at least when it comes to these current generations of people who are less and less tied to Localities that culture and locality are becoming very distinct from one another.

438
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:15,000
Speaker 1: I mean, I am culturally similar to all of you out there listening and all the geeks of the world.

439
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:21,720
Speaker 1: I have more in common with some D&D playing video game or geek in Norway or Japan or Australia.

440
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:26,573
Speaker 1: Then I do with 99% of the people who live within five miles of me.

441
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about it.

442
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:31,920
Speaker 0: ten years ago It culture was mostly at least for people who you know.

443
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,631
Speaker 0: I mean now it's still true for people who aren't connected.

444
00:31:34,812 --> 00:31:38,164
Speaker 0: but back in the day before there was a Possibility of being connected.

445
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:41,014
Speaker 0: there were no cell phones or internets or anything commonly available.

446
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:45,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, your culture was Ninety-nine percent of the time determined by where you lived.

447
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:49,595
Speaker 0: if you lived in Argentina your culture was Argentinian.

448
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:50,319
Speaker 0: now, that's true.

449
00:31:51,063 --> 00:31:54,540
Speaker 0: Still, you know most people in Argentina are probably still Argentinian in the culture.

450
00:31:55,101 --> 00:32:02,762
Speaker 0: But there are people in Argentina who are so connected to the world or technology that their culture is not Argentinian.

451
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,851
Speaker 0: it is geek internet dig whatever.

452
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:06,954
Speaker 0: It's something else.

453
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:09,000
Speaker 1: I would say geek because we you know.

454
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,608
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it could be anything, you know, they're not.

455
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,817
Speaker 0: there are other cultures that are coming into being on the internet.

456
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:20,499
Speaker 0: besides geek You know There are all sorts of other groups of people out on this internet doing things that we don't really pay attention to.

457
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:23,339
Speaker 1: well Like there's Brazilians and then there's the Orcut Brazilians.

458
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:29,240
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like we have dig which is like our cultural center, I guess right now, but there are other sites like this.

459
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,508
Speaker 1: Well, there's the corrosion community.

460
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's those kinds of people out there.

461
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,581
Speaker 0: There's.

462
00:32:32,823 --> 00:32:40,211
Speaker 1: there's all sorts of different new cultures coming into existence And I think it's wonderful these cultures couldn't have existed before.

463
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:43,720
Speaker 1: and think about how many it's kind of some internet anthropologists coming on.

464
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, I

465
00:32:44,202 --> 00:33:00,340
Speaker 1: mean not to draw upon this too heavily or make too many comparisons But back it during the early days of the feminist movement and the idea of the feminine mystique that a lot of people were unhappy With their lot, but they couldn't act like they were unhappy because they couldn't see any way to be happy.

466
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:03,715
Speaker 1: You see everyone else around you appears to be happy.

467
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:04,840
Speaker 1: You're the odd one out.

468
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,502
Speaker 1: You can't know that everyone else feels the same way you do or that there are people out there There's just like you.

469
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:20,560
Speaker 1: if you were a nerd who is into gaming and you lived in some backwater community in the 20s How are you going to be happy and find other people with similar interests or similar culture or anything?

470
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,450
Speaker 0: You're not going to.

471
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:24,673
Speaker 1: nowadays You can find that easily no matter where you live.

472
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:28,939
Speaker 1: if you can get on the internet You are now connected to other people who are just like you.

473
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:34,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and for better or for worse, you know, it allows the geeks to connect as well as the pedophiles.

474
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,091
Speaker 0: But you know, I wouldn't while that's bad.

475
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,720
Speaker 0: I wouldn't trade it away just to stop those people.

476
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,388
Speaker 1: Well, every advance has its costs and his benefits.

477
00:33:42,729 --> 00:34:00,469
Speaker 1: I mean we got the printing press and we lost peasants And we gained pornography Things of the day.

478
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:02,378
Speaker 0: So how am I doing the show?

479
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:03,402

Speaker 1: It's going okay.

00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,670
Speaker 1: unless I have trouble setting up the new computer

490
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:31,511
Speaker 0: I

491
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:41,960
Speaker 1: Might even if even if all the hardware works I got to install windows and then I got to install Ubuntu and then I got to get everything working the way I want it And then I got to make sure the new sound card works.

492
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,556
Speaker 1: decide if I want to use the old side It's fine.

493
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:45,185
Speaker 1: all that crap.

494
00:34:45,206 --> 00:34:45,550
Speaker 0: That's right.

495
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,647
Speaker 0: Well people always talk about how geek nights is super egotistical and I don't really.

496
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:52,398
Speaker 0: I always ask them Well, what part of the show is egotistical?

497
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,230
Speaker 0: and they always don't say anything and they don't have an answer for me.

498
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,576
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna say something.

499
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,520
Speaker 0: egotistical you ready?

500
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,287
Speaker 0: You're listening to geek nights right now.

501
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:00,572
Speaker 0: this episode This is an episode.

502
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:02,078
Speaker 0: We're doing while gravely ill.

503
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:03,563
Speaker 0: not gravely ill but but ill.

504
00:35:04,065 --> 00:35:05,289
Speaker 0: think about how good the show is.

505
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,321
Speaker 0: This is what we do and we're sick.

506
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,890
Speaker 0: think about what it's like when we're not sick.

507
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,401
Speaker 0: That's how badass we are.

508
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:11,288
Speaker 0: Everyone else sucks.

509
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,541
Speaker 1: now I picture our good friend Scott Johnson who is one of the.

510
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:19,818
Speaker 1: he's not a king of insults, but he's definitely a prince and He likes to say your mom a lot.

511
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is when other people say your mom.

512
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,090
Speaker 1: It's just stupid but he says it with such frequency and in such a way with such impeccable.

513
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,078
Speaker 0: Dick is just saying your mom.

514
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:32,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he would say I know what he would have said to what you just said.

515
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,664
Speaker 1: He would said something along the lines of well, I guess you've never been healthy.

516
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:40,902
Speaker 0: Oh Like a little Statler and Waldorf action something like that.

517
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:42,990
Speaker 1: All right, so that's a good thing of the day.

518
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,733
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use it.

519
00:35:43,914 --> 00:35:44,516
Speaker 0: Okay later.

520
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:46,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one no one knows about it.

521
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:47,509
Speaker 0: You didn't hear what he just said.

522
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,782
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, you think I'm editing tonight?

523
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:51,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

524
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:57,670
Speaker 0: So Today's Memorial Day and last Friday was actually two different holidays.

525
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,949
Speaker 0: It was towel day and the day of New Hope simultaneously.

526
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,558
Speaker 0: now You might be like what the fuck holidays are they?

527
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,110
Speaker 0: what kind of holidays towel day or day of New Hope?

528
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,417
Speaker 1: Well, it's a perfectly cromulant holiday.

529
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:11,761
Speaker 0: Absolutely cromulant.

530
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:17,165
Speaker 0: Basically one holiday is a holiday that celebrates Star Wars.

531
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:20,000
Speaker 0: cuz on Friday the 25th.

532
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:29,022
Speaker 0: not Friday But May 25th in 1977 was the day that Star Wars a New Hope opened in theaters.

533
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:34,119
Speaker 1: now for those of you who saw Star Wars in the theater When it came out, don't you feel old?

534
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,383
Speaker 0: You're super old.

535
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,126
Speaker 1: You're older than me.

536
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:38,113
Speaker 0: I wasn't alive then I wasn't.

537
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,120
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be bored yet for five years.

538
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:45,561
Speaker 0: I wasn't even a twinkle in my daddy's eye Wasn't even not even a sperm yet.

539
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,428
Speaker 1: Well, you might have been a twinkle in Ron Jeremy's.

540
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:47,990
Speaker 1: I know.

541
00:36:49,058 --> 00:36:58,390
Speaker 0: And Also, it is towel day a day set where you must carry around a towel in celebration of Douglas Adams affinity for towels.

542
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:07,590
Speaker 1: Yes, I actually did because I was cleaning my room anyway And when I left the house, I had my tiger towel from the RIT hockey games and I brought that with me in the car.

543
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was gonna take a towel but all of my towels are too large.

544
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:11,570
Speaker 0: I needed a smaller.

545
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,838
Speaker 1: Well, you don't own towels you own basically bath sheets.

546
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:14,460
Speaker 0: Yeah.

547
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta get me some small towels.

548
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:16,849
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

549
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:17,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

550
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:25,550
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically my thing of the day is I use Google Calendar Like I've never actually successfully used a calendar application in my life.

551
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,305
Speaker 0: Like I kept trying and none of them like stuck.

552
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:33,705
Speaker 0: like I tried to use that Mozilla Sunbird and it just I tried to use it and then I just stopped using it.

553
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:38,905
Speaker 0: but Google Calendar I'm actually using and continuing to use it's amazing.

554
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:44,287
Speaker 1: We even use it for the show And we have a Google Calendar full of every show we're doing for like the next two months.

555
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:50,490
Speaker 0: Yep But what one feature of Google Calendar is that you can find you can share your calendars.

556
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:55,130
Speaker 0: I mean if someone else has shared a calendar you can add it to your calendar view.

557
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,603
Speaker 1: No, we're not sharing the future of geek nights calendar.

558
00:37:58,904 --> 00:37:59,888
Speaker 1: No, don't ask.

559
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:06,130
Speaker 0: Yes But for example, I have the the Scott Rubin calendar, which is the things I'm doing personally and that's sort of hidden.

560
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:10,023
Speaker 0: I have the front row crew calendar, which is like what conventions we're going to.

561
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,625
Speaker 0: that's public.

562
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:13,757
Speaker 0: I have the Jewish holiday calendar.

563
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:24,237
Speaker 0: just so I know even though I'm not really super Jewish I have the US holiday calendar for obvious reasons and I have the geek holiday Calendar and that is my thing of the day.

564
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:25,822
Speaker 0: It is a geek holiday calendar.

565
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:29,749
Speaker 0: It will tell you every geek holiday and It's pretty useful.

566
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:40,825
Speaker 0: I mean the 27th which was yesterday was WordPress day and the next geek holiday coming up is happy ripping day on July 14th followed by Firefox day on the 15th.

567
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:41,810
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

568
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,263
Speaker 0: So geek holidays, are you a geek?

569
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:45,530
Speaker 0: I'll break that shit.

570
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:48,281
Speaker 1: I can say I celebrate more geeky holidays than I do.

571
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:50,690
Speaker 1: I guess quote unquote real holidays.

572
00:38:51,032 --> 00:39:03,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I don't really celebrate more than any other is September 19th Of course, of course granted shouted the sky day was always a favorite, but that's a very very small Internal somewhat inside holiday.

573
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:08,361
Speaker 0: Yes, we should Dedicate we should figure out what day that is and put it on.

574
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:18,750
Speaker 1: it was hard to say because in Rochester it felt like every day Actually my second favorite sadly out of the sky day, it's every day but only in Rochester, New York.

575
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:31,107
Speaker 0: I might possibly live to see another one, but International Day of Slayer Yeah, that's a great holiday right there Sadly one of the top five holidays of the year.

576
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:37,389
Speaker 1: sadly I was unable to celebrate International Day of Slayer in the manner so prescribed by the people who invented it.

577
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:43,590
Speaker 1: I was not able to play Slayer at full volume 24/7 whilst I went about my business.

578
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:45,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would go deaf if I did that.

579
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,883
Speaker 0: That's the only reason I don't.

580
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:48,290
Speaker 1: I don't think my co-workers would have liked it.

581
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,230
Speaker 1: I probably would have been fired and possibly killed.

582
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:51,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I did.

583
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,305
Speaker 0: I did play some and listen to some Slayer.

584
00:39:53,546 --> 00:40:02,402
Speaker 1: on the International Day of Slayer I actually just put all of my Slayer on a loop and just played it all day and my computer whether or not I was Talking about a way to market.

585
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:09,430
Speaker 0: All right people Let's figure out which day of the year has the least geek nights listening action and make that international day of geek nights.

586
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,840
Speaker 0: I've asked listen to geek nights all day at full volume.

587
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,845
Speaker 0: So everyone else can hear it.

588
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:13,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds good to me.

589
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:16,326
Speaker 0: Ram you're working on the station identifications, right?

590
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:21,115
Speaker 0: We got to put those wacky Wwek radio.

591
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:21,617
Speaker 0: Yeah.

592
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:21,898
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:22,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:24,187
Speaker 1: Oh that actually really hurt with my throat.

595
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:24,870
Speaker 1: I couldn't do it.

596
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:32,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, my throat was like I was sick with the throat a little bit yesterday the day before like a tiny bit But now it's gone and it's just head congestion.

597
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a bad throat thing going.

598
00:40:34,157 --> 00:40:35,242
Speaker 1: I still got a little touch of it.

599
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:35,864
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

600
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,250
Speaker 1: I have a pretty dodgy throat.

601
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,217
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, your throat is way dodgy.

602
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,582
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're actually kind of worried.

603
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:41,265
Speaker 0: You're not sick.

604
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,750
Speaker 0: You're like coughing up phlegm and shit.

605
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,790
Speaker 1: We're actually kind of worried because we're doing a lot of live shows this summer at a couple of conventions.

606
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:55,102
Speaker 1: We're doing like three conventions in the month of July alone and we're doing like 10 or 11 December at one of these conventions.

607
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:56,208
Speaker 0: we're doing a lot of shit.

608
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:03,460
Speaker 1: now I point out that we both lost our voices at one convention where we did One live show.

609
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,510
Speaker 0: Well, we lost it before the live show.

610
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:14,959
Speaker 1: Yes the live show was when we went into Overdrive and kicked it up to 11 by drugging ourselves so that we could actually make our live appearance Thanks to the halls of medicine.

611
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:16,025
Speaker 0: Yeah next year though.

612
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,030
Speaker 0: We should use Rico.

613
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:25,710
Speaker 1: Actually, I think joke about it We should find because there are a lot of experts in the area find professional speech therapists and get vocal training.

614
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,060
Speaker 0: It's a little bit of money and time.

615
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:28,604
Speaker 1: It's not that expensive.

616
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:29,469
Speaker 0: I don't have that right now.

617
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:33,530
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look into it because we could probably learn how to do this better.

618
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll look at to the SSR first then then we'll talk.

619
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:36,264
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:41:36,284 --> 00:41:49,122
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, uh We were sick and all that and I realized that nothing makes a sickness or a bad day feel somewhat mitigated Better than making someone else feel just as bad.

621
00:41:49,142 --> 00:41:51,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, and thus my thing of the day.

622
00:41:52,132 --> 00:42:00,999
Speaker 1: Emily showed this to me and she wasn't quite sure what to make of it other than she was laughing hysterically And I watched it and I'm also not sure what to make.

623
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,203
Speaker 0: I was laughing hysterically.

624
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:10,310
Speaker 1: I was laughing but more in that Like you know when the Joker kills you with this horrible gas and you laugh just before you die.

625
00:42:10,651 --> 00:42:13,599
Speaker 0: Yes, that is that is how I was laughing but only on the inside.

626
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,045
Speaker 1: It's just watch the video.

627
00:42:16,105 --> 00:42:16,787
Speaker 1: I linked to.

628
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:27,450
Speaker 1: it's about Willow and when I say willow, I don't mean hot willow from that vampire Buffy whatever show I mean Lucas Arts will Teeny baby.

629
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:31,190
Speaker 1: Yes, that willow the best willow as far as I'm concerned.

630
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:34,301
Speaker 0: If you haven't seen that movie go get it now.

631
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:36,510
Speaker 1: the little peckers gonna throw an acorn at me.

632
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:39,021
Speaker 0: I barely remember it, but I remember it.

633
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,910
Speaker 1: Oh god, I could do a show about that.

634
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:46,233
Speaker 1: I got to see it again But then I could do a show but put it in the Netflix queue and we'll do a show whenever we get to that point In the queue.

635
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:55,750
Speaker 0: All right, also ten years from now when it comes up We'll realize how long and you know Because think about it in like I don't know maybe five years they'll be like up.

636
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:59,139
Speaker 0: It's the 25th anniversary of willow special edition DVD.

637
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,042
Speaker 1: That'll do it.

638
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:00,423
Speaker 1: Yep.

639
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:01,566
Speaker 0: That's what's gonna get us.

640
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:02,629
Speaker 1: So, uh, all right.

641
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, no last week on the show.

642
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:06,566
Speaker 0: Oh, did you do your thing of the day?

643
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:07,350
Speaker 1: I was in the middle.

644
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,033
Speaker 0: Oh, wow, you didn't.

645
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:09,078
Speaker 0: I was trying to jump ahead.

646
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:09,661
Speaker 0: Yeah, you were.

647
00:43:10,003 --> 00:43:11,088
Speaker 0: oh that's apples when I'm sick.

648
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:11,550
Speaker 0: It's okay.

649
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:17,109
Speaker 1: Okay, I wasn't gonna say much more other than I'm not sure what to make of this.

650
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:21,590
Speaker 0: There are some things I know about it and that these are the kind of people I see at gaming conventions.

651
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:27,410
Speaker 0: They're scary and I don't like them But at the same time they are geeks and they are sort of like our distant cousins.

652
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:30,841
Speaker 1: I could get the sense that it was done in jest.

653
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:40,675
Speaker 1: However, the fact that I am not 100% certain that this was done entirely in jest is what Confuses and disturbs me.

654
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:44,569
Speaker 0: and even if it was done in jest it doesn't jest me it disturbs me.

655
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:47,520
Speaker 1: So granted I watched the whole thing I did.

656
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,763
Speaker 1: I was somewhat entertained because rim didn't close the window Yeah, but I noticed that you didn't violently protest.

657
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:54,290
Speaker 0: I somewhat protested.

658
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:57,385
Speaker 0: I said why are we still watching this like three times as you kept watching?

659
00:43:57,425 --> 00:43:59,193
Speaker 1: you could have averted your eyes But you didn't.

660
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:00,177
Speaker 0: it was.

661
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:08,436
Speaker 0: it was like it wasn't like goat see where I have to or tub girl Where I have to avert my eyes, it was kind of like looking into the Ark of the Covenant Kind of kind of.

662
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:24,849
Speaker 1: uh, I I now I did a little bit of research I found I tracked down more about who did it, but I haven't really tracked down why and If any of you feel like figuring out the whole story and telling us exactly what this is all about I would be I guess grateful.

663
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, watch the video and you'll see what I mean.

664
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:31,867
Speaker 1: And in the very least I know you're gonna say and try to stop watching and it's not sick or anything.

665
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:34,269
Speaker 1: Don't worry about that It's just about willow to music video.

666
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:42,963
Speaker 1: Don't stop watching until you've at least seen some of the music video part because the first bit is just lead up to the music Video, I don't understand how it was lead up.

667
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:47,270
Speaker 0: as far as I was concerned It was just the stuff that happened before the music video part.

668
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:51,544
Speaker 0: It had no meaning or relation to the music video whatsoever as far as I could tell.

669
00:44:51,604 --> 00:44:53,209
Speaker 1: but oh she shall sing.

670
00:44:53,937 --> 00:44:54,970
Speaker 0: Yes, all right.

671
00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:05,182
Speaker 0: So last week we were trying to do a theme week the how to get into it week where we told you how to get Into various geekeries if you are not into them, unfortunately starting starting on Wednesday.

672
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:12,589
Speaker 0: It was how to get into throat infections Yeah, so as a result it was a theme half-week.

673
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:18,990
Speaker 0: well That's good for us because that's actually a theme week with I think we have more than four ideas for.

674
00:45:19,451 --> 00:45:26,410
Speaker 0: Therefore we have decided to go easy on ourselves and hopefully entertaining for you and continue it to make it a theme week and a half.

675
00:45:26,912 --> 00:45:34,173
Speaker 0: And today we will talk about something people have clamored for quite a bit how to get into Computer programming.

676
00:45:34,313 --> 00:45:36,639
Speaker 0: now, I am a computer programmer.

677
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:43,603
Speaker 0: I am NOT rim is not so I'm a best computer scripter Yes, so I think the best way to start out is.

678
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:50,730
Speaker 0: a lot of people out there They they talk about coding and programming this but they don't really know what programming is.

679
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:57,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a lot of people say things like yeah, I was coding HTML the other day and that's not really coding it It's a really it's a different thing.

680
00:45:57,944 --> 00:46:05,709
Speaker 0: Yes Basically you have a chip in your computer and it's a Pentium or a. what a cord to or an AMD whatever it is.

681
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,258
Speaker 0: It's a freaking I don't know.

682
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,507
Speaker 1: Apple - it's an x86.

683
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,564
Speaker 0: Yeah it's some chip of some sort and that chip has a bunch of wires going into it.

684
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:16,497
Speaker 0: a lot of them like hundreds of them and They're the in wires.

685
00:46:16,517 --> 00:46:21,529
Speaker 0: They're also out wires, but don't worry about those and You can either on any of those wires.

686
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,360
Speaker 0: You can choose to send electricity or not send electricity.

687
00:46:25,922 --> 00:46:29,453
Speaker 0: and let's say you have I don't know a three gigahertz Processor.

688
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:36,669
Speaker 0: every second the chip will look at those wires Three three billion times to see what's there?

689
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,385
Speaker 0: So you basically have to change what the what whether those wires have electricity or not.

690
00:46:42,726 --> 00:47:03,090
Speaker 0: three billion times a second the chip will depending on which wires are on and which wires are off do something inside of itself and then output something on the other end on the output wires, which are many and Computer programming in as best as I can tell you is Controlling the what whether those wires are on or off.

691
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:06,310
Speaker 0: Does that sound exciting to you now luckily?

692
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:15,381
Speaker 1: programming has advanced a long way and there are many layers of Programming between the physical chip and you and your application.

693
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:18,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can roughly break it up into low level and high level.

694
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:26,761
Speaker 0: yes, when people talk about people talk about things like assembly language and Basically what because we have modern technology.

695
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:29,030
Speaker 0: back in the day people really did like an ENIAC.

696
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:38,059
Speaker 0: They would literally turn all these inputs on and off and then push a button then turn them all on switch them all again Push a button and repeat that process many times.

697
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:49,289
Speaker 0: then they had punch cards or basically you would punch the cards Which switches you want switched at which times you fed the cards into the machine and depending on what you punched It would turn them on and off.

698
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:54,110
Speaker 1: I mean now at the bottom you've got machine code, which is literally just ones and zeros.

699
00:47:54,331 --> 00:48:12,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll just in a row but now thanks to modern technology you can type on a computer things that look almost like English words or sometimes our English words and That will be translated for you by existing programs into the sequence of turning the switches on and off.

700
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:23,916
Speaker 0: So programming is typing in the words Or whatever depending on which language you choose into the computer that tell the computer what to do and That is how you make software.

701
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:25,742
Speaker 0: It's how Microsoft Word is made.

702
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,427
Speaker 0: It's how Firefox is made.

703
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:30,429
Speaker 0: That's how Pokemon is made.

704
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:32,201
Speaker 0: So World of Warcraft is made.

705
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:41,990
Speaker 0: all those things are made By someone typing words into the computer that tell it which switches to turn on and off when to and then that's it.

706
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:49,215
Speaker 1: Now we're not gonna go into a lot more detail than that about how programming works or different languages because that is not the show We're not talking about to it.

707
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:50,039
Speaker 1: What programming is?

708
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,907
Speaker 1: we're talking about how to become a programmer.

709
00:48:52,188 --> 00:48:58,210
Speaker 0: Yep Well becoming a programmer is sort of tricky because a lot of people say ah, what language should I learn?

710
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,254
Speaker 0: I learn this language.

711
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:03,170
Speaker 0: I learn that language and I always tell them you shouldn't learn a language.

712
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:08,030
Speaker 0: Don't learn a language because when you learn a language, you don't learn anything about languages.

713
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:16,830
Speaker 0: It's like if you learn say French right you learn French specifically You're not gonna also know Spanish or also know Italian by magic.

714
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:30,325
Speaker 0: But if you learn Latin languages, you will know French Spanish Italian and all other similar Latin based languages Very easily if you learn the more generic concepts behind Latin based languages.

715
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:43,054
Speaker 1: also to extend the analogy in America the United States when people learn English Part of this is because the American educational system people don't actually learn a lot of the finer finer points of grammar or why things Are the way they are.

716
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:45,529
Speaker 1: they just learn English because they use it all the time.

717
00:49:45,951 --> 00:49:50,540
Speaker 1: so people have a working knowledge of English, but they don't really understand the hows and whys.

718
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:57,309
Speaker 1: and I can say that I learned a lot more about English language when I studied French than I ever did in any English class.

719
00:49:57,711 --> 00:50:10,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, because by learning and learning about things like conjugation which they don't teach you about English conjugation But they taught me about Spanish conjugation when I took it for like in middle school in high school And then I said hey English has conjugation - look at that.

720
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:25,090
Speaker 1: And I guess much more important in programming as with language then learning how to do a specific thing in a specific language is Learning what things there are to do what generic ways there are to do them and just the basics of how programming works.

721
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:31,865
Speaker 0: Yep Okay, so there are many different ideas for how programming languages should work.

722
00:50:31,926 --> 00:50:37,063
Speaker 0: there are procedural languages There are functional languages there assembly languages, whatever.

723
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,829
Speaker 1: what about those semi vs?

724
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, aspect oriented programming language?

725
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:50,441
Speaker 0: There are lots of different theories as to how a language should work, and I'm not going to talk about language theory But there are languages that work on different principles from others.

726
00:50:50,942 --> 00:50:53,550
Speaker 0: now for example C is a functional language.

727
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,453
Speaker 0: So is Pascal?

728
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:57,262
Speaker 0: if you learn just see you'll know.

729
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:59,730
Speaker 0: see if you learn Pascal you'll know Pascal.

730
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:07,581
Speaker 0: But if you learn the concepts of functional programming languages It won't be very difficult for you to make programs in C or Pascal.

731
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:14,170
Speaker 0: if you have a book that tells you the syntax Which is just which words do you type which is not nothing you need to remember?

732
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:22,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you know a book or the internet to tell you if you know what you want to do And you know what language you're using you have a reference no matter who you are.

733
00:51:22,271 --> 00:51:26,917
Speaker 1: You can just follow the book and make it do what you wanted it to do But you're not gonna learn a lot from doing that.

734
00:51:26,957 --> 00:51:39,130
Speaker 0: yep in the modern world we have developed a new relatively new like in the 90s Theory of computer programming languages that allows for a type of language called the object oriented language.

735
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:42,442
Speaker 0: I could talk a whole show about object oriented languages and someday.

736
00:51:42,503 --> 00:51:46,581
Speaker 0: I will if someone posted in the forums, but Object oriented languages?

737
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:47,729
Speaker 0: they thought it was a fad.

738
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:48,774
Speaker 0: And it's not.

739
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:52,890
Speaker 0: object orientation is the way that most programming languages work.

740
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,730
Speaker 0: It is the proper way to write programs these days.

741
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:56,372
Speaker 0: It is the.

742
00:51:56,733 --> 00:52:00,885
Speaker 0: an object oriented language is the is the language of choice for most applications.

743
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:05,276
Speaker 0: It is the prevailing Everything and what you should.

744
00:52:05,336 --> 00:52:10,093
Speaker 0: if you go to any school object orientation is the first thing they will teach you is the first thing They taught me at RIT.

745
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,164
Speaker 0: This is what they taught me in high school.

746
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:13,290
Speaker 0: This is what they teach.

747
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:14,326
Speaker 0: It's what people use.

748
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:20,770
Speaker 0: So if you want to become a computer programmer and first decide if some programming is something you really want to do based on what?

749
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:28,735
Speaker 0: I said before and then learn the fundamental principles of object oriented design Like what is an object?

750
00:52:28,996 --> 00:52:29,738
Speaker 0: You know?

751
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:31,403
Speaker 0: What is an object method?

752
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:34,010
Speaker 0: How do you private and public in?

753
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,599
Speaker 0: Polymorphism Instantiation yeah all those.

754
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:43,749
Speaker 0: when you learn those concepts of Object how oriented laying object orientation works?

755
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,663
Speaker 0: You will be able to pick up any object oriented language and use it like.

756
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:50,218
Speaker 0: I had to do a job once and I need To learn Ruby.

757
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,090
Speaker 0: I didn't know Ruby.

758
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:54,506
Speaker 0: I picked up a book and the book had the syntax of Ruby in.

759
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:55,430
Speaker 0: it was actually online.

760
00:52:56,093 --> 00:53:05,449
Speaker 0: I learned Ruby in a week because I already knew how object oriented languages worked and this is an object oriented language, so I just looked at it, and I drew on what I already knew.

761
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:06,973
Speaker 0: and There you go.

762
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:07,576
Speaker 0: I know Ruby.

763
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:13,050
Speaker 0: if you give me a book on any object oriented language I can pretty much write a program in it almost immediately.

764
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:19,794
Speaker 0: And if you want to be able to do that don't learn like I'm gonna learn PHP or I'm gonna learn C++.

765
00:53:19,815 --> 00:53:20,279
Speaker 0: don't do that.

766
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,570
Speaker 0: That's that's basically.

767
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,181
Speaker 0: It's like learning how to use one tool.

768
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,190
Speaker 0: That's like saying I'm gonna be a carpenter I'm gonna learn how to use a screwdriver.

769
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:28,856
Speaker 0: You don't learn how to use a screwdriver.

770
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:34,218
Speaker 0: you learn how to use tools in general and then you can pick up any tool And you know how to use it.

771
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,470
Speaker 0: and then depending on what job you have Let's say you come up to a job and the job is to hammer a nail into the wall.

772
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,938
Speaker 0: Well, I only learned how to use a screwdriver.

773
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:43,199
Speaker 0: Well.

774
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,510
Speaker 0: I guess you could get a nail into a wall with a screwdriver.

775
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, and by the same token you can write whatever you want to write in Visual Basic if you want.

776
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could write a website in Visual Basic.

777
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,290
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be pleasant for you.

778
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,262
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like hammering a nail into the wall with a screwdriver.

779
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:02,050
Speaker 1: I have done both yep.

780
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:11,100
Speaker 0: So if you know the correct a bunch of languages and the generic concepts of languages You can pick the right tool for the job.

781
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,874
Speaker 0: if you need to write a big production website You can learn.

782
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:18,005
Speaker 0: you know PHP or Python inside a day.

783
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:23,950
Speaker 0: if you need to make some like Linux kernel module you can learn C pretty quick even though C is an object oriented.

784
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:28,450
Speaker 0: But you know you can learn these things very quickly once you understand the fundamentals.

785
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,040
Speaker 1: So I guess along those lines don't just think of.

786
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,048
Speaker 1: you know you want to learn the fundamentals of programming.

787
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:36,449
Speaker 1: basically Which kind of is easier to say than to do?

788
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,481
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you don't learn how to drive a Ford Taurus.

789
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:41,570
Speaker 0: you learn how to drive, and then you can drive anything.

790
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:43,578
Speaker 0: That's how programming languages are.

791
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:47,794
Speaker 1: well see almost anything because you still can't drive the semi-truck cuz that's okay I drive the semi-truck.

792
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:48,216
Speaker 0: That's true.

793
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,707
Speaker 1: and some programming languages in the same way.

794
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:54,629
Speaker 0: yep I can't just suddenly write assembly if you can do Python and PHP.

795
00:54:56,073 --> 00:55:04,927
Speaker 0: But anyway if you want to learn these things there is actually one place I recommend you go to start out and determine if you actually are going to like programming.

796
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:05,870
Speaker 0: don't do it.

797
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:09,083
Speaker 0: Don't continue to do it if you don't like it, but there is a book.

798
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:10,570
Speaker 0: you can read it online for free.

799
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:17,282
Speaker 0: It is distributed with the GNU free documentation license And it is called how to think like a computer scientist.

800
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:20,689
Speaker 0: if you just search Google for how to think like a computer scientist You'll find it right away.

801
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:29,844
Speaker 0: I'll link to it in the forum or on the site or something and it uses Python Which is pretty easy to get and it works on Mac and Linux and Windows.

802
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:30,827
Speaker 0: just fine.

803
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:31,750
Speaker 1: Python is great.

804
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:41,450
Speaker 0: I gotta say it's really good for learners because you can just type Python on the command line and then type in Python code And it'll immediately be interpreted and executed.

805
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:45,987
Speaker 0: Yep You'll be able to learn how different Python commands work very easily with that.

806
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:46,248
Speaker 0: so that

807
00:55:46,268 --> 00:56:02,850
Speaker 1: was a big Frustration a lot of people I remember had in IT when I was taking Java classes because I was one of the last classes where All the programming we did just by the Institute policy Was visual basic and then they turned it into Java right after I'd finished all that crap.

808
00:56:03,122 --> 00:56:14,603
Speaker 1: Yeah So I took a Java class just to learn Java and force myself to because I wouldn't have learned it on my own I wouldn't have bothered and a lot of people had trouble Because you actually have to do a lot to make Java do some pretty basic things.

809
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:16,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, Java is really a language.

810
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:20,830
Speaker 0: It's object oriented, but it's designed for large enterprise applications.

811
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,850
Speaker 0: So if you're not making a large enterprise application with it, it's sort of cumbersome.

812
00:56:24,912 --> 00:56:34,130
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean like trying to chop like cut down your tomato plant with a chainsaw Like my experience of using Java would say you want to make a big GUI interface for something in Java.

813
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:48,555
Speaker 1: The amount of effort it took to make one button in the upper like just one button that you clicked on Versus the effort to make an entire GUI It was practically the same because once you put up you had you spent more time doing the framework than the actual bits inside Of the framework.

814
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:56,610
Speaker 0: So if you want to get into computer programming I recommend if you're still like a high school kid take every high school class that your school has available.

815
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,797
Speaker 0: I don't care how shitty it is.

816
00:56:57,817 --> 00:57:00,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they still shitty but you'll learn something.

817
00:57:00,612 --> 00:57:04,710
Speaker 1: Also, you might meet the smart computer instructor who will give you a little help on the side.

818
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:05,971
Speaker 1: Yep Learn

819
00:57:06,232 --> 00:57:23,929
Speaker 0: take this book that I just linked to the how to think like a computer scientist and just go through it from beginning to end and as long as you're still interested in having fun, you know that you're gonna like this business and That'll learn you a whole lot like a lot more than most people who graduate from college.

820
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,780
Speaker 0: No It's kind of sad.

821
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:25,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:57:26,102 --> 00:57:26,585
Speaker 1: Yeah.

823
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:33,830
Speaker 0: Then if you really like it, of course going to college even like a community college is not a bad idea.

824
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:38,567
Speaker 0: And of course if you go to the bookstore, there are books with animals on them.

825
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:39,550
Speaker 0: They're the O'Reilly books.

826
00:57:39,691 --> 00:57:40,918
Speaker 0: Oh really by O'Reilly?

827
00:57:40,938 --> 00:57:42,486
Speaker 0: Yes, don't buy books.

828
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:45,850
Speaker 0: pretty much I mean there are good books published by other companies.

829
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:54,749
Speaker 0: But you really can't go wrong with an O'Reilly book like I. own many of them and they're all awesome as references or as learning tools or whatever.

830
00:57:54,769 --> 00:58:05,090
Speaker 0: and If you give me an O'Reilly book on anything the computer related because I think most of them are computer related I will learn that thing as fast as I can read that book if not faster.

831
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:08,199
Speaker 0: So if you want to learn say I don't know pearl.

832
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:14,959
Speaker 0: go out and there's a book called learning pearl or like programming pearl and has a picture of like a camel on it.

833
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,099
Speaker 0: and that book if you read it will learn you pearl and It's well worth like the 30 or whatever dollars.

834
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:23,970
Speaker 0: They charge for the thing buy it on Amazon to get a discount.

835
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:31,559
Speaker 1: And I think on that note just because we're tired and sick and I gotta go to bed Hey, we have work tomorrow and such that's it.

836
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's because it's really that's all you need to do to get into programming.

837
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:40,924
Speaker 0: There's so much free information on the internet because of open source stuff that you could just learn it.

838
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:45,450
Speaker 0: if you want to everything you need is out there all The tools all the software all the everything.

839
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,590
Speaker 1: I guess the only other tips are one have some sort of goal in mind like we've said with a lot of young.

840
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:52,189
Speaker 1: Otherwise you just you'll stop putting the effort in.

841
00:58:52,209 --> 00:59:02,183
Speaker 0: Yep That's I always find that even though I know how to write software If I don't have a specific goal in mind like if I sit down and say I'm gonna learn Pearl down I can't actually learn it.

842
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:03,610
Speaker 0: I just don't do it.

843
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:05,957
Speaker 0: You know, I just play a game or something.

844
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:17,581
Speaker 0: instead if I actually have a goal like I am going to make this thing Using this then I will actually end up learning the thing in the act of accomplishing the goal and it has to be a goal I really want.

845
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,809
Speaker 0: though if it's a goal I don't really want I'll just give up because I don't want to do it.

846
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:32,550
Speaker 0: so find something software or something you actually want to make badly and then Figure out what the best tool for the job is and just do it and you'll learn in the process of the doing.

847
00:59:34,033 --> 00:59:35,003
Speaker 0: I think that's all I got.

848
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:35,630
Speaker 0: I gotta go to bed.
