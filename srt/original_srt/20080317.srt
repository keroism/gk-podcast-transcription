Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,679
Speaker 0: Scott talks about what computer programming languages are.

5
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:26,919
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,655
Speaker 0: You know my car I'm not gonna.

7
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:46,390
Speaker 0: I'll say this openly because if any police officers listen to this show and Happen to be police officers in a jurisdiction that covers me You're probably cool enough to not come after me or even care because we did something illegal.

8
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:51,958
Speaker 0: I've done something illegal Continuously sin for about seven months now.

9
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,840
Speaker 1: What do you been doing?

10
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,087
Speaker 0: I've been driving an uninspected car.

11
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,470
Speaker 0: Oh good job Yeah, but I did look it up.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,610
Speaker 0: The fine is like 20 bucks if they catch you and you have to go get the inspection which I renewed my car on time.

13
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:04,474
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

14
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,590
Speaker 0: Well, the reason I didn't was that the last time I renewed my car.

15
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:18,746
Speaker 0: I've told this story before but I went to the mechanic some shady mechanic and Yonkers cuz near my work back then and I was Hey, I need an inspection and he says you want me to actually inspect it or you just want the sticker.

16
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,815
Speaker 0: and I said Yeah, and he inspect.

17
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,760
Speaker 0: I told him to really inspect it and it passed.

18
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:30,458
Speaker 0: but I know my front shocks are shot Mm-hmm, they're completely shot.

19
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:34,130
Speaker 0: All right, but then again, I don't know exactly what it takes to pass a New York State inspection.

20
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,736
Speaker 0: Nope, so I took my.

21
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,580
Speaker 1: you could look it out.

22
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know much about cars either.

23
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:57,888
Speaker 0: I remember but way back when my front right control arm bushing was broken and I knew what a bushing was And I think I knew what a control arm was but I wasn't quite sure what the front right control arm bushing was and I tried to look under my car and I didn't even I Couldn't even tell what was broken and the guy was like, yeah, I have to fix this.

24
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,590
Speaker 0: But then I learned what it was like, oh, okay, and it made sense.

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,010
Speaker 0: I'm glad I got it fixed but my car is a lot of minor problems and I took it and I'm like it's kind of old.

26
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:16,334
Speaker 0: I decided alright, my deal is unless it's a new car I'm gonna go find some shady mechanic because a shady mechanic who is certified and Gets business.

27
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:16,475
Speaker 0: Yeah.

28
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:24,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you inspect cars in New York You have to put this metal sign on your mechanic shop in plain view that says we are certified to inspect cars.

29
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,313
Speaker 1: And this is big.

30
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,905
Speaker 1: they got a big yellow sign and the big green sign was.

31
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:33,370
Speaker 1: they say different things But if you see those signs on a building you can get your car inspected there.

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:44,181
Speaker 0: Yep, now beyond all that pretty much what I've learned throughout my life is that you don't want to go to a scuzzy looking mechanic But you want to go to a kind of rough-and-tumble looking mechanic.

33
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:52,644
Speaker 0: because those are the people who if they're still in business It means they know enough about cars to keep getting business And two people like that tend to be a lot more resource or they

34
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,623
Speaker 1: have to be a great Location where the cars break down all the time like

35
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,950
Speaker 0: the shitty one in Yonkers.

36
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I needed to get this inspection.

37
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:11,250
Speaker 0: So I looked in beacon and there's a bunch of you know mid-range not not scuzzy look and just you know Kind of like rough-and-tumble looking mechanics and I just picked one randomly the one that was in the most convenient location.

38
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:18,570
Speaker 0: Mmm, and let me tell you that lady in there is one of those like badass mechanics and those kinds of mechanics.

39
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,905
Speaker 0: Just a little hint for all you out there.

40
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,990
Speaker 0: We'll always find a. they will tell you what it will cost to do fix something the quote unquote right way.

41
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:30,809
Speaker 0: But they'll also tell you how to fix it the clever cheap way Which usually involves getting parts from salvage for an old car.

42
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,295
Speaker 1: That's not a bad way to go.

43
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,805
Speaker 0: old car for any car older than like four or five years.

44
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:35,970
Speaker 0: That isn't a special car.

45
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:40,382
Speaker 0: That's the way to go because a salvage switch is no different than a new switch.

46
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:40,964
Speaker 1: Yep.

47
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:47,406
Speaker 0: Anyway, she Come in and remember I think because it was kind of a low-income area for a long time.

48
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:51,726
Speaker 0: I was like, all right You know, I go in I go back and I'm like, so what's the damage?

49
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:52,370
Speaker 0: What'd you find?

50
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:59,650
Speaker 0: And she's like, well I had to fail your inspection and I got some bad news and I'm thinking shit The shocks are shot that would cost so much to replace.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,981
Speaker 0: I'm just got to throw the car away and buy a new one like this week.

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,845
Speaker 0: God damn it.

53
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,433
Speaker 0: And she's like Everything's fine.

54
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,000
Speaker 0: Except all these little things.

55
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:11,556
Speaker 0: I fixed all those for free cuz whatever I'm like, okay and then that's also the cool thing.

56
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,726
Speaker 0: mechanics like that will totally fix minor stuff for free cuz it's.

57
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,600
Speaker 0: it's like I Replaced the light bulb on the back of your car.

58
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,125
Speaker 1: Yeah pay me for the light bulb.

59
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:22,836
Speaker 0: light bulb cost a nickel I'm not even gonna charge you.

60
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,202
Speaker 1: sometimes are $2.

61
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,226
Speaker 0: It depends on what kind of car?

62
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,010
Speaker 0: what kind of light bulb?

63
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,227
Speaker 0: You want that fancy light bulb or not?

64
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,737
Speaker 0: Well Yeah, but she doesn't.

65
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,142
Speaker 0: apparently I was missing a lug nut.

66
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:36,716
Speaker 0: All right, and she showed me like yeah What the fuck did my lug nut go?

67
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,830
Speaker 0: All right, I'm gonna take it and then she's like, but yeah the bad news.

68
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:52,989
Speaker 0: It's gonna have to cost about a hundred and sixty dollars to replace the headlight switch because I can't find a Sunfire even close to yours in any salvage yard in this County.

69
00:04:53,451 --> 00:05:00,697
Speaker 0: Yeah to which I thought wow, my car must be pretty reliable and to 160 bucks, whatever.

70
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, uh, all right, that's damage.

71
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,182
Speaker 0: I don't think that's damaged pretty much as long as a car continues to run.

72
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:11,379
Speaker 0: if you own it any repair There's less than a thousand dollars that's gonna last.

73
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,190
Speaker 0: at least a year is worth it compared to buying a new car.

74
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:20,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you don't care about having a newer car you guys you're willing to keep driving the old jalopy go nuts Plus.

75
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:21,609
Speaker 0: it works as old a job.

76
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,755
Speaker 0: It goes pretty damn well, and there's nothing wrong with it Except that one thing.

77
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:33,142
Speaker 1: the thing is when you really think about it, you're paying a hundred and sixty dollars Instead of paying a $20 ticket, you're better off.

78
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,408
Speaker 1: Just knowing the $20 ticket.

79
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,640
Speaker 0: See the problem with that is that all right $20 ticket.

80
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:44,778
Speaker 0: Also if I'm in an accident with an expired inspection It'll be real hard to claim no fault.

81
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,406
Speaker 0: Even if I'm not a fault because I have a car that's not legal.

82
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:51,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Whenever my Registration is due.

83
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,828
Speaker 0: I can't renew it without a valid inspection.

84
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:54,250
Speaker 1: That's true.

85
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,540
Speaker 0: Also, and you only need the expansion inspection once a year or every two years Do you need the registration every two years?

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,701
Speaker 0: Yeah action every one year, man I remember in Michigan the registration lasts like five years.

87
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:05,947
Speaker 0: the license lasts like 20 years.

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,106
Speaker 0: My Michigan license still says it's valid.

89
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:09,670
Speaker 1: great.

90
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:27,824
Speaker 0: Anyway, I got that out of the way because that's pretty much the good thing that we have to talk about this morning because you see Getting up this morning It was a normal day going to work and I get on my train and I noticed that there's a freaking lot of people on the train and they're all wearing green and some of them are drunk.

91
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:33,539
Speaker 0: and I'm note that I take a 532 Express train into the city a.m.

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,202
Speaker 0: Right.

93
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, did it cause any problems or was it just loud and annoying?

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,890
Speaker 0: It was very very crowded To the point that it took a long time to get people on the train and my train got into the city like 20 minutes late.

95
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,920
Speaker 1: See I took the 744 train.

96
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:54,728
Speaker 1: I wanted to take the 728 but I slept And the 744 was ten times worse than that.

97
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,658
Speaker 1: Basically, I saw at the train station.

98
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,227
Speaker 1: I can't tell if they were college or high school.

99
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,690
Speaker 1: if they were college They were the most immature college kids ever.

100
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:11,856
Speaker 0: Oh I ran into a bunch of high school kids carrying around like a Tool leader that looked like it was full of coke and like I don't know some kind of liquor and they're all passionate around anyway Obviously 14.

101
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,670
Speaker 1: they were in the second to last car.

102
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:18,249
Speaker 1: So I got into the last car, you know Cuz I wasn't gonna run around to the front of the train or anything, you know.

103
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:23,586
Speaker 1: and They basically everyone else is like they would look into that car and say I'm not going to that car.

104
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,943
Speaker 1: as a result You had this entire train car full of rowdy punk kids.

105
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,210
Speaker 1: I don't know if there was alcohol or whatever.

106
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,338
Speaker 0: So there was.

107
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,869
Speaker 0: I can say some of them.

108
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,790
Speaker 1: I think there was like smoking going on in the vestibule.

109
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:43,690
Speaker 1: It was it was out of control and basically the conductor is fed up with that shit and they were getting rowdy and whatnot.

110
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:47,586
Speaker 1: So he stopped at Croton Harmon and was like I'm calling the police.

111
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,630
Speaker 1: This train isn't going anywhere.

112
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,119
Speaker 0: That would totally be worth it.

113
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:54,789
Speaker 0: just to see the comeuppance.

114
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:59,762
Speaker 1: yeah, and basically all that happened is some people went over and got on the.

115
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:06,850
Speaker 0: the nice train that you know was like if my Train ever stopped in Croton Harmon and I was going into well the train was gonna stop there anyway.

116
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if it like stopped there and there's any problem I would totally get on those other trains.

117
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,590
Speaker 0: Well, the trains are great.

118
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,270
Speaker 1: The other trains are real nice, but they it was gonna make a bunch of stops before Grand Central.

119
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,773
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

120
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,610
Speaker 0: there are some of those that are expressed from Croton to Grand Central.

121
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not at the same, you know, basically this train is an express from Croton to Grand Central.

122
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,326
Speaker 1: So why would they have another Croton Grand Central Express leave at the same time?

123
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:32,078
Speaker 0: It's almost worth it though I mean if Amtrak is first-class and Metro North normal is coach.

124
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,967
Speaker 0: Those are like second-class right there.

125
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're okay.

126
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:42,169
Speaker 1: But yeah, and I was already on the later train so I didn't wanna you know But I stayed on there cuz I was in my nice safe car in the back.

127
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,850
Speaker 1: But yeah, the those rowdy kids got some comeuppance.

128
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,849
Speaker 1: But as soon as that train pulled into Grand Central those rowdy kids got rowdy again.

129
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:59,062
Speaker 1: Well, and then on the way home They were they there was still some rowdy ness and there was like a drunken fireman on the train and you can still lose stuff going on.

130
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,308
Speaker 1: and I just got home.

131
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:05,699
Speaker 0: and Yeah, there were a bunch of troubles on my train on the way home But they didn't involve me and I just sat there with my laptop.

132
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,710
Speaker 1: So yeah, I was just like God these people God.

133
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:12,182
Speaker 0: But the worst thing was I around lunchtime like man, I'm hungry.

134
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,450
Speaker 0: And again, I forgot about this holiday.

135
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,614
Speaker 0: So I just walk out of my building and I want Indian food and the only Indian place really near my work is in Grand Central.

136
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:21,503
Speaker 1: good job.

137
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,270
Speaker 0: So I go in there.

138
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:32,876
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good place and I go down and pretty much there is basically a large sea of people in green loud Drunk spilling things.

139
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,305
Speaker 0: I saw someone vomiting just in the middle of Grand Central.

140
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,117
Speaker 0: It's like all over the floor I ran into.

141
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,083
Speaker 0: I watched the police.

142
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,329
Speaker 1: I like to go to work today?

143
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,794
Speaker 0: Apparently not.

144
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,450
Speaker 1: Hey everyone everyone in my work went to work today.

145
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,973
Speaker 1: It's everyone.

146
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,530
Speaker 1: I had one co-worker went to play golf, but everyone else is at work.

147
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,330
Speaker 0: Well, everyone in my work went to work today, but that's because the stock market is very interesting.

148
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,519
Speaker 1: Currently playing golf is Scottish not Irish.

149
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:54,583
Speaker 1: So it's the wrong holiday day.

150
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:55,406
Speaker 1: Yes.

151
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,960
Speaker 0: Yes, it is Scotland Island.

152
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,449
Speaker 1: Yes more Island.

153
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,295
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, st.

154
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,079
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day.

155
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:11,630
Speaker 0: I mean, I think kid the only like st Pat when I was a kid st Patrick's Day was I wear a green shirt to school or everybody fucking punches me because everyone's jerks.

156
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,140
Speaker 1: I didn't do anything on st.

157
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,804
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day ever.

158
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:14,710
Speaker 0: I wore a green shirt.

159
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,153
Speaker 0: That was it.

160
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,349
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything until high school when I didn't do anything.

161
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,682
Speaker 1: But yeah, I really think the problem is we.

162
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,870
Speaker 1: we take a commuter train, you know, it's a people.

163
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,962
Speaker 1: They want a nice quiet trip to work and home.

164
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:27,307
Speaker 1: They want it to be fast.

165
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:28,914
Speaker 1: They want to sleep They want to whatever.

166
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:42,264
Speaker 1: but the train is allowed to be used by all, you know Including people on day trips and it's always day trip tourists people in groups who use the trainer like the second most common people To use the train if they use the train in a weekend, whatever.

167
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,450
Speaker 1: It's the weekend train, right?

168
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're pretty rowdy on weekend.

169
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,665
Speaker 1: But if they use the train on the weekday, right?

170
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,395
Speaker 1: It's like whoa You're the commuters are here.

171
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:50,876
Speaker 1: You need to.

172
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:57,017
Speaker 1: I really think they should that if there's like some sort of weekday group They should sort of like designate them to.

173
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,230
Speaker 1: you know far away from the commuters or somehow that's crazy.

174
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:02,677
Speaker 1: Like this is the quiet car.

175
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,209
Speaker 1: absolutely no talking on this car whatsoever something like that.

176
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,096
Speaker 0: You know what?

177
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:08,090
Speaker 0: I've noticed the conductor's usually just deal with it.

178
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,370
Speaker 0: I mean like on the on the trains going home.

179
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,740
Speaker 0: Usually they everyone's kind of talking and it's kind of loud.

180
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,930
Speaker 0: it like that's super loud, but it's not like silent.

181
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:19,290
Speaker 0: But in the morning the conductor doesn't even announce the stops because he knows no one cares.

182
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:25,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of times some of the cars have the lights off and they're not supposed to be off But obviously they were just turned off because people kind of want that.

183
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:33,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if someone's like even talking quietly the connector be like sir, you need to be quiet Yeah, and they kind of just deal with it, but I mean you can't really segregate.

184
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,810
Speaker 0: There's like the airlines all the people who cause problems on the airlines and people who don't fly off it.

185
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should have family flights and business flight.

186
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,122
Speaker 1: They're trying to do that in some entirely separate flights instead of separate sections.

187
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:47,432
Speaker 0: Yes, because I'm sure that is economically viable Why not?

188
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:49,117
Speaker 0: and also a good idea.

189
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:52,968
Speaker 1: the family fights just be less often the family fights will be flights.

190
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,118
Speaker 0: Yes I disagree with you.

191
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,103
Speaker 1: I think it's a good idea.

192
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:57,007
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a good idea.

193
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:57,630
Speaker 0: freedom of transportation.

194
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,981
Speaker 0: Besides I'm willing to put up with a tiny bit of annoyance.

195
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,355
Speaker 0: plus, you know what I have earplugs There is it's.

196
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:07,430
Speaker 0: you know how much it takes to actually bother me.

197
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,202
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the earplugs protect me from plenty of noise.

198
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,187
Speaker 1: It's that you know.

199
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:16,364
Speaker 1: people Running up and down the train bumping in you possibly barging on you.

200
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,327
Speaker 1: That's that's the truth.

201
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:18,110
Speaker 0: Did any that happen?

202
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,432
Speaker 1: Someone else?

203
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,826
Speaker 0: it happened because if it happens the conductor deals with it.

204
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:30,210
Speaker 0: Yeah It's hard to conductors versus like a whole car full of rowdy kids Yeah, but all they have to do is say well we've stopped and here come the police.

205
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't do much.

206
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 0: I've been on a few trains.

207
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,442
Speaker 0: The conductor will just like suddenly come out and say Effectively to anyone who has luggage on the seats removed here.

208
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,430
Speaker 0: I'm kicking you off the train as soon as I see you.

209
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other problem is it's like alright, you've got a whole car.

210
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,490
Speaker 1: that's seemingly rowdy, right?

211
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,938
Speaker 1: How do you know who is you know?

212
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:51,790
Speaker 1: What if someone was sitting quietly and everyone else is being rowdy?

213
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,196
Speaker 0: I've seen conductors do this.

214
00:12:54,437 --> 00:13:00,140
Speaker 0: They look in from the vestibule and they make note And then they identify those people when the police come.

215
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,090
Speaker 0: I've seen that exact thing happen many times.

216
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,583
Speaker 1: It's conductor procedure.

217
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:08,623
Speaker 0: actually though the funniest thing was that most of the people on my train home didn't have tickets.

218
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:14,081
Speaker 0: Wow didn't understand how it worked and Pretty much the conductor went person by person.

219
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:17,436
Speaker 0: the conductor be like, uh, sorry Do you have a ticket is like no how much is it?

220
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,390
Speaker 0: and she'd be like however much which is always some ludicrous amount.

221
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,494
Speaker 1: It's like 30 bugs.

222
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,650
Speaker 0: they check on this crazy surcharge if you don't have a ticket and you pay and especially on a peak train.

223
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're supposed to buy tickets to the machines.

224
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:33,010
Speaker 1: You can buy the ticket on the train But it costs a whole shit ton extra and most of the people didn't have money.

225
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,480
Speaker 0: A lot of them didn't have IDs.

226
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,970
Speaker 0: they wanted to pay with credit cards.

227
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:37,257
Speaker 0: They balked at the price.

228
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,450
Speaker 0: few people were like, I can't pay what are you gonna do?

229
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,556
Speaker 0: Could I just like kick you off the train?

230
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, as soon as we get to Croton Harmon Yep, and if I can identify you really make a note so we see you.

231
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,600
Speaker 0: if you ever come again Yep, and the guy's like, uh, what do I do?

232
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,110
Speaker 0: and she's like get off the train quietly in Croton Harmon.

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,974
Speaker 0: Hope I don't notice you.

234
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:53,797
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,409
Speaker 0: The thing is the conductors will always cut you a break if you're not a jerk Yep.

236
00:13:57,812 --> 00:14:04,943
Speaker 0: So all people who ever come to New York City if you screw up on the train Just be polite and they will totally cut you a break.

237
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,089
Speaker 0: That is my advice to you.

238
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

239
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,466
Speaker 1: I did you read that milestones thing?

240
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:08,969
Speaker 1: They give up.

241
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,943
Speaker 0: I read that every time because it's always.

242
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:11,950
Speaker 1: did you read what it said?

243
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:16,365
Speaker 0: I always read it because it always is very kind of snarky in its seriously.

244
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,990
Speaker 0: people be quiet in the morning.

245
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,769
Speaker 1: Well, did you did you see what it said in the most recent one?

246
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,678
Speaker 0: I'm not sure to what you're referring about the.

247
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,960
Speaker 1: they're actually gonna give the conductors like handheld gizmos instead of the paper They've been using for a hundred years.

248
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,109
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I think that's cool.

249
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,982
Speaker 0: Yeah I was gonna wait till it happened and then I was gonna talk about it.

250
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:33,646
Speaker 1: now you can pay.

251
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:42,090
Speaker 1: you're probably gonna be able To pay with a credit card on the train instead of you know Punch a holes in a piece of paper and give you a piece and then file it in the office.

252
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:46,443
Speaker 0: I'm really looking forward to that to be honest because that's like such a good idea.

253
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:47,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

254
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:48,068
Speaker 1: It's.

255
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,534
Speaker 1: I'm surprised It wasn't implemented.

256
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,770
Speaker 1: I don't know to five years ago when that technology was invented.

257
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,170
Speaker 0: I don't even care about the paying part.

258
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:09,200
Speaker 0: What I like is that now they'll get perfect accurate statistics of who is going where not just going to Grand Central But a lot of times they don't really know who is taking what trains when who's getting off at all those kind of in-between Stops when because a lot of a lot of like.

259
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:16,110
Speaker 0: if you want to go from some stations to other stations Like when I was commuting to the Bronx from here, it's almost impossible.

260
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:22,941
Speaker 0: But yet a lot of people do it and now they'll know exactly how many people do it And I think the train schedules are gonna become ten times better.

261
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:23,402
Speaker 1: Maybe.

262
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:25,589
Speaker 1: All right, let's break through all these bunch of newses.

263
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,272
Speaker 1: All right.

264
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:26,835
Speaker 0: All right.

265
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,243
Speaker 0: So, uh, what do you got first?

266
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,630
Speaker 0: You see there's so much to talk about.

267
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,262
Speaker 0: We both have a real news and a quickie news.

268
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:33,910
Speaker 1: Well, here's my is my quick news.

269
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,698
Speaker 1: Actually, I could talk about this a lot but basic I'm not going to.

270
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:42,448
Speaker 1: there's a company called Japan steelworks limited And that has to be an awesome fucking place, right?

271
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,641
Speaker 0: It's like heavy industry right there.

272
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,970
Speaker 1: That is the heaviest of industries.

273
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:51,910
Speaker 1: basically It's a giant steel mill in Japan where they make like the world's best steel or close to it.

274
00:15:52,291 --> 00:16:01,410
Speaker 1: And at the top of the mountain, there's a guy in an old-fashioned hut and he makes Swords right like the old-school way.

275
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:09,277
Speaker 1: He makes awesome swords with their best steels for sword making but down in the steel mill is where the news is at Because I just wanted to point that out.

276
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:12,490
Speaker 1: so, you know that it's the same steel mill that's making swords is making this.

277
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:15,269
Speaker 0: Well, no that guy in the top actually makes those things by hand.

278
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he doesn't make the steel.

279
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 1: you take the deal.

280
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,567
Speaker 0: I was saying the thing that you're about to talk about.

281
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:29,950
Speaker 1: Oh, no In fact, no No He does not make in the steel mill down at the bottom of the hill where they do not make swords.

282
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,390
Speaker 1: So they make big things very big things.

283
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,595
Speaker 1: They have a factory.

284
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:45,243
Speaker 1: that is the only factory on the entire earth that is capable of Producing the core of a nuclear reactor in one solid piece.

285
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:51,530
Speaker 1: every place else that makes nuclear reactor cores Makes two pieces that are half and half and then welds them together.

286
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,134
Speaker 1: Now you might say oh well, you know What's why is that a big deal?

287
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:59,890
Speaker 1: because it's a bajillion times safer than having the two separate pieces welded together.

288
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:06,950
Speaker 1: So basically everyone who was building a nuclear reactor, which is hundreds and hundreds right is buying these things.

289
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:10,498
Speaker 1: and the thing is They have to put down.

290
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,289
Speaker 1: Well at first they can only make for a year.

291
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:20,994
Speaker 0: So if a hundred people want them you're gonna be waiting a while, you know, that makes me realize, you know The enormity of the task.

292
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,042
Speaker 0: I'm afraid from this point forward.

293
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:24,569
Speaker 0: We can only make four gig nights a year.

294
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:25,949
Speaker 0: We just can't really hand it.

295
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:30,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, and two well, it would be if we did not edit.

296
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:35,946
Speaker 1: like some people people who want these things Because there's only four a year.

297
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:45,495
Speaker 1: They have to make a down payment of a hundred million dollars and this is considered like a sure bet like a like a great Investment like oh, of course.

298
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:46,940
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you spend 100 million dollars?

299
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,590
Speaker 1: It's obvious for one big piece of metal.

300
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,790
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think just think that's pretty amazing.

301
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:59,318
Speaker 1: and I think if you read this article it talks about how they make the 600 ton ingot of steel and such.

302
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:07,197
Speaker 0: and think about how normal that I said enormity twice for a reason 600 ton ingot 100 million dollar deposit.

303
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:13,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put a five dollar deposit on my car repair.

304
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,226
Speaker 1: I mean you go to a chip factory whatever.

305
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:17,512
Speaker 1: still look at that Business.

306
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,900
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean even tiny steel mills are awesome.

307
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,422
Speaker 0: Imagine.

308
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:23,150
Speaker 0: I'd love to see videos of just all the stuff.

309
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,759
Speaker 1: I don't think they would let you in because then that would reveal the secret to the rest of the world and suddenly everyone be Making one piece nuclear reactor cores.

310
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,562
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm sure.

311
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:31,024
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:36,185
Speaker 0: Alright, so my quick I make one in my backyard my quickie news real briefly.

313
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,149
Speaker 0: I just want to point this out.

314
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,756
Speaker 0: According to some article this linked on slash shot.

315
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:44,167
Speaker 0: It appears that six and only six botnets are responsible for approximately 85% of the world's spam.

316
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:55,770
Speaker 0: I might have a lot to say about that but I think we should wait and do a show on botnets and spam or something like that because It would take a lot much more than the news.

317
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,530
Speaker 0: But I have to point that out because there are debates along the lines of why don't we make secret evil?

318
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,021
Speaker 0: Viruses that screw anyone who is infected by these botnets thus saving the internet.

319
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,593
Speaker 0: Hmm, and there's a lot of any reasons why no one does that.

320
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:28,809
Speaker 0: but I I just want to point this article out because If you're computer running windows and you think that your windows is fine and safe and there's nothing wrong with it You might want to double-check with some sort of third-party Firewall checking your own traffic.

321
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,567
Speaker 1: You might want to get someone who knows something to check because obviously you don't because a large.

322
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:40,230
Speaker 1: if you know how to check Then I can guarantee you you're safe because you know, but you might think you know and not know.

323
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:41,396
Speaker 0: So, how do you know?

324
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:44,049
Speaker 0: if you know or you just think you know you get someone who really knows.

325
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,662
Speaker 0: But what if they just think they know then you're fucked.

326
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:48,912
Speaker 0: or you could just ask us I don't know.

327
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,559
Speaker 1: only you can only trust us cuz we know.

328
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,495
Speaker 1: yes only I can only trust someone who is who is very Intelligent.

329
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,650
Speaker 0: but what if we only think we know we know?

330
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,941
Speaker 0: The thing is there's almost no way to tell.

331
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,749
Speaker 1: there's an easy way to tell.

332
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,037
Speaker 0: yes External outbound firewalls.

333
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:10,549
Speaker 1: the wireshark can easily tell wireshark and eyeballs.

334
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,998
Speaker 0: Well wireshark can tell.

335
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,170
Speaker 0: but what if your TCP IP stack is compromised?

336
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:23,868
Speaker 0: You can use the another computer with wireshark with a yes Like I said external monitoring external outbound monitoring is the only way to know.

337
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,194
Speaker 0: Yes So now you know.

338
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,263
Speaker 0: and if you thought something else you didn't know.

339
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:28,488
Speaker 0: and now you know that you didn't know.

340
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,974
Speaker 0: and now you know That you know, yeah.

341
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,789
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know, you know, so I got a real news here.

342
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:49,018
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's been this problem lately with the FCC kind of not saying what their regulations are but then suddenly someone says fuck on the airwaves and $100,000 fine your network's gonna be shut down.

343
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:49,621
Speaker 0: all this business.

344
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:55,243
Speaker 0: the FCC has wide and broad powers and Some of those wide and broad powers are important and I agree with them.

345
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:56,730
Speaker 0: and some of those powers.

346
00:20:57,312 --> 00:21:02,790
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that the FCC should have absolutely no regulation whatsoever over the content of what is on the airwaves.

347
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,696
Speaker 0: I think that's that's they show.

348
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:22,330
Speaker 0: but they should have full power to regulate how the airwaves are used exactly as in protocols as in companies having the right to use or not use them with such power and whatever as if people are preventing Shared technology spaces such as radio frequencies from working.

349
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,578
Speaker 1: Then the FCC can step in.

350
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:31,269
Speaker 1: if someone is using them for things which are legal Then they got it doesn't matter as long as they're not fucking it up.

351
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,728
Speaker 0: There have been a whole bunch of Controversies and a whole bunch of problems with this in the u.s.

352
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:36,010
Speaker 0: Lately.

353
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:50,521
Speaker 0: I mean you might remember what happened at a Super Bowl a while ago, and there have been other incidents, but All the networks that have balls have basically stood up and challenged all these things And there have been a bunch of lawsuits going around because they

354
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,068
Speaker 1: want porn on primetime TV And I'm all for it.

355
00:21:53,411 --> 00:22:00,039
Speaker 0: Or maybe it's more that they don't like the fact that an entity over which they have no say and no control Can.

356
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,190
Speaker 1: well they have saying control.

357
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,099
Speaker 1: They just send lobbyists with lots of money to say in control.

358
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:08,030
Speaker 0: remember the FCC is largely independent of other governmental structures.

359
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,181
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can still send people with money over there and get what you want.

360
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,412
Speaker 0: not so much you have not on paper I remember.

361
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:22,219
Speaker 0: the FCC generally follows the guidelines put forth by a Ridiculous minority of the American population.

362
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:30,245
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much and this minority actually has very little Lobbying power when compared to the lobbying power of the entertainment industry.

363
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,716
Speaker 0: you get the entertainment industry Industry people like.

364
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:38,028
Speaker 1: it's very hard to tell because you read the news right and you see news about different things.

365
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:39,316
Speaker 1: you see news about sports.

366
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,077
Speaker 1: you see news about Entertainment industry.

367
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:44,715
Speaker 1: you see news about you know banks.

368
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:47,382
Speaker 1: you see news about Technology industry.

369
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:54,149
Speaker 1: right it But it's hard to tell because you sort of get the idea of how big things are based on the quantity of news.

370
00:22:54,169 --> 00:23:09,390
Speaker 1: like you See lots and lots of entertainment news and that sort of makes entertainment feel big, but if you really look at the numbers like Technology industry like Microsoft could buy probably the entire entertainment industry like all of it like every movie studio Microsoft could buy them all.

371
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,619
Speaker 1: Probably it's that that's the size.

372
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:23,169
Speaker 0: We're talking about him yep, but regardless This really came into stark relief here when there was a this problem where the FCC changes policy on so-called Bleeding expletives.

373
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:36,753
Speaker 0: The biggest example was when someone at the Golden Globes three years ago caught five years ago Uttered didn't even say outright, but just uttered the phrase, and I'm gonna quote here fucking brilliant Mm-hmm.

374
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:46,279
Speaker 0: and the FCC said well the f-word when used in any context is quotes Inherently sexual and connotation unquote.

375
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,365
Speaker 1: all right even if it is what's wrong with that?

376
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:54,293
Speaker 0: even beyond that Fuck you has no sexual connotations.

377
00:23:54,514 --> 00:24:02,782
Speaker 0: with me saying it now it means that I rather dislike you that I'm blowing you off that I disagree even if it does have Sexual connotations, what's wrong with sexual connotation?

378
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:05,172
Speaker 0: ah ah well apparently I don't even know.

379
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:20,079
Speaker 0: but the problem is the FCC has they changed their policy saying that they can enforce and Fine as a result of any network allowing expletives that are fleeting To be put forth to be on the airwaves?

380
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:28,210
Speaker 0: and they protested this and a court said well You didn't really say why you changed your policy, and you didn't make your policy clear.

381
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:34,773
Speaker 0: So your policy can't be enforced until you come forward with something and now they're appealing it And it's going all the way to Supreme Court.

382
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:36,616
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the case of the century.

383
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:40,176
Speaker 0: so the Supreme Court is Going to.

384
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,130
Speaker 1: did they say yes, or did they just say no?

385
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:48,930
Speaker 0: Well quote the Supreme Court on Monday stepped into a legal fight over the use of curse words on the airway.

386
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,615
Speaker 1: Oh, what did the previous court say?

387
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:53,003
Speaker 0: all the previous court was the court that said.

388
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,090
Speaker 0: I already said, that's okay.

389
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,877
Speaker 1: So the previous court was on our side.

390
00:24:57,017 --> 00:25:00,310
Speaker 0: yes, okay, and they appealed it all the way to SCOTUS, okay?

391
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,487
Speaker 1: But if SCOTUS says we don't want to look at that then we win.

392
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:10,690
Speaker 1: well I believe the news Scott as I pointed out was that they said they're going to look at well That's usually bad because that means there's a chance of losing whereas if they said no there'd be no chance of losing.

393
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,799
Speaker 0: However, I'd rather them look at it.

394
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,430
Speaker 1: well if they look at it, and then we still win.

395
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:29,249
Speaker 0: That's like double-plus yes, and if they look at it and they rule otherwise I've learned that I now disagree with the Supreme Court on such a fundamental level because to paraphrase Seinfeld Freedom of speech and religion is the first one.

396
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:31,798
Speaker 1: It is indeed so.

397
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:45,992
Speaker 0: the case will actually be argued in the fall and This in my eyes is other than maybe the whole Torture thing is probably the most important Supreme Court case to be put forth in Recent memory.

398
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,728
Speaker 1: this is going to be the most important case until we have the wiretapping case.

399
00:25:49,989 --> 00:26:00,450
Speaker 0: yes I want to point out that The wiretapping case you know a lot of people say oh the government can't do anything about that because blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah, and this is not big news yet.

400
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:12,650
Speaker 0: But I point out that last week the house had a secret session for the first time in like two decades Which means that they're gonna debate something secret and obviously it was that and they voted to not give immunity.

401
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:16,256
Speaker 1: It really seems like you know lately I mean like.

402
00:26:16,316 --> 00:26:16,677
Speaker 1: I don't know.

403
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:26,370
Speaker 1: maybe I just paid attention to the Supreme Court less earlier in my life But it seems like the Supreme Court like it's like every case is like the new case of the century.

404
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,676
Speaker 1: It was like the Grokster case.

405
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,625
Speaker 1: This is the public domain case.

406
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,558
Speaker 0: there were a bunch of cases You didn't care about.

407
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,650
Speaker 1: I know there were a bunch I didn't care about but it does seem like there's just it's.

408
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,155
Speaker 1: Case after case.

409
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:39,390
Speaker 1: every case is bigger and badder than the previous one.

410
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,829
Speaker 1: I think like in five years is gonna be a case like so crazy It'll be like should we end the world or not?

411
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:53,445
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason if a case gets to the Supreme Court It has to be the case of the century because that means that no not always.

412
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:55,353
Speaker 1: a lot of them are sometimes Just small.

413
00:26:55,413 --> 00:27:02,556
Speaker 0: things are relatively small means they're so contentious that it has become a federal possibly Constitutional issue.

414
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:14,121
Speaker 0: we need the people who have the most authority possible to come down and deign to say what actually is going to be and No one can do anything about it except Andrew Jackson.

415
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:15,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he's dead.

416
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:18,796
Speaker 1: He's dead All right, so check this out.

417
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:22,590
Speaker 1: I'm not exactly sure like I heard about this news on a podcast, right?

418
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,292
Speaker 0: How great.

419
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,797
Speaker 0: some guy on the internet love to it.

420
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:28,310
Speaker 0: and well now you're hearing about this on a podcast that heard about it.

421
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,657
Speaker 1: Well, they didn't hear about it from a podcast.

422
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:31,500
Speaker 1: I heard about it from to it.

423
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:39,050
Speaker 0: no, you're hearing about it from us And that podcast heard about it from.

424
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:44,417
Speaker 1: So because I decided I wanted to talk about it I had to look for the article and I don't know.

425
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:46,906
Speaker 1: maybe I just couldn't find the article but I found.

426
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,295
Speaker 1: basically it seems like Twit made up a news.

427
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:55,573
Speaker 1: That was the combination of two other two articles that Man Regardless.

428
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,097
Speaker 1: basically twit said.

429
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,622
Speaker 1: this is what twit said to.

430
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:09,978
Speaker 1: it said that some Chinese company Made like routers and switches that were fake and put the word Cisco on them Sold them to the US but they had back doors in them.

431
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,710
Speaker 0: now one buying a bootleg Cisco router with all the functionality unlocked.

432
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:17,177
Speaker 1: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

433
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,244
Speaker 0: selling an awesome Cisco router.

434
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:23,035
Speaker 0: That's obviously bootleg with everything unlocked Along with a back door.

435
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,118
Speaker 0: brilliant.

436
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,590
Speaker 0: Yes brilliant again, like my head is off to everyone involved.

437
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,178
Speaker 1: Well, except for the morons.

438
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,089
Speaker 1: You don't realize they bought a router with the back door.

439
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,816
Speaker 1: Like buying a router without a back door.

440
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:35,238
Speaker 1: brilliant.

441
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,084
Speaker 1: buying a router with the back door.

442
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,191
Speaker 1: if you can find the back door and seal It up.

443
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:40,716
Speaker 1: double brilliant God.

444
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,623
Speaker 0: We just need someone to make an open-source router.

445
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:43,305
Speaker 0: That isn't awful.

446
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:46,797
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway anyway In looking for this news.

447
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:48,384
Speaker 1: I found actually two other stories.

448
00:28:48,425 --> 00:29:02,287
Speaker 1: The first story is That there were bootleg routers made from China and sent to the US and Canada and that they confiscated bootleg routers Seventy million dollars worth of Cisco systems networking equipment.

449
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:02,910
Speaker 1: That was bootleg.

450
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:04,829
Speaker 0: I was right problem.

451
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:10,606
Speaker 0: If I was using it for my own use I wouldn't be that opposed to a bootleg router if it worked.

452
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:11,249
Speaker 0: Yeah.

453
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:18,050
Speaker 1: Then I read another story that's basically says that PC Pro news in the you in the UK.

454
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:26,410
Speaker 1: Right, I Said that it would be possible for Asian manufactured switchers and routers to have back doors.

455
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:28,219
Speaker 1: I should watch about that.

456
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:28,681
Speaker 0: that.

457
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,350
Speaker 0: that see it's funny.

458
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,740
Speaker 0: that sounds like a subtle change like it happened to.

459
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:38,037
Speaker 0: it could happen but no that turned a Real article into nothing more than FUD.

460
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:46,567
Speaker 1: and basically what I'm linking to here is an editorial by a guy on CNET Who says that that FUD is xenophobic and bla bla bla bla bla bla fuck you.

461
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,193
Speaker 1: granted I agree with that guy.

462
00:29:48,213 --> 00:30:04,370
Speaker 0: if I were in China making bootleg Cisco routers in order to sell and make a gigantic profit You can bet you can Absolutely bet that there would be some sort of VPN back door credit card numbered password getting thing in there.

463
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,597
Speaker 1: But that would be true for me.

464
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:15,413
Speaker 1: making bootleg routers in any country Yeah, the fact that they were specifically being all racist against you know, the Asians who are known for their bootlegs There is no doubt.

465
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,519
Speaker 0: but well, mostly China Korea.

466
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:23,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I'm on the Southeast Asia mostly China Yeah, and the Philippines, but you get you get the drift here.

467
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,629
Speaker 1: so The I haven't found yet a news article that shows that these two things have actually been combined into a true story.

468
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,919
Speaker 1: But there are two separate things.

469
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,050
Speaker 1: They're interesting and they're worth thinking about.

470
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:51,224
Speaker 0: You know what a much better way to go about this if you are a Chinese bootlegger instead of going the whole I'm gonna make fake Cisco stuff sell it and put it back door in is I'm going to take the Cisco stuff sell it, but I'm not gonna call it Cisco.

471
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,990
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call it sasco.

472
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:54,599
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call it something sorry.

473
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,008
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we'll go down to.

474
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:02,469
Speaker 1: We'll go down to canal Street and right next to the verse H will be the sascoes.

475
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,522
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a verse edge Disney cross over.

476
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,210
Speaker 1: the guy will set a cross on the side.

477
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,179
Speaker 1: I'll set up a table on the sidewalk.

478
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,160
Speaker 1: He's like 24 foot switches 24 foot $10 with load balancing and a picks firewall.

479
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,490
Speaker 0: I'll throw in a picks firewall picks firewall free without every purchase.

480
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:27,089
Speaker 0: but what I would do is I'd make my own brand and I just it would happen to just be bootleg Cisco software and bootleg Cisco designs.

481
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:33,009
Speaker 0: But I'd stand by my brand as in my brand is totally not full of bag doors.

482
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:40,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that people are going to go buy bootleg Costco's are Totally gonna buy my bootleg Costco's.

483
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,350
Speaker 0: and also now Cisco can't get me for trademark infringement.

484
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:46,724
Speaker 0: They can only get me if they prove that I'm using their software.

485
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,070
Speaker 1: We should be hard.

486
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,370
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't think they even know what software they're using.

487
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:55,508
Speaker 0: All I'd have to do is change some checksums here and there and oh man, oh man.

488
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:57,051
Speaker 1: Yep Exactly.

489
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:03,048
Speaker 0: So if I were a Chinese large-scale pirate, that is what I would do.

490
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:06,949
Speaker 0: Yep Wow, we just killed that hole if I was a pirate episode.

491
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:28,073
Speaker 0: Alright rim if you tried if you ever tried one of those digital to-do lists in the past I had a PDA once and I put to-do lists on him On it and then I never looked at that to-do list again ever.

492
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:30,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I get it's weird.

493
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,806
Speaker 1: It's like you.

494
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:35,340
Speaker 1: there's all these productivity tools and they seem sort of obvious, right?

495
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,228
Speaker 1: But you end up not really using them.

496
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:41,527
Speaker 1: like Google Calendar is the only one I've kind of used But I don't really like.

497
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,933
Speaker 1: I don't live by it like.

498
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,199
Speaker 1: I use it a little bit.

499
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:52,798
Speaker 0: I just Google Calendar and things like that to remind me like Does this convention overlap with this other convention before I try to do events at both of them?

500
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:53,360
Speaker 1: It's weird.

501
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:05,199
Speaker 1: It's like they have these tools designed where you can like live by them like a like a day planner like the day runner products or something, you know, and I feel like That's like a thing you need to have or do but I never.

502
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,328
Speaker 1: Every time I try one, I don't I might.

503
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:11,417
Speaker 1: you know, I had calendars that I just never used.

504
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:20,529
Speaker 1: the Google Calendar I do use but I only use it a bit Like I. I feel like I should be using it hardcore like putting everything in there and but I feel like that would take more time.

505
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,385
Speaker 1: it would just be a waste of time because I don't forget to do anything and Like I just don't do it.

506
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,520
Speaker 1: and the same thing is a to-do lists like that.

507
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:33,020
Speaker 1: You know, I've had to-do lists in the past and I sort of use them and not use them.

508
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,079
Speaker 0: I just remembered when I first got my new moleskine.

509
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,720
Speaker 0: I put a to-do list in there and I realized I haven't looked at my moleskine in a long time.

510
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:44,825
Speaker 0: Yep, let's see what I got in here Email katsu-kan about panels.

511
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:47,772
Speaker 0: did it email uncle yo about katsu-kan?

512
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,677
Speaker 0: did it make an archival feed?

513
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:50,238
Speaker 0: I didn't do that.

514
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:50,659
Speaker 1: didn't do that?

515
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:53,107
Speaker 0: Make C's.

516
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:54,016
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

517
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:59,220
Speaker 1: but anyway I also did it to-do list of my moleskine and I kind of use it a little bit.

518
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:09,077
Speaker 1: You know sort of like the same way as the Google Calendar like I don't live by it But I sort of use it some you know, and I look through it and I'm like, oh right I forgot about that thing, you know.

519
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,780
Speaker 1: And sometimes like I'll come up with an idea and if I remember to write it down real quick then even if I forget that Idea later, it'll be in there and I kind of like that.

520
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:23,580
Speaker 0: Yeah what I have used like things like that for is like whenever I'm in a bookstore if I see a book that I want I Write the name down in my notebook or something.

521
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:33,300
Speaker 0: I see things I like useless doll for that, you know, like when I'm in the bookstore And I see a book Yep, and then I come home and I put it in Amazon and I buy it because it's always cheaper that way.

522
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:38,059
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you're that kind of person, right I found here a is it?

523
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,159
Speaker 1: you know There's a billion to-do lists on the on the web, you know, like oh we have a to-do list.

524
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,512
Speaker 1: We have one, you know, there's one I found called.

525
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:50,150
Speaker 1: Remember the milk remember the milk calm It's got this happy cow and he's kind of cute there.

526
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:56,199
Speaker 1: and this to-do list Actually looks like it might have the potential to be a real to-do list.

527
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:59,580
Speaker 1: It integrates if you have you know, Windows Mobile.

528
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:00,889
Speaker 1: It works with that go.

529
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:03,022
Speaker 1: Google Calendar works with that Got.

530
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:05,491
Speaker 1: an iPhone or an iPod touch works with that got.

531
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,716
Speaker 1: Twitter works with that got.

532
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,660
Speaker 1: Gmail works at that.

533
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,069
Speaker 1: It works with all your stuff.

534
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,900
Speaker 1: It just integrates and it's a happy awesome to-do list.

535
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,247
Speaker 1: This is how web applications need to be made people.

536
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:25,020
Speaker 1: All right, you know, I was dealing today with like I You know Twitter pounce and jaku and I was trying to sort them all out and none of them was good.

537
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:30,020
Speaker 1: They all sucked in some way and we're all good in some way and it was horrendously annoying.

538
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,487
Speaker 1: But remember the milk.

539
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,199
Speaker 1: even if it's you know, you don't end up living by it.

540
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:37,592
Speaker 1: This is a to-do list where it's not a problem in the software.

541
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:41,480
Speaker 1: if you're not, you know using it to the fullest It is the high quality.

542
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:46,940
Speaker 0: So I had a much more meaningful thing of the day something I generate some discussion about.

543
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:52,907
Speaker 0: I'll save that maybe for a Thursday, but instead This video.

544
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:54,155
Speaker 0: there's a small chance.

545
00:35:54,235 --> 00:36:02,680
Speaker 0: It was staged But I would believe that it isn't because I have seen people do things this dumb and I know video using.

546
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:03,402
Speaker 0: I've.

547
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:07,433
Speaker 0: I've witnessed people in actual workplaces doing things like this.

548
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:10,140
Speaker 0: All right, dudes taking a spool.

549
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:13,019
Speaker 0: They got to get it up into another part of it.

550
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,584
Speaker 1: I don't think everyone knows you mean by spool.

551
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:20,360
Speaker 0: All right a spool of cable as in it's like five or six feet in diameter.

552
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:27,982
Speaker 1: It's real heavy think a spool of thread but with giant heavy cable wrapped around it and it's big like as big as you Like.

553
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:32,258
Speaker 0: the kind of thing a college kid will steal with when there's wired gone from it and make a table out of.

554
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:39,260
Speaker 1: it's the kind Of thing you see on like the phone company truck with cable wrapped around it You know big wooden discs with a cylinder in the middle.

555
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:43,000
Speaker 0: Well, these guys have constructed some sort of ramp to get these things up.

556
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,474
Speaker 0: It looks like they're probably wiring this building for connectivity.

557
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,600
Speaker 1: Why did they use an elevator?

558
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:47,764
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons for that.

559
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:56,657
Speaker 0: a lot of buildings make the mistake of not having service elevators if they're small buildings not in cities and then it's like normal elevators just can't deal with stuff like that.

560
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:04,260
Speaker 0: or The elevators were broken or they wouldn't fit in the elevator or that floor was like a mezzanine that isn't supported by elevators.

561
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,188
Speaker 1: It looks like it was sort of an open Lobby.

562
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,760
Speaker 1: They could have used one of those like, you know lifting things.

563
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,380
Speaker 0: Nah, how do you want how do you get that in the lobby?

564
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,840
Speaker 0: You have to construct it in there because obviously there's no big way into that Lobby anymore.

565
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:16,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also there will be soon.

566
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also a lot of times like the floor.

567
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,531
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why they were poorly designed building.

568
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,580
Speaker 0: There are a lot of legit morons.

569
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:26,452
Speaker 0: No, there are a lot of legitimate reasons why I would be doing something like this.

570
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:32,441
Speaker 0: However, there are certain Safety precautions you take to do this sort of thing Safely.

571
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,771
Speaker 0: these people did not take those precautions.

572
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:42,340
Speaker 0: What results is nothing more than sheer Absolute hilarity bonus points when the car alarm starts going off.

573
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:43,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like.

574
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,220
Speaker 1: it's like you see some damage done from morons and then you there's like this two-second pause.

575
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,713
Speaker 0: You're like, wow, and then there was more damage.

576
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:51,940
Speaker 1: That was off-camera.

577
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:54,527
Speaker 0: Like did it hit a car?

578
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:55,994
Speaker 0: and sure enough you get to see.

579
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,180
Speaker 0: yes it hit a car.

580
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,048
Speaker 1: It was much off-camera damage.

581
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:00,234
Speaker 0: I've no one got hurt.

582
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:04,300
Speaker 0: So I don't feel bad about watching it Just laugh at the morons or the poorly designed building.

583
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:13,137
Speaker 0: No the morons because the building there might have been a lot of legitimate reasons for what they were doing But when they designed the building they designed a stupid not necessarily there.

584
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:13,920
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into this.

585
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of legitimate reasons for doing what they were doing.

586
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:17,999
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

587
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:18,601
Speaker 0: Yes I've.

588
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,460
Speaker 0: the only problem here is that they were doing these things in an unsafe manner.

589
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:23,999
Speaker 0: There's a safe way to do that.

590
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:28,980
Speaker 1: You could have just kept the spool on the bottom floor and taking cable off of the spool as needed it.

591
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,489
Speaker 0: No, that's really really inefficient.

592
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,298
Speaker 0: All you do is have a winch at the top and you secure the thing.

593
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:34,600
Speaker 0: That's it.

594
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:36,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all you had to do anyway.

595
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:40,669
Speaker 1: So I got to talk about programming again, right?

596
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:41,170
Speaker 0: Yeah go now.

597
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,994
Speaker 0: It's I'm gonna play Layton.

598
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:42,857
Speaker 1: Oh great.

599
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:54,340
Speaker 1: So last time I talked about what is programming right and you know, I talked a little about that and Basically programming is you tell the chip what to do, right?

600
00:38:55,381 --> 00:39:09,141
Speaker 1: But the next thing I was gonna talk about was programming languages and I was gonna go over like, you know Some of the big very popular programming languages of today and the past and talk a little about what each one does and how they're Different.

601
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:18,308
Speaker 1: but I realized something I can't go talking about programming languages yet until I talk about What is a programming language?

602
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:21,777
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna have the what's better visual basic or see we're not.

603
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,940
Speaker 1: there's no such thing.

604
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:29,520
Speaker 1: No language is better than any other language unless you have a specific situation in mind.

605
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,020
Speaker 0: I would argue that some languages are overall worse.

606
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,610
Speaker 1: But well some languages can be less useful can all?

607
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:42,930
Speaker 1: there are some languages that are always less useful than some other languages for every Possible situation but that you know, they're not like a worse language.

608
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,096
Speaker 1: That's that's just not a valid kind of.

609
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,500
Speaker 0: I can submit a worse language.

610
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:50,238
Speaker 0: I made it right now Anyway, it doesn't even work.

611
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:52,551
Speaker 0: Anyway, go that's exactly.

612
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:53,760
Speaker 1: this is what I'm talking about.

613
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,460
Speaker 1: Is that before you understand that kind of argument you have to understand what is a programming language?

614
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,629
Speaker 1: Well a program telling you what a programming language is is very simple.

615
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,200
Speaker 1: a programming language is a language that's used for programming.

616
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:06,151
Speaker 1: That's that's all.

617
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,926
Speaker 1: there is The heart.

618
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,339
Speaker 1: I already told you what programming was last week.

619
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:14,137
Speaker 1: So the part you don't know is what a language is.

620
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:18,400
Speaker 1: now you're thinking Oh, I know what a language is like English Spanish French Chinese.

621
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,365
Speaker 0: It's just the thing that tells the computer what to do.

622
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:21,950
Speaker 1: No a language.

623
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:25,600
Speaker 1: and see there's the colloquial use of the word language.

624
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:30,164
Speaker 1: You know English Spanish Spanish French Japanese Canadian right.

625
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:37,729
Speaker 1: and then there's the sort of language theory use of the word language Which is a completely different meaning.

626
00:40:37,769 --> 00:41:00,013
Speaker 1: well actually it isn't super completely different but basically according to the Wikipedia because I couldn't come up with the super exact definition on my own even though I know a Language is a system of visual auditorial Visual auditory or tactile symbols of communication and the rules used to manipulate them.

627
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:07,509
Speaker 1: so you have some sort of Symbology right and there are some rules governing the symbology.

628
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,016
Speaker 1: that is what a language is.

629
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:15,536
Speaker 1: so a programming language is a set of symbols rules governing the.

630
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,408
Speaker 1: How do you manipulate those symbols?

631
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,000
Speaker 1: and those manipulated symbols are used to program?

632
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,087
Speaker 1: That is what a programming language is.

633
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:24,930
Speaker 0: well simple.

634
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,351
Speaker 0: We're done.

635
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:25,853
Speaker 0: No.

636
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:29,145
Speaker 1: We're not really done because people have no idea What the hell I just said do they?

637
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,960
Speaker 0: some people might but if you do then you don't really you're not gonna learn anything today.

638
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:40,867
Speaker 1: Most likely yeah, all right, so the thing is when someone says okay You know I kind of understand that.

639
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,940
Speaker 1: well the next thing what you know every language right you say, okay?

640
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,294
Speaker 1: A language is a set of rules governing the use of a set of symbols.

641
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:52,789
Speaker 1: right well How do we describe those rules?

642
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,040
Speaker 1: How do I how do I tell someone a language?

643
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,699
Speaker 1: Well if I was gonna tell rim about a language.

644
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:01,132
Speaker 1: What those rules are called is the grammar.

645
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,159
Speaker 1: you see oh you see where this goes?

646
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:14,336
Speaker 1: The grammar yes, so the grammar is basically It's the set of rules that Tell you what the language is.

647
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:17,803
Speaker 1: so Let's say here.

648
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:19,830
Speaker 1: I'm gonna come up with a brand new language right now.

649
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,472
Speaker 1: Okay.

650
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:30,440
Speaker 1: My language is called a B. That's that's what the name of my language and the alphabet of my language alphabet being a keyword has two symbols.

651
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,694
Speaker 0: You know it's funny that you chose a B because alphabet literally alpha beta a B.

652
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:35,576
Speaker 1: I know anyway.

653
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:37,926
Speaker 0: Yes, you see me I see that you're clever.

654
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:38,930
Speaker 0: You're yes.

655
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:44,509
Speaker 1: Yes, my language Maybe my language a B has an alphabet.

656
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:45,973
Speaker 1: that alphabet has two symbols.

657
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:51,954
Speaker 1: you see the alphabet is the set of symbols for the language a And B. I hope you know what those are.

658
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:53,182
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna you know.

659
00:42:53,283 --> 00:43:06,905
Speaker 1: and they look like the letter a and letter B for the English alphabet and The way the rules of my language the grammar of my language is thus the language is comprised of Sentences.

660
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,588
Speaker 1: all right You can have as many sentences as you want.

661
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:22,138
Speaker 1: all right every sentence must begin with a a can be followed only by either B or the end of the sentence.

662
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:29,604
Speaker 1: every B must be followed either by a B or an A. I Just made a whole new language.

663
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:31,610
Speaker 1: you see that I made rules.

664
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:40,700
Speaker 1: the rules make a language and now we can Take symbols and arrange them and then we can look at those symbols and we can say are those symbols grammatically correct?

665
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,095
Speaker 1: Are they in this language or are they not in this language?

666
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:43,760
Speaker 0: all right?

667
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,560
Speaker 0: So you've got your language, and we know how to form things in the language correctly.

668
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:48,605
Speaker 0: You know what the rules are.

669
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,173
Speaker 0: so how what what does that get me?

670
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:51,440
Speaker 1: What does that get you?

671
00:43:51,700 --> 00:44:01,420
Speaker 1: Well you see when you have a language like the English language you see the human brain is Sort of flexi, and it is very has the fuzzy logic and the fusiform gyrus.

672
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:05,022
Speaker 1: Yes as things which computers right now Do not have.

673
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:12,555
Speaker 1: so if you were to try to speak the English language to a computer which is a valid language It's a language just according to the definitions.

674
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,703
Speaker 1: I just gave The computer.

675
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:18,274
Speaker 1: it'd be very very difficult to make a computer that understood that right.

676
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:31,062
Speaker 1: and like I talked about last week You know the chip in the computer it knows like an assembly language Which is just numbers and then we sort of replace some of those numbers with letters to make it easier to type in but really It's not any different.

677
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:35,236
Speaker 1: It's incredibly difficult for a human to think in the way a machine does.

678
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,580
Speaker 1: so I assembly language is difficult.

679
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:42,340
Speaker 1: So it's incredibly difficult to tell a machine what to do because you have to think the way it does which is hard.

680
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,628
Speaker 1: It's much easier to think in.

681
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,108
Speaker 1: you know your native human language But it's very hard for the computer to understand that.

682
00:44:48,931 --> 00:45:03,180
Speaker 1: so what we do in the world of programming is We basically if you made a chip that on the lowest level where the assembly language was easy That ship would be very slow because the assembly language is determined by the actual hardware.

683
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:06,950
Speaker 1: So we make the hardware where the machine language is very hard.

684
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:16,960
Speaker 1: It's the assembly language right, but then we make another language That's a little bit easier for humans to read and then that language gets translated into assembly language.

685
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:28,599
Speaker 1: you see and we make up these languages we make up grammars for these languages and Then you know we write we talk to the computer in these new languages that we just made up.

686
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,265
Speaker 1: We can make up any language you want.

687
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:39,452
Speaker 1: we could even make a B into a programming language if we wanted to and then we Arbitrarily decide right because a language the meaning has nothing to do with the language.

688
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:39,893
Speaker 1: right?

689
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:47,276
Speaker 1: what a means like a bbva End of sentence is a valid sentence in the a B language.

690
00:45:47,557 --> 00:45:48,180
Speaker 1: What does that mean?

691
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,852
Speaker 1: Oh, that's nothing to do with the language what it means.

692
00:45:50,933 --> 00:46:09,734
Speaker 1: we arbitrarily decide what the things are going to mean outside of the language and What we do is we take a grammar we type in our programming language The computer looks at the grammar right it looks at the language And then it says aha that is in this language Or it is not.

693
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:12,209
Speaker 1: if it's not that's how you get the syntax errors you see.

694
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,403
Speaker 1: Because he says oh, that's not in this language that doesn't match up.

695
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:21,210
Speaker 1: you put a b a b Which is wrong because a must either be followed by a or the end of a?

696
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:28,003
Speaker 1: B or the end of a sentence and B must be followed by either a or B. So if B is followed by the end of a sentence is no good.

697
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,096
Speaker 1: I Don't know this is getting confusing even for me.

698
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:34,648
Speaker 0: Don't do what Donnie don't does dude anyway.

699
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:39,679
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway What we do is you make up a language.

700
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,210
Speaker 1: the language can be a rules for how the symbols are arranged.

701
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:47,650
Speaker 1: You can arrange the symbols however you want as you know you when you're making up the language.

702
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:58,310
Speaker 1: But once the language is made up you obey the language And then the computer will translate that language according to the arbitrary things you set up, so we decide okay?

703
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,839
Speaker 1: Aba that means you know the computer.

704
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,547
Speaker 1: do this and a bba that means computer.

705
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:11,430
Speaker 1: do this other thing and We just come up with a language that is you know a B is hard for people to understand.

706
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:12,630
Speaker 1: You know it's only got two symbols.

707
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,590
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean a lot of stuff.

708
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:23,873
Speaker 1: But if you come up a language like C. We can have things like printf if while do then return You know int x integer All sorts of.

709
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:33,048
Speaker 1: you know things that mean something to a human being and we write rules for how we're going to arrange these things in a structured way that a computer can break them apart.

710
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:47,390
Speaker 1: and Now you can tell a computer what to do in a language that makes sense to humans, but is still structured and According to a grammar that a computer can bust apart, and that is that is sort of a languages.

711
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,803
Speaker 1: I didn't do the bad by planning on how to explain.

712
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:53,570
Speaker 1: that was much better than my execution.

713
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,198
Speaker 0: That's fine because my what is IT was.

714
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:00,430
Speaker 0: I'm just filling time before I eat a bunch of food.

715
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:01,810
Speaker 0: Let's just keep trying.

716
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway.

717
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:05,805
Speaker 1: I will clarify more in the form if anyone wants, but here.

718
00:48:05,845 --> 00:48:06,990
Speaker 1: I want to say one more thing though.

719
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:21,499
Speaker 1: No, here's where this kind of stuff gets interesting, and this is the stuff that is like the the complex parts of computer science That you will learn if you go get a CS degree all right, so let's say I Want to write down on a piece of paper.

720
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:23,430
Speaker 1: right a definition of my language?

721
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,135
Speaker 1: I want to write the grammar down.

722
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:27,422
Speaker 1: if I want to write the grammar down.

723
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,769
Speaker 1: I need to write it in a language don't I?

724
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,990
Speaker 1: So so we have languages for writing grammars.

725
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,823
Speaker 1: We have one language in particular called back as an hour form or BNF.

726
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:47,683
Speaker 1: most people just say BNF because back as an hour is hard to say And BNF is a language for writing down grammars.

727
00:48:47,783 --> 00:48:49,107
Speaker 1: It's really not that complicated.

728
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:50,755
Speaker 1: if you look at it It's it's pretty obvious.

729
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:53,529
Speaker 1: It basically says this this can you know?

730
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:55,675
Speaker 1: This is that and this is that.

731
00:48:55,695 --> 00:49:03,661
Speaker 1: so you can say sentence equals and then after that you put you know the form of a Sentence and then you could even do like sentence equals a number of words.

732
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,910
Speaker 1: a word equals a number of you know letters.

733
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:11,550
Speaker 1: Letter equals a or B or C or D or E or F, and that's English right there.

734
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:12,054
Speaker 1: You know.

735
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,650
Speaker 1: it's not that complicated.

736
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:19,545
Speaker 1: But what if I wanted to write the grammar of back as an hour form?

737
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:21,090
Speaker 1: because back as an hour form is a language.

738
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:26,769
Speaker 1: So you could actually write the definition of the back as an hour form language in back as an hour form.

739
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:28,886
Speaker 1: Think about that.

740
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:32,445
Speaker 1: So wait here, we're gonna get crazy.

741
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:32,929
Speaker 1: Are you ready?

742
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,634
Speaker 1: XML is a language.

743
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:37,505
Speaker 1: It's a markup language not a programming language, but it's a language.

744
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:38,810
Speaker 1: right XML is a language.

745
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,325
Speaker 1: It's the extensible markup language.

746
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:44,544
Speaker 1: in XML there is a subset of XML called a DTD.

747
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:47,556
Speaker 1: a document type definition I believe is what it stands for.

748
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:48,740
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

749
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:50,808
Speaker 1: I think it's a document type definition.

750
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,762
Speaker 1: a DTD is a way is a subset of XML.

751
00:49:55,822 --> 00:50:00,217
Speaker 1: so all DTDs are XML but not all XML or DTDs.

752
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:06,320
Speaker 1: and a DTD is a way of Writing a grammar for a language.

753
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:07,364
Speaker 1: that is XM.

754
00:50:07,444 --> 00:50:09,009
Speaker 1: that is a subset of XML.

755
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:13,890
Speaker 1: so Xhtml for example is also another subset of XML, right?

756
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:21,737
Speaker 1: So I could write the rules for writing Xhtml in a DTD.

757
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,810
Speaker 1: in fact there is one you can go look at the rules for X HTML.

758
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,228
Speaker 1: There is an X HTML DTD that you can look at.

759
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:34,907
Speaker 1: That's a set of rules for writing an XML document written in a subset of XML itself, so you can write.

760
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:35,970
Speaker 1: get this.

761
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:41,270
Speaker 1: You can write a document type definition because DTDs are XML.

762
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:45,250
Speaker 1: right You can write a DTD for DTDs.

763
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,638
Speaker 1: You have XML as a language.

764
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:56,659
Speaker 1: within that language you have a sub language that can define a Subset of the language so you can define.

765
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,070
Speaker 1: it's it the subset of the language with itself?

766
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,614
Speaker 1: You're writing languages.

767
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:08,670
Speaker 1: you're using languages to write rules for languages and therefore they can write rules about how to write themselves.

768
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:15,734
Speaker 1: It's totally crazy, and I got an assignment to write the DTD for DTDs once and I didn't do well It was hard.

769
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:19,183
Speaker 0: man never had to do anything weird like that in IT.

770
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:20,567
Speaker 0: We're just like here's a router.

771
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:21,670
Speaker 0: set it up.

772
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:29,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you can write if you want to go a real challenge try to write a document type definition for document type definitions.

773
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,276
Speaker 1: I'm in fact there is one.

774
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:31,745
Speaker 1: you can probably just download it on the internet.

775
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:32,389
Speaker 1: See what it looks like.

776
00:51:32,732 --> 00:51:33,036
Speaker 1: I don't know.

777
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:39,250
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll find it somewhere, but You know this is the kind of stuff that you know is like the core of computer science.

778
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,474
Speaker 1: You know you have languages.

779
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:43,282
Speaker 1: It's language theory how languages work.

780
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,130
Speaker 1: You know different language structures.

781
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,057
Speaker 1: You know because by restruck.

782
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:51,408
Speaker 1: This is why we have so many different programming languages.

783
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:52,898
Speaker 1: you think oh We'll just have one.

784
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,210
Speaker 1: You know we'll just have a handful.

785
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,214
Speaker 1: why do we need so many?

786
00:51:55,656 --> 00:52:02,500
Speaker 1: it's because you can structure languages in so many different ways and It's really it's not about the computer so much.

787
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,228
Speaker 1: We you know the computer speaks assembly.

788
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:04,790
Speaker 1: we can trans.

789
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,818
Speaker 1: You know we just need to come.

790
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:15,955
Speaker 1: when you're making a new language You just need to make sure that you can translate it into the assembly somehow somewhere right or you could even translate it into another Language that can then be translated to assembly.

791
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:19,104
Speaker 1: like Python translates to C translates to assembly.

792
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:22,077
Speaker 1: so as long as I can translate to C I'm okay now.

793
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,809
Speaker 0: You might say that seems silly, but think about it.

794
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,223
Speaker 0: It's really a lot easier to write Python than it is to write C.

795
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:28,608
Speaker 1: Well depends on what you're doing.

796
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:30,400
Speaker 0: well for me It is for non coder.

797
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:37,110
Speaker 0: if I'm doing simple stuff I can get a lot of the performance of things that are written in C, but I only have to write them in Python.

798
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:59,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you basically there's this whole science, and it is science is computer science of trying to work out languages working with languages and grammars to come up with languages that are Easy for people to understand and you know are structured in a way that you can use them to get different jobs done.

799
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:20,880
Speaker 1: However, also you need to be able to get computers to understand these languages make sense of them understand them and Translate them into actual real assembly instructions that the chip in the computer you know reads and does something according to that and That's like the core of CS there.

800
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:22,428
Speaker 1: that that's the hardcore shits.

801
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:31,130
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't have anything else then I can tell you all that next Monday I'm gonna talk about a IT subject that is near and dear to a lot of people.

802
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:35,249
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about the help desk and what that really is and what its purpose is.

803
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:40,576
Speaker 1: Those are the most annoyed people at the company and all the morons call them constantly The people.

804
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:45,221
Speaker 0: when your Comcast thing is broken you call these people Everything that goes right.

805
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:45,928
Speaker 0: these are the people.

806
00:53:46,654 --> 00:53:51,137
Speaker 0: they're pretty much the interface between users and People who actually care.

807
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:53,730
Speaker 1: and the big problem, but I'll talk about it.

808
00:54:00,135 --> 00:54:02,717
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

809
