1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,323
Speaker 1: It's Monday, December 3rd, 2012.

2
00:00:10,323 --> 00:00:10,503
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:28,330
Speaker 1: I'm yawning And this is geek nights tonight, we're talking about network sniffing and what programmers don't understand about networks and sniffing.

4
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,407
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,674
Speaker 0: So go to lunch today Doing your thing.

6
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:37,881
Speaker 0: as happens in the city you walk down the street.

7
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:41,875
Speaker 1: I went to Hale and Hardy had a really kind of mediocre Soup.

8
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:49,476
Speaker 1: I had some overpriced Sushi that weren't too bad got a really really shit cookie because they have the shittest cookies And I really wanted a cookie.

9
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:51,646
Speaker 0: as you get the cookie there cuz I really wanted to come.

10
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,590
Speaker 0: which is the cookie there?

11
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:53,104
Speaker 1: I don't know.

12
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:54,916
Speaker 0: Sorry, like two dollars.

13
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,930
Speaker 1: the problem is that I get back to the office and one of my co-workers is like a bra brownies.

14
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:09,670
Speaker 0: So I'm walking to lunch and Fire engines going down the street, and I'm like okay the usual usual, and there's a you know the the fire SUV is behind it.

15
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,517
Speaker 0: I'm like okay.

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,403
Speaker 0: I go to lunch.

17
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:12,210
Speaker 0: I come back from lunch.

18
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:19,049
Speaker 0: I come back from lunch, and I see that on the intersection outside my office There is a great deal of fire and police.

19
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:23,378
Speaker 1: Interesting because a few days ago And I tweeted about this the exact same thing happened to me.

20
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,449
Speaker 1: there were fire engines blocking like City Hall and like they'd Evacuated the park and all the entrances were locked up.

21
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:34,424
Speaker 0: Okay, so anyway something was going on in the street And I couldn't really see and I didn't give a shit that much.

22
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,290
Speaker 0: so I went to the office.

23
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:41,130
Speaker 0: I get to the office I look out the window I can kind of see but I can't really tell what's going on and I'm like okay something's going on there.

24
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:46,204
Speaker 0: So I go back to work sitting down eating the lunch doing the work a couple hours later.

25
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,247
Speaker 0: Get up stretch.

26
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,250
Speaker 0: We got the window.

27
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:55,599
Speaker 0: There's police all around there still and I'm like What could possibly have happened there?

28
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,887
Speaker 0: that they're hanging out for hours.

29
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:58,650
Speaker 0: you you know?

30
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,464
Speaker 0: It's like I figured you know somebody got hurt.

31
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:09,769
Speaker 0: Maybe somebody fell maybe some you know who know you know someone car accident something like that and They just you know clean it up in an hour and go away.

32
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:14,690
Speaker 1: What's interesting is the same thing happened to me before and I basically did the same thing you did right?

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,498
Speaker 0: So they're sitting there, and it's been hours.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,071
Speaker 0: You know it was like noon, and this is like at 3 30.

35
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,110
Speaker 0: They're still out there, and it's mostly police.

36
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:33,450
Speaker 0: They've got it roped off and I can see the subway station on that side is closed and nobody's going into the subway on this On my side of the street Which is not good because I need to go in there to get home without walking anywhere.

37
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:39,958
Speaker 0: So I go to Google and usually when I google for like ultra local, New York news It's not that easy to find it.

38
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:43,113
Speaker 0: like remember that time we were biking back from New Jersey And there's a fire.

39
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:45,041
Speaker 0: I tried to google that fire the next day.

40
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,045
Speaker 0: I couldn't find shit.

41
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:55,550
Speaker 1: nah, man well the thing is what the point I was going to make is that I have a much a Pretty good success rate when weird shit happens in New York of finding out what it was.

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,690
Speaker 0: But if it has to be big enough over a certain threshold that a news truck will show ah it just has to be in.

43
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,717
Speaker 1: As far as I found this was in Manhattan.

44
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,030
Speaker 0: the fire yeah, right, but it's like that fire that fire.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna wonder if I can find that fire now.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,790
Speaker 0: Good luck anyway, but anyway Yeah, it's like if the news breaks a certain threshold then it'll be really easy to find because it's fucking New York City.

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,318
Speaker 0: But if it's like below, it's actually rather hard to find if no one reports on it, right I still think my idea for a website.

48
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,000
Speaker 1: I just want to call it.

49
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:25,844
Speaker 1: What the fuck was that?

50
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,285
Speaker 1: calm yeah And all it is is you just log you know locations.

51
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:33,259
Speaker 0: usually what I do is I try to search Twitter and Google News.

52
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,212
Speaker 0: those are my go and then I go to the New York news Websites.

53
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:40,710
Speaker 0: the real way to find stuff out like this is have a police radio, but I don't have one of those there.

54
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,717
Speaker 1: I don't know how it is here, but in some places I've been there are weird laws like you can hold.

55
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:49,170
Speaker 1: you can own a police scanner, but not have it in your car.

56
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,300
Speaker 0: Interesting yeah, I wonder if it's legal to take a police scanner Take the audio output and stream it on the internet.

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,052
Speaker 0: so some we just go to the website and listen to like New York police Scanner.

58
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:01,030
Speaker 1: I'll bet it depends on state and city laws.

59
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:09,381
Speaker 1: But I will say this when I was a kid We had a police scanner right and in the old days the way this worked is you get crystals for whatever Channels like in a CB radio you'd buy like right

60
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:15,329
Speaker 0: because if you just buy a scanner They remove those channels as possibilities, and those are only good for like listening

61
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:18,576
Speaker 1: Than that I'm talking like when I was a kid in the

62
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:18,957
Speaker 0: 80s.

63
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:22,407
Speaker 1: No you really couldn't get a variable antenna.

64
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:28,410
Speaker 1: or like a variable radio you plug in a little crystal that would resonate and give you like the.

65
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:34,790
Speaker 1: So you'd buy like a channel 13 crystal for your CB radio and your radio had like three slots.

66
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,990
Speaker 1: So you could have up to three crystals.

67
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,048
Speaker 1: I Remember one day for my birthday my dad got me a second crystals.

68
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:42,800
Speaker 1: my brother And I could use two different channels on our CB radios.

69
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,327
Speaker 1: that was the fucking.

70
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:44,990
Speaker 1: that was awesome.

71
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:50,130
Speaker 1: But so there were channels for our police scanner like we had crystals for all this stuff.

72
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,449
Speaker 1: But there were some crystals that you weren't allowed to buy.

73
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,602
Speaker 1: My dad was a fireman so we had all the crystals.

74
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,530
Speaker 0: so we'd listen to all the crystals.

75
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:59,366
Speaker 1: We left it on scanning all the time.

76
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:04,910
Speaker 1: so at night There'd be like we just find out about crazy fires and go watch houses burn down anyway.

77
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:12,299
Speaker 0: So I go to Google News, and I say 49th Street, and I immediately find So it was some fight on the subway platform.

78
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,447
Speaker 0: dude pushed a dude on the tracks got hit and died.

79
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:18,143
Speaker 0: not cool Not cool at all.

80
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,049
Speaker 0: kind of weird.

81
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:26,930
Speaker 1: It's like if I was gonna fight a dude Which I wouldn't do I point out already the kinds of people who get into a fight on the subway.

82
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,537
Speaker 1: We're taking time bombs.

83
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,650
Speaker 0: apparently it was like a 60 year old guy who got killed.

84
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:39,554
Speaker 1: So the question is was he killed by another old man in an old idea, or was he killed by the stereotypical In quotes gang?

85
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:45,904
Speaker 0: I didn't read the Google News that much more than men so you can go read it if you want more details Which I'm sure the police collected over those many hours.

86
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:46,910
Speaker 0: They were all hanging out there.

87
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,294
Speaker 0: There were a lot of top brass on that street corner And mine was.

88
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,090
Speaker 1: so the thing I saw was much less interesting in the end.

89
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,469
Speaker 1: You know I wonder what was going on.

90
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,422
Speaker 1: I tried to like pull I was like I'm impressed.

91
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,185
Speaker 1: could I get a statement?

92
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:03,169
Speaker 1: and the cop was like Even if I knew not telling anyone.

93
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:23,650
Speaker 1: So I gave up, and I went about my business and later on Twitter I learned that it was a AIDS activist had climbed a flagpole and hung a flag and Apparently that entails shutting down the entire park having every cop in the world there cordoning off everything And there's like 20 cops standing around watching one dude very slowly in a cherry picker like cut the flag down.

94
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,944
Speaker 0: They couldn't send 19 of those cops to a bad neighborhood instead.

95
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:31,020
Speaker 1: no and they had this like Terrorism rapid response unit there too.

96
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:33,189
Speaker 1: that I learned about by googling because I saw there's.

97
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:41,569
Speaker 1: no He didn't put a bomb on with the flag up on that because the dude who hung the flag was still there yelling About how he put the flag up.

98
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,723
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm so unafraid of terrorists that it annoys.

99
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,670
Speaker 1: it annoys and amazes me the reactions.

100
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:50,059
Speaker 1: But then again, New York is much calmer than Boston.

101
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:58,510
Speaker 1: I guess remember when they overreacted to that Little like LED light show that was all around the city anyway and all the threads on the internet.

102
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:02,862
Speaker 0: You know I sort of joked like you know I should run to be.

103
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,449
Speaker 0: you know mayor on the platform that I'll you know.

104
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,236
Speaker 0: Make the police not suck.

105
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:12,333
Speaker 0: because also you know in somewhat related, New York cop news There have been.

106
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,040
Speaker 0: there have been like two or three good cops.

107
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,430
Speaker 0: one of them has a website that doesn't look very well.

108
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,439
Speaker 1: Here's a million websites of police scanners.

109
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,609
Speaker 1: We can just listen to live from anywhere in the country nice.

110
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,017
Speaker 0: But anyway the there was.

111
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:27,756
Speaker 0: there have been a few cops in New York City who were like just exposing The hell out of the police.

112
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:31,010
Speaker 0: he's like look I brought in an audio video recorder to the police meeting.

113
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:35,910
Speaker 0: Here's the precinct chief guy saying talking about the quota that doesn't exist.

114
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,010
Speaker 0: But he's saying you he says like straight up you guys go you gotta go arrest more dudes.

115
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,322
Speaker 1: Well, I thought about this a lot like if I were.

116
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:57,604
Speaker 1: you know New York City is complicated But like when we lived in Beacon upstate if I ran the police like enforcement division in that city I would basically fuzz not bother with Speeders anymore and kind of the basic stuff and I would just go after.

117
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:05,152
Speaker 1: I would just have one dude whose sole job Was to pull people over don't turn their headlights on at night or in the rain, and I'd make the fine like $5,000.

118
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,642
Speaker 0: yeah, I'd go after all this stuff that people don't you know.

119
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:14,830
Speaker 0: think to go after that's actually worth going after and if you're In a small town you can go to bike thieves you go after all kinds of good stuff.

120
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,985
Speaker 1: Also, I'd really go after littering because it'd be really it's low-hanging fruit there.

121
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:26,270
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah No, they go after watching a guy put a flag in a flagpole and all you know and then they do stuff like have quotas?

122
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,321
Speaker 0: They're not supposed to have.

123
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:31,525
Speaker 0: but yeah If I could write if I could get elected mayor somehow I could.

124
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,886
Speaker 0: I would take that guy that Whistle-blowing cop who you know who?

125
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:45,670
Speaker 0: You know who was like hey, there's a quota and published it and everything and I would say you're the commissioner now Boom you know in New York City and all the cops would freak the fuck out and maybe try to kill me.

126
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,466
Speaker 0: But doesn't matter I'd implement.

127
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:52,966
Speaker 1: I'd like the idea of every cop having to wear a GoPro or equivalent whenever they're on duty of course.

128
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,756
Speaker 0: so you know some special Police can make all the shit public.

129
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,162
Speaker 0: you know police meetings.

130
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fucking public.

131
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,290
Speaker 0: might as well be town council meeting.

132
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,132
Speaker 1: I would.

133
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:05,990
Speaker 1: you do need to have the ability to meet privately like say you say the detectives are figuring out the serial killer case.

134
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,356
Speaker 1: Okay, they don't.

135
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,470
Speaker 1: you don't want the guy who committed the crimes now watching.

136
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,650
Speaker 0: Well, I'm talking about the meeting where the police get together in the morning, and they're like all right guys.

137
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,254
Speaker 0: This is what we're doing.

138
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if in that meeting.

139
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,924
Speaker 1: They're like all right.

140
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:16,870
Speaker 1: remember that serial killer?

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,473
Speaker 0: They don't do that.

142
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:18,517
Speaker 0: those meetings are pretty.

143
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,682
Speaker 0: have you ever been to one of those meetings.

144
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,574
Speaker 1: I actually have in Detroit So boring.

145
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:24,001
Speaker 0: it's like all right guys listen up.

146
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:26,050
Speaker 0: We got the quota that we're not supposed to have.

147
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,669
Speaker 0: We're gonna use a different word to describe it.

148
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,890
Speaker 0: But you guys are behind or ahead good job or bad job and look at this wall.

149
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,601
Speaker 0: You know those are the people who are wanted.

150
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,104
Speaker 0: you'll notice.

151
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:35,090
Speaker 0: There's a new got in Detroit.

152
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,224
Speaker 1: They had the wall of unsolved murders that have not been given up.

153
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,470
Speaker 0: look at that new face on the wall.

154
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,875
Speaker 0: Just remember it before you go out.

155
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,124
Speaker 0: that guy hasn't paid child support in like six months.

156
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:49,930
Speaker 0: if you see him bag him in and You know we're setting up a little checkpoint over on this street today because it's gonna be a drunken party.

157
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,463
Speaker 1: Why can't it be more like a robo cop or Gotham Central?

158
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,870
Speaker 0: It is not like that at all.

159
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:59,297
Speaker 0: I see no reason why that meeting Could not be public.

160
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,130
Speaker 1: so this is some old news.

161
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,769
Speaker 1: That's old for from a number of angles.

162
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,799
Speaker 1: But I realized it hasn't been talked about a lot in the technologies front.

163
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 1: now.

164
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,170
Speaker 1: sadly slash shot linked to an article about it.

165
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,360
Speaker 1: So I thought oh, this is a good opportunity to talk about it.

166
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:24,298
Speaker 1: the article is so Poorly written and it beats around the bush so much it actually doesn't really explain what the problem is Until like 40 paragraphs in.

167
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:27,449
Speaker 0: that must be a real clean bush nice and circular shaped.

168
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,600
Speaker 1: You could beat around in a regular bush.

169
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,910
Speaker 1: Just as easily as a nice and clean bush.

170
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,488
Speaker 0: Well, that's beating off in the bush not beating around the bush.

171
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,967
Speaker 0: You've never been to the bush.

172
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:49,350
Speaker 1: So here's the deal on the highest highest level because I swear you don't care about the details under this.

173
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:53,110
Speaker 1: Though part of the problem is that you don't care about the deals under details under this.

174
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,608
Speaker 1: But part of the solution is that those details are so old they don't matter.

175
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:04,833
Speaker 1: So people who live in rural areas are having calls to their landlines drops with a surprising Frequency.

176
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:06,981
Speaker 0: we're talking as in so you live in the sticks.

177
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,125
Speaker 0: someone tries to call you.

178
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,149
Speaker 0: the phone doesn't ring.

179
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,610
Speaker 1: now We're talking like early AT&T iPhone levels like greater than 20% of inbound calls.

180
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,230
Speaker 1: Just never make it or get dropped within the first few seconds.

181
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:29,310
Speaker 0: Now you might think oh duh ancient rural Infrastructure not really shitty phone lines and phone switches that are like a hundred years old and they don't work anymore.

182
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,536
Speaker 1: You're probably picturing those one-way power lines.

183
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:36,870
Speaker 1: They use in really podunk towns where it grounds out to the earth around the end by your house.

184
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, and guess what?

185
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,103
Speaker 1: That's not the problem.

186
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, that shit fucking works.

187
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,890
Speaker 1: Actually, those lines are actually higher quality than the lines in most cities and they're much better maintained.

188
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is they don't have digital congestion.

189
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,990
Speaker 0: They have a frickin separate wire for everybody.

190
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,810
Speaker 1: So let's go back to the early days.

191
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:58,169
Speaker 1: You know Ma Bell the old days of phone systems in the United States like the 80s.

192
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:08,345
Speaker 1: So in that time there was this sort of analog system with some digital Components of routing calls around and it was actually really really really complex.

193
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:20,659
Speaker 1: the technology around it was amazing Especially for the day especially considering how much of it was analog and mechanical And you had to be able to route a call from anywhere in the country to anywhere else in the country And it might have taken a while to connect.

194
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,859
Speaker 0: like you call you wait you wait you wait and it rings But eventually it fucking worked all the time.

195
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,528
Speaker 1: Do you remember Scott from the 80s?

196
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,789
Speaker 1: How a lot like when they taught you remember all those classes and like elementary school Like here's how to do a letterhead when they teach you like how long to let the phone ring.

197
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:37,458
Speaker 0: No one taught me how long to let the phone ring.

198
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:39,749
Speaker 0: I just let the phone ring until I heard ringing.

199
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,410
Speaker 1: Really really we were told six rings for a local call eight rings for a long distance.

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,745
Speaker 1: No one ever taught me ten rings for an international call because no one had answering machines or voicemail.

201
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:51,267
Speaker 0: That's true.

202
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,850
Speaker 1: I Remember we got our first answering machine is a big fucking deal.

203
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,490
Speaker 0: But I just you know you wait on the phone long enough some number of rings until you get tired of fucking waiting.

204
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:03,770
Speaker 1: Yeah thing is you don't know a too long cuz that was in play cuz what if the person was screening their calls?

205
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, don't do that.

206
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:14,163
Speaker 1: So all that infrastructure had of course a ridiculous body of legislation around it and one of the things had to do with how to pay.

207
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:18,696
Speaker 1: because there's the local loop then there's Like the more like the regional telco.

208
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:23,910
Speaker 1: then there's the switching between like different like higher level regions and long-distance calls.

209
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:25,810
Speaker 1: It used to be that it wasn't a long.

210
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,910
Speaker 1: It was a long-distance call to call someone who lived like the next town over.

211
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:33,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, it's like, you know, we could dial.

212
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,110
Speaker 0: you have a seven-digit phone number and to this day this still works, right?

213
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,230
Speaker 0: You could just dial somebody's seven-digit phone numbers straight up as long as they're in the same area code, right?

214
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,039
Speaker 0: But if they're in a different area code You had to dial the area code.

215
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,030
Speaker 0: now the area code is missing part of the phone number.

216
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,350
Speaker 1: But even then it wasn't always.

217
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,577
Speaker 1: Sometimes you needed to dial the area code Even if they were in your area code.

218
00:13:52,638 --> 00:14:02,230
Speaker 1: if you were in a region where there'd been a recent split Like, you know Detroit was the three one three area code and then it filled up One which is the country code for us and then the number.

219
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:12,259
Speaker 1: Funny thing is back then I one meant I am I'm making a call that I have to ask my parents to do first because right because it cost money Lots of money.

220
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,970
Speaker 0: local calls are basically we're free You don't have to pay anything extra above your you know standard pay money to keep the phone on flat rate.

221
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:22,466
Speaker 1: Actually, we paid a flat rate for our first phone line.

222
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:27,390
Speaker 1: We paid for 450 local minutes on our secondary phone line.

223
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,528
Speaker 0: I had a second phone line that we got way later only for a few years in the late 90s for internetting.

224
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:39,730
Speaker 1: Yep Because after we had cable we kept that second phone line because that was basically like my own personal phone line.

225
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,393
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

226
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,390
Speaker 0: I had my own personal phone line also, but I you know, we use the phone on it.

227
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,810
Speaker 1: We used it because there was no, you know voice chat in games back then.

228
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,770
Speaker 1: So we would all like use that phone number into conference calls and then three-way calling with phones.

229
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,909
Speaker 0: Do that if I had a regular modem on that line as well?

230
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:58,130
Speaker 1: See we had a cable modem.

231
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:06,714
Speaker 1: but then we play like a quick deathmatch and like I'd call person a They would use their like conference calling from their parents to call person B. We've usually this chain.

232
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:11,070
Speaker 1: a bunch of people in there as voice chat while we played quick deathmatch should not do that.

233
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:18,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so for example rural local loops cost way more to build and maintain than the ones in cities.

234
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:24,170
Speaker 1: So those local loops is regulations saying they got to charge more for terminated calls in those regions?

235
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:30,850
Speaker 1: We live in a world where none of that matters or even is accessible or visible to the vast majority of people.

236
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:34,923
Speaker 1: So as a result, the regulations haven't really changed much.

237
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,890
Speaker 0: and right it was basically an incentive.

238
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:45,689
Speaker 0: It was saying hey look phone company We want these people who live in the sticks to be able to have phone service because if you charge You know them the same amount you charge something lives in New York City.

239
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,430
Speaker 0: It's not economically viable for you, which means you're not gonna build phone lines for the people in the sticks.

240
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,010
Speaker 0: So even the six won't have phones.

241
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:57,329
Speaker 0: So we're gonna allow you to charge more money to people living in you know for phone calls to the sticks.

242
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:04,755
Speaker 0: So that you will want to build phone lines in the sticks and people in everyone in the whole country will have phones Including the sticks.

243
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:13,745
Speaker 0: and thus that is why everyone in the country pretty much no matter where you live even the extreme sticks Extreme sticks you can get a phone line pretty easily.

244
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:17,863
Speaker 1: So here's the problem Nowadays, I mean there's a million websites.

245
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:18,990
Speaker 1: You can just buy phone numbers.

246
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,079
Speaker 1: I have on my phone that basically that xkc said it best.

247
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:30,854
Speaker 1: those first three digits in your phone number are are basically Random and your area code is basically just where you lived around 2004.

248
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

249
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:40,367
Speaker 1: So now the numbers don't really make sense like that anymore and you just dial one for everything if you dial one at all And all this just push you go to contacts you touch the person's name.

250
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:50,947
Speaker 1: it basically Call routing will be routed via a least cost model Meaning you'll route to these like, you know a call will be routed to some discount carrier because it's cheaper.

251
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:58,382
Speaker 1: that discount carrier then tries to route it as cheaply as possible to make a profit between what they get paid and what they have to pay to terminate the call.

252
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:07,589
Speaker 1: and What they're doing is if they have to terminate the call somewhere where there is a statutory rate That's high and they would lose money on the call.

253
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:11,035
Speaker 1: They just fucking drop it Even though that's totally illegal.

254
00:17:11,076 --> 00:17:16,876
Speaker 1: the FCC apparently is fined no one for this because it's so hard to prove They don't have any resources.

255
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,310
Speaker 1: It's basically an unenforceable set of legislation and there's a loophole.

256
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,157
Speaker 1: Rather than terminating the call, you know what I can do.

257
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,290
Speaker 1: Just keep looping it forever and never actually let it terminate.

258
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,156
Speaker 1: I didn't drop it.

259
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,628
Speaker 1: I just wait for the other person to give up.

260
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:33,950
Speaker 0: The other thing that's going on is you can read about this to get all the details.

261
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:44,314
Speaker 0: But a lot of places like you know One nine hundred number places and call centers set up their phone centers in specific places in the country Overloading those places.

262
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:57,470
Speaker 0: Yeah that have certain rates and then what happens is for there's a big fight about this because Google Voice basically blocks Entire section, you know entire sections of the country that have these like phone call places in them.

263
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:01,589
Speaker 0: You know these one nine hundred numbers because they don't want it to pay to service that bullshit.

264
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:02,833
Speaker 0: now Bullshit.

265
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,249
Speaker 0: and there's a few people who live there get screwed by that.

266
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:09,890
Speaker 0: But the real phone companies like AT&T say hey, what the fuck?

267
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,210
Speaker 0: How come Google is allowed to not service that unprofitable bullshit area?

268
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:24,590
Speaker 0: But we're not allowed to not service that because there's the regulation that makes us do it and Google isn't following that regulation with Google Voice and it's well Google Voice is not the same thing as the actual phone company.

269
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:36,374
Speaker 1: Now couple this with the fact that for someone like me, I don't care Don't want those people to be on my phone network because they because the few people are caught up in the sort of like the Collateral damage.

270
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,942
Speaker 1: I don't know any of those people.

271
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:38,866
Speaker 1: I will never call them.

272
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:39,610
Speaker 1: They'll never call me.

273
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:43,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like if you're in the sticks, they already don't have cell phone service.

274
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:51,930
Speaker 0: So they even though they you know, we still have this guarantee of wired service because this old regulation and old system, you know It's like well, there's no cell phone service.

275
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:59,589
Speaker 1: So really there is effective Example of something I used to do in the early days of email like if I'd run an email server I could set up filters.

276
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:06,819
Speaker 1: I'll basically block emails from any IP address in China Because that's where all the spam was coming from for a time.

277
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:13,749
Speaker 0: then who in China is actually gonna email me or who has Hosted, you know hosted server in China that is sending legitimate emails to me?

278
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,510
Speaker 1: Yep, nowadays that all comes from like hack people behind cable modems and whatever.

279
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:28,737
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this is an interesting problem That is obsolete to young people who leave rural areas because I haven't had a landline Since the year 2000.

280
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,864
Speaker 1: I will probably never have a landline again.

281
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:38,589
Speaker 1: And sure there is a drawback I can't have my guaranteed phone service if the cell networks and power all go out like wire landlines do.

282
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,433
Speaker 1: I Just don't care.

283
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:41,861
Speaker 1: Don't care don't care at all.

284
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,957
Speaker 1: We're good Got any news?

285
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:50,269
Speaker 0: Oh new you want news News news news news news news news.

286
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:53,560
Speaker 0: Okay, so I don't know if anyone realized this.

287
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,441
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone realized this but iTunes 11 just came out which is actually much delayed.

288
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:05,796
Speaker 0: It was supposed to come out around the iPhone 5 time you know, they announced it along with the New iPad and everything.

289
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:09,030
Speaker 0: recently, you know, I've had many and then I you know and everything like that.

290
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,885
Speaker 0: It didn't appear but now it has appeared.

291
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,319
Speaker 0: so First of all, it's actually a major change.

292
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,087
Speaker 0: It's it's not iTunes 10 point something.

293
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:17,751
Speaker 0: It's 11.

294
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,596
Speaker 0: It's a whole new version.

295
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,710
Speaker 0: The UI is significantly changed.

296
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,674
Speaker 0: You can see what they did.

297
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:25,810
Speaker 0: is they did sort of a clever thing where they updated it graphically, right?

298
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,989
Speaker 0: But they also sort of gave it this new UI.

299
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:29,833
Speaker 0: but they put it.

300
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:35,133
Speaker 0: if you go to the menus you can change enough options to basically make it the same size and shape as The old one.

301
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:37,123
Speaker 0: like there's no sidebar with all those choices in it.

302
00:20:37,164 --> 00:20:39,960
Speaker 0: But if you go to view sidebar Oh, look the sidebars back.

303
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,349
Speaker 0: It looks like it used to right.

304
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:53,530
Speaker 0: But if you don't do that has this top bar and actually I kind of like the top bar But it requires more clicks to do certain things You know, so it's sort of this weird balance like like it better less efficient.

305
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:59,850
Speaker 0: But the major thing about iTunes 11 is a lot of people they be hitting on iTunes But wait, wait, wait, wait.

306
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:09,082
Speaker 1: You're saying that people are flipping out because a UI of a general use Software product used by both technologists and non technologists changed.

307
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,370
Speaker 0: Well, no, I'm saying that that's expected right?

308
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,910
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is there are people who already hated iTunes period regardless of oh my god, it changed, right?

309
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,556
Speaker 0: They just hate iTunes period I'll admit.

310
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:21,026
Speaker 1: I haven't used iTunes in like six years.

311
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,050
Speaker 1: I have no use for it.

312
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,332
Speaker 1: I'm done.

313
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:23,438
Speaker 0: I have an iDevice.

314
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:30,760
Speaker 0: I don't have an iDevice needed and even if I did You mean even if you did you have you.

315
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,650
Speaker 0: if you have an iDevice you got to use iTunes.

316
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:34,850
Speaker 0: Unless you jailbreak us.

317
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,343
Speaker 1: I pretty much only listen to music on Spotify and my own mp3 is.

318
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:41,316
Speaker 1: I just drag out of my file system right now I got you know, I'm you got it.

319
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,164
Speaker 0: You know, you want to buy some apps in the App Store.

320
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:44,370
Speaker 0: That's iTunes.

321
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to sync that's iTunes podcast.

322
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,250
Speaker 1: A lot of people have trouble with podcasts now.

323
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:50,238
Speaker 0: I don't my.

324
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:51,710
Speaker 0: it's always worked for me just fine.

325
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,094
Speaker 1: But apparently what the?

326
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:57,807
Speaker 1: the thing that changed is you can't do certain kinds of organizational task manual anymore.

327
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:05,509
Speaker 1: and the podcast Stuff in iTunes 11 is tech is like aimed pegged by some values in the id3 tags.

328
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:17,730
Speaker 1: So people who don't use like the RSS feeds and like manually download the mp3s From people who don't properly set up their id3s or do it through lights never been different.

329
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,312
Speaker 0: That's never.

330
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,565
Speaker 0: if you download something that's not through an RSS feed iTunes thinks it's music.

331
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:22,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't know it's a fucking podcast.

332
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,350
Speaker 1: So there apparently was a way in every instant earlier to click on it be like no, this is a podcast.

333
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,707
Speaker 0: I've never seen that my entire life of using iTunes since the iPod mini was out.

334
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:32,550
Speaker 0: That's never happened.

335
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,090
Speaker 0: I'll ever see that my life.

336
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,310
Speaker 1: I could select the files click on more info and click and change the setting to podcast as if I tunes 11.

337
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,536
Speaker 1: This no longer is an option.

338
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:43,345
Speaker 0: I've never seen that as an option ever.

339
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:44,510
Speaker 1: It was an option.

340
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,233
Speaker 1: Who's screenshots?

341
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,579
Speaker 0: people are friggin crazy?

342
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:47,564
Speaker 0: Stop fucking.

343
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,010
Speaker 0: this is the thing about Apple stuff, right?

344
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,280
Speaker 0: And I love it and hate it.

345
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:56,364
Speaker 1: and everyone, you know If you're gonna use it go all-in don't like you were using Apple.

346
00:22:56,404 --> 00:23:00,970
Speaker 0: shit You have to just don't change fucking anything.

347
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,069
Speaker 0: Just do it the way they want you to do it and don't fuck around with it.

348
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,148
Speaker 0: Right everyone, you know, if you're an option changing customizing kind of person Apple ain't for you, right?

349
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,654
Speaker 0: Don't be using Apple.

350
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:16,919
Speaker 0: and for me, you know when it comes to phones and this really important thing I carry around all day as open-source II as I am.

351
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:22,256
Speaker 0: it is a and as openness is a high priority and Freedom is a high priority.

352
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:25,686
Speaker 0: The higher priority is this thing is really important.

353
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:26,830
Speaker 0: it better fucking work.

354
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:34,545
Speaker 0: So I don't fuck with it default everything right and when it comes to something else And maybe I don't care much about I don't care if it continues to work right.

355
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,974
Speaker 0: if it breaks big deal It's not so important.

356
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's fuck around with this.

357
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:39,621
Speaker 0: That'll be fun times.

358
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,650
Speaker 0: So I tunes pretty important my phone.

359
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:43,818
Speaker 0: I don't fuck with it.

360
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,550
Speaker 0: Just do it the way it's supposed to be used.

361
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,808
Speaker 0: Don't go and looking for weird options cuz you know what?

362
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,525
Speaker 0: Huh this I use this unsupported feature and then I complain when they took it away from me.

363
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:56,535
Speaker 0: when I find weird hack no longer works Curses, it's like they didn't.

364
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:57,438
Speaker 0: it was a weird hack.

365
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,864
Speaker 0: It was not promised to work.

366
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:00,550
Speaker 0: It wasn't a feature, right?

367
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:03,450
Speaker 0: And they didn't promise to even keep their features.

368
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,590
Speaker 0: So, of course, they didn't promise to keep their weird hacks.

369
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:20,926
Speaker 0: The point is iTunes 11 regardless of its graphical updates, which I kind of okay with the windows version Which is the one I use is vastly improved because even You know the I never really had a big problem with it before.

370
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:21,889
Speaker 0: it was crashy.

371
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:36,229
Speaker 0: It would crash it flake out the I would have problems with it such as I would try to do like the music streaming through iTunes from my PC to my HD PC and it was like sometimes just stop and had to restart iTunes to make it work again stuff like that.

372
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:40,099
Speaker 0: Now all that stuff just works perfectly every time.

373
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:45,570
Speaker 0: it's way faster and it never crashes and it's so perfect and Life is very pleasant.

374
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:57,328
Speaker 0: So if you're one of those iTunes Haiti people and you can get over, you know Whatever weird customization and organization OCD thing you have to do and just let iTunes do what it wants to do.

375
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,194
Speaker 0: and you know Buy into it.

376
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,486
Speaker 0: It is vastly improved with its no crashy.

377
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:03,410
Speaker 0: No flakiness.

378
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:05,253
Speaker 0: So there you go.

379
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,900
Speaker 1: So last thing a very brief news.

380
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,227
Speaker 1: Here's a guy on the internet s slash dot.

381
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:14,959
Speaker 1: Oh Say to DVD drives that don't suck for CD ripping.

382
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,759
Speaker 1: He needs a modern CD drive to rip his MP By the $20 one on Newegg.

383
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically what he's pointing out is that Modern like new say to CD ROMs are way way slower than old ones.

384
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,710
Speaker 1: There's not as well made I believe as well.

385
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,020
Speaker 1: They keep rereading and he and he goes on and on.

386
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,230
Speaker 1: he proves it's a problem and I have his answer right here.

387
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,221
Speaker 1: I believe it have ripped all your CDs to mp3 15 years ago.

388
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:41,522
Speaker 1: I agree.

389
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:50,730
Speaker 1: Optionally, it is faster to go to Pirate Bay than it is to rip a single CD depending on your internet connection.

390
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:58,811
Speaker 1: Yes, I'd argue that almost all modern internet connections are faster than ripping a CD - All right.

391
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,656
Speaker 0: What else is that's it?

392
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:01,628
Speaker 1: I just found this the whole thing kind of funny.

393
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,457
Speaker 1: I mean I have an optical drive.

394
00:26:03,538 --> 00:26:09,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what my 32 X whatever Sata CD, you know say to DVD rom, whatever.

395
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:11,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might be kind of slow.

396
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:17,890
Speaker 0: It's ripping a CD compared to maybe my Plex store 8 for 32 Which was you know, probably the best at it, right?

397
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,089
Speaker 0: Cuz even though it's burning was not the great the 32 burning that written speed hasn't really increased lately.

398
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:34,867
Speaker 0: And yet no one gives a shit about optical drives now, so they make them way cheap, but you know what it's still Crazy fast compared to my 4x CD rama the olden days.

399
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:37,498
Speaker 0: It's like oh no It's five minutes instead of three minutes.

400
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,530
Speaker 1: Well, I don't need optical drives anymore And I need I need to use an optical driver in my laptop for one thing.

401
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,197
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna buy like a USB.

402
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:52,490
Speaker 0: if you're ripping that many CDs to mp3 that the time matters That you care that much about it and you're not willing to just go to Pirate Bay and download it.

403
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,176
Speaker 1: You really should have done it ten years ago.

404
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:55,903
Speaker 0: Yes, but you could just buy.

405
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,830
Speaker 0: and you're willing to buy optical drives.

406
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:05,330
Speaker 0: just buy the really expensive one or Instead of the $20 one or buy one of those really tall things.

407
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,065
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of CD drives and it meant for you know, mass burning and just use it for mass ripping.

408
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,335
Speaker 1: I Also suspect though.

409
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:18,810
Speaker 1: I didn't really read, you know all his stuff too deeply But he's trying to use flak and he might have some other IO bottle.

410
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,437
Speaker 0: Well, it depends that.

411
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:27,466
Speaker 0: I haven't looked at this guy's tests for speed it You know, he could be a dumbass and it could be his encoding that is slow and not his ripping.

412
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:28,490
Speaker 1: that is possible.

413
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,503
Speaker 1: But anyway, I just thought this was kind of funny.

414
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:34,236
Speaker 0: so yeah, oh Man, the new floppy drives.

415
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,179
Speaker 0: I just bought one.

416
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,062
Speaker 0: It's so slow.

417
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,510
Speaker 0: I can't save the data off all my floppies.

418
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:39,457
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

419
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:42,048
Speaker 1: I wonder if any of my floppies are still readable.

420
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,867
Speaker 1: Cloppies were really susceptible to bit rot.

421
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,472
Speaker 0: some Probably.

422
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:48,755
Speaker 0: maybe some files be bad.

423
00:27:48,795 --> 00:27:49,638
Speaker 0: Maybe some will work.

424
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:50,681
Speaker 1: I've got one somewhere.

425
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:53,609
Speaker 1: that's got my old hack copy of stunts 40 racing.

426
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,603
Speaker 0: I have a USB three and a half inch floppy drive cracked by killer fit.

427
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:58,566
Speaker 0: I have a drive.

428
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:08,114
Speaker 1: we can do it anyway, it's Things of the day.

429
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:15,715
Speaker 1: if you've never seen an old Silly Symphony and I'll bet many young kids haven't check this out Silly Symphony Music land.

430
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:28,551
Speaker 1: This is a wonderful little 9 minute and 12 second animated short from 1935 where the island of jazz and the island of symphonic music have a deathmatch to the death Mmm.

431
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:33,169
Speaker 1: and the top comment asks if there is in fact a land of metal there should be.

432
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:34,494
Speaker 0: Someone should remain.

433
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:39,852
Speaker 1: someone's gotta add to animate metal and and just mash it up with this video Electronically.

434
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:50,730
Speaker 1: what I find funny is the weird old sensibilities from 1935 that The guys flirts with the girl basically by chasing her around while she tries to get away from him.

435
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see that.

436
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,210
Speaker 0: Welcome to every Pepe Le Pew ever.

437
00:28:54,772 --> 00:29:01,614
Speaker 1: Also the fact that this is almost a hundred years old and it might as well have been made today other than the sensibilities is Kind of amazing.

438
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:01,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

439
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:05,610
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the big thing to take away from this is something we already all should all know.

440
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,065
Speaker 0: Right is like look our great-grandparents only like classical music and her grandparents like jazz music.

441
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,810
Speaker 0: and they said that jazz music is the devil.

442
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:16,390
Speaker 0: And then the grandparents told our parents that rock music is the devil.

443
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:21,684
Speaker 0: Dub step is not not like our jazz music that rock music is the devil.

444
00:29:21,724 --> 00:29:27,403
Speaker 0: and then our pair some of the parents with the rock Music learned the lesson but some of the other ones were like that rap music is the devil.

445
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,955
Speaker 0: and then now you've got that dub Step is the devil.

446
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:30,982
Speaker 0: Come on people.

447
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,110
Speaker 1: All right, can't figure it.

448
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,722
Speaker 1: So everyone only lives through one cycle of it.

449
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:36,385
Speaker 0: some people.

450
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:38,736
Speaker 0: I've figured it out Some people have figured it out.

451
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:51,325
Speaker 0: No matter how many children I have been zero or a billion I will never tell any punk kids that the dub step or the rap step or the 10 Whatever, whatever crazy bullshit music there is.

452
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:57,323
Speaker 0: when I'm a 90 year Yeah, when I'm a 90 year old man, whatever the kids are listening to is gonna be awesome.

453
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,736
Speaker 1: Oh My god, it's all over my pop filter.

454
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:04,064
Speaker 0: So the my thing of the day.

455
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:05,690
Speaker 1: I got dub step all over my pop.

456
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,328
Speaker 0: That's great.

457
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:11,310
Speaker 0: This guy named the whistler on YouTube.

458
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:20,850
Speaker 0: He mashed up My favorite one of my favorite games ice hockey for the NES and he changed it into lockout hockey as is appropriate.

459
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,405
Speaker 1: So wait, he mashed up ice hockey with ice hockey.

460
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:24,169
Speaker 0: That is right.

461
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:28,009
Speaker 0: So you should watch this here video.

462
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:33,003
Speaker 0: It is a good video of funniness and ice hockey in the meta moment.

463
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,670
Speaker 1: The book club book is the great Gatsby.

464
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,519
Speaker 1: You probably have some time to read it.

465
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,850
Speaker 1: I have a feeling we're not doing that show until early next year.

466
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:42,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, next year not do.

467
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:48,690
Speaker 0: probably after the mag Mag fast which is another thing to talk about in the meta moment is actually soon now.

468
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,655
Speaker 1: Oh my god, mag fest is coming.

469
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,059
Speaker 1: It is right after New Year's.

470
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:54,505
Speaker 0: Mag best is near Washington DC.

471
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:58,736
Speaker 0: It is four days 24/7 no nights off.

472
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:02,210
Speaker 0: It is Thursday morn through Sunday night.

473
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,029
Speaker 1: They have a physical arcade the size of a football field gaming gaming gaming gaming music concerts concerts concerts.

474
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:19,864
Speaker 1: year We started a handful of panels at midnight and finished five in the morning and then passed out gaming gaming gaming drinking panels concerts not stopping for days.

475
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:25,570
Speaker 0: Why are you not going to mag fest if you are listening to the show?

476
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,957
Speaker 1: I like mag fest almost as much as packs.

477
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,490
Speaker 1: They're different, but they both are crucial to my enjoyment.

478
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:38,633
Speaker 0: They're like the two sides of what gaming cons might only regret not going to mag fest sooner because I didn't know about it sooner than I went to.

479
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:42,347
Speaker 0: it is not going to pack sooner and not having the money to go to pack.

480
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:48,510
Speaker 1: not going to pack sooner is literally One of two things in my entire life that I regret anyway.

481
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:54,045
Speaker 1: Other meta moment we have an official counter-strike server counter-strike go.

482
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,410
Speaker 1: I'm gonna add some new maps to it.

483
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,580
Speaker 1: You kids should be playing on it.

484
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:57,589
Speaker 1: It's pretty tight.

485
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:17,612
Speaker 0: I'm about to send the newsletter again, and I think I'm gonna send it with this other thing That is not MailChimp But is made by the MailChimp people because it's way simpler and easier to do than MailChimp But it's run by the same people's and so, you know, don't freak out at the at the next newsletter looks different Whatever.

486
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:23,389
Speaker 1: All right, and of course a PAX East a ways out but enforcer applications just went up.

487
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:30,450
Speaker 0: So it since it's almost entirely sold out if not entirely sold out and you want to go Enforcing is a great choice.

488
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:37,730
Speaker 0: In fact, I plan to do it for the first time ever so that my foot will go in doing the walking to match my mouth.

489
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,774
Speaker 0: That has done the talking.

490
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,761
Speaker 1: Yes, Scott and I promised long ago.

491
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,636
Speaker 1: Someday we'll enforce so we're putting On shit talking.

492
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,970
Speaker 0: Also, I've spent you know at the last PAX East.

493
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,830
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of time doing stuff that yeah, you know, I could have enforced.

494
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like I want to do everything.

495
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:56,130
Speaker 0: I had a couple free hours at the last PAX East.

496
00:32:56,231 --> 00:33:02,116
Speaker 1: So if I enforce it's gonna be jam-packed this time I'm gonna see PAX East, well PAX, from every possible angle.

497
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:15,152
Speaker 0: Also, I can get food in enforcer land instead of having to go to get food at the horrible food locations Near PAX East which is the you know, a great great idea All right.

498
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:21,290
Speaker 0: So so yeah rim had this show idea and I poo-pooed it, but I'm gonna let him do it anyway.

499
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:28,990
Speaker 0: And so if you like this show Then we'll just let rim pick Monday show ideas and do them even if I poo-poo them because apparently he's right about what you want.

500
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:33,410
Speaker 0: But if you don't like the show you think it's boring or it doesn't get a lot of listens or whatever.

501
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,690
Speaker 0: Then I was right and we're right to poop.

502
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,775
Speaker 1: What should we have done this show on?

503
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:43,570
Speaker 0: we should have just sat around watching the Giants games about to start in an hour and a half.

504
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,012
Speaker 1: You know what?

505
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:47,728
Speaker 1: I feel we should do if we don't have Monday topics just do the news thing of the day.

506
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:50,215
Speaker 1: in the end It's still a show.

507
00:33:50,235 --> 00:34:01,100
Speaker 1: the news that our discussion of the news on Geek nights Mondays is relevant and that tech news is in fact 90% of what anyone cares about in the tech world.

508
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,544
Speaker 1: other than how to.

509
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,230
Speaker 0: why don't we just make to it anyway?

510
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:11,918
Speaker 0: send in Monday Ideas to the forum or our email.

511
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:16,190
Speaker 0: geek nights at front recruit calm or Twitter or Facebook or Google+ or whatever you got.

512
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:29,530
Speaker 1: so I've realized over the course of my Project management and design and IT over the years that I know a lot about networking and You know a lot about that networking thing most during you pay a lot of money to have a degree in it.

513
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:36,570
Speaker 1: What's funny is despite being an expert at networking to the lowest level I can talk about how?

514
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:44,246
Speaker 1: Bullshit is encoded on different types of Ethernet at the physical level of how you make a one and how you make a zero All the way up to switches and all that.

515
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:47,149
Speaker 1: That was a big part of education RIT.

516
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:51,726
Speaker 1: Never really done that as my job, but you didn't work at Verizon.

517
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:55,783
Speaker 0: you worked It's you know the hospital and the other places even at the hospital.

518
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,350
Speaker 1: I didn't really do it.

519
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,441
Speaker 1: I just told other people what to do.

520
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:00,407
Speaker 1: like it's funny.

521
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:16,189
Speaker 1: at RIT I took a class where we had a mock house And we ran cables and learned about like how to deal with power cables versus ethernet cables and how to like architect all this stuff and differences and server closet placement and the architecture.

522
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:18,837
Speaker 1: and Yeah, all that actual work.

523
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:22,110
Speaker 1: That's really fun to do gets outsourced to people who get paid barely minimum wage.

524
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,725
Speaker 0: Well, you have the degree you know how to do this.

525
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:25,510
Speaker 0: grunt leave.

526
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:29,150
Speaker 0: That's the fun stuff, and then you could go be a grunt labor.

527
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,730
Speaker 0: You could not gone to college have been like a plumber and done all kinds of fun stuff.

528
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,696
Speaker 0: It's only fun when it's made a lot of money.

529
00:35:34,877 --> 00:35:38,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you'd be working like crazy because everyone's got fucking fucked up.

530
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:44,970
Speaker 1: toilets You know network cables through data centers at IBM and at that hospital, and I've dealt with all that stuff to a degree.

531
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,230
Speaker 1: But I've never really done networking.

532
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,444
Speaker 1: I've never set up a router or switch as part of my job.

533
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,370
Speaker 0: most people have them set up already.

534
00:35:53,431 --> 00:36:04,009
Speaker 0: That's a big part of the problem Is by the time you learned how to set them up they had already set most of them up And they are not offed replaced, so I have a project going on at my with my work.

535
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:10,920
Speaker 1: right now We're making a a network sniffer to read something called the fixed protocol Which is a favorite.

536
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,370
Speaker 1: I thought it's a big part of my life.

537
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,519
Speaker 1: I'm a member of the fixed protocol board.

538
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:25,213
Speaker 1: You know like or they're like the company the the consortium W3 of fix the league the consortium that like makes the fixed protocol writes the specs for it and everything I Speak at these.

539
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,519
Speaker 1: you know conventions about it.

540
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:33,911
Speaker 1: I'm actually going to Istanbul probably Soonish to probably teach people there how to use it Mmm.

541
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:36,059
Speaker 1: I feel like we should do a show on that sometime.

542
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,184
Speaker 0: the thing nobody cares about.

543
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,629
Speaker 1: yeah, you think no one cares about it.

544
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,901
Speaker 0: What can I learn from the results of this show?

545
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:43,127
Speaker 0: whether the poo poos are

546
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:52,881
Speaker 1: I'll say this one if you know the fixed protocol and are also a programmer It's pretty easy to get a relatively high-paying job in the financial

547
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:58,458
Speaker 0: program, or it's relatively easy to get a job period To live in New York or San Francisco if

548
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:05,324
Speaker 1: you know the fixed protocol, but again you have to be willing to live in New York Maybe Chicago or you know Sao

549
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:05,706
Speaker 0: Paulo.

550
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:06,430
Speaker 0: They have commodity.

551
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,869
Speaker 1: Yeah the CBOE the CBOE yep anyway anyway, so here's what we need.

552
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,230
Speaker 1: We have a thing that'll read these fixed logs.

553
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,519
Speaker 1: So you know the fixed protocol is kind of like middleware.

554
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,126
Speaker 1: think of it that way like TibRV or whatever.

555
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,119
Speaker 1: you're sending messages Back and forth.

556
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,490
Speaker 1: It's like a point-to-point protocol.

557
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:30,504
Speaker 1: It's like HTTP, but for stock trading and you have an engine on either end that Deals with the fixed bullshit, and then gives your application the data.

558
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,090
Speaker 1: It needs like here's an order.

559
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:39,077
Speaker 0: Yes, so the application is like the web browser and the engine is like Apache But for fix instead of for HTTP.

560
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:44,650
Speaker 1: so in the financial world unlike for example in HTTP I trust my application.

561
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,809
Speaker 1: I never Give one shit.

562
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:52,370
Speaker 1: What went over the wire like what my get request looked like unless I'm troubleshooting like a problem with my own web server.

563
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,824
Speaker 0: Well, I do if I'm a developer right, but you don't care if you're a user.

564
00:37:56,225 --> 00:38:01,403
Speaker 1: so in the financial world The users actually care too because they have an order management system an OMS.

565
00:38:01,423 --> 00:38:07,467
Speaker 0: the thing that the stock trader sits there Because you know because of my website visiting fucks up.

566
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:08,050
Speaker 0: Oh big deal.

567
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,682
Speaker 1: It's the Book of Mormon for an hour until we fix it well.

568
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:12,968
Speaker 0: No that's serving fucks up.

569
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:13,510
Speaker 0: That's a big deal.

570
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,066
Speaker 0: I'm taking my website visiting mess up.

571
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:15,430
Speaker 0: No one cares.

572
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:17,629
Speaker 1: I can't buy tickets to Book of Mormon for an hour.

573
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,243
Speaker 0: But stock trading messes up both people on both ends.

574
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,368
Speaker 0: give a lot of fucks all the fucks If that shit doesn't work.

575
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:33,546
Speaker 0: Sometimes more fucks than are necessary, but yeah, I'm just saying they give all the fucks if money has a problem.

576
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:45,505
Speaker 1: I gave a somewhat controversial discussion on a panel in Mumbai a while ago where I said that a lot of the things that people talk about in terms of Like latency and these connections don't actually matter and a lot of people really liked it.

577
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,709
Speaker 1: a lot of people really didn't like it.

578
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,978
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's neither here nor there.

579
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,557
Speaker 1: so the users of this stuff actually care What went over the wire?

580
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,305
Speaker 1: because say my order management system?

581
00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:56,170
Speaker 1: I'm like yeah?

582
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,304
Speaker 1: I want to send a new order and then I net like nothing happens.

583
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:02,042
Speaker 1: my order like looks like it's open But I never get any executions.

584
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:02,748
Speaker 1: I'm like what the fuck.

585
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:16,483
Speaker 1: So it'd be really nice if I knew what happened because a lot of order management systems suck or something might go wrong Like my order might not actually get acknowledged or some like border fixed engine acknowledges it But then for whatever reason like downstream.

586
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,870
Speaker 1: They don't actually do anything with it.

587
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:26,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, shit like that happens, so I'd like to be able to see you know kind of in real time the actual individual fixed messages Which you know.

588
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:30,890
Speaker 1: my life for many years working as a production engineer for like an algorithmic trading shop.

589
00:39:31,771 --> 00:39:37,089
Speaker 1: I would just you know grab and said and tail log files and tell traders what they needed to know.

590
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:41,050
Speaker 1: But that's really expensive to hire someone like me to do something like that.

591
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,170
Speaker 0: And it's also how much coverage can you get right that log files pride?

592
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,478
Speaker 0: Gigantic how much did you miss?

593
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:49,110
Speaker 0: you know you're grepping and setting looking for specific things?

594
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,138
Speaker 1: I don't miss anything cuz I'm a fucking badass at this.

595
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,770
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you know people looking for specific things.

596
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,700
Speaker 0: You're not watching every single log line 24/7 right.

597
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:59,390
Speaker 1: well that that's a whole separate discussion of monitoring.

598
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:04,857
Speaker 0: So say I have well, that's what looking at log files is yeah, but any well But you want to automate that shit.

599
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:07,850
Speaker 1: of course you want to have in the minimum you want to process.

600
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:13,640
Speaker 1: That's like tailing the log with a regular expression looking for like a log for J Error and sending you an email.

601
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,190
Speaker 0: that's a good idea like step.

602
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,817
Speaker 1: That's like babies first, but anyway.

603
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:25,453
Speaker 1: so the fixed protocol people who aren't Technologists like me are the ones who really need to see those messages like the traders themselves Mmm-hmm.

604
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,003
Speaker 1: also the compliance people like you know.

605
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,690
Speaker 1: they want to know if there's malfeasance.

606
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:32,130
Speaker 1: They want to know what's going on on the wire.

607
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:34,080
Speaker 1: You know they want to keep archives and records and all this.

608
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:38,447
Speaker 1: so one way we do this We have a little agent that'll read these log files from.

609
00:40:38,528 --> 00:40:41,984
Speaker 1: you know The where the log files are written the law that engine logs.

610
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:46,642
Speaker 0: I sent this message I got but then you're trusting the engine to write the logs that are correct.

611
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:53,030
Speaker 0: the engine could if someone can write a devious engine That sends one thing over the network and log something different, so you're looking for malfeasance.

612
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,801
Speaker 0: It actually it wasn't malfeasance, but it was.

613
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:57,904
Speaker 0: but it doesn't say it was.

614
00:40:58,085 --> 00:41:03,239
Speaker 1: so that is one thing That is actually not much of a concern really okay, not at all.

615
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,009
Speaker 1: and sometimes you just some engines don't actually write these log files.

616
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:13,939
Speaker 1: Say performance say you're sending so many messages per Millisecond that you don't have enough disk.

617
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,045
Speaker 1: I owe to write them all out to disk.

618
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:17,490
Speaker 0: you just got to get more disk.

619
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you what if you hit your limitations?

620
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:21,970
Speaker 0: Amazon actually sells disk.

621
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,054
Speaker 0: I hope you get you.

622
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:28,865
Speaker 0: type in the number of like IO ops per second you want And you pay more money the bigger the number is.

623
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:33,650
Speaker 1: so anyway Let's say that you know even if I have the thing that's gonna read these fixed logs.

624
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:36,409
Speaker 1: Let's assume that they're legit, and I don't have to worry about that stuff.

625
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:39,340
Speaker 1: There's still the possibility of you know impact.

626
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,648
Speaker 1: Let's say I'm running this thing on a you know a server That's doing real stock trading.

627
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:49,430
Speaker 1: well That's one more process taking up however much RAM it takes up using CPU cycles Sending stuff out over a network to somewhere.

628
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:53,570
Speaker 1: So maybe I want to get this stuff over the network too, so I go to some developers.

629
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,498
Speaker 1: I'm like here's the spec make a network sniffer.

630
00:41:55,538 --> 00:41:57,346
Speaker 1: Just to read this stuff directly off the network.

631
00:41:57,486 --> 00:41:59,512
Speaker 0: well you basically take Wireshark.

632
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:00,937
Speaker 0: you take you go to wireshark.

633
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:03,587
Speaker 0: you find the code for putting the ethernet in promiscuous.

634
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,255
Speaker 1: I was about to ask you How would you do this?

635
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:07,146
Speaker 1: well as a programmer?

636
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:07,930
Speaker 1: Here's your project?

637
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,310
Speaker 1: I want you, and I give you some basic parameters like how this is gonna work.

638
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:19,516
Speaker 1: I want you to be able to sniff an arbitrary network interface or multiples read data payloads.

639
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:28,510
Speaker 1: you know the top level the payload of the TCP IP packet yeah and parse it Mm-hmm log it somewhere and send it on to a server to do more bullshit.

640
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:29,738
Speaker 0: Well, there's two ways to do it.

641
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:34,281
Speaker 0: one way is if I'm on the server That's doing the communicating is it's a Linux server.

642
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:35,586
Speaker 1: You're not gonna be on the server.

643
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:36,470
Speaker 1: That's doing the communicating.

644
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,421
Speaker 1: Because otherwise, what's the fucking point?

645
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:41,550
Speaker 1: the point of this is that it's not impacting.

646
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:45,208
Speaker 0: I have it on some other device, okay, so I put on another device.

647
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:53,857
Speaker 1: yep Assume you have Effectively unlimited resources like you have the most powerful like normal like to you server You're gonna share whatever.

648
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,342
Speaker 0: I had to plug it in Very close to in fact exactly next to the server that I'm not allowed to be on.

649
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:06,882
Speaker 0: right so close in fact that all the packets That are going to that computer also go to my computer because they're on the same hub.

650
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:09,914
Speaker 0: or if it's such thing as hubs Well, then you have to.

651
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,170
Speaker 0: you have to go and connect the switch so that the two ports are hubbed.

652
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:14,538
Speaker 0: So it's a fit.

653
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,905
Speaker 1: so although that's not how that works.

654
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:16,650
Speaker 0: so the switch.

655
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,166
Speaker 0: You know when you can.

656
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,757
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz you normally what a switch does it fig?

657
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:25,333
Speaker 0: once it figures out which port certain packets belong to it only sends them down that Port.

658
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:30,982
Speaker 0: but you can tell the switch hey Anything that's going to port to send it to port one also.

659
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,330
Speaker 1: That's not the same as making them like a hub.

660
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:41,250
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, if they were like a hub then you the third party that's sniffing could theoretically send a message to that network segment.

661
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:43,437
Speaker 1: But now that's not how we do this.

662
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:43,818
Speaker 1: we do.

663
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:46,290
Speaker 1: we do something called a port span, okay, so how is that?

664
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,553
Speaker 0: How is that not?

665
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,930
Speaker 1: so what that basically does is just sends a copy of everything that goes over?

666
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,305
Speaker 1: One or more arbitrary ports to your report, but you can't talk back.

667
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,575
Speaker 0: Oh So it's not exactly hub.

668
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,439
Speaker 0: I can't say anything.

669
00:43:58,479 --> 00:43:59,082
Speaker 0: I just listen.

670
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:00,810
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and the thing is only listening.

671
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,723
Speaker 1: Yes, and saying stuff wouldn't help you anyway.

672
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:03,649
Speaker 0: How about what I?

673
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:06,450
Speaker 0: Don't know it wouldn't?

674
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,522
Speaker 1: I'm trying to trap you here.

675
00:44:08,703 --> 00:44:14,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no reason I need to talk, but if I'm gonna if I'm hubbed if we were on a hub which doesn't exist anymore

676
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:14,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if

677
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:18,981
Speaker 0: I got a hub from ten years ago plugged in and put two computers into it I could see everything the other computer does.

678
00:44:19,102 --> 00:44:20,230
Speaker 0: yes in both directions.

679
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:25,090
Speaker 0: So it's that's all I need to do is see every packet that goes to and from the other computer in both directions.

680
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,196
Speaker 1: Alright, so say there's you.

681
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:32,090
Speaker 1: there might be an arbitrary number of different computers on the subnet.

682
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,309
Speaker 1: You're listening to all sending fixed traffic, and you want to sniff all of them.

683
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:37,499
Speaker 0: Well, I can I can.

684
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:51,411
Speaker 0: the same interface well Oh, well I mean is is there enough traffic going over all of those other computers that it's going to completely flood My one Ethernet cable connection of one gigabit Capacity?

685
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:57,070
Speaker 0: so I mean I can't monitor all of Google's HTTP traffic with one gigabit of bandwidth.

686
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:00,390
Speaker 1: So let's assume for now that aside from a crazy peak you're fine.

687
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:03,401
Speaker 1: You can reasonably assume that you will not sell even though.

688
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:12,808
Speaker 0: so all those packets going to and from all those other computers Right are being copied to my to my computer right, and there's no bandwidth worry whatsoever.

689
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:16,515
Speaker 1: Yep, none Okay, well yeah And no like median bandwidth.

690
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:21,650
Speaker 0: now when those packets get copied are the packets being rewritten so that identical?

691
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,728
Speaker 0: So they're not being readdressed to me.

692
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:26,921
Speaker 0: They're still have the original addresses on them original everything.

693
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:27,764
Speaker 1: so I do last.

694
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:31,437
Speaker 0: so I do need to put my ethernet card in Promiscuous mode in order to capture them all right.

695
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:32,682
Speaker 1: Do you know what promiscuous mode does?

696
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,990
Speaker 0: it basically says hey ethernet card usually?

697
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,821
Speaker 0: Anytime you see a connection with a MAC address.

698
00:45:37,841 --> 00:45:38,444
Speaker 0: That's not yours.

699
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:39,690
Speaker 0: you throw that shit in the garbage.

700
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,919
Speaker 0: Yep, do not throw that shit in the garbage.

701
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,690
Speaker 0: any bits you see touching you at all.

702
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,079
Speaker 0: Capture those bits and make them available to my software.

703
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,507
Speaker 1: you want to know some interesting things in token ring networks.

704
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:54,240
Speaker 0: if you go into Promiscuous mode I did not know token ring had it from excuse matter.

705
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,585
Speaker 0: I thought that that was an ethernet thing.

706
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:58,357
Speaker 1: so you'll basically Basically, no you'll be.

707
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:00,688
Speaker 0: are there MAC addresses on token rings?

708
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:00,749
Speaker 0: uh?

709
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:03,415
Speaker 1: You want to show on token ring.

710
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:04,639
Speaker 1: talk a lot about.

711
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:08,290
Speaker 0: no one uses token ring anymore except old places that have cobalt.

712
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,583
Speaker 1: You don't have switches or hubs you have MA use yeah multi access unit.

713
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:21,390
Speaker 1: anyway if you go into promiscuous mode Basically the mile you're connected to could say no fuck you you can't you're not authorized.

714
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,250
Speaker 0: well There are ways interesting ways.

715
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,645
Speaker 0: I've heard of detecting people who go into promise.

716
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:31,850
Speaker 0: there are indeed But we don't care of if anyone detects us in promiscuous because really this is our network we're allowed to be.

717
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,998
Speaker 1: Yes, your network is in the straightest.

718
00:46:34,018 --> 00:46:34,680
Speaker 1: set up this parts.

719
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,250
Speaker 0: This shit is on fucking purpose right okay?

720
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:48,040
Speaker 0: So step three is I need to write a program similar to wireshark that looks at all those fucking packets hitting my ethernet port and Writes them all the fuck down all right in.

721
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,510
Speaker 0: and do I have enough space to write all these fuckers down?

722
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:59,326
Speaker 0: Let's say yes, okay I put in so much RAM and hard drive space that I can Write all these down or I can process them fat so fast as they come in.

723
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:02,658
Speaker 0: I don't need to write them down I can write down my results, and I don't need to.

724
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,470
Speaker 0: you know hold on to them, but so how do you differentiate between?

725
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,161
Speaker 1: Say there's two different computers running.

726
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,348
Speaker 1: You know whatever this fixed up.

727
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,420
Speaker 0: well first I have to filter because remember this is raw network traffic.

728
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:12,601
Speaker 0: right.

729
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,090
Speaker 0: yes, this is we're not at the fixed protocol level yet.

730
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're at me right.

731
00:47:16,776 --> 00:47:17,739
Speaker 0: so for example.

732
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,730
Speaker 0: There's all these like fucking sins and acts in there and shit.

733
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,326
Speaker 0: I just got to get rid of a lot of that garbage and only make some sort of TCP.

734
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:26,310
Speaker 0: It's TCP IP right.

735
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:26,936
Speaker 0: It's not UDP.

736
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:27,783
Speaker 1: It's TCP IP.

737
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,510
Speaker 0: okay, so I need to.

738
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,630
Speaker 1: You're already thinking you can rely on your own guaranteed delivery.

739
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:38,110
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying that I'm gonna look at the T. I'm only gonna get rid of any packet.

740
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,476
Speaker 0: That's not a TCP IP packet.

741
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:41,304
Speaker 0: all the IC MPs throw them out.

742
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:42,690
Speaker 0: You know throw out all this garbage.

743
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,297
Speaker 0: I gotta throw out anything.

744
00:47:44,317 --> 00:47:44,859
Speaker 0: I got.

745
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:46,486
Speaker 0: I know what a fixed header looks like right.

746
00:47:46,506 --> 00:47:48,613
Speaker 1: oh Really it's like.

747
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:49,217
Speaker 1: so equals fix.

748
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:57,818
Speaker 0: I would create some sort of filters such that only the fixed packets would be seen by my Software and any other kind of packet.

749
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,323
Speaker 0: sins and acts and all the garbage.

750
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,050
Speaker 0: just forget that shit all right now.

751
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,750
Speaker 1: Are you gonna?

752
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,693
Speaker 1: Do you know how to use the?

753
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:09,106
Speaker 1: because you have you'll have to abstract a little bit because TCP could theoretically send the same frame multiple times.

754
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:16,247
Speaker 1: So computer a sends a tease of TCP packet with a fixed message sends five more packets with fixed messages.

755
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,664
Speaker 1: the other end Basically says I didn't get any of those.

756
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:20,329
Speaker 1: send them all again.

757
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you see the same guy again, so I can you know I can remove duplicates.

758
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:28,218
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm pretty sure ever be a case in the fixed protocol where there would be Intentional duplicate like it was.

759
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:30,167
Speaker 0: it was sent and acknowledged and sent.

760
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:30,468
Speaker 0: the same.

761
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:35,189
Speaker 1: exact Acknowledgments within the protocol are separate from TCP IP.

762
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:43,650
Speaker 0: Well that is very good because then I can easily determine whether it was an intentional Duplicate or a TCP IP duplicate and any TCP IP level duplicates.

763
00:48:43,992 --> 00:48:46,585
Speaker 0: I could just look and do like an MD a hash of the.

764
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:49,994
Speaker 0: you know the packets Identical to one I've already got.

765
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,218
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

766
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:58,823
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the Wireshark libraries and the pcap libraries can Abstract out the TCP and just give you the packets that actually made it.

767
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:00,610
Speaker 0: they can indeed do those things.

768
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,423
Speaker 0: I've never gone if I were to utilize their libraries and not write it myself.

769
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,650
Speaker 0: there are many filtering features in Wireshark.

770
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,132
Speaker 0: That's pretty much.

771
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:07,934
Speaker 0: What the fuck it does.

772
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,018
Speaker 1: all right, so do you know?

773
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:09,981
Speaker 1: so what?

774
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,245
Speaker 1: how would you differentiate?

775
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:12,248
Speaker 1: like say there could be?

776
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,640
Speaker 1: Multiple fix engines running on the same machine.

777
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,049
Speaker 1: each one listens on a different port mmm.

778
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:20,557
Speaker 1: So how do you differentiate all the different?

779
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,630
Speaker 1: like say you want to differentiate the packets from one engine versus another engine?

780
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,027
Speaker 1: Do you know the tuple that?

781
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,758
Speaker 1: Defines the TCP IP connection.

782
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:30,364
Speaker 0: I would look it up in the fucking book.

783
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:32,050
Speaker 0: I could look at the packets themselves.

784
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:32,672
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

785
00:49:32,692 --> 00:49:33,154
Speaker 1: You know it.

786
00:49:33,576 --> 00:49:33,737
Speaker 0: No.

787
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:34,238
Speaker 0: I don't know it.

788
00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:35,142
Speaker 0: I don't do that.

789
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:37,190
Speaker 0: My job is googling things right.

790
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:37,894
Speaker 0: I have again.

791
00:49:37,914 --> 00:49:40,950
Speaker 0: I would look at the pet if I had to and I couldn't Google that right.

792
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,582
Speaker 1: Really, it's really simple.

793
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:43,710
Speaker 0: I would just look at the packets.

794
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,662
Speaker 0: I would have one engine send a packet the other engine send a packet.

795
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:48,710
Speaker 0: go to my little program in Wireshark.

796
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:51,762
Speaker 0: Look at the both of them, and I would be able to see with my eyeballs.

797
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:53,207
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the fucking difference right there.

798
00:49:53,247 --> 00:50:05,054
Speaker 1: boom done Alright, so you realize it's actually just the the IPs on both ends Oh, and the ports on both ends okay, and then that was hard the protocol TCP or UDP.

799
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:06,399
Speaker 1: so big deal.

800
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:08,306
Speaker 1: yeah nice and easy all right.

801
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:09,530
Speaker 0: so what I'm partly.

802
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,321
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to figure out how much about networking.

803
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:12,628
Speaker 1: You know this is selfish enough.

804
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:14,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, to do whatever.

805
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:16,582
Speaker 0: This isn't the right programs that do network.

806
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:23,670
Speaker 1: all right, so this is working out, okay, so How would you deal with the situation of a slow subscriber?

807
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,774
Speaker 1: So you're reading all these things.

808
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,941
Speaker 1: just fine you want to send them off to some other server.

809
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,434
Speaker 1: say that server slows the fuck down Way upstream.

810
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:30,795
Speaker 0: Oh the guy.

811
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:31,659
Speaker 0: I'm sending them down.

812
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:33,285
Speaker 0: I just buffer that shit up.

813
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:34,309
Speaker 1: all right, so what if?

814
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,889
Speaker 1: He's down for the whole day.

815
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,250
Speaker 1: You're gonna buffer it all in RAM forever.

816
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:42,449
Speaker 0: And just what do you do when you hit when you who is this guy from another company or is it from my company?

817
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:42,550
Speaker 0: say?

818
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,214
Speaker 1: It's your company.

819
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:44,624
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's my own company.

820
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:45,469
Speaker 1: It's your own company.

821
00:50:46,231 --> 00:50:49,930
Speaker 0: I just write that shit in some hard drive somewhere all right, so you'd buffer to a file.

822
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:54,864
Speaker 1: Yeah Would the same thread send the message upstream and write it to the file?

823
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,028
Speaker 1: or would you do some sort of?

824
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:56,670
Speaker 0: I would have some?

825
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,863
Speaker 0: Sort of policy that we would decide on in a meeting probably of like.

826
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:00,365
Speaker 0: you know.

827
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:02,395
Speaker 0: hey if the thing is down What do we want to do?

828
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:02,918
Speaker 0: do we want to?

829
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:04,950
Speaker 0: how long do you want to retry for an hour?

830
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:05,673
Speaker 0: Do you care?

831
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:06,456
Speaker 0: how much do you care?

832
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:09,650
Speaker 0: business guy who actually this matters to what it you know?

833
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,250
Speaker 0: This is your thing right?

834
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,075
Speaker 0: This is where your business matters.

835
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:16,669
Speaker 0: if you need this to be automatically sent no matter what then I'll have a thing you know.

836
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:27,390
Speaker 0: We'll come up with a schedule like hey Maybe we'll automatically resend after every hour or you know we'll start trying every five minutes And if it stops working will slow down to hourly will slow down to daily.

837
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,766
Speaker 0: Do you really need me to keep the logs forever like if it's two days old.

838
00:51:30,786 --> 00:51:31,650
Speaker 0: do you even care anymore?

839
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,129
Speaker 0: You know maybe I'll just throw them out when they're two days old.

840
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:38,688
Speaker 0: You know we'll decide on something that makes sense for the business case of what to do.

841
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,770
Speaker 1: all right So what I was getting out with all this?

842
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:45,730
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a manual resend or you know if you ask you make a manual request for the log.

843
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,734
Speaker 0: I'll email it to you.

844
00:51:46,894 --> 00:51:49,686
Speaker 1: so this kind of wraps up my whole ulterior motive here.

845
00:51:49,706 --> 00:52:14,515
Speaker 1: a Big problem with a lot of people who are young and coming just out of college and getting into industries Whatever they might be programmers everything the separation of duties is actually really important and Unless you're like a startup of one You've the fact the programmer Doesn't only makes arbitrary decisions on the things that matter to the programmer But notice how immediately.

846
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:17,045
Speaker 1: what Scott's asking me are what are the constraints?

847
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,049
Speaker 1: What does this need to do?

848
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:20,370
Speaker 1: He's writing it to the business specification.

849
00:52:20,531 --> 00:52:21,394
Speaker 1: That's what matters.

850
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:25,409
Speaker 1: in the end of course it man what the code is that most people I've met don't get that yet.

851
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:26,857
Speaker 0: Well, I don't.

852
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,330
Speaker 1: they don't think about things in these terms.

853
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:33,807
Speaker 0: So I just I'm just gonna retry forever and then my computer runs out of memory.

854
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:36,998
Speaker 0: yeah Great good job.

855
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,350
Speaker 1: Do you know what would you do on a Linux system?

856
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:46,537
Speaker 1: If you if you in var log messages and om was logged at some point it depends on what systems running I mean do I really care?

857
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:49,910
Speaker 0: I mean if this om something or was already killed on the server, right, okay?

858
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,520
Speaker 1: But it's let's say it's the kernel om handler not some individual applications.

859
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,930
Speaker 0: om right so the kernel is killing some processes off.

860
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,375
Speaker 1: Do you know how it does that?

861
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:04,180
Speaker 0: yeah when it runs out of memory it looks at you know has some priority system usually kills Off the biggest fucker.

862
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,770
Speaker 1: actually usually it's entirely random.

863
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,238
Speaker 1: It kills a random PID and it keeps doing that.

864
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:13,435
Speaker 0: I've only I've only ever seen the kernel om really go off with my SQL Eating up all the memory.

865
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:21,624
Speaker 0: I've seen that and it always see and I haven't seen it lately not in a few years But it always killed off my SQL every time The biggest fucker.

866
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:28,690
Speaker 0: So maybe it picks like a random bit in memory and sees who that bit belongs to and that's how it picks the biggest guy.

867
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:29,147
Speaker 0: I don't know.

868
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:34,252
Speaker 1: This is the side because the advice I usually give people is if you ever see an om written off our log messages just reboot Cuz.

869
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:35,570
Speaker 1: there's yeah safe way to recover.

870
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:39,330
Speaker 0: I would just reboot, but I mean maybe it's you know depending on the business use of that machine.

871
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,349
Speaker 0: Maybe there is another process on the machine that is still not killed.

872
00:53:43,492 --> 00:53:44,959
Speaker 0: You care about it, and it killed.

873
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:49,838
Speaker 0: maybe the thing that got killed with some runaway Crawl here that no one gives a shit about.

874
00:53:49,858 --> 00:53:56,274
Speaker 1: if you want to be a successful technologist in a real company paid Don't just think about.

875
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:57,578
Speaker 1: you know your silo of.

876
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:59,103
Speaker 1: I write the code that does this.

877
00:53:59,364 --> 00:53:59,806
Speaker 1: think about.

878
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:02,618
Speaker 1: you know all the different pieces along the way and do the parts that make sense.

879
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:09,210
Speaker 1: and that seems like simple advice, but People fresh out of college have never worked in these environments seem to have a lot of trouble with that.

880
00:54:09,351 --> 00:54:11,303
Speaker 0: Well the problem the trouble I have is the opposite.

881
00:54:11,363 --> 00:54:16,041
Speaker 0: right is like you know See these issues And I want to talk to these business people.

882
00:54:16,061 --> 00:54:18,394
Speaker 0: you go to the guy who does my job And he doesn't care.

883
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:26,250
Speaker 0: these people don't care and they're all politics and bullshit And they don't actually care about improving their product, or you know one guy wants one thing one guy wants another thing.

884
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,055
Speaker 0: They're contradictory.

885
00:54:27,075 --> 00:54:28,161
Speaker 0: they work for the same company.

886
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:29,549
Speaker 0: They don't cooperate with each other.

887
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:31,014
Speaker 0: The guy above.

888
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:32,680
Speaker 0: both of those guys won't decide.

889
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,987
Speaker 0: I'm not allowed to talk to them, or I don't even know who it is.

890
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:39,990
Speaker 0: you know Everyone just passes the buck and is like why are you talking to me about this low-level bullshit?

891
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:40,956
Speaker 0: Because they don't want to.

892
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:58,533
Speaker 0: you know I guess they don't want to micromanage which is good But it's like hey listen you got three people working for you Who are all saying different things and basically fighting over the same resources and want to use them in different ways and they're all Technologically inconsistent and impossible, and it's impossible to appease all of them Physically.

893
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:10,010
Speaker 0: you need to lay down the law and tell me which one of these people to listen to and also I have suggestions That would you know that you know conflict with all the priorities of these three people who only care about themselves.

894
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:14,769
Speaker 0: And I got ideas that would actually help the customer who no one seems to give a fuck about but me.

895
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:18,801
Speaker 0: Should we do what I say or what these people say?

896
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:20,730
Speaker 0: come on and there's nothing going on.

897
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:26,250
Speaker 1: It just amazes me how many companies just can't manage that and it seems to almost always come down to human drama.

898
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:27,674
Speaker 0: It is human drama.

899
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,961
Speaker 1: I love working for a relatively small companies.

900
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:32,590
Speaker 1: now where if that stuff really doesn't happen?

901
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:36,404
Speaker 0: My place was relatively small, but we got bought.

902
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:37,830
Speaker 0: yeah seems to happen anywhere.

903
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:41,049
Speaker 1: Every company I've worked for has been the smallest company I've ever worked for.

904
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:42,855
Speaker 0: How about that?

905
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:45,210
Speaker 1: I mean I started with the US federal government.

906
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:49,624
Speaker 0: So then I went to IBM so you tested how much you know about networking.

907
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:51,029
Speaker 0: do I know enough about networking?

908
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,210
Speaker 0: yeah?

909
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,774
Speaker 1: You know the thing is.

910
00:55:53,396 --> 00:55:55,382
Speaker 1: it's interesting that your first instinct is.

911
00:55:55,422 --> 00:56:00,263
Speaker 1: let me google that I've talked to a bunch of different programmers both Like in my company and other companies.

912
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,680
Speaker 1: I've been asking just friends I know all these same questions.

913
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:10,230
Speaker 1: just to kind of I'm trying It was an interesting simple question to see the extent to which different programmers know stuff, and here's my conclusion.

914
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,412
Speaker 1: RIT computer scientists know more about networking than everyone else in the world I had.

915
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:21,068
Speaker 0: I had like three networking class except for a certain subclass of old-timers.

916
00:56:21,088 --> 00:56:21,148
Speaker 1: who?

917
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,149
Speaker 0: The guys who set up the router that you didn't get the setup because he set it up.

918
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:39,712
Speaker 1: That guy more like the guys who were doing like the generation of coding before we had formalized coding disciplines Who basically had to know everything and they will also look it up if they don't know it like you will of course You know.

919
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:40,860
Speaker 0: did you know about this?

920
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:41,867
Speaker 0: the Unix command FC?

921
00:56:45,316 --> 00:56:45,358
Speaker 1: FC.

922
00:56:46,651 --> 00:56:47,413
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't.

923
00:56:47,775 --> 00:56:55,669
Speaker 0: I learned about it yesterday in fact from this book about 21st century coding in C Which also taught me how to use auto tools which I'll tell you about later.

924
00:56:56,251 --> 00:57:02,270
Speaker 0: But yeah, good luck finding the man page for FC because it has the least documentation of any command.

925
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,622
Speaker 1: Man FC built-in runs in a built-in command.

926
00:57:06,682 --> 00:57:14,188
Speaker 0: This isn't even yeah, it is the least Documented command ever, but I'll tell you about it after the show and how crazy useful it is.

927
00:57:15,252 --> 00:57:16,603
Speaker 1: Wait I found it all right.

928
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:22,770
Speaker 0: That's that's the page I found is the only page I could find documenting this fucker big bash dead daily.

929
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:24,638
Speaker 1: I'm still doesn't tell me what it does.

930
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:25,482
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what it does.

931
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:26,064
Speaker 0: my shows over.

932
00:57:26,325 --> 00:57:27,289
Speaker 1: okay kids look it up.
