Speaker 0: Verizon doesn't have shit for phone.

Speaker 3: But yeah, they said hey upgrade your phone get a new contract, and they didn't have any good phones.

22
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,490
Speaker 3: No, I could get some like normal crap phone.

23
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a Tuesday episode technically speaking.

24
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,965
Speaker 3: yes We should talk about vid games.

25
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,953
Speaker 0: you want to talk about any e3 whatnots.

26
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:41,936
Speaker 3: I don't know.

27
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:46,020
Speaker 3: we should well probably Have to do a show about several of these announcements.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,425
Speaker 3: I mean there's so much to talk about.

29
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:51,919
Speaker 3: we haven't even talked about how NS is available NS - we can pre-order it.

30
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:52,927
Speaker 0: Oh, man, we didn't.

31
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:57,193
Speaker 3: yeah, no shit That is the day that I did not expect to come as soon as it did.

32
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,258
Speaker 3: yeah that came out of no.

33
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:04,121
Speaker 0: and again There are people out there of Duke Nukem forever pre-orders Plus.

34
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,574
Speaker 3: there's the the new Zelda game and the other new Zelda game that was hinted at.

35
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,600
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, that doesn't count.

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:19,452
Speaker 3: Well they basically by all they had to do is release that screenshot, and it wasn't a Miyamoto who said yeah There's a reason he doesn't have a sword and everyone lost their shit.

37
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,240
Speaker 0: How about that Metroid game?

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,993
Speaker 3: Yeah, I'm actually looking forward to that.

39
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:27,589
Speaker 0: about that For Mario for swords Mario game that could.

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,923
Speaker 3: the thing is that could be what the Mario remake on the DS Should have been.

41
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,856
Speaker 0: I like how they're acting like four swords doesn't exist right.

42
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:41,940
Speaker 0: It's like they make this game Basically four swords, but they're acting like they just came up with this brilliant idea.

43
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,918
Speaker 3: I know I mean four swords in my opinion was one of the better games Nintendo ever put out.

44
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,784
Speaker 0: yeah Well, I think what happened?

45
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:55,537
Speaker 0: is it just so few people like actually played a lot of those things from that era Except for us the era when Miyamoto was sad.

46
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:05,620
Speaker 0: yeah So they can like they can pass off that shit again, and I think however I think that the platforming aspect will make that game a lot more frustrating.

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,649
Speaker 0: I mean it was bad enough in Zelda that you'd have people setting each other on fire And you know I'm talking about the not on purpose times.

48
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:16,262
Speaker 0: You know the on purpose times are perfectly okay, but in this game Record.

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,327
Speaker 0: yeah in this game.

50
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:24,980
Speaker 0: There's gonna be plenty of on purpose pushing the other guy in a hole But I think there's gonna be even more accidental pushing the guy in the hole, and it's good.

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,959
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be good.

52
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:27,444
Speaker 3: Well it depends on this.

53
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,289
Speaker 0: you have four skilled players.

54
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:37,900
Speaker 3: if they were if it were set up such that four people could go Say the worlds were the little boards were like Mario 3 boards, and you can all go in different directions.

55
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it keeps you on the same screen.

56
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,554
Speaker 3: see that that's from what I've seen.

57
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:47,299
Speaker 3: well four swords was good with the same Screen in the splitting you could also make a really good game if people can just go off.

58
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really need to do that.

59
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:49,648
Speaker 0: No.

60
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:53,280
Speaker 0: I don't think there is a game like that where they should really make a DS game.

61
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,989
Speaker 0: Everyone can just go off on the same map.

62
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,458
Speaker 0: you know and not all the thing is like.

63
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,120
Speaker 0: you know.

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Speaker 0: There are some games like that where you can just go off, but it's usually bad to go off.

65
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:11,701
Speaker 0: You know you need like two people in the same place to like navigate a puzzle or something like that You know.

66
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,820
Speaker 0: so you want to stick together or force and also fight the bad guys at the same time to kill them quick.

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,220
Speaker 3: Four swords rewards you if you run off by giving you jammies But it hurts everybody because you can't actually go forward.

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,791
Speaker 0: Well it also doesn't let you.

69
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:27,520
Speaker 0: it lets you run off But doesn't let you run up very far keeps you in the same place.

70
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:34,180
Speaker 0: I'm talking about a game where it's like let's say it's a big Final Fantasy dungeon even a roguelike and you can just run off.

71
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,158
Speaker 0: It's basically a local MMO.

72
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:39,128
Speaker 0: It loads the whole instance and everyone.

73
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,738
Speaker 0: not only should you go off, but you can.

74
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,744
Speaker 0: well Not only can but should you.

75
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:52,386
Speaker 3: Nintendo barely scratched the surface with those the idea of that of you having your own screen with hidden Information and they did.

76
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:55,334
Speaker 0: the DS sort of does that without any help.

77
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,939
Speaker 3: one games do it.

78
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:01,148
Speaker 0: well I mean advance wars with fog of war.

79
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,859
Speaker 3: advance wars is probably the best multiplayer game on the DS.

80
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,405
Speaker 3: still Yeah, I mean look most games.

81
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,513
Speaker 0: They have multiplayer, but it's joke multi.

82
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:14,080
Speaker 3: It's always some weekend like Castlevania You know beat the other guys time.

83
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,262
Speaker 0: Yeah They always have.

84
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,870
Speaker 0: why do they feel the needs like put in this joke multi.

85
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:25,580
Speaker 0: well actually the the puzzle games Tetris puyo pop those Have good player Mario Kart if it didn't have snaking you know those sorts.

86
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:27,347
Speaker 0: But you know why?

87
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:28,050
Speaker 3: I can tell you why.

88
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,440
Speaker 3: because then they can put that multiplayer logo on the box.

89
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:36,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, and grab the games have like some sort of joke ass Not even worth playing multiplayer.

90
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,212
Speaker 0: listen if this is a part of your game.

91
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:39,716
Speaker 0: That's not even worth playing.

92
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:43,979
Speaker 0: don't put it in there I know someone's gonna say oh might as well right it can't hurt.

93
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of can hurt.

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,471
Speaker 0: It's just there's.

95
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:49,640
Speaker 0: there's spending time and money making that shit.

96
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:50,939
Speaker 0: They really made another level.

97
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:59,059
Speaker 3: They really like like I. the thing that bothered me is playing the old like Chrono Trigger remake And they basically added an entire crappy version of Pokemon to the game.

98
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,580
Speaker 3: Whoa you can go you can go into this area and raise monsters and fight them like why?

99
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,407
Speaker 0: But does it have any connection to the actual game part?

100
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,391
Speaker 3: don't think so.

101
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:08,274
Speaker 0: so it's just this.

102
00:06:08,354 --> 00:06:10,020
Speaker 0: tacked on on the side thing.

103
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:15,860
Speaker 0: I think you can basically Chrono Trigger plus bad Pokemon on the same cartridge like Mario and Duck Hunt on the same cartridge.

104
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:18,179
Speaker 3: I think you can get some sort of item.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,642
Speaker 3: I don't know.

106
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:22,540
Speaker 3: I walked in there to see what it was and I walked right back out and take that game facts.

107
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,905
Speaker 3: Anyway, we're gonna cut short.

108
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,832
Speaker 3: We're not gonna talk about all the e3 stuff.

109
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:29,900
Speaker 3: We'll let that ferment for a while.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,218
Speaker 3: Maybe we'll do an extra Tuesday episode next week to catch up, but tonight We have an interview with two game developers Emily and Alex who work for muse games and live down the street.

111
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:46,060
Speaker 3: Yeah It's the Emily and Alex of the front row crew who also happen to be game developers.

112
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:52,240
Speaker 3: Yes for real game developers - not like you know Not like a lot of people are game developers.

113
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:56,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, right like what was that guy who made the game for the GBA?

114
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,593
Speaker 3: Nintendo didn't accept that guy while he was crazy.

115
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:05,527
Speaker 3: He gets a lot of points for determination If you consider those points.

116
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:06,591
Speaker 3: well boy, I didn't.

117
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:07,956
Speaker 3: what are you gonna redeem him for?

118
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,060
Speaker 0: another negative point?

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,660
Speaker 0: There's a space for crazy space boy space boys.

120
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,620
Speaker 0: You need a billion to add up to one regular point.

121
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:21,659
Speaker 3: but Emily and Alex work for muse games a small game studio and there they've made a game elementia that you will link to.

122
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,460
Speaker 3: that you can play and We're going to interview them shortly.

123
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:29,236
Speaker 3: We already did and now we're just gonna play the audio from the interview.

124
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:30,160
Speaker 3: We conducted last night.

125
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:41,500
Speaker 3: Well, thanks to all sorts of microphone shenanigans There are somehow four microphones plugged into this mixer board here of varying quality shape and size.

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,062
Speaker 3: We've got.

127
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:46,881
Speaker 3: we've got rim and Scott as always on the SM 57 or 58.

128
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,926
Speaker 0: No, they're not 58.

129
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,810
Speaker 0: We need to get some of those.

130
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,252
Speaker 3: Yeah, we do.

131
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,140
Speaker 1: and here's Emily on the headset.

132
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:55,768
Speaker 0: That's the Radio Shack.

133
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,118
Speaker 0: piece of shit is the technical term.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,524
Speaker 3: Famous microphone.

135
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,950
Speaker 3: someday we will sell that on eBay.

136
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,838
Speaker 3: That was the first geek nights microphone.

137
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,903
Speaker 0: Yeah That'd be great.

138
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:10,700
Speaker 0: imagine if like, you know say I don't know some famous radio guy was like.

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,518
Speaker 0: He made a radio show and he was like a kid in High school and he had the microphone that he used like man.

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,300
Speaker 0: What if I go I could go find my like fisher-prize tape recorder somewhere?

141
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,491
Speaker 1: I think that every little kid had that fisher-prize tape recorder.

142
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,818
Speaker 1: because I've got all these, you know, they're.

143
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,719
Speaker 1: they're kind of preschool audio dramas.

144
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,440
Speaker 1: Many of them concern like the alternate adventures of Peter Pan.

145
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,645
Speaker 2: They're like really really weird.

146
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:37,589
Speaker 1: or or like.

147
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,359
Speaker 1: there's this one where we're having a trial for a rabbit and like it was.

148
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:51,900
Speaker 1: it was actually kind of funny because it showed that even as like six-year-olds we had a Pretty good grasp of how the legal system worked like there was a prosecutor and a defense.

149
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,547
Speaker 1: Did you chew on this thing?

150
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,192
Speaker 0: we had ones that were.

151
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:02,006
Speaker 0: they were like little books and then they came with the tape that Went with the book as he would.

152
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:05,922
Speaker 0: you sort of listen to the tape while you read the book at the same time and you Get the sound effects.

153
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:09,252
Speaker 0: They would read to you or whatever, but then on the reverse sides.

154
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,817
Speaker 0: It was always record whatever you want.

155
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:20,460
Speaker 1: I Still think the best thing was my mom dug out a whole bunch of tapes I had made when I was a little kid and there was one where it was just I would turn the tape recorder.

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,028
Speaker 1: I carried it with me everywhere.

157
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,540
Speaker 1: And so I turned the tape recorder on at random times.

158
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,655
Speaker 1: And so you just get these conversations from like 20 years ago.

159
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:29,860
Speaker 1: It was kind of wild.

160
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: There was one where my mom was trying to get my toddler sister To get in the car and go to the clothing shop and my sister was being really uncooperative.

161
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,670
Speaker 1: So it's just this exchange, you know, it was.

162
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:41,835
Speaker 1: it was kind of funny.

163
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,260
Speaker 1: It's really nostalgic to listen.

164
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:49,479
Speaker 3: I have an hour of screaming and horrible noises mixed together in a loop that I then would Randomly just play.

165
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:54,993
Speaker 2: You were so much fun for your parents party guests.

166
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:58,964
Speaker 0: Remember the retro arcade.

167
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:04,020
Speaker 0: guys said that he had like a vinyl audio recording of his parents wedding and he restored it for them.

168
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,070
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's kind of awesome man.

169
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:06,613
Speaker 2: It is cool.

170
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:07,940
Speaker 1: That guy is cool.

171
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,769
Speaker 3: But the main reason as we mentioned

172
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:11,210
Speaker 1: in the beginning

173
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:39,140
Speaker 3: that we have these extra microphones here is that we actually you know Independently of Emily and Alex being friends of ours and such they are both Game designers working in the actual gaming industry making And pretty much we get the question either email to us or in the forums at least once an hour Asking us how to be a game developer and what it's really like or something to that effect.

174
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:48,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember a thread in the forums There was like a kid in high school who was like, this is what I want to pursue as my career You know, does anybody have any advice?

175
00:10:48,588 --> 00:11:06,465
Speaker 1: and actually there were quite a few people like Mancun, for example who actually have worked in the game industry and Immediately started giving this kid advice and warnings and like sometimes you'll have to work on pretty princess pony games Even if you

176
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:09,645
Speaker 0: don't want to you know Really seems like in a few.

177
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:19,200
Speaker 0: there's like a few jobs that like in any sort of geek area, you know There's always like some job that someone wants like all the skater kids want to like be Tony Hawk for a living.

178
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:19,602
Speaker 1: Yeah,

179
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:23,080
Speaker 0: all the gamer kids want to be like, you know, John Carmack for a living

180
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,937
Speaker 1: Programmers want to work at Google or animators want to work in

181
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:34,820
Speaker 2: Pixar Literally every programmer to whom I ever heard the question asked at RIT would say yeah, I want to make video games.

182
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 2: Yeah, like literally everyone.

183
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:41,111
Speaker 3: So I guess the first question is how did you two?

184
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,000
Speaker 3: well first, what do you both actually do?

185
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,120
Speaker 3: I mean, I can't explain to my grandma or my mom or anyone what I actually do for a living.

186
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,189
Speaker 3: So what do you actually do?

187
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,419
Speaker 1: Well, I'll go first.

188
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,760
Speaker 1: It was it's actually kind of a small studio.

189
00:11:54,001 --> 00:12:00,040
Speaker 1: So I actually my work is a lot more varied than it probably would be if I worked for a big studio like EA.

190
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:02,764
Speaker 1: I do Concept.

191
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:12,000
Speaker 1: my my official title is a virtual world character designer And so I do Basically all the art assets that go into the games.

192
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:19,400
Speaker 1: I do the character design, you know start out with Photoshop paintings and model sheets and then I go into 3d modeling.

193
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:21,711
Speaker 1: I texture and sometimes rig.

194
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:26,130
Speaker 1: I had some help with rigging Characters from an intern we had.

195
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,937
Speaker 1: he's still a very good friend of mine.

196
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:42,625
Speaker 1: But So modeling rigging, you know, basically the the 3d character creation from start to finish You know, I do a lot of the animation as well Design environments I do.

197
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:58,859
Speaker 1: I guess one of my main things lately is I've just been producing a ton of textures for For this virtual chat that we do and so it's like, you know fashions for avatars and Like 20 t-shirts a day or something, you know.

198
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:01,427
Speaker 1: So, what about you Alex?

199
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:01,889
Speaker 1: What do you do?

200
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,180
Speaker 2: Well, I program things.

201
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:08,676
Speaker 2: I would like to be more specific than that, but I really can't be I don't know.

202
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:13,632
Speaker 2: you said It's a small studio and we all kind of have to wear a bunch of hats.

203
00:13:13,813 --> 00:13:17,205
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I do graphical effects I do game logic.

204
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,775
Speaker 2: I do low-level networking stuff.

205
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:22,800
Speaker 2: I occasionally dabble in the website.

206
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,613
Speaker 3: Yeah, well, what's your actual job title?

207
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,960
Speaker 3: because I remembered being something cool.

208
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,540
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am a virtual world architect, which I agree sounds really cool.

209
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:51,556
Speaker 1: It's basically I do almost a little bit of almost everything design the framework of every single game we do and You you also do some artistically oriented programming like you do our shader development and particle simulations and stuff like that.

210
00:13:51,576 --> 00:14:00,195
Speaker 1: actually many of the the programming Things that you do have a have a visual effect in the final product.

211
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:06,498
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's Effects programming which is I guess the the best I can come up with for an actual field.

212
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:14,119
Speaker 2: for that it falls into this weird line that kind of straddles the the pure engineering and pure artistic ends of things.

213
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:15,686
Speaker 2: I'll agree.

214
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:16,979
Speaker 2: It's one of the more fun parts of my job.

215
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,620
Speaker 3: So to really illustrate I mean, you know people always ask how do you get into the gaming industry?

216
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,080
Speaker 3: How did both of you get into the gaming industry?

217
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Speaker 3: Because it's it seems like it's an impossible task for the majority of people who have ever lived in this earth.

218
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:47,698
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the thing is it seems very daunting because a lot of people they try to go for the big industry, you know the big houses and Competitions very fierce for like say EA or or other like valve or something like that.

219
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,717
Speaker 1: But with with me I I'm working for a startup.

220
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:59,359
Speaker 1: So I Ended up getting into it by a kind of lucky lucky chance here.

221
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:12,540
Speaker 1: I did a character design contest right when so sauce the parent company of muse games was starting out and That was back my senior year of college and I remember spending one night in my dorm room.

222
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:21,060
Speaker 1: I think it was like on my birthday or something was the deadline Drawing these two characters for this design contest and I got second place.

223
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:31,138
Speaker 1: I didn't win but in return they kept in contact with me and I come in and test their web applications for their travel website.

224
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:37,098
Speaker 1: and so I got to learn, you know, all the different people in the office and we became kind of friends.

225
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:45,140
Speaker 1: and Then one day a few months later I found out that they were looking for a character designer and I was just graduating.

226
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,863
Speaker 1: It was like a month before I graduated.

227
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,368
Speaker 1: So I ran and I was like me me seriously.

228
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,129
Speaker 1: That's what I do.

229
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:57,059
Speaker 1: and It worked out and they looked at my portfolio and decided that I was good enough and they hired me.

230
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,346
Speaker 1: And Alex you were kind of.

231
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:07,455
Speaker 1: that was kind of funny for you too because This is a lesson in the importance of connections.

232
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:21,625
Speaker 2: I got hired Networking and I the guy who had previously done my job had quit suddenly for personal reasons of his own yeah, and They needed a graphics program.

233
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:30,800
Speaker 2: and I happened to be a guy who'd done graphics programming at least a little bit Even though I wasn't doing it professionally at the time, but that was like your master's was in.

234
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:33,506
Speaker 2: It's what I had done in school.

235
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:40,486
Speaker 2: I had done, you know computer science, but I kind of focused on graphics Graphics programming broadly.

236
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,512
Speaker 3: Well, plus you did that RIT special.

237
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,780
Speaker 3: Hey stick around a little longer and you get a masters.

238
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,517
Speaker 2: Yes, that means you have to call me master.

239
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,586
Speaker 2: I'm hoping you do that.

240
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,716
Speaker 3: Did you get to wear that special hat to a graduation?

241
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:51,540
Speaker 0: I have a hood.

242
00:16:55,462 --> 00:17:05,326
Speaker 2: Yes, I was in the right place at the right time the right place being looking for a job in the New York area the right time being when the Social sauce needed a graphics program.

243
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:06,652
Speaker 1: Oh, man, did we ever?

244
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,560
Speaker 1: we were like you totally saved us.

245
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:09,403
Speaker 1: I was.

246
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,371
Speaker 1: I was very worried for about a week.

247
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,780
Speaker 1: They're like, oh my god, our main programmers gone.

248
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,563
Speaker 1: What are we gonna do?

249
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:30,259
Speaker 2: and as a result because I'm working for tiny little startup studio My first job in the games industry is as the Lee basically the lead developer of a studio Which is really not something it's possible to do any other way.

250
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:36,381
Speaker 2: This is normally an industry where as I understand it you have to do a lot of grunt work before you get to do cool Stuff.

251
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,329
Speaker 0: Yeah along those lines.

252
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:43,240
Speaker 0: I mean, I think that a lot of the punk kids out there, you know They want to be make video games.

253
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:48,660
Speaker 0: I you know I get the feeling that a lot of them think that they just are sort of gonna get the Miyamoto job where you say what?

254
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,178
Speaker 0: The game is gonna be and then it somehow it is.

255
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:57,869
Speaker 0: So what like, you know, you told us what you do on a broad level, but like, you know What do you do on like, you know the micro level.

256
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,498
Speaker 0: you go into work and is it?

257
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,263
Speaker 0: you know It's not.

258
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:01,878
Speaker 0: you're not playing video games all day.

259
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,519
Speaker 1: Can I say something real quick?

260
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:18,500
Speaker 1: That one of the things is good about Going the indie route and working for a smaller studio is we kind of do this a tour thing where?

261
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,320
Speaker 1: Every game that we've created so far seems to be somebody's pet project.

262
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:37,133
Speaker 1: Like the game that we're going to be talking about today was basically Alex's creation and like sledding was Brian's and The the next game is Austin's.

263
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,945
Speaker 1: so it's like having such a small team.

264
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:51,244
Speaker 1: you do get to have a lot more creative freedom and input into the Types of games that are being created but on a day-to-day basis, I'm It's late to any other.

265
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,515
Speaker 2: it's like any other programming job.

266
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:54,640
Speaker 2: I have a list of bugs.

267
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,644
Speaker 2: I go and fix them.

268
00:18:55,945 --> 00:19:07,365
Speaker 2: or I have a list list of features that I need to add to the software or I have you know the vague plan for a new piece of software that I'm in the process of either Writing out or prototyping

269
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:15,451
Speaker 1: and I guess it's the same for me where it's not every day that I'm doing like You know original characters.

270
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:23,480
Speaker 1: It seems like a lot of the time I'll just go into work and make like 50 chairs or something like that or or texture a bunch of crates.

271
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:42,772
Speaker 1: I remember having the conversation about making license plates and like 90% of Any computer job, it's just making the license plates In some ways in the ways in the ways of the geek I guess.

272
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,480
Speaker 3: so I guess very specifically like just you know.

273
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,427
Speaker 3: Let's get us up the notch a little bit.

274
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:50,560
Speaker 3: Let's let's engage on the high level as we talked about last week.

275
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,162
Speaker 3: Yeah, what?

276
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:54,514
Speaker 3: what specific skills or I guess classes from school?

277
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,340
Speaker 3: Would you say came the most in handy?

278
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,493
Speaker 0: Or previous experiences also?

279
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:06,012
Speaker 2: well I Work in mostly in C sharp, which is a language.

280
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,120
Speaker 2: I had never used before I came to this job.

281
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:15,427
Speaker 2: But at my previous job, I had to learn Python Perl and PHP which were also languages I had never used from until that job.

282
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:26,491
Speaker 2: So it's especially if you're a programmer you have to be flexible you have to be able to pick up a new language as Needed pretty much the right tool for the right job.

283
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can.

284
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,040
Speaker 0: I can definitely echo that times a billion.

285
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I've never had a job where I you know, I mean, you know, I worked at James.

286
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:42,213
Speaker 0: I had to do Ruby which I didn't really do before so much and I mean I've done Python sorta But now is the first time I'm doing it for super reels.

287
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:43,660
Speaker 0: times a hundred, you know.

288
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:52,460
Speaker 0: And the job I got right out of college I did PHP and MySQL which I had sorta kind of maybe done in one class kind of not really

289
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:59,518
Speaker 1: Well, I think one of the most important things once you get out of college is that a lot of the times you're going to Be teaching yourself.

290
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:14,740
Speaker 1: So make sure you go around the internet and find any available resources and tutorials and everything I feel like I've gotten a lot better at for example modeling and texturing since I graduated college.

291
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:22,600
Speaker 1: I mean most important classes I think for a character designer would definitely be like fine arts and figure drawing.

292
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:28,671
Speaker 1: You've got to be able to look at something and then Be able to create a character from it.

293
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,880
Speaker 1: You've got to have a good grasp of anatomy.

294
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,330
Speaker 1: Whether or not you do 3d or 2d.

295
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,092
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

296
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:44,240
Speaker 1: knowing the human form is going to be Absolutely essential to anybody doing video game art Also?

297
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:49,880
Speaker 1: Yeah basic if you're if you're 3d artists just take a lot of 3d classes, you know.

298
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,623
Speaker 1: Make sure you get a very well-rounded education and don't just focus on one Aspect.

299
00:21:55,663 --> 00:22:02,508
Speaker 1: do modeling rigging, you know programming too can be very useful For for rigging.

300
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:10,799
Speaker 3: so it's interesting how in this whole discussion The the topic of designing games from a game a pure game perspective hasn't come up at all.

301
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,700
Speaker 2: We haven't gotten there yet.

302
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:19,662
Speaker 3: It seems like most kids who want to get into the gaming industry always think oh I got a great idea for a game Are they?

303
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:22,778
Speaker 3: but it how much of the job is actually?

304
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,313
Speaker 3: Designing games from the game side versus implementing.

305
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:28,920
Speaker 3: This is a loaded question, obviously.

306
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:37,539
Speaker 2: Well, well, the design is a relatively small part of it on the one hand But that's not to say it's a small thing.

307
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:52,540
Speaker 2: if you're gonna actually Specify a design at the level the design of a game at a level that you could then go and implement it From an artistic or a programming standpoint you need to get really frighteningly specific.

308
00:22:54,047 --> 00:22:57,767
Speaker 2: I have somewhere Probably about a 10 or 15 page document.

309
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:00,614
Speaker 2: That is the original design doc for elementa.

310
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,038
Speaker 1: It's completely different.

311
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:07,920
Speaker 2: Yeah The game that it came out of it is actually very different from what that document originally specified.

312
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:12,779
Speaker 2: Because The thing that is most important, of course is that the game should be fun.

313
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,050
Speaker 2: Your game is not fun.

314
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,686
Speaker 3: change it, you know A lot of professional game developers could learn that.

315
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:23,860
Speaker 1: but we went through so many stages of play testing and got so much feedback.

316
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,690
Speaker 1: I think you developed the original game within like three weeks or something.

317
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,076
Speaker 1: It was like inside of a month, wasn't it?

318
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:36,632
Speaker 2: And then Engine which Going to go into game development get a proper engine.

319
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:42,260
Speaker 2: because if you want to go into engine programming That is a fine and good thing But that is not game development and do not fool yourself.

320
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:51,100
Speaker 2: But if you're going to go into game development and write your own engine It's not worth the effort 90% of the time the love guy did it, but he's crazy.

321
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,659
Speaker 2: It's not what I would recommend as your first project.

322
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:03,929
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing about making engines for most of the people who've made engines is that you know You have to sort of if you're gonna make an engine.

323
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:15,180
Speaker 0: it's sort of in the service of a game, you know It's like they didn't just make the quake engine and they make quake later, you know They made the quake engine for quake because there was no engine available that suited their needs or is even close.

324
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:23,305
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean In the making of a you need to make an actual game on the engine while you're making the engine so that you actually make The engine usable.

325
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:24,632
Speaker 3: well, even half-life.

326
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,140
Speaker 3: I mean half-life itself.

327
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,023
Speaker 3: They took the quake engine that already existed and they modified it to suit their own very heavily though But they did.

328
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,572
Speaker 3: they took a basic engine and modified.

329
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,979
Speaker 3: they didn't just write anything from scratch.

330
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:46,057
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like especially for all you aspiring bedroom coders out there you'll just save yourself a lot of work and produce probably a better-looking product.

331
00:24:46,338 --> 00:25:01,939
Speaker 2: if you Go for an engine that's already created It will save you a huge amount of time and headaches over very very minor things and as Emily suggested you'll be able to get a playable prototype of your game in a week or two.

332
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:10,100
Speaker 2: and That first playable prototype is really important because that's gonna tell you whether or not your your basic concept is actually worth playing.

333
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,451
Speaker 2: All the design docs in the world will only take you.

334
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:24,326
Speaker 2: so far the design doc and you know Analysis of the game from a mathematical theoretical standpoint can help you in the right direction But it won't itself.

335
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:25,751
Speaker 2: let you synthesize a fun game.

336
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,899
Speaker 2: that theory doesn't seem to be developed yet.

337
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:35,266
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, did you have any like, you know, you you would think right on paper at least that you know The designing of a fun game, you know.

338
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:40,160
Speaker 0: without you know, the trial and error method we would be somewhere in the psychology department.

339
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,392
Speaker 0: Did you have any like, you know psychology peoples on board?

340
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:48,146
Speaker 2: not as such no That's a hobbyist.

341
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,078
Speaker 1: I mean you've thought a lot about the psychology of games.

342
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:51,299
Speaker 1: Yes

343
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Speaker 2: The most directly psychological like the thing I can think of that came into the design was actually in terms of visual design because that is what's gonna Turn people off or on to your game before they even have a chance to experience your clever mechanics, whatever they are.

344
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,240
Speaker 0: Do judge by the book by the cover despite the saying as to not do so.

345
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:19,000
Speaker 1: It was kind of weird because I remember we we ended up doing the visual stuff.

346
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,092
Speaker 1: It actually wasn't a very taxing project.

347
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:42,684
Speaker 1: as far as art design went, you know Because there wasn't a lot of 3d modeling It was it was mostly just these 2d character cards these illustrations that I had to do And I remember I I presented these mood boards to show like what I was kind of going for and I remember our boss Had some reservations.

348
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:46,860
Speaker 1: he said, you know, I don't want this to be really heavy and dark and medieval looking.

349
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,394
Speaker 1: I you know, even though it's got this alchemy theme this and mythology going on I want it to be approachable much more hardcore.

350
00:26:54,495 --> 00:27:02,080
Speaker 2: in the original It's kind of lightens over time, which is fine because it wasn't necessary to the game.

351
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:10,048
Speaker 1: he wanted it to be more approachable and less, you know hard fantasy looking and I remember over that weekend.

352
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,973
Speaker 1: I did a series of five sketches.

353
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:24,194
Speaker 1: I did like a digital painting and a medieval kind of like illuminated manuscript looking and I did one that looked kind of Disney esque.

354
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:35,160
Speaker 1: and then I did this cut paper design and It was funny because even though it was one of the simplest Illustrations it seemed like everybody really like that one.

355
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:44,620
Speaker 1: It almost ended up with kind of this children's book Theme to it and I think that definitely changed the atmosphere of the game quite a bit.

356
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:53,479
Speaker 2: It was I still feel a very striking design and it's not one that You really see in any other game at least none that I can think of.

357
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you see you see it in South Park and such.

358
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,340
Speaker 0: but you know, you don't see that in video games too often.

359
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:03,680
Speaker 2: Yeah, I feel like there's some recent game that has this kind of like ripped cut paper theme going.

360
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:08,508
Speaker 2: It's in a slightly different direction than ours The blurst one the paper moon.

361
00:28:08,649 --> 00:28:10,616
Speaker 1: They did all with sharpies and stuff.

362
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:18,580
Speaker 2: But yeah the Anyway, it was a distinctive style and I think the distinctive style is gonna help from the that initial appeal point of view.

363
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:21,220
Speaker 2: It's it gets eyes on it, which is always helpful.

364
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:29,080
Speaker 1: So do you want to talk about a little bit how the actual game mechanics changed over time?

365
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:37,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was Like how the game works, you know, like just the basic, you know, don't need we don't need the rule book.

366
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,103
Speaker 3: We just need tell us the concept you started with and then we'll go from there through the evolutions All right.

367
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 2: Well as you may guess from the name of the game elementia It's about elements the before classical elements earth air fire water And it's a 2d kind of tile laying strategy game.

368
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:07,149
Speaker 2: the The original idea of the game, I think it actually on some level came out of a conversation I had with you two guys over Japanese food.

369
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,063
Speaker 1: I remember that time we were at the neko But it was.

370
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:34,899
Speaker 2: have these four elements have each of them provide a different benefits and then using them in concert is the strategy you have to develop and On top of that was developed to this Sort of cyclical element beating another rather than the usual Well more usual two opposites each of which, you know can strike hard at the other.

371
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:38,795
Speaker 2: It's everything beats one thing and is beaten by one other thing.

372
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:44,053
Speaker 2: in this perfect circle If you've played the fire emblem games, it's very similar to the weapon triangles in there.

373
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, they axe the spear in the sword.

374
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:52,360
Speaker 2: Yeah, this case it's fire beats air air beats earth earth beats water water beats fire or crystal warriors.

375
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:54,271
Speaker 0: Well, that's what is the.

376
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:55,216
Speaker 0: so it cross ways.

377
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,388
Speaker 2: it's just even Yep, so you have that.

378
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:03,294
Speaker 2: you have the the tile laying which is There are two purposes to it.

379
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:09,590
Speaker 2: There's the Arrange things so that Elements are adjacent to one another and provide the bonuses you need.

380
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:19,199
Speaker 2: and there's the chain everything up to make attacks with since The way we do you do the attacks in this game the more elements of the same color it passes through the stronger it is.

381
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:35,819
Speaker 2: So what we were trying to do is to create this tension between you want to stretch out in this long twisty chain but that's inherently fragile and you want to bunch things up to Produce all the adjacency benefits and protect each other and heal each other and all that good stuff.

382
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:42,879
Speaker 3: So did you start considering multiplayer from the start or single-player only or what was your thinking along those lines?

383
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,693
Speaker 2: multiplayer was in mind from the start.

384
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:52,020
Speaker 2: the Original idea for the multiplayer was this crazy shifting alliances thing.

385
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:57,172
Speaker 2: I'll say right now that a lot of stuff from elementia.

386
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,279
Speaker 2: I cribbed from one board game or another.

387
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:07,375
Speaker 2: The tile laying was originally basically straight out of T&E to take her son Euphrates Although it's kind of drifted since then.

388
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:19,279
Speaker 2: This alliance mechanic that it has also drifted from since then was inspired by Dune and it ended up Actually managing the alliances was going to be too complicated for what it would have gotten us.

389
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,009
Speaker 2: So we stuck to a strict.

390
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,960
Speaker 2: it's either a versus game or a co-op game.

391
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:31,099
Speaker 1: there's actually a fair number of maps that you developed and Do you want to talk about like the way the placing the elements?

392
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:43,074
Speaker 1: changed because for a while it was a draft and there were like cards and And then there was a point system and there originally it was.

393
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:50,719
Speaker 2: it was this card draw thing and that ended up being Basically wasn't adding anything anymore.

394
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:56,480
Speaker 2: So again, if a mechanic isn't helping get rid of it, you don't need the extra complexity.

395
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,969
Speaker 2: I mean the later development of this game was a battle with removing extra complexity.

396
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,590
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just keep it simple.

397
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:15,805
Speaker 2: Keep it simple and that was It's a very distinct thing between Four games which is on some level how I started thinking of this and a video game, which is what it actually is In that a board game.

398
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:19,076
Speaker 2: usually when you play it you sit down and there is someone there to teach you.

399
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:27,348
Speaker 2: that is Kind of a big crutch that board games can lean on and they can have a lot more Complexity and still appeal to a lot of people.

400
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:41,326
Speaker 2: where for a video game has to be entirely self-taught Even if you're playing multiplayer You're usually not playing multiplayer with someone who's gonna walk you through every action and teach you all the mechanics Even when they're willing to.

401
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:45,380
Speaker 2: they're not in the same room and it's really hard to do that over text chat or even voice chat.

402
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,972
Speaker 2: If you they can't point at the screen.

403
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's so true.

404
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,393
Speaker 0: I mean like how many times do I get like a flash game?

405
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,679
Speaker 0: and even if there are instructions I like maybe look at the controls and that's it.

406
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:01,896
Speaker 0: If I look at anything at all before I just click play and start playing and it's such a short attention span with a video Game you just you know, if you can't figure it out right away.

407
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:02,520
Speaker 0: It's like that's it.

408
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,082
Speaker 0: You're done.

409
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,320
Speaker 2: people aren't willing to read instructions and they aren't willing to figure it out for themselves.

410
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:11,680
Speaker 3: It's it's it's catch-22, but it's weird because as much in the games as I am I'm like that.

411
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,465
Speaker 3: I mean I sit down.

412
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:14,156
Speaker 3: I'm a wreck the dead by getting any as game.

413
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:17,032
Speaker 3: I take it home I put it straight in and I'd start the game.

414
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:17,978
Speaker 3: I hit a. see what ate.

415
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:18,930
Speaker 3: it hit B C would beat.

416
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,500
Speaker 3: it hit them both.

417
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:22,119
Speaker 3: I just try every button combination and then I'd go and that was it.

418
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really hard on the computer though.

419
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,483
Speaker 0: Cuz you have a keyboard with so many buttons that if you're gonna use it at all It's.

420
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:28,877
Speaker 0: you know, it's whoa.

421
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:36,940
Speaker 2: You're of a mindset that you'll sit down to do that to a game and you'll actually do that until you figure it out.

422
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:38,909
Speaker 1: Some people just go.

423
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,440
Speaker 1: Oh, this is complicated.

424
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,173
Speaker 2: Yeah, say it's complicated.

425
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,704
Speaker 2: I don't want to bother Mmm, is that?

426
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:50,123
Speaker 0: did you see that a lot in the testing like, you know, you'd get someone to play the game and they be Like I was too complicated.

427
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:50,624
Speaker 0: What do I do?

428
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:55,800
Speaker 2: Yeah, the the UI went through numerous revisions as a result of all that.

429
00:33:56,381 --> 00:34:04,083
Speaker 1: That was probably the biggest challenge in getting the game ready for release was getting the UI so it wasn't confusing.

430
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:11,773
Speaker 1: people seemed like no matter what we did or how we designed the The wheel at the bottom showing the the progression of the elements.

431
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,540
Speaker 1: Everybody was like, what does this do?

432
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,608
Speaker 1: I don't understand this game at all.

433
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:18,020
Speaker 2: Yeah, so there were a lot of iterations.

434
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:30,937
Speaker 2: There was again complexity being stripped out where it wasn't absolutely strictly necessary and in the end I think we actually came up with something pretty cool and All this iteration and forcing us to think about it did help the final product.

435
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,251
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean that's something I've noticed a lot.

436
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:52,800
Speaker 0: actually is that you know When I when I look at indie games and when I look at professionally made games It seems like the indie games have these really good ideas But they really struggle on like a lot of basic things like controls and interface and these sorts of things and the professional games Often might not have much interesting going on in terms of the actual game.

437
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:03,795
Speaker 0: But the interface is always correct and the you know, the the controls always are work and are well calibrated and all that That's what you get when you can hire a dedicated interface designer.

438
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:09,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously We did have an intern that you'd let him test stuff.

439
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:13,507
Speaker 2: and yes You you need testing.

440
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:25,480
Speaker 2: in any software development in game development You need more and additional kinds of testing than I think in any other kind With possible exception of life-or-death stuff like air traffic control.

441
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,120
Speaker 2: Yeah, seriously because in addition to testing the the pure functionality of it You need to test that very subjective.

442
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:33,986
Speaker 2: Is it fun thing?

443
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:38,040
Speaker 2: and you need to test that on people who have never played the game before?

444
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,636
Speaker 2: Which becomes increasingly hard to find as you you run through your list of friends who are willing to test and

445
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 1: all sorts of people Like, you know, you want to try to get different Demographics to test it and see okay So this is big with board gamers, but does this 30 year old lawyer lady like to play?

446
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:22,370
Speaker 1: No, but we do have Once once a month we have this open open studio night where it's it's the muse games game night where you can Come and eat free pizza and test the games so that that actually helped a little bit in getting a variety of people to Just give us their basic reactions on the

447
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:23,955
Speaker 2: huge help.

448
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,775
Speaker 0: Yeah The cost of the pizza.

449
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:30,663
Speaker 2: Oh, yes totally so.

450
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:41,296
Speaker 3: did you ever get frustrated showing someone a game and trying to not explain things to them to see if they figure it Out on their own and seeing them clearly not figuring it out, even though it's so obvious to you.

451
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:54,468
Speaker 2: Yes But I was helped in this in that Before we ran the first of these game nights I'd been flipping through various Game design documents from other companies.

452
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,857
Speaker 2: valve in particular is as a huge resource of stuff.

453
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:58,780
Speaker 2: They just put online.

454
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,608
Speaker 2: It's their old GDC presentations and that sort of thing.

455
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:18,880
Speaker 2: One of which was about the importance of hands-off testing where You the designer don't sit there and walk walk someone through the game you stand back and you watch their reaction See when they flounder and see when they're really picking it up quick and stuff like that.

456
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:29,431
Speaker 1: And it's hard because it's like, you know having played the game so many times and being so familiar You at least I end up kind of lacking a perspective.

457
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:40,720
Speaker 1: So I just want to be like no no see that's how you do it But you just got to force yourself to let them Figure it out on their own and acknowledge if they can't figure it out on your own you're doing something wrong.

458
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,099
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what you're gonna work on tomorrow.

459
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,172
Speaker 0: Games do exist that people figure out it on their own.

460
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:50,578
Speaker 0: And so if yours isn't then that's Hopefully it is now.

461
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,038
Speaker 0: So does your game have any sort of?

462
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,584
Speaker 0: Musics going on.

463
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,359
Speaker 1: Oh, I love the musics.

464
00:37:58,082 --> 00:38:20,417
Speaker 1: It was an acquaintance of our marketing guy and the guy who designed the website Austin and There was this composer that he knew and we sent him some demo tracks and One of the things my my vote was I was like I want something kind of ephemeral kind of like that end of time from Chrono Trigger.

465
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:21,380
Speaker 1: and he wrote back.

466
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,190
Speaker 1: He was like, I love Chrono Trigger.

467
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,100
Speaker 1: He's actually a pretty big video gamer.

468
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:28,515
Speaker 2: So and that's when we knew we had probably found the right guy.

469
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:41,720
Speaker 1: Yeah His tracks turned out really nice Nicely, I don't know how you describe it kind of Bells and piano and it's not too overpowering.

470
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:50,432
Speaker 2: it's it's not like a grandiose score, but I mean this is It's kind of a contemplative game and I think the music reinforces that.

471
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:53,079
Speaker 0: yeah, you have sound effects like, you know.

472
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:58,700
Speaker 0: Yep, did you make them or did you just buy them or what?

473
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:14,566
Speaker 2: Yeah, we have a sound library that was minimally massaged by me wearing a sound designer hat And I I created the particle effects to go along with With those sound effects.

474
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:17,980
Speaker 1: So like if you click on the fire attack, there'll be like flames.

475
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,920
Speaker 0: And it was so that you see you're listening to the sound and then you had to make an animation that match.

476
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:25,238
Speaker 0: It was opposed to vice-versa opposite, wasn't it?

477
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:30,572
Speaker 2: We really needed sound in this thing.

478
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the sound adds a lot.

479
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:33,600
Speaker 1: I mean people.

480
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:35,124
Speaker 1: You know when?

481
00:39:35,846 --> 00:39:45,050
Speaker 1: when you're not actually creating a game I guess people don't realize how much Just simple sound effects will add to the overall product.

482
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:58,440
Speaker 0: Well, I mean think about that Terminator game for the NES that soundtrack Yeah, where everything was the same exact noise No matter what happens you shoot you get hit Or Atari.

483
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:03,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, so do you guys have like a?

484
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,960
Speaker 0: you know, you're you're not a big game studio.

485
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,089
Speaker 0: You're probably not selling this thing for like $50, right?

486
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,513
Speaker 0: So is there a?

487
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,980
Speaker 0: what is the money-making strategies you got there?

488
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,884
Speaker 1: It's the game.

489
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:20,260
Speaker 1: the core game itself is is free playable to anybody who has the unity plug-in.

490
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,739
Speaker 0: Is that also free?

491
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,540
Speaker 1: Unity plug-in is completely free and I'd actually recommend you download it.

492
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:36,359
Speaker 1: I mean, I know a lot of the people listening to the show are probably really leery of installing any you know plugins on their computer.

493
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:47,711
Speaker 1: But there's this browser plug-in that works with the game engine that we use unity 3d and allows you for 3d game content in your browser.

494
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,580
Speaker 2: and it's not just us we're using it.

495
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,917
Speaker 2: There are a few big companies who are using it and there are a million little indie game developers using it.

496
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,869
Speaker 2: So So far as I know there's nothing else that is actually really doing this right now in terms of Letting you put 3d stuff in a web page.

497
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,620
Speaker 2: There's the the nascent Google Mozilla efforts.

498
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:13,516
Speaker 2: But yeah, even those there may be 3d, but they're not a full game Proprietary - I mean there's like the quick live.

499
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:21,380
Speaker 2: Yeah Application an instant action, which is just a wrapper that lets it install any application it wants.

500
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:31,040
Speaker 1: It's basically like the 3d version of flash is I guess the easiest way I've heard it explained.

501
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:45,196
Speaker 1: But so you install the plug-in you go to our site and the games there to play But we will release further maps and other characters through the store.

502
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:53,980
Speaker 1: and The part of the thing with elementia is it's got this mythological theme and there's all these.

503
00:41:54,181 --> 00:42:02,066
Speaker 1: You know the Sun the moon Saturn you know Jupiter very very Greek mythology oriented.

504
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:13,200
Speaker 1: and I guess Half of the characters as of yet are free and the other half they have different powers different special abilities.

505
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:30,136
Speaker 2: you can buy them for a for a pittance in the news game store and Because I know someone out there is gonna ask this because it's the question I would ask No, you do not get the inherently better characters by spending money on them About this.

506
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:34,172
Speaker 2: The additional characters do provide you with other options.

507
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,636
Speaker 2: They're all.

508
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:36,980
Speaker 2: the characters are asymmetrical.

509
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:46,365
Speaker 2: They provide for very different play styles But we were very careful to try to not make any of them strictly better than the others because the people who spend money are Not just gonna win.

510
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,240
Speaker 2: No, we've seen how that ruins.

511
00:42:52,002 --> 00:43:02,295
Speaker 0: So it's not the Korean model it's just sort of a you know People who are big fans and want to want to do something Having a free demo and then you pay for the full version.

512
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:07,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, and That one of the things I think is really good about the game is one.

513
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:07,612
Speaker 1: it's.

514
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:10,560
Speaker 1: it's two-player multiplayer four-player multiplayer.

515
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:12,813
Speaker 1: It's either versus or cooperative.

516
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:16,658
Speaker 1: It's you know, it can be played totally solitaire.

517
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:32,097
Speaker 1: and The thing with the maps is you made a whole bunch of different variations where the Plague the enemy grows in different ways and there's different obstacles and stuff like that.

518
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:34,758
Speaker 1: lay out of the board changes with each new map.

519
00:43:35,962 --> 00:43:37,353
Speaker 2: Provide some replayability there.

520
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:44,382
Speaker 3: Yeah That stuff really reminds me of the miasma from Crystal Chronicles Wasn't it?

521
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:48,640
Speaker 2: based in part on the fungi from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind?

522
00:43:49,242 --> 00:43:56,140
Speaker 1: Because it used to be called putrefaction before it was called the plague and I I thought the sea of corruption.

523
00:43:56,361 --> 00:44:04,718
Speaker 1: So I spent like I don't know three or four hours Just digging up pictures of mushrooms and that black mold in Michigan and Nausicaa.

524
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:14,820
Speaker 1: I looked at all these weird plants from Nausicaa and So the the gloppiness of the of the enemy is it's a little a bit based on that.

525
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:16,185
Speaker 1: It's kind of moldy.

526
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,494
Speaker 0: So you said it was a. it was a browser plug-in.

527
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,000
Speaker 0: So does it work in all the browsers?

528
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:22,089
Speaker 0: I mean like Safari 4 just came out today.

529
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:22,370
Speaker 0: I don't know.

530
00:44:22,571 --> 00:44:23,656
Speaker 0: probably doesn't work in that right.

531
00:44:23,676 --> 00:44:24,178
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.

532
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:29,560
Speaker 2: Safari 4 it does work in Safari doesn't work in Safari 4. it probably will shortly.

533
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:38,452
Speaker 2: It works in IE Mozilla Chrome Safari on Windows and Mac.

534
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:43,149
Speaker 2: there is no Linux version Unfortunately, there is demand for this and they've.

535
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,940
Speaker 2: the developers of unity have said that they're looking into it, but they haven't gotten to it yet.

536
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:51,520
Speaker 1: They better do my facial morph targets before they do that.

537
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:59,449
Speaker 0: It works, you know, like, you know me but I mean like when you make a website, you know You always have to worry about all the different browsers.

538
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,840
Speaker 0: Does this have a problem with that or no?

539
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:06,020
Speaker 2: The unity itself is actually very good about cross browser compatibility.

540
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:15,919
Speaker 2: There are occasional wrinkles with the cross operating system compatibility because it uses different Layers to talk to the hardware, but even those are relatively minor.

541
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,700
Speaker 0: I'd say you know You wouldn't like recommend one browser over the other for playing it.

542
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,080
Speaker 0: You would just say we use whichever one is the one you're using.

543
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:24,993
Speaker 2: Sadly, I have to generally.

544
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:35,468
Speaker 2: yes, sadly I have to make a ding against Firefox and that Firefox apparently has terrible memory management on some level And it causes weird garbage collector hiccups.

545
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,692
Speaker 2: There's nothing you can't play through.

546
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:38,338
Speaker 0: So that's Firefox 3 you're talking about.

547
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:39,000
Speaker 2: That is Firefox.

548
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:41,327
Speaker 0: I'd be interested in Firefox three and a half.

549
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:42,310
Speaker 0: Have you tested that out?

550
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:43,053
Speaker 2: I have not.

551
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:43,594
Speaker 2: I'll have to do that.

552
00:45:43,614 --> 00:45:44,256
Speaker 0: That'd be interesting.

553
00:45:44,296 --> 00:45:47,678
Speaker 0: Yeah That's enough technical whatnots.

554
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:51,689
Speaker 1: So you guys have played the game right.

555
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,840
Speaker 0: I played it a few times a little bit.

556
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:04,944
Speaker 0: I played it while I was having beer and pizza after work Of course, I think I've only played the actual finished game though, like once or twice, you know, I played the Unfinished game a few other times.

557
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:07,469
Speaker 1: I remember you were very obsessed with the old man.

558
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:08,230
Speaker 1: You're like old man.

559
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,240
Speaker 0: Well, I like the characters.

560
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:16,578
Speaker 2: Lemon party You brought it up, not us.

561
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:18,971
Speaker 0: Rin brought it up.

562
00:46:20,045 --> 00:46:20,859
Speaker 3: Lemon party.

563
00:46:22,623 --> 00:46:24,518
Speaker 1: This is not good promotional material.

564
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,386
Speaker 0: The characters are all you know, it's like.

565
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:27,650
Speaker 0: it's like on the one hand.

566
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:35,080
Speaker 0: They're like all you know, sort of, you know stylistic But they're also sort of cute and quirky in a way, you know, it's like they do all have a lot of personnel.

567
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:46,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like when I. it's like whenever I play a video game with characters, you know, like a fighting game or whatever You know, it's like there's always some characters obviously better or worse, right?

568
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,854
Speaker 0: But I try not to pick based on that.

569
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:51,348
Speaker 0: It's like when I play a board game I always pick green because I like green.

570
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:58,700
Speaker 0: so when I play a video game and there's a character selection I try to pick a character that looks, you know, you know as something I like, you know.

571
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,473
Speaker 0: So if I'm playing Street Fighter, I'll pick you know M. Bison because he I just I just like his look better than I like The other people, you know.

572
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:12,960
Speaker 0: or I'll pick You know Siegfried in Soulcalibur because he's a big knight with a giant sword and all the other people are sort of.

573
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:20,339
Speaker 0: I'm not interested in them, you know, so You know in in this game There's sort of like this quirky old man with a cane and he's sort of like whoo.

574
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:29,620
Speaker 0: His head's like leaning over a little bit and he's sort of like, you know He reminds me of sort of like, you know, like the sort of silly old man in a lot of animes and whatnot.

575
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:38,349
Speaker 1: I should do you a little animation of him just to make you happy like take After Effects and be like I was that he's not animated in the actual game.

576
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,652
Speaker 1: No, he's not animated.

577
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:41,036
Speaker 1: I didn't have time to do that.

578
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:45,433
Speaker 0: I was making t-shirts You plan to like, you know, I mean, you know not.

579
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:47,060
Speaker 0: the game is like done and out, right?

580
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,840
Speaker 0: Yes, it is So are you going to continue though to you know iterate upon it or are you just gonna you know?

581
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,146
Speaker 0: Leave it be and move on.

582
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:58,037
Speaker 2: Um, well, that's partly gonna depend on What feedback we get about it?

583
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:04,859
Speaker 2: I don't think any of the other games we've released have ever actually been finished So I see no reason to expect that for this one.

584
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:16,980
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, part of the reason why I didn't animate the characters on the character cards was that we do have two other games in the pipeline.

585
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,020
Speaker 1: This is really only our second full game release.

586
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,939
Speaker 1: I mean, we have that virtual world chat, but that's not really a game per se.

587
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 2: Although in fairness, a lot of the technology we developed for that fed into all our other games.

588
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely.

589
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:36,940
Speaker 1: And actually, it had the most art asset creation for it.

590
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,339
Speaker 1: But so this is like our second game game after Extreme Sledding.

591
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,200
Speaker 1: And there's two other games in the pipeline.

592
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Speaker 1: Can you tell us anything about them, or is that still a proprietary secret?

593
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:48,540
Speaker 1: What do you think?

594
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:51,660
Speaker 1: Can I say the buzzword for the one?

595
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:54,439
Speaker 2: I think we can say one magical word about one of them.

596
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:55,696
Speaker 1: Air pirates.

597
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,440
Speaker 3: That's two words.

598
00:48:57,722 --> 00:48:57,908
Speaker 2: Oh, no.

599
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:01,659
Speaker 1: Air pirates and airships.

600
00:49:01,944 --> 00:49:02,840
Speaker 1: Be prepared.

601
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:13,140
Speaker 3: So having actually brought this game to completion from the beginning as kind of people just getting into the gaming industry, what did you learn?

602
00:49:15,403 --> 00:49:18,800
Speaker 3: Like, what would you have done differently from the start making this game?

603
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:27,137
Speaker 2: Well, one, I have a much greater grasp of how much complexity you can actually expect people to pick up on, especially for a little browser game.

604
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,400
Speaker 2: And it has taught me to rein in my ambitions for the future.

605
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,240
Speaker 1: And I don't know.

606
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,680
Speaker 1: As far as I'm concerned, like I said, it was a very simple game as far as art asset creation.

607
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:52,660
Speaker 1: But I think one thing that really left an impression on me is, you know, GUI design is incredibly important.

608
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:59,360
Speaker 1: And I should definitely start earlier in the design process with developing a GUI.

609
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:08,660
Speaker 1: And like each iteration, each change in gameplay, you've got to adjust your ideas of the layout of the interface.

610
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:14,520
Speaker 1: And I guess the interface, we really started working on that way late in the game.

611
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,380
Speaker 1: We had like a very standard boxes thing--.

612
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,098
Speaker 2: It was crappy with the [INAUDIBLE] --for a long time, yeah.

613
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:41,760
Speaker 1: So I think every time Alex changes a gameplay element, I think I'll also have to look at it, and along with our other design people like Austin, and kind of brainstorm about how can we make this particular iteration very intuitive and playable.

614
00:50:42,361 --> 00:50:49,138
Speaker 2: If you're one of those aspiring game developers out there, I have a piece of very, I think, cogent advice for you.

615
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:58,439
Speaker 2: Inevitably, if you're a wannabe game developer, you have in mind some huge sprawling game.

616
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:11,539
Speaker 2: Statistically, from what I've seen, it's very likely to be an RPG, but it doesn't have to be, with a million really cool and novel mechanics, and really great graphics, and a really awesome story, and wonderful music.

617
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:13,020
Speaker 2: And that's great.

618
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,119
Speaker 2: And that's a great thing to shoot for, but you have to understand you're not going to make it on your first try.

619
00:51:18,506 --> 00:51:27,999
Speaker 2: It's kind of like-- You have to be willing to focus on the things that are really important about the game, the most important elements, whatever they are.

620
00:51:28,441 --> 00:51:29,278
Speaker 2: Make those work.

621
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,860
Speaker 2: And if you can add stuff that works with them rather than against them, great.

622
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,740
Speaker 2: But if you can't, leave it small and perfect.

623
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,700
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of like how I was when I first entered film school.

624
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,780
Speaker 1: It's like I really wanted to do this big epic feature thing.

625
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:53,700
Speaker 1: And then I realized, no, just concentrate on getting a damn good three minutes worth of footage, and then start to increase your ambition.

626
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:57,440
Speaker 1: But yeah, start small and start solid.

627
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:04,580
Speaker 1: Come up with something really well thought out, and then you can start to work your way up the ladder.

628
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:09,879
Speaker 2: Do not allow yourself the luxury of saying, I know this, and this, and this.

629
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,687
Speaker 2: This one part.

630
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:12,540
Speaker 2: I'm kind of fuzzy on, but I'll figure it out later.

631
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:12,995
Speaker 2: No.

632
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,059
Speaker 2: Sit down and figure that part out now.

633
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:16,880
Speaker 0: Or else it'd be Dwarf Fortress.

634
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:17,931
Speaker 1: I don't know.

635
00:52:18,862 --> 00:52:20,799
Speaker 2: I don't think that's where Dwarf Fortress has issues.

636
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:22,019
Speaker 2: I don't think so.

637
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,216
Speaker 2: It has issues.

638
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:23,974
Speaker 2: I won't deny.

639
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:27,880
Speaker 0: I just wanted to rip on Dwarf Fortress.

640
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,400
Speaker 1: So you too, review time.

641
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,659
Speaker 1: Do you like the game, yes or no?

642
00:52:33,242 --> 00:52:33,474
Speaker 1: YN?

643
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,031
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've played it enough to figure out if I like it or not.

644
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,299
Speaker 0: I got to play it a few more times.

645
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,760
Speaker 0: Because definitely when I played it most recently, it was way different from what I remembered.

646
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,640
Speaker 3: Because we were playing like that beta beta version on the right.

647
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,180
Speaker 1: I remember I was playing the beta beta version version.

648
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,259
Speaker 1: We were all sitting in front of the TV that I played the beta beta version.

649
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:57,520
Speaker 0: And it seemed kind of because like I would put out a whole bunch of balls and they would die really slowly.

650
00:52:57,701 --> 00:53:00,980
Speaker 0: And it was sort of like it was that, you know, it was like I was.

651
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,600
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell if I was winning or losing.

652
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:05,359
Speaker 0: And, you know, I could put so much stuff out.

653
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:07,840
Speaker 0: And it was just sort of like this attrition kind of thing.

654
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,940
Speaker 0: But when I played it more recently against Alex, it just sort of got creamed immediately.

655
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:16,515
Speaker 0: So it was definitely a much tighter game.

656
00:53:16,536 --> 00:53:17,319
Speaker 0: where you can you can.

657
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,579
Speaker 0: It was a very significant winning and losing.

658
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,071
Speaker 3: Well, there's definitely the increasing cost.

659
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:31,180
Speaker 3: as you do one action more and more to discourage the, you know, obvious, make a whole bunch of red and then destroy a whole bunch of stuff with that red.

660
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,820
Speaker 1: I like the increasing price mechanic.

661
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,959
Speaker 1: I think that added a lot.

662
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:41,520
Speaker 0: I think what it is to sum up what I was saying is that in the earlier version of the game, it felt like your individual moves mattered less.

663
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:45,439
Speaker 0: And in the more recent one, each move matters a whole lot more.

664
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:49,040
Speaker 0: And so a wrong move here or there can be the difference.

665
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,600
Speaker 0: So there's actually significant decisions being made all the time.

666
00:53:53,242 --> 00:53:56,620
Speaker 0: And that is that is definitely a good thing in a game that I like, at least.

667
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,700
Speaker 0: I don't know about other people.

668
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:04,240
Speaker 2: I think it was Sid Meyer who said the immortal phrase that every game designer should know a game is a series of interesting decisions.

669
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:05,440
Speaker 0: Yes, that is correct.

670
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:14,200
Speaker 3: I guess I I feel like it'll shine the most in multiplayer because knowing that there's a human making these important decisions on the other side always means a lot to me.

671
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,959
Speaker 3: And of course, you all out in the forums can just play this game with us.

672
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,680
Speaker 1: Just please play this game.

673
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,239
Speaker 1: Everybody listening, please.

674
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:24,300
Speaker 1: Emily asked you, please go check it out.

675
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,360
Speaker 3: I'd be very happy if you have things to say.

676
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,128
Speaker 3: Good or bad.

677
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,040
Speaker 3: Just post them in the forum.

678
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:29,563
Speaker 2: Yeah.

679
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,331
Speaker 2: Or email us.

680
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:31,220
Speaker 2: We're there.

681
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:31,763
Speaker 2: We'll listen.

682
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:32,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're.

683
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,799
Speaker 1: I mean, seriously.

684
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,403
Speaker 1: Thank us.

685
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:35,979
Speaker 1: We're front row crew.

686
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,120
Speaker 3: Just yes, you've got the rare opportunity to talk directly to the game designers about a game they made.

687
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we might actually listen to you.

688
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,698
Speaker 1: That's a rarity in this business.

689
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,479
Speaker 1: Except with tribes, too, where they listen to much.

690
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:51,919
Speaker 0: Let's not go down that road.

691
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:52,865
Speaker 0: So the game is.

692
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:54,780
Speaker 0: so the game is a browser plug any thing.

693
00:54:55,361 --> 00:55:01,580
Speaker 0: And like, you know, other browser games like, say, desktop tower defense, they get like they get posted in like a whole bunch of different sites.

694
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:07,780
Speaker 0: Is your you know, is it possible to put like unity game on like the congregate and all sorts of places or is it only at your website?

695
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:09,285
Speaker 2: It is.

696
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,220
Speaker 2: It is possible to put a unity game on any site you want.

697
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,919
Speaker 2: I don't believe congregate supports them yet, although they have.

698
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,380
Speaker 2: I've heard internal mutterings that they might eventually.

699
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,422
Speaker 3: I don't know.

700
00:55:21,442 --> 00:55:23,960
Speaker 3: You know, I could see it partly just because unity does.

701
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,035
Speaker 3: It really serves a different purpose from flash and it does 3D.

702
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,400
Speaker 0: Well, it's definitely more game centric.

703
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,418
Speaker 0: I mean, is unity used for anything that's not a game?

704
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:40,700
Speaker 2: The closest non game thing I've seen it used for is educational simulations of various kinds, sort of architectural visualization.

705
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:44,099
Speaker 1: Oh, I've seen I've seen architectural stuff done with it.

706
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:51,100
Speaker 2: But it is very specifically a game engine as opposed to Flash, which is this animation tool come programming tool.

707
00:55:51,640 --> 00:56:07,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, I think in terms of game, like the the programming side of it, it it manages the physics and stuff very well, which Flash does not do.

708
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:11,220
Speaker 1: Anyway, amuse games.

709
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:29,200
Speaker 1: There aren't really any unity game portals right now, but we're kind of hoping that maybe someday our site can become a hub for independent developers, you know, us as a studio, but also us as a community for unity.

710
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,060
Speaker 0: That's definitely a good thing to go for.

711
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:33,980
Speaker 0: I mean, nothing succeeds today without building a community around it.

712
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,890
Speaker 1: That's the big part of it.

713
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,462
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:56:36,482 --> 00:56:38,680
Speaker 0: Podcast game, open source project.

715
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:45,659
Speaker 1: And another part of our our business plan is even though we're a very small team, we're about five people.

716
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,480
Speaker 1: We we really want to make games that are fun to play multiplayer over the Internet.

717
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:59,020
Speaker 1: So both multiplayer and single player is one of the requirements for every game we do.

718
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,907
Speaker 0: So you had five people.

719
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:09,079
Speaker 0: about how long did it take, you know, from like let's make a game to well, from let's make this game to it today.

720
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,438
Speaker 1: Well, Muse, Muse Games itself was was launched on April 14th.

721
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,158
Speaker 1: But this game has been in development since when about, um, it's a few months ago.

722
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:27,660
Speaker 2: I spent about a month doing the original design document, but that was not the only thing I was working on.

723
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:28,773
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the thing.

724
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:45,259
Speaker 2: It's really hard to think because, you know, we're always doing about two weeks to have a what I would actually call a playable prototype and then about another three weeks to a month of work to get it to the final state.

725
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,820
Speaker 2: Again, interspersed with other projects here and there.

726
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,460
Speaker 2: That's why it's actually been more like two months since the design document was finished.

727
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,920
Speaker 0: Two months is pretty good for, you know, an entire game.

728
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,680
Speaker 0: I mean, at that rate, you could make, you know, six games a year.

729
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:09,820
Speaker 0: And when you're you know, at least from what I've seen, if you're making small games that are probably not going to be like, you know, stupid, popular all over the Internet, it's, you know, quantity is is a good thing to have.

730
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:16,120
Speaker 2: That is roughly what we're shooting for is a game every two months, and especially now that the site is up and we can focus our energies on the actual games.

731
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that was a big part of it.

732
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,460
Speaker 1: There was a lot of, you know, creating icons for the store and stuff like that.

733
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:27,599
Speaker 0: And since we all have many hats, so you won't have to do that again because they'll just know this.

734
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:37,979
Speaker 1: The site is there and we can really hone in on doing the, you know, about eight weeks of full on game development if stuff goes well.

735
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,355
Speaker 3: So the game is Elementia, Moo...

736
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:41,838
Speaker 1: Elementia!

737
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,199

Speaker 2: Well, he does know my name.

748
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,620
Speaker 2: He just knows it only in translation, apparently.

749
