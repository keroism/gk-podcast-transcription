1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,115
Speaker 0: It's Thursday March 22nd, 2012.

2
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,999
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,901
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:15,445
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,550
Speaker 0: Tonight, I talk a bit about my trip to India.

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,348
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,257
Speaker 0: So, you know, we're always kind of hard up more of a Tuesday thing to play hardcore board games.

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,262
Speaker 0: Like, it's funny because I remember there was a time when we'd complain about the people who complained about that because we could always just get a game going.

9
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,800
Speaker 0: But, uh, it's surprisingly more difficult just with doing more stuff.

10
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:45,900
Speaker 0: So we have our own, like, private board game night independent of all these other, like, board game things we do in the city.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,668
Speaker 1: And even then it's still hard to get real games.

12
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,080
Speaker 0: Because basically one person shows up every other week.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,146
Speaker 1: Or too many people show up.

14
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:56,080
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the thing with hardcore games is that to play, it's weird.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,612
Speaker 1: It's like, most people have the problem of they have no friends.

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,736
Speaker 1: At least most nerds.

17
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:01,780
Speaker 1: Or they have very few friends.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,440
Speaker 1: So if they want to play anything for reals, it's very difficult.

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,685
Speaker 1: They can't even get a Mario party going on.

20
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:09,400
Speaker 0: Even if they have a lot of friends, the friends are not in the same physical location.

21
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,003
Speaker 1: Right.

22
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:13,360
Speaker 1: So, you know, to even have anyone is already lucky.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,220
Speaker 1: But it's like, in order to, you know, certain activities require very specific circumstances.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,480
Speaker 1: To play a hardcore board game, a German game, usually you need exactly three, four, five people.

25
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,489
Speaker 1: Usually four or five, right?

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,600
Speaker 1: Four is mostly the optimal number.

27
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,680
Speaker 1: And you need to be in the same place.

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:38,000
Speaker 1: You need to have, like, two or three hours of time set aside specifically for this without distractions.

29
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,696
Speaker 1: And you all need to be dedicated and saying, "Yes, this is what we're gonna

30
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:42,756
Speaker 1: do.".

31
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:52,673
Speaker 0: But, at the same time... You know, we tried to make the hardcore, like, semi-private, like, it's like the high-class club, like, "Oh, you, sir, are a distinguished board gamer.

32
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,278
Speaker 0: We will invite you to our private, fancy board game

33
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:55,819
Speaker 0: party!".

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,545
Speaker 0: *sad noises*.

35
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:01,733
Speaker 0: But, uh, all the people we invite are just as busy with stuff as we are.

36
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:02,676
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, I can't come.

37
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:03,578
Speaker 0: I'm going to the night

38
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,019
Speaker 0: market.".

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:04,819
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,232
Speaker 0: Which is actually pretty cool.

41
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:06,819
Speaker 0: And anyway...

42
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,120
Speaker 1: Or they show up and they just want to play, like, spot it and dix it and they don't want to play for serious.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Speaker 0: So we tried the Geek Night Strategy, also known as the Penny Arcade Strategy.

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:27,060
Speaker 0: If we scheduled our private board game night every other week, and we held it no matter what, and sometimes me and Scott would sit here, the two of us playing games.

45
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:28,719
Speaker 0: Usually, Chase would come, we'd have three.

46
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:33,540
Speaker 0: But, uh, for whatever reason, last night was, like, the night.

47
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:37,260
Speaker 0: We had the exact right number of people to play two simultaneous sets of games.

48
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,440
Speaker 1: Well, even so, the hardcore game only half-finished.

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,860
Speaker 1: But it's a great game, by the way.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, Brass looks pretty good.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,824
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

52
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,557
Speaker 1: And the other game was not hardcore.

53
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:46,819
Speaker 1: It's Dixit.

54
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played some Dixit, and we played, uh, Cameltron.

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,494
Speaker 1: Cameltron's somewhat hardcore.

56
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:51,880
Speaker 1: That's respectable.

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,420
Speaker 0: The thing is, you know, the board game night also had a large social element, 'cause it'd been a while since we had a lot of people together, 'cause everyone's been busy.

58
00:02:59,581 --> 00:02:59,904
Speaker 1: Indeed.

59
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:01,399
Speaker 1: But it's gonna be PAX real soon.

60
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:02,329
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

61
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:02,938
Speaker 0: Basically...

62
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,605
Speaker 1: I've been basically practicing.

63
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,234
Speaker 1: You know how most people, they're gonna do something.

64
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,358
Speaker 1: Like, they're gonna be in the Olympics.

65
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:08,820
Speaker 1: They train.

66
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,419
Speaker 0: I play Carcassonne four times a day.

67
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,930
Speaker 1: I was playing Tini twice a day.

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,000
Speaker 1: I'm playing Medici once or twice a day.

69
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:19,540
Speaker 1: I'm basically pumping board game iron to prepare for PAX.

70
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,610
Speaker 1: And you notice I was winning at Bonanza, right?

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,400
Speaker 1: I was doing, uh, I'm pretty much doing excellent all across the board.

72
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,660
Speaker 1: So, at PAX, I am keeping hard score on everything.

73
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,795
Speaker 1: I might even make a little app or something.

74
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:32,420
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

75
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:33,173
Speaker 0: Will you?

76
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:33,519
Speaker 0: Will you?

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,860
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use a notepad and keep track of all the scores.

78
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,328
Speaker 0: Will you?

79
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:36,799
Speaker 0: Will you?

80
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,387
Speaker 1: I will.

81
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:38,200
Speaker 1: I will you.

82
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,780
Speaker 1: I'll use a pencil and a paper and a camera to remember all the winnings and losings of PAX.

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,120
Speaker 0: Should we do it like Magfest, where we tweeted each victory?

84
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,640
Speaker 1: We're gonna do even harder core than Magfest.

85
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,118
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna win.

86
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:49,817
Speaker 0: Are you?

87
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,840
Speaker 1: I've pumped the most board game iron.

88
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,000
Speaker 0: Uh, it's not just board games.

89
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:55,739
Speaker 1: That's true.

90
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,619
Speaker 0: Granted, actually.

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 1: But I've also been playing Punch-Out.

92
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:03,860
Speaker 0: The trouble is, PAX is the one gaming con where I basically do no video gaming.

93
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:05,680
Speaker 1: I do a tiny bit.

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Speaker 0: I'll walk into, like, the old, the retro table, or the retro, uh, like, uh, consoles and play, like, a game of Punch-Out or something, like, for five minutes, but...

95
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,959
Speaker 1: I wanna, I wanna see if they set up the Bomberman High Ten.

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,440
Speaker 0: I mean, PAX, I love it, but the one thing it lacks is an actual arcade.

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,460
Speaker 0: Magfest is where I go to play video fucking games.

98
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,560
Speaker 1: It technically has one, but it's really small.

99
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,840
Speaker 0: I know, like, I made that montage video to pump people up for PAX, and it shows that arcade makes it look really badass.

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Speaker 0: The secret is that in the Magfest video, I showed maybe a quarter of the arcade.

101
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:35,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,676
Speaker 0: Because there was so much arcade.

103
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 0: That two-second shot from my PAX video is the entire PAX arcade.

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Speaker 1: You could fit one to, like, at least ten or twenty or thirty PAX arcades in the Magfest.

105
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,039
Speaker 0: Dude, the PAX arcade would fit in my apartment.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would.

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Speaker 0: In the Geeknight studio, you could fit a good chunk of the PAX arcade.

108
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:54,436
Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.

109
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,158
Speaker 0: Why don't I do that?

110
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,119
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to remove all your stuff.

111
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and replace it with... Air hockey.

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,180
Speaker 0: Oh my god, air hockey.

113
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:11,820
Speaker 0: I would, if there were a time when somehow air hockey were the Omega-Thon finale, I might just have to rush the stage, naked, challenging everyone.

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,216
Speaker 0: Do it.

115
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:13,299
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

116
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,299
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all you.

117
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,591
Speaker 1: But imagine if we had an air hockey table, all that time we spend, like, laying around going, "Yep, yep,".

118
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,920
Speaker 1: instead it'd be click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, until we were gods.

119
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:28,080
Speaker 0: I think I would finally master the two-finger, which I'm worried about breaking my goddamn wrist when I try to play that way.

120
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,980
Speaker 1: I would watch so many YouTube videos and study every single aspect and all the minor, you know, like, everything.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,964
Speaker 0: You know what we gotta find?

122
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:38,500
Speaker 0: Let's try to find a bar in the city that has, like, a real air hockey table.

123
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,778
Speaker 1: Alright, New York City air hockey.

124
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,039
Speaker 1: Photon air hockey.

125
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 0: None of that, uh, non-regulation shit.

126
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,478
Speaker 1: Air hockey New York, let's see.

127
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
Speaker 1: A point finally to the air hockey table.

128
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,365
Speaker 0: I mean, there's not one.

129
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:56,900
Speaker 0: There are multiple high-class bar lounges dedicated solely to table tennis.

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,363
Speaker 1: Well, hold on.

131
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 1: There's one for table tennis.

132
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:00,140
Speaker 0: No, there's more than one.

133
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,299
Speaker 1: There really is more than just spin?

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's more than spin.

135
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:05,351
Speaker 0: I'd go to spin because spin is the highest class one.

136
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,400
Speaker 0: They have servants who will walk around handing you balls.

137
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,880
Speaker 1: Alright, so there's Boulmore, which is bowling, right?

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,571
Speaker 0: Boulmore's overrated.

139
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,199
Speaker 0: There's better places.

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,580
Speaker 1: I know, but I'm just saying, it's a relatively fancy bowling bar.

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,159
Speaker 1: It's like spin.

142
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:18,602
Speaker 1: Right.

143
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:21,500
Speaker 1: There's the place in Brooklyn, which is the skeeball place.

144
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:22,299
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,557
Speaker 1: They have leagues, uh, this barcade, obviously, right?

146
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,084
Speaker 1: But there is not an air hockey bar.

147
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:34,940
Speaker 1: If we had enough money to open a bar and get a liquor license, we could open up the air hockey bar and we'd probably make just as much money as the skeeball bar does.

148
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:35,559
Speaker 0: Easily.

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,319
Speaker 1: Perhaps more.

150
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:38,439
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,860
Speaker 1: They just let people play free skeeball and they make all their money by selling alcohol and then they have leagues, which bring in a whole bunch of people.

152
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,024
Speaker 0: You know what I'll do, Scott?

153
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:49,600
Speaker 0: I'm going to see if Magfest, because, I mean, we got Katsu-Kan to get us that goddamn Rampart machine.

154
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to pester Magfest.

155
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,419
Speaker 0: I'll go to Magfest and be like, look, if you get a Rampart machine...

156
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,578
Speaker 1: And an air hockey table.

157
00:06:56,223 --> 00:06:57,359
Speaker 0: Or an air hockey table.

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,949
Speaker 1: And/or...

159
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:04,920
Speaker 0: Either one of those, I will promise them that magic will happen around that table, meaning I will play it the entire time.

160
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,745
Speaker 1: The thing is, it has to be a real table.

161
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,349
Speaker 1: It has to be balanced evenly.

162
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:12,460
Speaker 1: It has to work and it has to, you know, it can't be like damaged goods.

163
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,222
Speaker 0: I'm worried, though.

164
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:18,500
Speaker 0: The reason I almost don't want a Rampart machine to appear is that I've maintained my undefeatedness.

165
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,440
Speaker 0: It's like the only area I have left where I am undefucking defeated.

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker 0: If we actually have access to another Rampart machine, like that whole Katsu-Kan where we had it, I was so afraid I was going to lose, and one game I almost lost...

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,860
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't, you sort of avoided any game you might have lost.

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,280
Speaker 0: Well, no, the one game I almost lost, but Scott Johnson was pretty drunk and he basically threw the game in my favor by accident.

169
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,458
Speaker 0: But there was this really good guy who almost beat me.

170
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,413
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, if we played it, me and Scott Johnson would just walk up to it and be like, "Alright, listen, Rym's bragging about it being undefeated.

171
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,095
Speaker 1: Team up on Rym.

172
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:51,476
Speaker 1: Okay.

173
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,459
Speaker 1: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

174
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:52,579
Speaker 1: We

175
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:52,719
Speaker 1: win.".

176
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,383
Speaker 0: Uh, you see, you say that.

177
00:07:54,483 --> 00:08:00,779
Speaker 0: But when we play games, usually what happens is you say that and everyone kind of looks at you and I'm like, "Scott's just saying that to try to win

178
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,180
Speaker 0: himself.".

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,456
Speaker 1: Well, you know that I would definitely not... I would definitely apple it up.

180
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,180
Speaker 1: I would not orange.

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,759
Speaker 1: And if Scott Johnson oranged, which he may well do...

182
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:08,610
Speaker 0: I'd give it a 50/50 shot.

183
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,185
Speaker 1: I do also.

184
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,120
Speaker 1: I would go and just get, like, Pete or someone who would not call orange.

185
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,700
Speaker 0: You think Pete wouldn't orange on you?

186
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:16,860
Speaker 0: Pete would orange all over you.

187
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,100
Speaker 1: There has to be someone who would not orange.

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,860
Speaker 0: Pete would get his orange all over your business.

189
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,440
Speaker 1: Who would go all out and attack only Rym until he was dead to make sure that he was no longer undefeated at Rampart?

190
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,085
Speaker 0: It's one thing.

191
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,953
Speaker 0: Like, last night, right?

192
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:28,740
Speaker 0: We had the board game night.

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,244
Speaker 1: I'll just pay some stranger.

194
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,467
Speaker 1: I'll be like, "I'll give you five bucks.

195
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,832
Speaker 1: All you gotta do is only attack that guy.

196
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,019
Speaker 1: And then once he's dead, we'll play you and me fair and

197
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:36,380
Speaker 1: square.".

198
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,453
Speaker 0: I'll go to the guy and be like, "Ten

199
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:37,736
Speaker 0: bucks.".

200
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:38,299
Speaker 1: Twenty.

201
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:38,751
Speaker 1: Thirty.

202
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:39,320
Speaker 0: Fifty.

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,679
Speaker 0: Hundred.

204
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,678
Speaker 1: Two hundred.

205
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,040
Speaker 0: Scott, I have more money than you, and this is one area that means a lot to me.

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,964
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

207
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,860
Speaker 1: I would employ the secret technique, which I will not reveal.

208
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:50,352
Speaker 0: Punch me in the face.

209
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,020
Speaker 0: Hack the machine.

210
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,664
Speaker 1: Something along those lines.

211
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:56,300
Speaker 1: Like, put my hand over and spin your trackball around while you're trying to play some pieces.

212
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
Speaker 0: Scott's fastest Ramparting strategy.

213
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:00,340
Speaker 1: Hit your buttons a whole bunch to play some pieces.

214
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,603
Speaker 0: So, last night, right?

215
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:11,679
Speaker 0: You know, this is why... I'm always able to pull it off on you.

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,700
Speaker 1: People are dicks.

217
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,720
Speaker 0: Not enough people will listen to this episode from Tuesday to know that I said this, but look at last night, right?

218
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,120
Speaker 0: Our friend Kat was playing the Cameltron with all our other friends, and they all learned the game.

219
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,180
Speaker 0: And they're playing, you know, as derpily as first-time players can play.

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,647
Speaker 0: But Kat had to go outside, so she couldn't finish the game.

221
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:33,780
Speaker 0: So I took over for her, and I sit down, and I look, and she's actually in a really good position.

222
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,119
Speaker 0: So I immediately sit down and say, "Oh, alright, I gotta figure out...".

223
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,574
Speaker 0: "Oh my god, what was Kat

224
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:39,857
Speaker 0: doing?".

225
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,427
Speaker 0: "Oh my god, I can't win!

226
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,172
Speaker 0: Look at this!

227
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:42,976
Speaker 0: That camel doesn't have

228
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:43,359
Speaker 0: anything!".

229
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,160
Speaker 0: And I bitched about it for, like, ten turns.

230
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,760
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I was winning by, like, thirty points.

231
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,940
Speaker 0: And no one noticed because I was bitching so much.

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what happened to me?

233
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,420
Speaker 1: We started playing Brass, right?

234
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,960
Speaker 1: And I'd never played this game before, and I wasn't quite sure what the strategies were or anything.

235
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,751
Speaker 1: So, you know, I make a move.

236
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:01,760
Speaker 1: I'm just sort of fooling around.

237
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,685
Speaker 1: I'm like, "I'll build a coal mine,

238
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,047
Speaker 1: whatever.".

239
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,574
Speaker 1: I'm just, like, feeling it out.

240
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:05,660
Speaker 1: Just trying stuff.

241
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:05,860
Speaker 1: Whatevs.

242
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,307
Speaker 1: And then I realize, "Oh, you should,".

243
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:14,399
Speaker 1: and I say it out loud, "You should sell cotton immediately to up your income, otherwise you're stuck at

244
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:14,780
Speaker 1: zero.".

245
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:15,777
Speaker 0: I heard you say it.

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Speaker 1: Then Steve is like, "Oh," and he sells cotton immediately, thus making it harder for anyone else to do it.

247
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,111
Speaker 1: He gets a big boost in income before anyone else, and I'm like,

248
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:25,976
Speaker 1: "Ugh.".

249
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:28,559
Speaker 0: I was the one who thought of that.

250
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,638
Speaker 0: Because, Scott... And now I lose.

251
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:38,580
Speaker 0: The way to win the PAX who wins the most game games is to pull out games that no one's played before and just captain it up.

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Speaker 0: Craft captain, craft captain, craft captain.

253
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,998
Speaker 1: The thing is, I don't feel bad doing that.

254
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,140
Speaker 0: Bushels in the castle, biscuits in the baskets.

255
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,325
Speaker 1: I want to win legitimately.

256
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,988
Speaker 1: I want to play games.

257
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,460
Speaker 1: everyone knows how to play and out-power everyone.

258
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,979
Speaker 1: Because that is much more satisfying.

259
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 0: All right, games everyone knows how to play.

260
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,650
Speaker 0: Teeny, we're deadlocked.

261
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,780
Speaker 0: Puerto Rico, we're deadlocked.

262
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,699
Speaker 1: Like, if I win a Bonanza, that's a big fucking deal.

263
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,540
Speaker 0: Oh, Bonanza, Ro is going to kick the shit out of both of us.

264
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,700
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, that's the point.

265
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,237
Speaker 1: It's like a game everyone's good at.

266
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,671
Speaker 1: If you win a Dominion, it's like,

267
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:06,556
Speaker 1: "Boom!".

268
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:07,943
Speaker 1: Yes!

269
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,215
Speaker 0: If she wins a Dominion, it's like, "Saw that

270
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:11,517
Speaker 0: coming.".

271
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,740
Speaker 1: That's a different story.

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,441
Speaker 1: Right?

273
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,637
Speaker 1: It's like, you got to win at a game that people know, and then it's like, "Yeah, that

274
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:19,099
Speaker 1: counts.".

275
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:19,909
Speaker 1: What?

276
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,011
Speaker 1: What?

277
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,993
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's like, if you're Michael Jordan walking out playing against the high school kids, it doesn't mean anything.

278
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,555
Speaker 1: For it to be a real championship, it's got to be the best of the best.

279
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,660
Speaker 1: playing for serious.

280
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,530
Speaker 0: So, a little bit of news.

281
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,340
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, it's The Lounge.

282
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:39,480
Speaker 1: You and your lounge.

283
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,480
Speaker 0: Talk about whatever we want.

284
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,410
Speaker 1: You know what's in my lounge?

285
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,079
Speaker 1: Air hockey table.

286
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,700
Speaker 0: There's a pretty good article in The Atlantic, actually, and I want to call attention to it.

287
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,520
Speaker 0: I won't talk about it a lot, but it argues that The Daily Show, of all shows, people always say The Daily Show provides more news to people than it should.

288
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,199
Speaker 0: People watch it to get the news, even though it's a comedy show.

289
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:08,483
Speaker 0: It is interesting how vaguely obsessed Fox News is with The Daily Show, when The Daily Show is ostensibly comedy and Fox News is ostensibly news, but I digress.

290
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,972
Speaker 0: This isn't new news for any of you.

291
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,196
Speaker 0: It's old news.

292
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,280
Speaker 0: We're talking about news.

293
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,218
Speaker 1: Century old news.

294
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,810
Speaker 0: So, this article takes it from a different light.

295
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,740
Speaker 0: It talks about the whole UNESCO fiasco.

296
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,880
Speaker 0: Are you familiar with this, Scott?

297
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:20,439
Speaker 1: Not really.

298
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,608
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's the deal.

299
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,000
Speaker 0: This is old news.

300
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,580
Speaker 1: I might know it once you start talking about it.

301
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,880
Speaker 0: I followed it because I was really pissed off about it, but the media basically didn't care.

302
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,200
Speaker 0: UNESCO is the UN organization that basically tries to provide clean water to people in starving countries.

303
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:38,760
Speaker 1: They didn't seem to be doing a very good job in India.

304
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,879
Speaker 0: They focus on the places that are worse off than India.

305
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,860
Speaker 1: Okay, where they can't even get the bottled water.

306
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,046
Speaker 0: They also work in India.

307
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:51,300
Speaker 0: It's an organization to where no one can say anything bad about them.

308
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,580
Speaker 0: They are nothing but a force for good.

309
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:55,500
Speaker 1: All they do is give water to people who have no water.

310
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,579
Speaker 0: So, the members of UNESCO voted to allow Palestine in.

311
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,724
Speaker 1: Of course.

312
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,440
Speaker 1: Do they need water?

313
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:04,340
Speaker 1: Are they people?

314
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,659
Speaker 0: No, they provide aid to people who aren't even in.

315
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,419
Speaker 0: If you're in, it means you're helping with humanitarian efforts.

316
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,275
Speaker 0: You have a vote in UNESCO to where the money goes.

317
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:12,939
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

318
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:13,920
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

319
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:22,580
Speaker 0: So, they wanted to bring Palestine in, and there was a huge majority of votes in UNESCO to allow Palestine to join this purely humanitarian organization.

320
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 1: If they want to give money to help people, including themselves and others, and then have a small one vote in deciding who gets help, what's wrong with that?

321
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:36,100
Speaker 0: So, I believe 12 or 13 members of UNESCO voted against this.

322
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:36,840
Speaker 1: All the Jews?

323
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,580
Speaker 0: Pretty much Israel, the US, and all the Israel allied countries.

324
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,378
Speaker 1: Right, okay.

325
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,640
Speaker 0: So, the US pulled all funding from UNESCO.

326
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:48,958
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

327
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:49,953
Speaker 0: $70 million gone.

328
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,999
Speaker 1: Obama was just okay with that?

329
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,779
Speaker 0: Obama's actually really pissed about it.

330
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,297
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

331
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:55,674
Speaker 0: But he can't do anything.

332
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,160
Speaker 0: It's Congress.

333
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:07,355
Speaker 0: So, Congress passed a law a long time ago, '90s, saying any UN organization that recognizes Palestine as a state, we will not talk to them.

334
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,200
Speaker 0: We will not help them.

335
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,550
Speaker 0: We will deny all funding.

336
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:10,559
Speaker 0: We'll basically fuck them.

337
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,660
Speaker 1: Dude, the thing is, if you think about it, it's like a board game.

338
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:21,345
Speaker 1: What they should do, all these people in the UN should just be like, "Hey, let's fuck the US.

339
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:24,457
Speaker 1: Let's put Palestine in every organization forcing the US out of

340
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:24,959
Speaker 1: everything.".

341
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,180
Speaker 0: Scott, the Republicans and a lot of people in the US would love that, because basically all it means is the US stops funding humanitarian programs around the world.

342
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 1: Well, no, they could do it in all of the other things that the US wants to be on.

343
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaker 1: Like, the UN could vote Palestine onto the Security Council, which would be crazy.

344
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,951
Speaker 1: And then he's like, "Oh, US can't be on the Security Council

345
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:41,192
Speaker 1: anymore.".

346
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:43,320
Speaker 1: China makes all decisions.

347
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,840
Speaker 0: It's a little more complicated than that, but anyway.

348
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,600
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, crazy shit.

349
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:55,940
Speaker 0: So, the law is there, ostensibly, to force Israel and Palestine to negotiate directly and to not let anyone else influence that in any way.

350
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:56,518
Speaker 1: Of course.

351
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,060
Speaker 0: Now, the reasoning behind that, and this whole situation, is basically absurd.

352
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:02,876
Speaker 1: Duh.

353
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:11,900
Speaker 0: And this article talks about how all the news coverage of it basically toed, not the party line, but the kind of status quo line.

354
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:16,400
Speaker 0: The news all said, "Yep, well, they reported very matter of fact.

355
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,459
Speaker 0: This organization voted to let Palestine in.

356
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,829
Speaker 0: The US has a law that says that they can't fund it, so the US had to stop funding it at the

357
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,010
Speaker 0: end.".

358
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,059
Speaker 0: So, The Daily Show did a double feature on how bullshit this is.

359
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:29,820
Speaker 1: Of course.

360
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,320
Speaker 1: It's like, this is one of those things where it's like, "Oh, there's a rule that the US can't do

361
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,380
Speaker 1: it.".

362
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,300
Speaker 1: It's like, a rule is just something that's made up by people.

363
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,320
Speaker 1: You can just fucking change that shit.

364
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,600
Speaker 0: It's a rule made up by Congress that they can trivially change.

365
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:41,940
Speaker 1: Right.

366
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 1: You can just change that shit.

367
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,560
Speaker 1: It's not like the law of thermodynamics.

368
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,416
Speaker 1: You can't change.

369
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,879
Speaker 0: John Oliver on The Daily Show interviewed a senator and was like, "So, we can't do anything about

370
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:52,040
Speaker 0: this.".

371
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,220
Speaker 0: The guy's like, "Yeah, our hands are tied.

372
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:53,855
Speaker 0: We can't fund

373
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:53,999
Speaker 0: them.".

374
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,656
Speaker 0: And he was like, "Because of the law you

375
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:56,020
Speaker 0: passed.".

376
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:56,452
Speaker 0: He's like, "That's

377
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:56,720
Speaker 0: right.".

378
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,140
Speaker 0: He's like, "So, Congress doesn't have the power to change laws.

379
00:15:59,221 --> 00:15:59,607
Speaker 0: That's good to

380
00:15:59,628 --> 00:15:59,770
Speaker 0: know.".

381
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,172
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, "Well...".

382
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:03,939
Speaker 0: Basically, he punked him.

383
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,393
Speaker 1: Yes.

384
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:43,416
Speaker 0: So, this article, you know, not to get into the UNESCO thing, even though it's absurd, but the article points out that The Daily Show scarily is actually the only major news show in the world, or at least in America, even though it's not a news show, that when it covers the news, does not cover it from the status quo perspective, but covers it from actually a more objective standpoint than actual news does, because actual news and trying to be objective doesn't actually talk about the ramifications of anything and really just focuses on the facts and assumes a lot of these things that are status quo, when really the news story isn't that the U.S.

385
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,180
Speaker 0: had to follow this law.

386
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,480
Speaker 0: The news story is that this is a fucked up situation that's hurting people.

387
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,080
Speaker 1: Dope.

388
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: And it's actually a really great article.

389
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
Speaker 1: But that's why The Daily Show's comedy, right?

390
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,780
Speaker 1: Comedy is truth.

391
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,180
Speaker 1: Have you read friggin' Stranger in a Strange Land or not?

392
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Speaker 0: Or perhaps the court jester is the only one who can call the king fat.

393
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,800
Speaker 0: No kidding, right?

394
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,440
Speaker 0: Except we live in a place where there's free speech.

395
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:08,160
Speaker 0: The news could call the king fat and the king can't do shit about it.

396
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,119
Speaker 0: The news just doesn't.

397
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,680
Speaker 1: Why don't we just start a news where we say that we have the same smart perspective, but we don't present it as comedy?

398
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,440
Speaker 1: And we just put it on YouTube every day and we'll do one news story.

399
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,079
Speaker 0: Let's put that in the hopper with the other thousand things in the hopper.

400
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,215
Speaker 1: Why isn't someone listening to the show?

401
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:23,660
Speaker 1: just do it?

402
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,618
Speaker 1: We don't care how shitty it is.

403
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Speaker 1: It could be like elementary school CCTV news quality.

404
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:29,300
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

405
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,084
Speaker 0: We have Project

406
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:30,549
Speaker 0: S.T.,

407
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,477
Speaker 0: Project C.R.L.

408
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,120
Speaker 0: They're all Project S.T We have Project T.T.I.

409
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,080
Speaker 1: But anyone out there who's got a camera, just sit in front of it every day, pick a news story, and just be like, "Today, UNESCO, whatever, funding cut.

410
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:46,819
Speaker 1: Because of this rule, the government is stupid and they could just change it, but they refuse

411
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:46,940
Speaker 1: to.".

412
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,280
Speaker 1: In other words, all your congressmen are basically taking clean water out of the mouths of starving people.

413
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,709
Speaker 1: They're disgusting.

414
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:55,660
Speaker 1: End of story.

415
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,040
Speaker 0: So, this is an interesting article.

416
00:17:58,342 --> 00:17:59,599
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you read it.

417
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,275
Speaker 1: Great.

418
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:02,680
Speaker 0: So, you have anything?

419
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:04,067
Speaker 1: Oh, I did.

420
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,260
Speaker 1: I remember my news now.

421
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:08,060
Speaker 1: I didn't have a link open for it, so I couldn't remember what it was.

422
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,023
Speaker 1: So, check this out.

423
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,700
Speaker 1: There's this crazy dude, and he went to a casino.

424
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,298
Speaker 1: Now, usually, going to a casino is not a good idea, right?

425
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,000
Speaker 1: It's a way to lose all the money.

426
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,375
Speaker 1: Because casinos, the house always wins.

427
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:18,960
Speaker 1: Always.

428
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,420
Speaker 1: And, you know, there was card counting at one point, but today, card counting doesn't work.

429
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:23,763
Speaker 1: Right?

430
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:24,113
Speaker 1: Forget it.

431
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:27,420
Speaker 1: But this guy, he was, you know, a big time gambler.

432
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:33,820
Speaker 1: And apparently, I wasn't totally aware of this, but if you're a big time gambler, you don't just walk into a casino and play.

433
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,380
Speaker 1: You talk to the casino, and because you have so much money, they talk to you.

434
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,858
Speaker 1: So, like, if you and me walk into a casino, you know, you walk over to the craps table and it says, like,

435
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:42,898
Speaker 1: "5x.".

436
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,048
Speaker 1: You can't change that.

437
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,400
Speaker 1: That's just the rule for the game.

438
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,399
Speaker 1: And if you don't like the rule, you don't play there.

439
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:53,298
Speaker 1: If you're mad rich, you can walk in and be like, "Hey, can you set me up a craps table with these

440
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:53,680
Speaker 1: rules?".

441
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:57,620
Speaker 1: And they'll be like, "Well, actually, we don't like those rules because then the house doesn't always win.

442
00:18:57,982 --> 00:18:58,533
Speaker 1: How about these

443
00:18:58,574 --> 00:18:58,840
Speaker 1: rules?".

444
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,940
Speaker 1: And you can negotiate on the rules and, like, how much money you're going to spend and all this stuff.

445
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,480
Speaker 1: So this guy went in, and he negotiated with these casinos.

446
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:08,660
Speaker 1: And, by the way, the casinos are the desperate.

447
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,920
Speaker 1: Like, actually, Foxwoods is even in big trouble.

448
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,700
Speaker 1: Because, you know, there's basically more casinos, the love's getting spread around, there's online poker and stuff, right?

449
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,900
Speaker 1: So, casinos are not doing well lately.

450
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,420
Speaker 1: So they're basically more desperate than ever to get people to come in, especially the high rollers.

451
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,200
Speaker 1: Because, you know, a whole bunch of low rollers, you know, a bus full of people coming from the city isn't going to help.

452
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,020
Speaker 0: Well, it's old ladies nickel at a time.

453
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,942
Speaker 1: Right.

454
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:38,420
Speaker 1: And if you want, you know, but one high roller, if he comes in and loses all his monies, your casino's good for, like, a whole month or two.

455
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,576
Speaker 1: So it's like, "Yeah, we need

456
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:39,738
Speaker 1: that.".

457
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,680
Speaker 1: So they're desperate to get this guy in the door.

458
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,280
Speaker 1: So, you know, the guy's figuring out which casino he wants to go to.

459
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,440
Speaker 1: So they're sort of competing as who's going to set him more favorable rules to get him in the door.

460
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:52,200
Speaker 1: They also actually are not technologically stupid.

461
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,820
Speaker 1: They actually have this computerized system that works and is good, where they can type in the rules.

462
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:06,439
Speaker 1: Like, "Guy wants to play blackjack with six decks and wants to allow double splitting and wants to allow this and that rules for this minimum bet on this and

463
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,620
Speaker 1: this.".

464
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,655
Speaker 1: And then it'll pretty much tell the casino owner, you know, once he types in those rules, "Thumbs up!

465
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:12,056
Speaker 1: We'll

466
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:12,377
Speaker 1: win!"

467
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:12,899
Speaker 1: or "Thumbs

468
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:13,180
Speaker 1: down!"

469
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,436
Speaker 1: "No, this is a bad idea if we let him play this

470
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:15,739
Speaker 1: game."

471
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:15,920
Speaker 1: Right?

472
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:22,040
Speaker 1: So apparently, whoever was at this casino totally fucked up and didn't use the software properly or who knows what.

473
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,600
Speaker 1: And they basically let this guy play at what was almost, like, 50/50 odds on blackjack.

474
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,148
Speaker 1: So he walked in with, like, "He's mad

475
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:31,469
Speaker 1: rich.".

476
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,517
Speaker 1: So he was just like, "Million

477
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:33,979
Speaker 1: dollars."

478
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,820
Speaker 1: And he got mad lucky and he got, like, four eights and he split it four ways.

479
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:47,760
Speaker 1: And there was also some weird rule about, like, you know, usually in blackjack it's, like, the house, like, has to hit in a certain situation and has to stop in a certain situation.

480
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,109
Speaker 1: And it's usually the same rules all the time.

481
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,460
Speaker 1: Those rules were even different in this game.

482
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,479
Speaker 1: So it was basically a situation where, like, he had four hands and the house went over and it was like, "Oh, one hand with millions of

483
00:20:59,499 --> 00:20:59,880
Speaker 1: dollars.".

484
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,189
Speaker 1: "Ha ha ha ha

485
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,352
Speaker 1: ha.".

486
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,919
Speaker 1: And this guy just-- It's a pretty good story.

487
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,468
Speaker 1: The dude friggin' rolled the casino without cheating.

488
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:08,430
Speaker 1: Right?

489
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,292
Speaker 1: Without cheating.

490
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:10,535
Speaker 1: He didn't count the cards.

491
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,820
Speaker 1: He just played blackjack smartly and normally.

492
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,360
Speaker 1: And had the rules of the game changed, but the casino agreed to it.

493
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,308
Speaker 1: So, uh, this is just another one.

494
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:23,160
Speaker 1: I wanted to bring this up, though, because it's not, you know, it's an example of smart nerdiness.

495
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,014
Speaker 1: A guy knowing the rules, doing the math, using his smart brain to get ahead.

496
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:27,456
Speaker 1: Right?

497
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,580
Speaker 1: Which is laudable.

498
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:36,759
Speaker 1: But it's also another example of, if you want to get more rich, and you already are rich, it's real easy.

499
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,200
Speaker 1: Right?

500
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,714
Speaker 1: But if you're poor, you can't get more rich as easily as someone who's already rich.

501
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:44,980
Speaker 1: Even at the casino.

502
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

503
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,410
Speaker 0: So, I was born in 1982.

504
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:55,605
Speaker 0: Me too.

505
00:21:55,891 --> 00:21:58,271
Speaker 0: And this video is from 1982.

506
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:58,590
Speaker 1: Me too.

507
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:03,570
Speaker 0: It is a video, volume one, of how to beat home video games.

508
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,867
Speaker 1: I wonder how much that shit cost on VHS, like 30 bucks per-.

509
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:13,550
Speaker 1: I have no idea, but this is- And it probably cost like 30 bucks for one VHS tape, and it probably was like 50 dollars for the Atari games.

510
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:20,589
Speaker 1: This is how to beat- You're paying 30 bucks to learn how to beat- How to beat Atari Circus, and there's something about- The one with the seesaw?

511
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:21,186
Speaker 1: Yes.

512
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know how to beat it.

513
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:24,710
Speaker 1: Always make sure the seesaw's under the falling dude.

514
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:32,730
Speaker 0: He has some good strategies here, but the thing is, it's interesting to watch because it's a blast from the past, and it reminds me that I didn't own Circus Atari.

515
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,530
Speaker 1: But I had this catalog- I borrowed it for a short time.

516
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,970
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, that listed like every Atari game you could buy and like a review of it, and I was obsessed with all the games I didn't have.

517
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,548
Speaker 1: Of course.

518
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,590
Speaker 0: Circus Atari's actually not that good of a game.

519
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:48,250
Speaker 1: It's not the worst though.

520
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:49,230
Speaker 0: It's not the best.

521
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,930
Speaker 1: There are a lot worse Atari games, but it is not exactly one of the Atari greats like Pitfall and such.

522
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, but these strategies- These videos are pretty interesting to watch, and they really take you back to, you know, the early '80s were more like the late '70s than you might realize.

523
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:10,330
Speaker 1: I have a VHS tape because when the TurboGrafx-16 was coming out, they had a big promotional thing at the mall, at the shopping mall next to us.

524
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,089
Speaker 1: And I went over there and played a bunch of demo stations before like you could even buy one.

525
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:14,453
Speaker 0: Ah.

526
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:21,330
Speaker 1: And I got a VHS tape that is basically an advertisement for TurboGrafx-16, and I must have watched it like two or three times.

527
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,700
Speaker 0: I have the VHS tape.

528
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:23,630
Speaker 0: It's not that old.

529
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,970
Speaker 1: I should dig it up and try to get it onto YouTube if it's not on there already.

530
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,770
Speaker 0: Dragon Strike, that D&D-ish game that was released with the VHS tape that came with it.

531
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,409
Speaker 1: Never played it, but I knew about it.

532
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had it.

533
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:35,907
Speaker 0: I had the VHS tape.

534
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,337
Speaker 0: Whoa.

535
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,069
Speaker 0: Never played it though because no one would play it with me.

536
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,514
Speaker 1: I was a bigger fan of the one.

537
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:45,730
Speaker 1: I can't seem to find it anywhere, but it came- remember the second- No.

538
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:46,870
Speaker 0: Or Haunted Mansion.

539
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,074
Speaker 1: No.

540
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:47,438
Speaker 1: No?

541
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,807
Speaker 1: I'm talking about this D&D game where it was basically- you had no GM because there was a big box full of cards.

542
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,010
Speaker 1: that was the GM, right?

543
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,790
Speaker 1: And like the box was basically- remember when they reprinted the second edition stuff, it was in a different graphical style where it was black, right?

544
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,482
Speaker 1: With the, you know, the picture in the middle?

545
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:05,490
Speaker 1: You know what I'm talking about?

546
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:06,789
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

547
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,309
Speaker 1: And basically this box was in that style and had a big red dragon on it.

548
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:18,010
Speaker 1: And basically you had a fold-out dungeon and you would move your guys around the dungeon sort of like HeroQuest, but it was TSR D&D brand.

549
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:27,830
Speaker 1: And it had a, you know, there was this big box full of cards and basically you would move around and then instead of, you know, being a GM or anything, you just went to the box and it told you what was in the dungeon and stuff.

550
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,856
Speaker 0: Oh, so I found your video.

551
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:31,410
Speaker 0: There were multiple versions of this apparently.

552
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:33,169
Speaker 1: That's the one.

553
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:33,814
Speaker 0: I got it.

554
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:34,459
Speaker 0: I'll link to it.

555
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:35,950
Speaker 0: Bonus thing of the day.

556
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:36,765
Speaker 1: Alright.

557
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,981
Speaker 1: So anyway, my actual thing of the day- Yup.

558
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:46,490
Speaker 1: Is, uh, everyone's probably seen this already because it was all over the internets and I'm pretty sure there's a whole, probably a whole bunch of things like this, so it's not unique at all.

559
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,037
Speaker 1: Um, and it's, you know, but whatever.

560
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,504
Speaker 1: It's got four million views.

561
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:51,710
Speaker 1: It could use a few more views.

562
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,510
Speaker 1: It's something called the Wrecking Crew Orchestra.

563
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,938
Speaker 1: And this is actually pretty recent from February 8th, 2012.

564
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:58,750
Speaker 1: So even if these guys have been around a while, this is a recent performance.

565
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:06,830
Speaker 1: What they do is they're basically a dance troupe, but they perform in the dark and they wear suits covered with lights and, you know, like strip lights and LED lights.

566
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,370
Speaker 0: Now, think about the ramifications of what you can do with that.

567
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,410
Speaker 1: And yeah, and the lights are basically pre-programmed or controlled by someone from a central location or something.

568
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:21,090
Speaker 1: So they dance and they appear and disappear and shift and they do all sorts of cool, you know, performance tricks going on here.

569
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,434
Speaker 1: Uh, and it is fun to watch.

570
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:29,710
Speaker 1: I mean, it wouldn't probably be fun to watch, like, you know, a whole bunch of these, but watching one if you haven't seen one is really awesome.

571
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,680
Speaker 1: And if you've seen it already, alright.

572
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:34,970
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen it already, must see.

573
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:40,543
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, uh, two weeks to PAX.

574
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,690
Speaker 0: It's a-coming.

575
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,610
Speaker 0: We're doing a whole bunch of panels and a bunch of our friends are doing a whole bunch of panels and workshops.

576
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,289
Speaker 1: Playing a whole bunch of games.

577
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,490
Speaker 0: We're gonna be at PAX in force.

578
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,483
Speaker 1: Pretty much, I gotta apologize, PAX Fever is in full effect as it is twice a year.

579
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:00,050
Speaker 1: Maybe it'll become three times a year, we have no idea.

580
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:00,852
Speaker 0: Well, there's a cure.

581
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:05,963
Speaker 0: If you are so hyped about PAX that you can't get over it, I'll link to a video.

582
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,850
Speaker 0: I made a montage of how awesome PAX was last year.

583
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,921
Speaker 0: And if you watch it, it might excite you so much.

584
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,970
Speaker 0: you'll die and then you won't have to worry about it anymore.

585
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:16,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not gonna help.

586
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,220
Speaker 0: That's like, hmm, cure for AIDS?

587
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,350
Speaker 1: Unprotected sex with someone with AIDS?

588
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,029
Speaker 0: Last night during the board game night.

589
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,586
Speaker 1: Cure for flu?

590
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:29,070
Speaker 0: We were talking about ponies and I was like, oh, there was a bunch of ponies at PAX.

591
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,990
Speaker 1: Going outside in the cold naked, that's a cure for flu.

592
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,531
Speaker 0: They were like, what?

593
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:37,164
Speaker 0: And I'm like, yeah, so I pull up that montage video and I skip to where all the pony stuff was and then I'm like, oh shit, PAX.

594
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,090
Speaker 0: Oh shit, PAX.

595
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:44,290
Speaker 0: Uh, you wanna make predictions now as to what the Omegathon's gonna be or save it for Tuesday?

596
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:50,610
Speaker 1: I told you, I'm sticking with, cause they already said- It's East, so it's gonna be teams, most likely.

597
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,310
Speaker 1: It's East, so it's co-op, guaranteed.

598
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,550
Speaker 1: And, you know, they had to have something built for this.

599
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:56,790
Speaker 0: I'm going with Double Dare.

600
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:58,970
Speaker 1: It can't be Double Dare.

601
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,473
Speaker 1: Why not?

602
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,509
Speaker 0: It could be the Double Dare challenge at the end.

603
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:10,830
Speaker 1: I am thinking- No, I'm still going with my Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robot until, you know, it is no more.

604
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,890
Speaker 0: Scott, you know what would be the ultimate, I realize.

605
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,850
Speaker 0: As much as I want, you know, the Double Dare, the Aggro Craig- Crossfire.

606
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:17,450
Speaker 0: Crossfire.

607
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:18,310
Speaker 0: Crossfire.

608
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,626
Speaker 0: Crossfire.

609
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:21,409
Speaker 1: But that's not co-op either.

610
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,950
Speaker 1: But they could easily make any of these things co-op.

611
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,790
Speaker 0: Would be, if it was straight up American Gladiator.

612
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:32,410
Speaker 1: They did make an Aggro Craig, it's Guts.

613
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,848
Speaker 1: They have all, full Guts, built into the thing.

614
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,750
Speaker 0: The thing is, depending on the nerds who get to the finale- How can they possibly keep it secret?

615
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:39,729
Speaker 0: It might be Guts.

616
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:46,050
Speaker 0: And the book is The Hunger Games, because it seems to be spreading faster than Twilight on Cancer.

617
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,300
Speaker 0: And it's pretty good actually.

618
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:49,546
Speaker 0: Not great, but pretty good.

619
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:50,089
Speaker 0: I liked it.

620
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,370
Speaker 0: So we'll do a show on it whenever.

621
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,650
Speaker 1: Yet, I haven't read it yet, but I have a copy.

622
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:02,690
Speaker 1: But people say that it's basically Battle Royale, the ripoff, plus some Arnold Schwarzenegger running man mix in there.

623
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,850
Speaker 0: And some 1984.

624
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's what people say about it, so maybe that sounds good to you.

625
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,868
Speaker 1: I don't know, but that's what people say.

626
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,990
Speaker 0: It exceeded expectations by a surprising amount.

627
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:18,150
Speaker 1: It'll probably actually be a "soon" book club, because once I actually start reading it, it shouldn't take very long at all.

628
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,810
Speaker 0: Dude, it's like a two and a half hour read.

629
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,320
Speaker 1: Right, so as soon as I actually get around to it, it'll be like

630
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,641
Speaker 1: "bam!"

631
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,790
Speaker 1: and we'll do this book club right away and get a new one going.

632
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,550
Speaker 1: It'll be much less weight than the previous book club, which took a while.

633
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,776
Speaker 0: Kineticon is coming up.

634
00:28:28,937 --> 00:28:30,850
Speaker 0: We run the panels and workshops department.

635
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:35,530
Speaker 0: If you submit a panel, I will link to the farm, and you're a Geek Nights listener.

636
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,310
Speaker 0: There's a good chance you'll get one, because you guys give us some of the best panels we get, normally.

637
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,167
Speaker 0: Nepotism!

638
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:44,810
Speaker 0: But yeah, submit your panels.

639
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,310
Speaker 1: It's not nepotism, they're not in our family.

640
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:48,841
Speaker 0: They're an extended family.

641
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:50,090
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights family.

642
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:50,550
Speaker 1: Sure.

643
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:51,818
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,448
Speaker 0: We got an internet, we got a YouTube channel, got a website, got a forum, all that stuff.

645
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:00,030
Speaker 0: It's all there.

646
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:06,050
Speaker 0: So it might be kind of a cop-out, but I figured I'd just talk about my experiences in India, because I'd never been to India before.

647
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,703
Speaker 1: Alright, do you want to get any sort of prejudice, racist, out of our system now?

648
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,608
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, a dalsib and great

649
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:12,969
Speaker 1: tiger.".

650
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,297
Speaker 1: Oh, so basically, when I was there- Hello, I am a poo.

651
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,210
Speaker 1: Thank you, come again.

652
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,390
Speaker 0: Everybody breathes fire.

653
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,489
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, everyone from India.

654
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,730
Speaker 0: In fact, if you got food from a street vendor, he breathed fire on it before he gave it to you.

655
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,395
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, everyone from India.

656
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:27,450
Speaker 1: I'm sure that when you can do a show about your trip to America, make fun of us, please, because I want to hear that.

657
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:35,349
Speaker 0: Actually, the best joke someone made, and it was actually an Indian guy that I was hanging out with while I was there, was like, "Where are all the Native

658
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:35,890
Speaker 0: Americans?".

659
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard there are many of them here.

660
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,262
Speaker 0: He was a funny guy.

661
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:41,330
Speaker 0: He was one of my cab drivers.

662
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,289
Speaker 1: He tried to do too much with it.

663
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:51,868
Speaker 0: He was the same one who was really proud of the slum, kind of how in America, if you're showing something around New York, you'll be like, "Yeah, that's a New York bum.

664
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:52,469
Speaker 0: Check him

665
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:52,590
Speaker 0: out.".

666
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,363
Speaker 0: Or, "See how there's no one in that subway car?

667
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:54,867
Speaker 0: Yeah.".

668
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,150
Speaker 0: It smells like pee.

669
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,357
Speaker 0: This guy was like, "That's our slum.

670
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,787
Speaker 0: There's at least two million people in

671
00:29:58,827 --> 00:29:58,968
Speaker 0: there.".

672
00:29:59,853 --> 00:29:59,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

673
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,731
Speaker 0: "It's pretty

674
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:00,993
Speaker 0: big.".

675
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,239
Speaker 0: And he's like, "You want to take a

676
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:02,480
Speaker 0: picture?".

677
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:03,746
Speaker 0: He was really just like, "Check it

678
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:03,887
Speaker 0: out.".

679
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:22,910
Speaker 0: But anyway, I was there on business, so I actually didn't get to do ... I had evenings and a couple of times to myself where I could wander around, but I was actually mostly beholden to a whole bunch of corporate-style meetings, and I had to go to this conference there, like a convention, and deal with booths and stuff.

680
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,270
Speaker 0: But it was the first time I traveled extensively on corporate money as opposed to my own money, and that's a very interesting experience.

681
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,136
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of we go to a convention, and they're like, "$10 hot

682
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:33,337
Speaker 1: dog.".

683
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:33,818
Speaker 1: You're like, "Are you

684
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,259
Speaker 1: crazy?".

685
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,341
Speaker 1: Now it's like, "$10 hot dog.

686
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:35,923
Speaker 1: Who gives a shit?

687
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:36,584
Speaker 1: It's not my money.

688
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,789
Speaker 1: I want a hot dog, and I don't want to walk anywhere.

689
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:38,930
Speaker 1: Give

690
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,990
Speaker 1: me.".

691
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:47,630
Speaker 0: Even better, what's interesting is that when you're in this position, you're kind of obligated to take other businessmen out to eat and stuff like that.

692
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,730
Speaker 0: So basically, it's expected that you're going to spend a ton of money on room service and cocktails and all that kind of crazy stuff.

693
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,984
Speaker 0: But I'll try to skip the business-y stuff, but I flew to Mumbai.

694
00:30:58,486 --> 00:30:59,390
Speaker 0: You may know it as Bombay.

695
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:02,240
Speaker 0: Now what's interesting is it's Mumbai.

696
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,525
Speaker 0: That's the official name of the city.

697
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:05,050
Speaker 0: That's kind of what you're expected to say.

698
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,610
Speaker 1: So it's written on all the things?

699
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,030
Speaker 0: And I'd gotten the impression that everyone called it Mumbai.

700
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:10,970
Speaker 1: No, they say Bombay.

701
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:16,563
Speaker 0: So when I got there, the only people who said Mumbai were foreigners and rich people.

702
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:19,370
Speaker 0: And everyone else that I met called it Bombay.

703
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:19,851
Speaker 1: Yep.

704
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:20,870
Speaker 1: I've heard that already.

705
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:26,170
Speaker 0: But what's really funny is we got to meet some executives from the Bombay Stock Exchange, the BSE.

706
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,110
Speaker 0: They call it the BSE now because they don't want to change the name to the Mumbai Stock Exchange or change the acronym or anything.

707
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,610
Speaker 0: Because imagine how much of a pain in the ass it would be if you have all these network things named something publicly and you have to rename everything.

708
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,710
Speaker 0: Imagine if you had to rename all the variables and class names in your code because of some BS.

709
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,167
Speaker 0: But the cool thing was...

710
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,908
Speaker 1: It's called SED.

711
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that may or may not work well depending on...

712
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:51,409
Speaker 1: You got to do it right.

713
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:01,110
Speaker 0: Well, one of the worst things in the world is when you're trying to fix some code and you find out that the name of a class was actually spelled wrong in the first place.

714
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:03,369
Speaker 0: That's like the worst.

715
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,669
Speaker 0: But I digress.

716
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:16,030
Speaker 0: I got to meet a bunch of people who run the Bombay Stock Exchange and we went up to their tower and I realized at the top that it was really the only tall building in that area of Bombay.

717
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,970
Speaker 0: And the guy introduces us and we realized we can see the entire city out these windows.

718
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,095
Speaker 0: And I look and I see all this military stuff.

719
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:25,940
Speaker 0: He's like, "That's the entire Indian Navy.

720
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:28,086
Speaker 0: Don't take any pictures.

721
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:28,949
Speaker 0: We'll get in a lot of

722
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:29,250
Speaker 0: trouble.".

723
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:36,229
Speaker 0: And apparently after the Mumbai terrorist attacks, India's got some problems like many places in the world do.

724
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,590
Speaker 0: So you're not allowed to have tall buildings in that area because you can basically spy on the military.

725
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:46,330
Speaker 0: And the buildings are targets for attacks, which is actually a concern there.

726
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,533
Speaker 1: That reminds me of this dude.

727
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:52,449
Speaker 1: There was a photo an astronaut posted and it was like, "What was the craziest thing you saw from

728
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:52,790
Speaker 1: space?".

729
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,373
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Look at

730
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:53,594
Speaker 1: this.".

731
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:56,790
Speaker 1: And there was this line on the Earth and it was this glowing line.

732
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,382
Speaker 1: And he's like, "That's the India-Pakistan border.

733
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:00,447
Speaker 1: It's a glowing

734
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:00,849
Speaker 1: line.".

735
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,490
Speaker 1: You can see it more easily than you can see the Great Wall of China.

736
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,664
Speaker 0: Actually, the Great Wall of China is one of the hardest things to see.

737
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:08,830
Speaker 0: It's not visible from space.

738
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,579
Speaker 1: Right, but you could clearly see this thing.

739
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,050
Speaker 1: It looked like a string of light bulbs that were just ridiculously long.

740
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,576
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Whoa.

741
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,806
Speaker 1: That's for serious,

742
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:17,987
Speaker 1: yo.".

743
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,830
Speaker 1: So by law, you can't really see the other contentious borders around the world, but you can't really see them from space.

744
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,790
Speaker 0: Well, you can see the implicit North Korea-South Korea border.

745
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,853
Speaker 1: Well, that's different.

746
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,770
Speaker 1: You can just see it at night because it's dark and then South Korea actually has lights.

747
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:39,490
Speaker 0: So they can't have legally tall buildings there, but the government was kind of smart about it.

748
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,930
Speaker 0: They're like, "Yeah, we're not going to make you tear down the only already existing tall building.

749
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,981
Speaker 0: Don't let people take pictures of the Navy.

750
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:47,167
Speaker 0: You'll get in

751
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:47,569
Speaker 0: trouble.".

752
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:51,087
Speaker 0: But it was a really great view and I wish I could have taken a picture.

753
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:51,589
Speaker 0: It was really...

754
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,850
Speaker 1: You should have just taken one illicitly and then posted it anonymously on like, Imgur or something.

755
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to deal with that, especially because I may or may not be trying to do business with the Bombay Stock Exchange.

756
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,499
Speaker 1: No, you just don't post it until the business is done.

757
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,247
Speaker 1: You obviously wouldn't go home and post it immediately.

758
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:05,910
Speaker 1: Then they know it was you.

759
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,350
Speaker 1: You do it like months later when it could have been anyone who visited in any of those months or even like a year later.

760
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,273
Speaker 0: Nah, because think about it.

761
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:14,081
Speaker 0: So I take a picture of the Indian Navy, right?

762
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,190
Speaker 0: Say the picture gets out and there's some bullshit.

763
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:21,146
Speaker 0: Some Navy intelligence guy over there is going to look at the picture and be like, "All right, these are the ships that were in

764
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:21,487
Speaker 0: part.".

765
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,949
Speaker 1: Didn't he say it was the whole Navy?

766
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,094
Speaker 0: Well, no, that's the Navy part.

767
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:29,125
Speaker 0: I'm sure a ship or two were out doing stuff.

768
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:30,690
Speaker 0: They move them around in the part.

769
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,289
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

770
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,335
Speaker 0: But it was a really impressive view.

771
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,647
Speaker 0: But the funny thing, so I flew Air India and it wasn't a coach.

772
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:38,730
Speaker 0: It was actual Air India.

773
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,668
Speaker 1: Well, Air India isn't exactly Lufthansa.

774
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,730
Speaker 0: So the domestic flights within India were way more comfortable than JetBlue, like way nice.

775
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,455
Speaker 0: That's nice.

776
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:48,870
Speaker 1: But were you first class?

777
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,627
Speaker 0: No, God no.

778
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,770
Speaker 0: God no, our company's doing well about that one.

779
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,498
Speaker 1: But the thing about JetBlue is it's not supposed to be the crazy comfortable.

780
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,869
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be everything's the same, it's simple, it's cheap, it works.

781
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,970
Speaker 0: The on Air India domestic flight was way comfortable.

782
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,189
Speaker 1: It was way more monies too.

783
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,030
Speaker 0: No, it was actually way cheap.

784
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,342
Speaker 0: The international flight was literally the most uncomfortable chair.

785
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:14,110
Speaker 0: that was actually a chair I've ever sat on in my entire life.

786
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,050
Speaker 1: Was it just like a wooden stick that shoved up your butt?

787
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,070
Speaker 0: There was this bar like shoving its way into my ass through this thin ass cushion.

788
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,099
Speaker 1: Was it a broken chair?

789
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,370
Speaker 1: Were all the chairs the same?

790
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,349
Speaker 0: I think they were all the same because the guy next to me was squirming the whole time.

791
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:27,902
Speaker 0: And then I look at him and I'm like, "Is there a

792
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:28,324
Speaker 0: bar?".

793
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,630
Speaker 0: He's like right in my butt.

794
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,762
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Okay, it's not just

795
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:31,943
Speaker 0: me.".

796
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:33,290
Speaker 1: Okay.

797
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,240
Speaker 0: But I engineered a solution.

798
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,049
Speaker 1: I asked for like- A pillow and you put it under your ass?

799
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,273
Speaker 0: They didn't have any extra pillows.

800
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:44,650
Speaker 0: So I asked for like eight blankets and I manufactured a device of blankets that worked okay.

801
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,661
Speaker 1: You know what the answer is?

802
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:48,289
Speaker 1: If you were to go to India- First class.

803
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:49,495
Speaker 1: Or a seat cushion.

804
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,750
Speaker 1: Just bring a seat cushion like the kind they use at football stadiums.

805
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I try to travel really light and not carry stuff on me.

806
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,810
Speaker 1: Or you can get the neck pillow and just put it under your butt instead.

807
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:05,090
Speaker 0: The other important thing about the flight is that I now have ample evidence to say that I do not in fact suffer from jet lag and/or jet lag is a myth.

808
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

809
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,335
Speaker 0: I'm very happy about that.

810
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,430
Speaker 0: I got there and everyone who flew with me like all the other people were wicked jet lagged.

811
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:17,330
Speaker 0: And literally I fly into India, it's evening, I get some dinner, I wander around, I go to bed, I wake up the next morning feeling great.

812
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:17,679
Speaker 0: Yeah.

813
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,227
Speaker 0: And everyone else like couldn't eat and bleh and bleh and bleh and bleh and I was fine.

814
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:22,770
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

815
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,790
Speaker 0: I think it's psychological.

816
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,569
Speaker 0: No, it actually is a real thing.

817
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,163
Speaker 1: I don't know.

818
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,109
Speaker 0: But some people are apparently immune to it.

819
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:28,670
Speaker 0: Okay.

820
00:36:29,176 --> 00:36:30,658
Speaker 1: And- I've never had much of a problem with it.

821
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:32,350
Speaker 1: It's not a noticeable one.

822
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,798
Speaker 0: When was the last time you flew?

823
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,290
Speaker 0: more than five time zones?

824
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,110
Speaker 1: More than five times?

825
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:37,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when was that?

827
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:41,190
Speaker 1: Uh, 2000.

828
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,019
Speaker 0: Okay, that was 12 years ago.

829
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

830
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:44,650
Speaker 0: Anyway.

831
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:54,936
Speaker 0: But the only problem that I have when I fly, because the same thing happened to Japan, is every day around 9, 30, 10 o'clock at night, I'm so tired.

832
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:59,928
Speaker 0: The second night I was there, I got out of this conference, go to my room and I'm like, "I'm going to check some

833
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:00,269
Speaker 0: internet.".

834
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:09,330
Speaker 0: And I literally opened my laptop and I remember starting to type my password in and then I woke up the next morning in the chair.

835
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,530
Speaker 0: The laptop was still sitting on my lap and I hadn't finished typing my password.

836
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,249
Speaker 1: Are you sure that wasn't jet lag?

837
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,190
Speaker 0: Scott, it was like 10 o'clock at night.

838
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,310
Speaker 0: So if that was jet lag, then jet lag's fine because it meant I went to bed at a reasonable goddamn hour.

839
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,369
Speaker 0: And I woke up at like 7 o'clock, which was when I wanted to wake up.

840
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,650
Speaker 0: Jet lag means you're not hungry and you can't get up in the morning and you're way tired all day.

841
00:37:32,811 --> 00:37:33,889
Speaker 1: I definitely don't have that problem.

842
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,330
Speaker 0: So, you know, I get to Mumbai and I get a driver and he takes me to the fancy hotel.

843
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:49,574
Speaker 0: And the fancy hotel, Mumbai is weird because it's like ultra luxury, like this, like, "Shall I warm so's crack

844
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:49,875
Speaker 0: pipe?"

845
00:37:50,055 --> 00:37:54,910
Speaker 0: fails to describe the opulent care that was taken of me when I showed up at this hotel.

846
00:37:56,111 --> 00:38:01,629
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, outside of the hotel were some straight up shantytown, sea of gods slums.

847
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,850
Speaker 1: It's basically Monaco, only bigger.

848
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, and more distributed.

849
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,730
Speaker 0: Like the slums are integrated and they're not all slums.

850
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,070
Speaker 0: Some of them are just very, very dense populated like residential areas.

851
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:21,290
Speaker 0: Some of them are shantytowns, but then like right next to it is like ultra luxury like hotel or ultra luxury condos.

852
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:28,510
Speaker 1: So, you know, in Monaco it's pretty much rich stuff in the middle, rich stuff in the water, and then the poor stuff is like on the outskirts.

853
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mumbai is so dense.

854
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:35,770
Speaker 1: This is all intermingled, which is kind of great because in the US, right, we got rich and poor, but they're all super separated.

855
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,810
Speaker 1: Rich people live in the woods on long roads with gates.

856
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:48,710
Speaker 0: And in New York, like in New York City, there's ultra rich and there's the American equivalent of very poor, but you don't get to the level of the shantytowns in our cities.

857
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,109
Speaker 0: Our equivalent of that is like Appalachia.

858
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,310
Speaker 1: Or you live in like one of the, you know, projects, you know, public housing, whatever.

859
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,648
Speaker 0: So, you know, I give the hotel...

860
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,249
Speaker 1: It's not a shantytown.

861
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:06,570
Speaker 0: Of course, every building that I went into for this entire trip had even like malls and everything had metal detectors and security at every door and like crazy security everywhere.

862
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,857
Speaker 0: But the security was actually effective.

863
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:12,290
Speaker 0: They just made you walk through a metal detector and they were smart about it.

864
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:18,810
Speaker 0: Like every time I walked through my cell phone and my wallet would beep and the guy would like grab it outside my pocket.

865
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:24,089
Speaker 0: And he had this look on his face like this is a white guy and it's obviously a cell phone.

866
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:27,270
Speaker 0: He didn't like freak out about the bulge in my pocket.

867
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,548
Speaker 0: It clearly was not a gun.

868
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,070
Speaker 0: But the security was pretty reasonable.

869
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,010
Speaker 0: Like it amazes me how the countries that have actual terrorism have reasonable security.

870
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,250
Speaker 1: We had actual terrorism.

871
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:41,069
Speaker 0: We had actual terrorism over a decade ago.

872
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:41,688
Speaker 1: Right.

873
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:47,710
Speaker 0: And yet we have security theater that is both more intrusive and less effective than what goes on in like India.

874
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,590
Speaker 0: I'm so pissed off about that, but I'm not going to... This isn't a show about me complaining about security in the TSA.

875
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,249
Speaker 1: No, that's every show.

876
00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:53,949
Speaker 0: I know.

877
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:58,530
Speaker 0: But so I, you know, I get some dinner and then I decided to wander around Mumbai.

878
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,949
Speaker 0: So I go to walk out of the hotel.

879
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,730
Speaker 0: They were a guest like, where is Sir going?

880
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,750
Speaker 0: Where is Sir's driver?

881
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,950
Speaker 0: Like they were insistent like, where's your driver?

882
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,570
Speaker 0: Should we get your driver?

883
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,709
Speaker 0: Should we get your car ready?

884
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:10,918
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

885
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:11,789
Speaker 0: you're walking out?

886
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,610
Speaker 0: Where are you going?

887
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,570
Speaker 0: And I was like, I'm just going somewhere.

888
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,118
Speaker 0: I'm walking out.

889
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:15,568
Speaker 0: I'll be back.

890
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:19,350
Speaker 0: And I kind of walked by over all their protests and wandered out in the streets.

891
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,330
Speaker 1: Did like Google Maps work?

892
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,429
Speaker 1: Could you find your way back with that?

893
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I didn't have data there because of my CDMA phone.

894
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:28,430
Speaker 1: But you had your, oh, everything there is GSM.

895
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:28,885
Speaker 0: Yes.

896
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,810
Speaker 1: You couldn't get a temporary phone with your corporate credit card?

897
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,530
Speaker 0: I didn't bother.

898
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,350
Speaker 0: I had a temporary phone, but I hadn't hooked it up yet.

899
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,610
Speaker 0: Like I hadn't gotten the data plan going.

900
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,923
Speaker 1: But it was just a regular phone.

901
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:38,510
Speaker 1: or was it a smartphone?

902
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,410
Speaker 0: It was a smartphone.

903
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:39,889
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

904
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,550
Speaker 0: So what I did is I turned on Google tracks and I started tracking because GPS works fine.

905
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:49,230
Speaker 0: So if I got lost, I could at least see where I started and navigate back to that.

906
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,270
Speaker 0: And that actually works.

907
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,910
Speaker 0: I wandered way, way off into Mumbai.

908
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,209
Speaker 0: I wandered through some of the.

909
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,630
Speaker 1: But if it was night, how did you like not get hit by cars and shit?

910
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:00,769
Speaker 0: So that was actually a concern.

911
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:01,730
Speaker 1: No kidding.

912
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:11,490
Speaker 0: So you see videos of like India and you see, you know, basically a three lane road in India is actually a five lane road plus two motorcycle lanes, you know, sidewalks.

913
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,881
Speaker 0: And it is amazing.

914
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,270
Speaker 0: There is literally no such thing as traffic laws there as far as I can tell.

915
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,430
Speaker 0: Or at least if there are traffic laws, no one cares.

916
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,465
Speaker 0: But you get this impression watching those videos.

917
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,350
Speaker 0: that is totally safe.

918
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,370
Speaker 0: And like everyone because everyone's going so slow and paying so much attention that, you know, it just kind of works.

919
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:33,670
Speaker 1: Like in the videos, it's like you see crazy shit.

920
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:35,870
Speaker 1: But you also see people, you know, they're slowing down.

921
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,650
Speaker 1: They're taking their time.

922
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:37,789
Speaker 1: They're waiting for the spot.

923
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,365
Speaker 1: Then they move in.

924
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,450
Speaker 0: No, thousands die.

925
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,509
Speaker 0: The roads are death traps.

926
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,910
Speaker 0: Road deaths are one of the biggest problems in India.

927
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:44,088
Speaker 0: So many people die.

928
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,149
Speaker 0: It is crazy.

929
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,970
Speaker 0: So I walk out into the street and I'm on this kind of sidewalk and it's fine, except occasionally shanties were like built into the sidewalks.

930
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,908
Speaker 0: I have to like get around them.

931
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:55,070
Speaker 0: And that's a big problem in India, encroachment.

932
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:56,609
Speaker 0: People will like have a building.

933
00:41:57,071 --> 00:42:02,090
Speaker 0: And then one day they put like some corrugated steel like around like a foot out from their store.

934
00:42:02,932 --> 00:42:05,690
Speaker 0: And then they quietly take down the wall inside their building.

935
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,469
Speaker 0: And then they put the wall back up right at the edge of the steel.

936
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,649
Speaker 0: And then they move the steel another foot out.

937
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:13,130
Speaker 0: Stuff like that happens all the time.

938
00:42:13,271 --> 00:42:15,770
Speaker 1: Why would you want to make your building longer?

939
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,890
Speaker 0: Oh, you want more space.

940
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,170
Speaker 0: Eventually you make up enough space to have an apartment in there or another store.

941
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,450
Speaker 1: You give it a whole store in the sidewalk space?

942
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:22,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

943
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,470
Speaker 0: It's like there are some stores that were literally the size of like a closet.

944
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:27,245
Speaker 1: Oh.

945
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,568
Speaker 0: That's just how it is.

946
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:30,109
Speaker 0: It's very, very, very dense.

947
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,670
Speaker 0: I mean, India is a nation of more than a billion people.

948
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,110
Speaker 1: It's like if you can get a square inch, you're good.

949
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,517
Speaker 1: Yeah.

950
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:36,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

951
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,530
Speaker 0: So, but I wandered around through the streets.

952
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:45,412
Speaker 0: And the thing is, everyone was like, I was kind of impressed at how friendly everyone is.

953
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,690
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't they be friendly?

954
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,710
Speaker 0: Because, you know, in New York, everyone's not friendly.

955
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,110
Speaker 0: They're trying their best.

956
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:56,448
Speaker 1: The thing is, right, is like when you're packed in with a lot of people, you got to be friendly because not friendly doesn't work when you're so packed in with them.

957
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:03,010
Speaker 0: But I think because you're more packed in, there's like this extra onus to be friendly because you're really like in it together.

958
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,788
Speaker 0: Something goes down.

959
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:04,286
Speaker 1: Yeah.

960
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:04,834
Speaker 1: And it's like you're.

961
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:11,230
Speaker 1: just you're basically, you know, it's like you're when you're on the subway, you know, you're friendly because you're packed in like sardines, right?

962
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,290
Speaker 1: You're not going to be a jerk on the subway unless you're crazy.

963
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:19,550
Speaker 1: But you know, you can be a jerk when like, you know, you can go home and be all alone and not have to deal with the people yelling at you for being a jerk.

964
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:23,530
Speaker 0: So the way I figured out to walk around is I kind of watch what everyone else did and kind of followed crowds.

965
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,310
Speaker 0: Like I didn't walk anywhere that I didn't see someone else walking first.

966
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,608
Speaker 0: I was always following someone.

967
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:34,130
Speaker 0: And good strategy probably saved my life because there were straight up death traps.

968
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:39,889
Speaker 0: Like you could walk and without realizing it be in the middle of like train tracks or like crazy highway.

969
00:43:40,476 --> 00:43:40,969
Speaker 1: Not death traps.

970
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,989
Speaker 1: Like someone's going to kill you.

971
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:42,345
Speaker 0: No, no.

972
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,369
Speaker 0: Death traps like a motorcycle is going to hit you because there's a thousand of them and none of them have headlights and no one has helmets.

973
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:57,829
Speaker 0: I rode some motorcycles, my co-workers, you know, they took me around town like when I was in a hydro bed later and I just got to ride on the back of motorcycles through this crazy traffic.

974
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,668
Speaker 0: No one wears helmets.

975
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,570
Speaker 0: It was it actually made me reminded me how awesome motorcycles are and I kind of want one again.

976
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:11,090
Speaker 1: Well, if we go to India, you know, I can do first thing at the airport, get a driver, buy a helmet where I did not see a helmet for sale anywhere.

977
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:11,750
Speaker 1: We could bring one.

978
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:12,868
Speaker 0: I guess you could.

979
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:17,550
Speaker 1: I wouldn't need I wouldn't necessarily bring like a crazy one like door if you're going to go around India.

980
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,068
Speaker 0: Here's the trick.

981
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:24,968
Speaker 0: It costs maybe 20 or 30 bucks to have a driver for an entire day who will drive you anywhere you want.

982
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,029
Speaker 1: But the road is still a death trap.

983
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:27,589
Speaker 1: You can get killed and still drive.

984
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:27,820
Speaker 1: No.

985
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,569
Speaker 0: And if you're in a car, you're basically safe because you're not going to get hit hard.

986
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,770
Speaker 0: The people who die or the people on motorcycles are in the little tuk tuks or the pedestrians.

987
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:37,330
Speaker 0: But in a car you're safe.

988
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:45,390
Speaker 0: And for like 20 or 30 bucks, a guy will drive you around all day, wait for you anywhere you go, take care of all your all your like baggage and everything.

989
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,350
Speaker 1: And the cars must be cheap or what?

990
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,328
Speaker 1: Like what kind of car is this?

991
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,090
Speaker 0: Well, because the exchange rate is interesting.

992
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,709
Speaker 0: It's about a thousand rupees.

993
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,935
Speaker 0: Like a thousand rupee note is like a 20.

994
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:54,041
Speaker 1: OK.

995
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,129
Speaker 0: Twenty dollars.

996
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:55,668
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

997
00:44:55,971 --> 00:45:02,570
Speaker 0: But the prices because of this, like half the country, like the country is modernizing so quickly.

998
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:17,509
Speaker 0: And yet there's this huge like mass of population that the disparity between rich and poor and the economies of these different areas are diverging so rapidly that in the five star hotel, I drop the equivalent of like a hundred bucks on dinner.

999
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:20,863
Speaker 0: And then the room service was actually.

1000
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:22,490
Speaker 0: what do you think was the rooms?

1001
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:22,970
Speaker 0: What do you think?

1002
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:23,549
Speaker 0: What do you think?

1003
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:24,710
Speaker 1: Indian room service.

1004
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,010
Speaker 1: I'm usually I'm usually the best at room service guessing game, but not when it's a foreign country.

1005
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:33,890
Speaker 0: Five star hotel designed for foreigners who are rich businessmen at a conference.

1006
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:35,247
Speaker 0: What do you think?

1007
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,530
Speaker 0: Two eggs over easy and some toast would cost room service delivery.

1008
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,125
Speaker 1: So in the US, that's like 40 bucks.

1009
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:41,743
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1010
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:42,930
Speaker 0: If you're lucky.

1011
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:43,768
Speaker 1: If you're lucky.

1012
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:47,950
Speaker 1: Right now, because I'm not going to it is a five star hotel and it's fancy.

1013
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,450
Speaker 1: So not going to be like one dollar.

1014
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:49,863
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1015
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:50,594
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to.

1016
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:54,050
Speaker 1: it's got to be more expensive than like the diner here, which is like five bucks.

1017
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:55,090
Speaker 0: It was cheaper than the diner.

1018
00:45:55,732 --> 00:45:57,230
Speaker 1: It's got to be like room service was cheaper.

1019
00:45:57,752 --> 00:45:58,588
Speaker 1: It's like seven, eight.

1020
00:45:59,070 --> 00:45:59,390
Speaker 0: No, Scott.

1021
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:04,428
Speaker 0: I use the mini bar in my room because it was cheaper than what I pay for some of those things that a convenience store in the US.

1022
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:05,144
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

1023
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:05,970
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1024
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:06,848
Speaker 0: I opened it.

1025
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,790
Speaker 0: I was I wanted a Red Bull.

1026
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,730
Speaker 0: I really need some cat.

1027
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:09,290
Speaker 1: They had it there.

1028
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:18,900
Speaker 0: There was Red Bull in the mini fridge and I'm like and I pick it up, I'm like, all right, this is going on the corporate card, but I'll get in trouble if I have a ten dollar Red Bull.

1029
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,610
Speaker 0: Of course.

1030
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,762
Speaker 0: And I look at the sheet and it's like a dollar.

1031
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:22,709
Speaker 0: seventy five like a white.

1032
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,409
Speaker 1: You should just ask for a case at that price because so there are two bucks here.

1033
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,149
Speaker 1: I know you should be like, hey, how many Red Bulls can you guys get me?

1034
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:35,402
Speaker 0: But yeah, room service was cheap, but like outside, like.

1035
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:41,710
Speaker 0: I went to a restaurant like a normal restaurant to get dosa, which is basically like a crepe.

1036
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,368
Speaker 0: It's the one Indian food I've never really seen in the US, but it's whatever.

1037
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:45,948
Speaker 0: it is for breakfast.

1038
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,610
Speaker 0: It's like a crepe.

1039
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,015
Speaker 1: So was the Indian food there like?

1040
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:51,872
Speaker 1: is our Indian food like the way Chinese food is or it's not the same?

1041
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:57,849
Speaker 0: or is it the same stuff like, you know, it's actually well in New York, it's actually mostly the same.

1042
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:02,609
Speaker 0: Other than that, the meat there was so much more tender.

1043
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,196
Speaker 0: The last like.

1044
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:06,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I imagine there's less food regulations.

1045
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:07,105
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1046
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:07,829
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

1047
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:13,850
Speaker 0: The most of the places I ate at just because the nature of my travel were like ultra fancy five star restaurants.

1048
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:20,069
Speaker 0: So it's hard to compare because I was having the five star Indian food versus the three star equivalent in the US.

1049
00:47:20,477 --> 00:47:20,910
Speaker 1: All right.

1050
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,170
Speaker 1: Because when we get Indian food, it's just like regular restaurant.

1051
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,010
Speaker 1: We don't go to the five star Indian restaurant.

1052
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,810
Speaker 0: So that really good Indian place where I used to go to and fish kill.

1053
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:28,090
Speaker 0: Right.

1054
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,610
Speaker 0: The meat was a thousand times more tender than that.

1055
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,023
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1056
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,076
Speaker 1: I bet they just probably like.

1057
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,550
Speaker 1: this is a five star restaurant, though, and it's in India.

1058
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,530
Speaker 1: They probably just like, you know, they got that Tandoori Rock.

1059
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:40,850
Speaker 0: They really care about the chicken.

1060
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,309
Speaker 0: When I was in Hyderabad, there were so many like stalls, like a shop that was like, look at our chickens.

1061
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,510
Speaker 0: We take awesome care of them.

1062
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:47,909
Speaker 0: Check them out.

1063
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:48,607
Speaker 0: Here's some of them.

1064
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:50,270
Speaker 0: Here's why our eggs are so great.

1065
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,119
Speaker 0: Here's videos of how we take care of our chickens.

1066
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:55,209
Speaker 0: like eggs are a big goddamn deal with so many vegetarians and such.

1067
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:56,489
Speaker 0: Oh, it's cool.

1068
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:57,310
Speaker 1: And the culture there.

1069
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,007
Speaker 1: So it's like if you're going to eat meat, you know, people are only.

1070
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 1: you know, a lot of people probably won't eat the meat unless it's like so in America.

1071
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:03,762
Speaker 0: Right.

1072
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,374
Speaker 0: It's like smoking or not is like the question you get in, I guess, backwater shitty places in the U.S.

1073
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,809
Speaker 0: because, you know, that's gone in modern places like New York.

1074
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,008
Speaker 0: But that question, that equivalent in India is basically veg or non veg.

1075
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:20,730
Speaker 0: So everything you get from fast food everywhere like McDonald's there has veg and non veg options for everything.

1076
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,510
Speaker 0: KFC has half the menus vegetarian and actually KFC there is pretty good.

1077
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:29,130
Speaker 1: Wait, what is KFC vegetarian menu?

1078
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,229
Speaker 1: They don't have any vegetables.

1079
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,310
Speaker 0: Yes, KFC there does because it's just potato and potato.

1080
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,308
Speaker 1: I mean, what else do they have?

1081
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:40,530
Speaker 0: They have other vegetables like a whole bunch that you can get, like green beans, beans and potatoes.

1082
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:41,390
Speaker 1: Great.

1083
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,730
Speaker 0: I've got you've eaten Indian food, right?

1084
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's vegetables in that shit.

1085
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:46,808
Speaker 1: But this is KFC.

1086
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:47,793
Speaker 1: What is KFC?

1087
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:52,104
Speaker 0: have the same vegetables that Indian food has prepared in various different ways?

1088
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,029
Speaker 1: I want to see the menu.

1089
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:58,229
Speaker 0: They have like veggie sandwiches and things, but like I was at the airport, like I was really hungry.

1090
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:00,770
Speaker 0: So I got like a Domino's pizza because I was in a hurry.

1091
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:01,588
Speaker 1: I actually had Domino's.

1092
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,830
Speaker 0: So the pizza options are great.

1093
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:09,307
Speaker 0: It was veggie pizza, non veggie pizza, spicy pizza or spicy veggie pizza, spicy non veggie pizza.

1094
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:09,830
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1095
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:12,310
Speaker 1: That spicy veggie pizza must have been so spicy, right?

1096
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,630
Speaker 0: Wasn't that spicy?

1097
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,389
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that's what you ordered.

1098
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:20,327
Speaker 0: But that was the spiciest thing I ate because I didn't end up going to a restaurant that actually had vindaloo.

1099
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,588
Speaker 0: Just because, you know, I was only there for a week.

1100
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,569
Speaker 1: That's a lot of days.

1101
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:31,370
Speaker 0: But the baseline Indian food is about as spicy as so-called spicy Indian food here.

1102
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:36,349
Speaker 0: Like I got some chicken biryani because of Hyderabad, like the chicken biryani is supposedly like famous.

1103
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:38,190
Speaker 1: Always get the local specialty.

1104
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:38,830
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1105
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,070
Speaker 0: That was the best biryani ever.

1106
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,530
Speaker 1: Always get the local specialty.

1107
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,010
Speaker 0: But that biryani was way spicier than any biryani I've ever had.

1108
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,430
Speaker 0: Go to Rochester and get the garbage plate.

1109
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,088
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

1110
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,330
Speaker 0: So I asked the coworkers, I was like, so how spicy is this?

1111
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:50,430
Speaker 0: They were like, what do you mean spicy?

1112
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,769
Speaker 1: It's not spicy.

1113
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:53,070
Speaker 0: You want spicy?

1114
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,769
Speaker 0: You'll die.

1115
00:49:55,471 --> 00:50:03,460
Speaker 1: Do they have like, every restaurant has like a bottle of pure cap in the back and they're just like, you know, using like a turkey baster and going squirting it all over the place.

1116
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,410
Speaker 1: I mean, what are they doing?

1117
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:14,526
Speaker 0: But so in a normal restaurant, I got an entire meal, like a meal that I could not finish for 40 rupees.

1118
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,045
Speaker 1: When you said a thousand rupees is a

1119
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:17,790
Speaker 1: 20? 40

1120
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,570
Speaker 1: rupees is like a dollar.

1121
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:21,630
Speaker 0: Okay.

1122
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,174
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1123
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:30,365
Speaker 0: So the despair, basically you can go around India on a ton of money or effectively no money.

1124
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,010
Speaker 1: Well, see, I think this is the thing, right?

1125
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:32,312
Speaker 1: It's like you.

1126
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:32,937
Speaker 1: look at the U.S.

1127
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:36,009
Speaker 1: and everyone, you know, we're all complaining about like the disparity of wealth, right?

1128
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, the gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S.

1129
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,450
Speaker 0: basically doesn't exist compared to most of the world.

1130
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:39,825
Speaker 1: Well, no, no.

1131
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,450
Speaker 1: It's like this gigantic disparity.

1132
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:43,298
Speaker 1: But everyone in the U.S.

1133
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:45,630
Speaker 1: has the same prices, mostly, right?

1134
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,709
Speaker 1: It's not like poor people get cheaper.

1135
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:48,508
Speaker 1: You know.

1136
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:49,247
Speaker 0: Scott, they do.

1137
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:50,669
Speaker 0: Here's an example.

1138
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:55,350
Speaker 0: In Rochester, me and Scott Johnson, we're at like, I think it was Astronomicon.

1139
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,590
Speaker 0: Remember, we used to go and like do events for the anime club.

1140
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,469
Speaker 0: So we go because no one else would fucking go and help us.

1141
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:01,090
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go.

1142
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,167
Speaker 1: Why would I go?

1143
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,270
Speaker 0: So we were really hungry.

1144
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:09,370
Speaker 0: And remember, I was kind of poor and Skodro didn't have a lot of money on him at the time either.

1145
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:16,088
Speaker 0: So we're walking around and we see this little place, like a hole in the wall, like "restaurant" in quotes.

1146
00:51:16,752 --> 00:51:24,889
Speaker 0: So we go in and for 80 cents, we could get like a sausage, egg and cheese and like hash browns and toast and stuff.

1147
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:25,626
Speaker 0: Where was this?

1148
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1149
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,090
Speaker 0: So, Scott, there's places like that in America.

1150
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:29,428
Speaker 0: You forget because you're in New York.

1151
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:33,510
Speaker 0: There are places in the Bronx where you can get an entire meal for like two bucks.

1152
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,430
Speaker 1: But the thing is, it's like, you know, Walmart is really just as low as it goes, right?

1153
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:37,786
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1154
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:38,408
Speaker 0: You can get it.

1155
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,366
Speaker 0: Scott, I think you forget how cheap some food is just because...

1156
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,690
Speaker 1: But like rich people also go to Walmart or Amazon or whatever.

1157
00:51:45,832 --> 00:51:47,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have they have options.

1158
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,770
Speaker 0: They can go really cheap or really expensive anyway.

1159
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,110
Speaker 1: But I mean, the difference.

1160
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,430
Speaker 1: But I mean, like those prices are ludicrously low, right?

1161
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:00,530
Speaker 1: Like 80 cents for the bacon, egg and cheese versus like you're talking like one cent.

1162
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,070
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's crazy.

1163
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:09,969
Speaker 0: So the interesting thing is I had thousand rupee notes, which I use multiple of when I bought stuff in like the fancy parts of town.

1164
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:17,267
Speaker 0: And people like literally would not have changed for that, for anything I might buy in other parts of town.

1165
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:23,609
Speaker 0: So every denomination, a one rupee coin is actually directly useful and there are things you can buy for one rupee.

1166
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:30,929
Speaker 0: Every denom, every like scale of the money from the from one to a thousand is directly useful all over the place.

1167
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,750
Speaker 1: So in one rupee is the lowest, right?

1168
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,588
Speaker 0: They don't have pennies.

1169
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:40,310
Speaker 0: Like some people I would tip like five or ten rupees and I would buy like snacks and drinks for like twenty rupees.

1170
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,929
Speaker 0: But then I'd have a dinner for like seven thousand rupees.

1171
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:44,758
Speaker 1: OK.

1172
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:46,048
Speaker 1: It's like link.

1173
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,268
Speaker 0: I actually have.

1174
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:48,890
Speaker 1: Do you have any big shields?

1175
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,470
Speaker 0: I actually have about ten thousand rupees with me because I didn't change it back yet.

1176
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:54,250
Speaker 1: Well, you can just change it over like any place.

1177
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,609
Speaker 0: Well, I'm waiting because the rupee is actually pretty low right now.

1178
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,070
Speaker 0: So I'm going to hold out.

1179
00:52:58,452 --> 00:52:58,870
Speaker 1: Hold your weight.

1180
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,570
Speaker 1: You're playing the market.

1181
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,150
Speaker 1: I'm playing the market.

1182
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,750
Speaker 1: You're waiting for the ten thousand rupees.

1183
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:04,830
Speaker 0: Partly because I'll probably go back to India in May or June.

1184
00:53:05,097 --> 00:53:05,327
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

1185
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:06,590
Speaker 0: Which apparently is the hot season.

1186
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,730
Speaker 0: It was like ninety five degrees there while I was there.

1187
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,404
Speaker 0: Oh, baby.

1188
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,890
Speaker 0: And that's the cold season.

1189
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:12,889
Speaker 1: Did you see any bicycles that weren't motorized?

1190
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,129
Speaker 0: Yes.

1191
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:15,509
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of mountain bikes.

1192
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:15,903
Speaker 0: OK.

1193
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:20,269
Speaker 0: I saw one guy on like a road bike, but everyone was riding like mountain bikes.

1194
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:31,169
Speaker 0: But the lens on everyone who was biking, pretty much everyone is riding motorcycles or Vespas or scooters or things like that or little took took like pseudo motorcycle cabs.

1195
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:35,470
Speaker 0: So Mumbai was awesome, like walking around, though.

1196
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:42,635
Speaker 0: What's interesting is if you go to the districts where foreigners might go, like in Hyderabad, we went to like a whole bunch of like.

1197
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:49,830
Speaker 0: I saw Golconda, which is this ancient, like 14th century, 13th century fortified city that is in ruins.

1198
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,409
Speaker 1: It was actually, you know, I like the old shit.

1199
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,730
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1200
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,890
Speaker 0: I got a ton of pictures of that.

1201
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,250
Speaker 0: And two of my awesome co-workers like took me around and they were like explaining stuff.

1202
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,229
Speaker 0: We went to all these temples.

1203
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,949
Speaker 0: We did the touristy stuff.

1204
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,949
Speaker 0: But because they're locals, like they knew with a worthwhile touristy stuff versus the stuff that's not worth bothering to see.

1205
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,750
Speaker 0: So I got a really good and they were explaining stuff.

1206
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:15,027
Speaker 0: And what was interesting is when I was walking around like a shanty town, nobody bothered me at all.

1207
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:19,770
Speaker 0: Like I wandered into what the average American would probably fear for their lives.

1208
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:21,989
Speaker 0: But really, everyone was just kind of chill living their lives in there.

1209
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:23,367
Speaker 0: But no one bothered me.

1210
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:27,890
Speaker 0: But in the tourist areas where foreigners might go, it's kind of sad.

1211
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:37,110
Speaker 0: But I literally there were beggars like clawing at my clothes and like grabbing me and like demanding money and like putting their hands in my pockets and just like they were pick pockets.

1212
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,513
Speaker 0: And it was.

1213
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,790
Speaker 0: it was crazy.

1214
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:49,110
Speaker 0: And basically, my two friends, the co-workers followed me around and were like at one point pushing beggars away from me and like shouting people away, like leave him alone.

1215
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:50,129
Speaker 0: He's not going to give you any money.

1216
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:51,728
Speaker 0: We're not going to let you rip him off.

1217
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:55,770
Speaker 0: In Hindi, like there's yelling at these people and I keep them away from me.

1218
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:56,071
Speaker 0: And it was.

1219
00:54:56,553 --> 00:55:00,330
Speaker 0: it was an interesting experience, but it was kind of like scarily stereotypical.

1220
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:00,854
Speaker 0: Like it's.

1221
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,270
Speaker 0: it's the kind of thing I didn't really expect to happen.

1222
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:05,629
Speaker 0: And yet it actually happened exactly like it does in the movies.

1223
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:06,150
Speaker 1: Yep.

1224
00:55:07,714 --> 00:55:09,089
Speaker 0: But I got to see like the Gate of India.

1225
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,470
Speaker 1: You should watch the relevant Galaxy Express episode.

1226
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:18,888
Speaker 0: Or the the train station in Mumbai is like from the relevant Galaxy Express episode from the colonial times.

1227
00:55:19,555 --> 00:55:20,485
Speaker 0: It is opulent.

1228
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,570
Speaker 0: Like it is as beautiful as Grand Central, but in a very different way.

1229
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:25,770
Speaker 1: Well, the British made it right.

1230
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:31,090
Speaker 0: It is an amazing building, you know, like extra amazing.

1231
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,487
Speaker 0: But in the touristy areas, too, and I actually have no problem with this, like a museum I went to.

1232
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:41,790
Speaker 0: It was five rupees for anyone who was an Indian, a Pakistani.

1233
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:43,229
Speaker 0: And there's like a list of other countries.

1234
00:55:43,642 --> 00:55:43,810
Speaker 1: Really?

1235
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,529
Speaker 1: Even a Pakistani.

1236
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:45,650
Speaker 1: I thought they hated them.

1237
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,630
Speaker 0: No, actually, the average people don't care at all.

1238
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,470
Speaker 0: They really wish like they're actually really chill about the Muslims.

1239
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,245
Speaker 0: There's a huge Muslim community in India.

1240
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,109
Speaker 1: I know that.

1241
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,403
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1242
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:00,069
Speaker 0: But like that slum, like the like the one slum that I saw that the cabbie was talking about.

1243
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,729
Speaker 0: Two million people live in that slum.

1244
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,469
Speaker 0: And apparently it's like ninety nine percent Muslim.

1245
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:03,918
Speaker 1: OK.

1246
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:04,619
Speaker 0: But.

1247
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:11,086
Speaker 1: But like that that number of rupees to get into the museum, that's like it might as well be free.

1248
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,809
Speaker 0: So it's like five hundred rupees for anyone else.

1249
00:56:15,213 --> 00:56:16,449
Speaker 1: So that's still almost no money.

1250
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:22,166
Speaker 0: So I paid 10 bucks to get in and a poor Indian or a normal Indian can pay five rupees to get in.

1251
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,370
Speaker 0: It's the same as the New York museums.

1252
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:24,349
Speaker 0: I go in for free.

1253
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,530
Speaker 1: Well, I go in for a penny.

1254
00:56:25,812 --> 00:56:26,248
Speaker 1: One penny.

1255
00:56:26,795 --> 00:56:27,210
Speaker 1: One penny.

1256
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:27,784
Speaker 1: You know that guy?

1257
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:28,268
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1258
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:32,290
Speaker 0: But the you know, the tourists basically pay the tourist tax.

1259
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:33,688
Speaker 0: I'm OK paying the tourist tax.

1260
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:33,957
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1261
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,246
Speaker 1: I mean, like, you know, if I'm in New York and I want to go to the museum, I pay one penny.

1262
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:45,950
Speaker 1: If I go to some other place and it's not free museum day, I pay the suggested donation, whatever, because I'm not paying for it with taxes.

1263
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:46,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1264
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,048
Speaker 1: Right.

1265
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,136
Speaker 1: It's not you know, it's not.

1266
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,887
Speaker 1: this is a federal museum like Smithsonian.

1267
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:50,390
Speaker 1: that are not paying.

1268
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,146
Speaker 1: I'm paying the minimum.

1269
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:51,668
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1270
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:57,450
Speaker 0: But like the ruined city was really, really interesting, partly because it wasn't curated in the same way.

1271
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,469
Speaker 0: It's kind of like how everyone says, if you want to see Greek ruins, go to Turkey.

1272
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:06,008
Speaker 0: Because in Greece, they're curated differently and or, you know, the city's kind of built up around it.

1273
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,870
Speaker 1: They didn't have like little description plates on it.

1274
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:08,473
Speaker 1: No, it was just.

1275
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:12,150
Speaker 0: it was just here's a gigantic old ruined city fort.

1276
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,650
Speaker 0: Wander around.

1277
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,167
Speaker 0: Check it out.

1278
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,890
Speaker 1: There aren't like ropes running from touching shit or it's not like don't sit here.

1279
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,189
Speaker 0: And I hate to say it.

1280
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:22,488
Speaker 1: But doesn't that make people ruin it?

1281
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:22,868
Speaker 1: No.

1282
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,490
Speaker 1: With their touching?

1283
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:24,750
Speaker 0: Well, it kind of does.

1284
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,309
Speaker 0: It's getting more ruined as time goes on.

1285
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:26,788
Speaker 1: Of course.

1286
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,110
Speaker 0: But it was actually really cool, like we just kind of wandered around it and like poked into these buildings.

1287
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,130
Speaker 1: It's always, you know, it's always like a tough tradeoff.

1288
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,370
Speaker 1: It's like you want to preserve this really old thing so more people can enjoy it.

1289
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:42,710
Speaker 1: But you could also give up some of its preservation to have the people who are enjoying it now enjoy it more.

1290
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:44,149
Speaker 0: I think you have to have a balance.

1291
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,950
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, and it seems like, you know, we got two extremes.

1292
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,302
Speaker 1: But it's like, well, what can you do?

1293
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:49,110
Speaker 1: that would be a balance?

1294
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,241
Speaker 1: It's like, well, some museums in the U.S.

1295
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,830
Speaker 1: were like, OK, don't touch anything.

1296
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,949
Speaker 1: Here's one spot we want to let you touch.

1297
00:57:55,431 --> 00:58:02,589
Speaker 1: And it's like, of course, that thing gets touched to death exactly because you get all the touching is concentrated in one area.

1298
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:03,390
Speaker 0: No touching.

1299
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:12,189
Speaker 1: It's like instead of having the touching spread out over the whole thing, you concentrate in just one area, completely destroying that area 100 percent way faster than any of the other areas.

1300
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:16,060
Speaker 0: So apparently, Golconda, though, is this huge, like fortified city with a big wall around it.

1301
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,589
Speaker 1: I'm sure it has a Wikipedia page.

1302
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:26,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the neat things about it were it had this system where you could say things or clap like way down at the gates and you'd hear it all the way up at the top in the throne room.

1303
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:27,455
Speaker 1: Whoa.

1304
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,870
Speaker 0: So they could warn like, hey, shit's going down, go hide.

1305
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:31,815
Speaker 0: Whoa.

1306
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, like really neat stuff like that.

1307
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:37,545
Speaker 1: Did you go to the throne room and one of your friends stayed at the front and you played a little game?

1308
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,570
Speaker 0: I just went up there and listened to people doing stuff down there.

1309
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:48,050
Speaker 0: We didn't actually play the game because otherwise there were people who were trying to grab us and give a free, like give a tour, like, hey, I'll show you around.

1310
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,370
Speaker 0: Then at the end, they were going to demand money and make a big scene.

1311
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:52,209
Speaker 0: So we had to avoid those people like the plague.

1312
00:58:53,772 --> 00:59:00,970
Speaker 0: And also there was a tunnel, it's gone now, like it collapsed, I think a hundred years ago, between Golconda and Hyderabad, the city itself.

1313
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,569
Speaker 0: And apparently you could escape.

1314
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rulers would live in the city, but if shit went down, they'd escape into the tunnel and hide in the fortress.

1315
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,210
Speaker 1: Oh, so they didn't live in the fortress.

1316
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:10,150
Speaker 1: No, they didn't live in the city.

1317
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,990
Speaker 1: Because it sucks to live in a fortress.

1318
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,188
Speaker 0: Unless shit went down.

1319
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:13,990
Speaker 1: Oh, not bad.

1320
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:14,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1321
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:15,506
Speaker 0: There's a lot of neat stuff like that.

1322
00:59:17,673 --> 00:59:20,230
Speaker 0: I think I'm going to kind of cut this short because we've actually gone on a long time.

1323
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:27,830
Speaker 0: I'll share other anecdotes whenever I have time on Geek Nights because I haven't even really talked about like 90% of what went on in India.

1324
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,109
Speaker 1: It was only there for a week.

1325
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:34,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I did so much in that week that I'm still struggling to like tell the whole story.

1326
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,029
Speaker 0: And I might get to go to Turkey and Germany like right after PAX.

1327
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:39,510
Speaker 1: I got to go places.

1328
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,149
Speaker 1: See, it's like I need vacation so I can go places.

1329
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,969
Speaker 1: I want to go places real bad, but you don't have any vacation, but you're just getting business trips.

1330
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:46,470
Speaker 1: That's cheating.

1331
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:48,428
Speaker 0: So, Scott, you want to come with me?

1332
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:51,290
Speaker 1: How can I come with you if you had to hire me or something?

1333
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to work for my company?

1334
00:59:52,374 --> 00:59:52,545
Speaker 1: No.

1335
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:53,087
Speaker 0: Why not?

1336
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:57,083
Speaker 1: All right, if my only job is to travel, then yes, official traveler.

1337
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,270
Speaker 0: Your job is going to be writing Java code.

1338
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:05,050
Speaker 1: My job will be the carrier of the corporate card.

1339
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,789
Speaker 1: I'll be the wallet.

1340
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:09,150
Speaker 0: Scott, you're going to be writing complex interfaces in Java.

1341
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:09,709
Speaker 1: No, I won't.

1342
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:10,588
Speaker 1: I don't want to do that.

1343
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,609
Speaker 0: But then you'll get to go to Java.

1344
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:13,990
Speaker 1: No, I don't want to do that either.

1345
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,369
Speaker 1: I just want to go to Java without writing any Java.

1346
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:17,544
Speaker 0: Hah.

1347
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:19,630
Speaker 0: Pax is coming.

1348
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, going there.

1349
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,800
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1350
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,899
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.
