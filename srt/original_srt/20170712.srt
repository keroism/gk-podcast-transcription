1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,324
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 12th 2017.

2
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,918
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,675
Speaker 1: tonight We're back and we're talking about one of the most delightful anime.

4
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:23,637
Speaker 1: We've seen in a while eccentric family season 1 too many words.

5
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:27,577
Speaker 0: you could have just said Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:32,278
Speaker 1: It could be complicated though cuz season 2 is on like right now, and I'm actually halfway through it.

7
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:46,289
Speaker 1: It's real good and actually I was talking to Yuko and Judith both at Connecticut about season 2. they both said it is way more serious and probably better than season 1 and I'm really curious to see all that now.

8
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:48,099
Speaker 1: I really like season 1 a lot.

9
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,219
Speaker 0: Don't you save your talk about the main bit for the main bit all right?

10
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,800
Speaker 1: So you got any news about anime or animation comics?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,111
Speaker 0: You're not even gonna talk about the Connecticut that we just went to.

12
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:58,734
Speaker 1: that was gonna be.

13
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,162
Speaker 1: I was gonna make that my news Good.

14
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,768
Speaker 0: the new news is ways the opening bit.

15
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

16
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:12,240
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah opening bit, so I just biked home from work And it's like 88 degrees, and I'm sweaty cuz it's super hot out, and I biked real fast.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,167
Speaker 0: I think it's kind of a little bit cold out right now.

18
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,520
Speaker 1: It actually got a lot chillier while I was biking home.

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,344
Speaker 0: It could be warmer.

20
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:19,631
Speaker 1: Yeah over lunch.

21
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,078
Speaker 1: It was like way hotter, and then it cooled off.

22
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:27,787
Speaker 1: But yeah, we were at Kinetic on and I was in London like the week before that and I was in Hong Kong not too long before that.

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:35,300
Speaker 1: so we've had a lot of Weeks where we didn't do shows and it's real hard to do a show the day after we come back from a convention.

24
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:37,026
Speaker 1: That's why Monday didn't happen.

25
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,153
Speaker 1: cuz I asked I also.

26
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,498
Speaker 0: I came home on my.

27
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:48,399
Speaker 0: you know I basically went to work straight from Connecticut Monday morning, so I was like I need to go home I can't spend another hour not at home and frankly I gotta go take care of my shit.

28
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,132
Speaker 1: well I could have said something like oh that means we won't do a show.

29
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:53,603
Speaker 1: what I thought in my brain was yes Fuck the show.

30
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,931
Speaker 0: I have no idea for a Monday show anyway.

31
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:03,854
Speaker 1: I do actually I want to do a show on AV tech in like panel rooms and halls and things like that.

32
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:04,416
Speaker 0: we done that.

33
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:06,622
Speaker 1: I don't think I did a Tentative search.

34
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,490
Speaker 0: video output goes to the video display thing.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,995
Speaker 0: make sure the input is selected.

36
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,920
Speaker 0: audio output goes to the sound system.

37
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:15,407
Speaker 1: Go there's a few more components.

38
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,352
Speaker 0: You got some microphones mix them nicely.

39
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:17,914
Speaker 0: There's.

40
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,979
Speaker 1: there are a few more components to that.

41
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:26,880
Speaker 1: Anyway, also I saw I noticed some things people are having problems with and actually they have the right adapter.

42
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:30,199
Speaker 0: Also, we told everyone VGA, but all the rooms at HDMI.

43
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,118
Speaker 1: now They also had VGA, but people kept like kicking it under the table, okay?

44
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:42,162
Speaker 1: Well a lot of the rooms HDMI cables just stopped working and it looked like it's because they were just literally too long Mmm.

45
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:43,950
Speaker 1: They're all all those kinds of issues.

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,420
Speaker 0: I thought it was because people had adapters that like weren't any good.

47
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't just the adapters.

48
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,240
Speaker 1: There's more to it than that anyway.

49
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:57,518
Speaker 0: So his is anime news ready crunchyroll the place where I watch 90% of the anime that I watch.

50
00:02:57,558 --> 00:03:08,854
Speaker 0: that's new And one of the only I guess the video streaming service that I cancel the least because I've said this before But just in case anyone doesn't know my strategy is because you get Netflix.

51
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:10,180
Speaker 0: you got who you got crunchyroll.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,849
Speaker 0: you get all these freaking shows out things out there and You know if you pay for any like.

53
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,220
Speaker 0: if you pay for Netflix monthly, it's like, okay This could be months where that's worth your money is me months.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,585
Speaker 0: You don't watch Netflix at all.

55
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,493
Speaker 0: And what the hell did you just spend money on right?

56
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,200
Speaker 0: I feel the same way about Adobe.

57
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:31,520
Speaker 0: There's like months where I'll make three videos and months or I won't even edit a photo and it's just like I paid 50 bucks for nothing that month anyway.

58
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:34,060
Speaker 0: But you can't you have to do that yearly.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,076
Speaker 0: You can't do it month to month with the Adobe thing easily, which is fine Cuz I'm using it literally all the times.

60
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:39,480
Speaker 1: I don't care.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,799
Speaker 0: It just feels comforting to know that at any time I have the full power to edit any Sort of digital content.

62
00:03:48,026 --> 00:04:00,479
Speaker 1: Yep and that comes in handy when I want to make a sudden meme out of nowhere and I need to like bust open any kind of Digital content video audio image website anything I have full power at a whim so that's worth paying for.

63
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:00,880
Speaker 0: but anyway.

64
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,646
Speaker 0: But video streaming services.

65
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:11,779
Speaker 0: if you pay for crunchyroll some month and you don't watch a single goddamn anime episode You just threw money in the fire like right but crunchyroll I use more than you know.

66
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,665
Speaker 0: Cancel Netflix.

67
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,440
Speaker 0: when I got no Netflix shows I cancel Hulu and I got no Hulu shows.

68
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:21,595
Speaker 0: I pretty much only subscribe to Hulu during South Park season but crunchyroll almost always on.

69
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:40,328
Speaker 0: so Crunchyroll is going down the path of the Netflix's and the Hulu's and the Amazon Prime's and that they realized hey You know just showing shows that someone else makes is pretty good, but to really get people to subscribe and pay We gotta make content that only we have.

70
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,900
Speaker 0: if we stream something that someone else has it's like all right.

71
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:50,299
Speaker 0: You know if we stream something that's like a temporary exclusive lice It's like people can wait it out and watch it somewhere else.

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:58,247
Speaker 0: But the reason all these people are making their own content is because that way it's like if we make something good You gotta pay us to see it.

73
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,456
Speaker 0: Otherwise the end is nowhere else.

74
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:08,399
Speaker 1: you will ever see it ever Yep, and also as soon as you own it You can do the kinds of things that a lot of licensers will not let you do sell merch.

75
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:11,719
Speaker 1: Look at look at Netflix with their offline mode.

76
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:18,187
Speaker 1: You'll notice that most stuff does not work in offline mode and the things that do work are the things that Netflix paid for themselves Right.

77
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:23,539
Speaker 0: So anyway Crunchyroll has partnered because obviously crunchyroll doesn't have anyone who can animate on their staff right there.

78
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:28,664
Speaker 0: But they partnered with NBC Universal Entertainment Japan Which I didn't even know existed.

79
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,228
Speaker 0: who is previously?

80
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:37,950
Speaker 0: they have previously produced animes such as fruit of Grisaia Starm you - I guess they didn't make starm you one.

81
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,412
Speaker 0: I don't know.

82
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:39,576
Speaker 0: I know starm you is.

83
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,439
Speaker 0: it's a Pokemon, right?

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,979
Speaker 0: Drifters, is that related to Tokyo drifters or is it different?

85
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,007
Speaker 0: Berserk that's an anime.

86
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,480
Speaker 0: I know that's a real anime the first real anime.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, as seven mortal sins don't know what the hell that is, but I guess they can produce anime.

88
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,899
Speaker 0: They produce berserk, right?

89
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:01,740
Speaker 0: Okay So crunchyroll is partnering with them and they're going to produce anime that are yet unnamed.

90
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:08,191
Speaker 0: But we'll have international appeal, of course And then they're gonna put them on crunchyroll only and we're gonna watch them.

91
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,580
Speaker 1: it'll be interesting because this is kind of a big deal.

92
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:18,415
Speaker 1: but a big part of why Netflix is able to have so much success with this is their unlimited bucket of money.

93
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:22,590
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and NBC Universal Japan, I'm sure has money.

94
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,500
Speaker 0: also anime that you make in Japan and pay With slave animation labor is inexpensive.

95
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:47,216
Speaker 1: That is actually probably the biggest factor that if you just take the existing Like studio system in Japan and just pump money into it and Commission anime I feel like it'll be real cheap to make a lot of content But at the same time that does not actually help the people in Japan.

96
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,900
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I hope that you know.

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:57,651
Speaker 0: the one thing I hope that comes from this actually is that they make some Original anime and not anime based on manga or sequels to exist it, right?

98
00:06:58,012 --> 00:06:58,233
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:01,100
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's a real bigger issue here.

100
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,920
Speaker 1: Well not an issue but the idea of what is anime versus what is just animation is gonna get increasingly blurred.

101
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,060
Speaker 0: I mean people are arguing about this Castlevania show on Netflix, which I watched.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,953
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone from Japan was super involved in like.

103
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,741
Speaker 0: no, it's not Japanese at all It's.

104
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:16,962
Speaker 0: it's.

105
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,293
Speaker 0: it's in English is the primary language.

106
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:20,197
Speaker 0: That's right.

107
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,764
Speaker 0: It's not dubbed It's it.

108
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:29,860
Speaker 0: I mean it's dubbed in the way that dubbing means toss, you know voiceover But ADR style the original language of voice acting is English, right?

109
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,055
Speaker 0: It is made by an American studio and mostly and no not Japanese really right it.

110
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:44,220
Speaker 0: but it you know has a Visual style that is not often seen in things that are produced.

111
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:50,620
Speaker 0: You know, obviously anime comes in many different styles and you know animation comes in many different styles regardless of nation of origin.

112
00:07:51,185 --> 00:08:04,809
Speaker 0: but the style of this is more like a lot of you know, generic not interesting anime styles and is not very much looking like you know a American, you know style animation.

113
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,679
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it'll be is that there was you know, the anime.

114
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:27,620
Speaker 1: Even though like we said there isn't really a particular style the kinds of shows and the things that came out of anime are going to start increasingly being adopted by just animation globally and the idea that something is anime because it came from Japan will be a lot like a Particular film movement like via our films from a certain era.

115
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,463
Speaker 0: Yeah well Todd we'll talk more about the Castlevania show.

116
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,510
Speaker 0: one's room watches it cuz only four episodes.

117
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,754
Speaker 0: it's like 20 minutes each.

118
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,320
Speaker 1: the next the only thing big nights.

119
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:36,299
Speaker 1: We will review it.

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,011
Speaker 0: But the only thing I want to say about it now is that when I was watching it It's like it was really the one thing that was really disappointing.

121
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:48,424
Speaker 0: the most disappointing about it was that it felt like It should have been.

122
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:58,268
Speaker 0: it was like leaning towards a Yoshitaka Amano style, but was so far away from it And obviously had no involvement with it whatsoever.

123
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,539
Speaker 0: that like I just really wanted like they just should have had him do it.

124
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really just want an animated feature a new one.

125
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:08,339
Speaker 1: That is just his crap.

126
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:15,660
Speaker 0: Yep It's like they would have just hired Amano to do the arts on that show would have been like like the greatest thing ever.

127
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:24,420
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah the Castlevania thing is kind of a missed opportunity and I'm not gonna talk about it too much because like I said We're gonna literally review it on the next Wednesday show of geek nights.

128
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,794
Speaker 1: So this past weekend as you know, we were kinetic on which is not an anime convention.

129
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,480
Speaker 1: It is just a convention.

130
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:41,918
Speaker 0: It's a nerdy convention of all nerdy things comics tabletop games video games You know an amaze everything nerdy is there and there's very little like it out there.

131
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,886
Speaker 0: cuz most There's a lot of everything cons.

132
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:48,120
Speaker 0: They just a lot of them don't have the balls to call themselves everything con.

133
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:57,774
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of everything cons to are super tiny and a lot of it ain't that small and and they are not run as Well, it might be one of the better run everything cons that we know of.

134
00:09:58,075 --> 00:09:59,541
Speaker 1: Yep, but we were there, you know We're.

135
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:14,387
Speaker 1: if you don't know we literally like run the entire panels department there And as always because we scheduled a whole bunch of panels and like random and had like the counts and everything I noticed a lot of interesting trends about Like what is popular and not now.

136
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:22,280
Speaker 1: and one thing I can say pretty definitively based on three years of trend data The pony fandom has all but vanished from the convention.

137
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,888
Speaker 0: No, I mean I saw plenty of pony action.

138
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:29,160
Speaker 1: keep pony action in that people will wear merchandise about my little pony.

139
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,229
Speaker 1: There'll be tons of art in the artist alley.

140
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,926
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but there is almost no interest in attending Pony related panels.

141
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,480
Speaker 1: No, and there's almost no one submitting pony related panels.

142
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,930
Speaker 1: No, meanwhile, you know, it came back in a big way.

143
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,983
Speaker 1: I got a shit ton of Hetalia.

144
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:45,807
Speaker 1: ask a nation.

145
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:48,480
Speaker 1: submissions really gone for years.

146
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,140
Speaker 0: I only saw one Hetalia with my eyeballs, but I saw actually a big two scoops full of homestucks.

147
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:56,608
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there were.

148
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:01,570
Speaker 0: it wasn't like the homestucks back in the heyday But there were like two nice scoops worth of homestucks that I saw.

149
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,971
Speaker 1: but in terms of submissions like Hetalia submissions We're up in a big way.

150
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:06,716
Speaker 1: I think we're way down.

151
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,088
Speaker 0: I think the reason for that is.

152
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,000
Speaker 0: I don't think it has anything to do with the popularity of Hetalia itself.

153
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:16,460
Speaker 0: I think is that the Hetalia community is a community that knows how to submit panels.

154
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:20,800
Speaker 0: I think that is more so than other pet communities regardless of size.

155
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,710
Speaker 1: I think cosplay related panels.

156
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:27,940
Speaker 1: I got more submissions for that than literally anything.

157
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,399
Speaker 0: That's the biggest thing at the gun.

158
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,848
Speaker 1: But most of them still are.

159
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,800
Speaker 1: I am a cosplayer and and they don't really have anything going on in the panel.

160
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,737
Speaker 1: so the ones I scheduled were ones like I am a pro and here's a technique.

161
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:47,480
Speaker 1: or Here is some like real information on plus-size cosplay and like how to do it right and stuff like that like real technical panels.

162
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:53,418
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in how I make dozens of dollars with my youtube channel about cosplay photography.

163
00:11:53,438 --> 00:12:08,858
Speaker 1: Nope But yeah, we ran our channels and what was really interesting is that Kineticon is one of those cons like Zenkai Con or like all the cons that are in a place Where the people who live in that place don't tend to travel to other conventions.

164
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:16,304
Speaker 1: that much Nope, so you'd have people for whom that convention is their first and or only Convention.

165
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:23,600
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm meaning we being lazy take all the content We've run it like five packs is and just recycle it at like Zenkai Con and Kineticon.

166
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:34,849
Speaker 1: but when I ran for an anime openers, which is something I've run like years and years this everywhere I ran I pretty much filled the room and I think 90% of the people in the room.

167
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:43,184
Speaker 1: never heard of me never been to a Kineticon before But didn't have any idea about any of this stuff and I'll for a lot of them I'd say half the room.

168
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:45,255
Speaker 1: It was their first convention ever.

169
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:45,798
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

170
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
Speaker 1: So all I want to say is that that German Naruto shtick?

171
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,889
Speaker 1: I had to pause and rewind.

172
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:52,914
Speaker 1: people were laughing so hard.

173
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,059
Speaker 1: They could not believe it.

174
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:57,009
Speaker 0: Seen a German Naruto before they'd never.

175
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,700
Speaker 1: the the foreign anime openers concept was already pretty crazy.

176
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Speaker 1: The Italian pony thing kind of kind of lost him.

177
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,822
Speaker 1: They were.

178
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:06,999
Speaker 1: I had to back up and replay parts of that because they were making so much noise.

179
00:13:08,342 --> 00:13:23,188
Speaker 1: but uh, yeah, uh The other trends I see is that there are fewer and fewer anime related panels being submitted and more importantly Almost all the anime panels are people who have submitted them in the past And or who I see it.

180
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:31,760
Speaker 1: other kinds like anime Boston or like Charles Dunbar and No one seems to have any interest in talking about most recent anime.

181
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,995
Speaker 1: It's all panels about old anime submitted by people who are around our age.

182
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:39,440
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll do a eccentric family panel, huh?

183
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,081
Speaker 1: Like.

184
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:44,214
Speaker 1: I think I only have like 35 minutes of content though.

185
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,760
Speaker 0: Well now if we get a second season in there.

186
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,526
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Seasons do some research about.

187
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:52,577
Speaker 1: so here's how hell is portrayed in this painting and how that relates to.

188
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:53,580
Speaker 1: I could be a fun panel.

189
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,444
Speaker 1: Actually, hmm.

190
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:58,220
Speaker 1: I'm suddenly feeling a be like maybe we should make a new set of anime panels.

191
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,668
Speaker 1: Is that a recycling over and over again?

192
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,136
Speaker 0: I could do your pet old panel.

193
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,519
Speaker 0: Yeah I could do a big you off at open.

194
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,466
Speaker 1: The problem is the anime have the most to say about her.

195
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,610
Speaker 1: still the old ass anime.

196
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,152
Speaker 1: There's almost.

197
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,477
Speaker 0: I'll mostly talk about biking.

198
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:17,249
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway things of the day.

199
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,497
Speaker 1: so remember that channel that we're a fan of.

200
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:20,220
Speaker 1: it's the woman who?

201
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:29,074
Speaker 1: makes Helper robots that are just awful Like they'll chop lettuce really dangerously with knives flying.

202
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,880
Speaker 0: Oh, I saw one just the other day.

203
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,703
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was this channel But it probably is.

204
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:36,580
Speaker 0: it was chopping a bread from the a loaf of bread from the top really poorly not.

205
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 1: So this I just found this kids YouTube channel like ran it randomly and this clearly looks like a dorm room in a college campus.

206
00:14:44,809 --> 00:15:01,748
Speaker 1: And basically he did a project where he used facial recognition technology to make a tiny robot and what that robot will do is Track any human face it sees and try to shine the laser pen in their eye And the video is pretty good because he tied.

207
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,858
Speaker 1: he talks a lot about like why he made it and how it seems like it's Gonna be a really good thing.

208
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:17,420
Speaker 1: but then he's you know, it's obviously like a school project and showing off the code and then he goes to demonstrate it and Literally he turns it on and he starts to talk and it gets him right in the eye and he's like, ah shit.

209
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:29,019
Speaker 1: And then he does the rest of the video trying to like Avoid it hitting him in the eye while he talks about how it works and it's way funnier than it has any right to be.

210
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:30,990
Speaker 1: Up there got him again.

211
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,359
Speaker 0: Just close your eyes, bro.

212
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:37,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you get hit in the eye with a regular laser pen and you close your eye, you can still see it.

213
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:51,117
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And the related videos to this seem to mostly be people making dangerous weapons with laser pens or Diodes, but this video is actually really funny and I laughed out loud.

214
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,763
Speaker 1: So So what do you got?

215
00:15:54,185 --> 00:16:02,710
Speaker 0: Oh, so this is a illustrator based out of Tokyo that I follow on Twitter Because their arts are way awesome and they're called utomaru.

216
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,100
Speaker 0: I think they that Twitter account itself was the thing of the day way back.

217
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:23,580
Speaker 0: But anyway utomaru has been doing the album art for this idol person named Oresama for I think like a couple albums, right and Oresama, I guess it's just some generic J-pop idol person or whatever, right?

218
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:29,803
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Oresama now has like a Is.

219
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:38,172
Speaker 0: I got a major label now and they just had a new music video that came out just now And it's generic J-pop.

220
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,320
Speaker 0: It sounds like an anime opener.

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,407
Speaker 1: Yeah My brain is literally.

222
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:45,142
Speaker 1: I'm listening to it with Scott before the show and I'm like, oh this sounds exactly Like.

223
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:51,362
Speaker 1: and my brain is every anime opener ever not all of them all the ones from a certain era Sure Cuz you know.

224
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:57,847
Speaker 1: like the late 90s anime openers have a particular sound to them as opposed to like the mid 2000s anime.

225
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 0: anyway, we don't we don't care about this song.

226
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,740
Speaker 0: What we care about is that utomaru's amazing illustrations are all over this music video.

227
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,288
Speaker 0: So just like watch the music video.

228
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've retweeted.

229
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:09,760
Speaker 1: I've seen you've retweeted this cat hour before.

230
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:18,310
Speaker 0: Yeah Just watch the video and you can mute it if you want and just you can see like so much Illustrations were done and put all over this music video.

231
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,538
Speaker 0: I guess the song is called that bat back there.

232
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 1: It's a good bat.

233
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,104
Speaker 0: yeah, it looks like a drakey from Dragon Quest.

234
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,961
Speaker 0: yeah does but yeah, the song is called trip trip trip Whatever.

235
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:34,880
Speaker 0: and it has like this RPG theme kind of going on while also has like a vacation traveling theme combined.

236
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:36,660
Speaker 1: That could be a good manga.

237
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:43,460
Speaker 1: It's visually Stimulating like that's how manga you're reading at the beach that I gotta borrow and read about the people in the dungeon delicious and dungeon.

238
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's alright.

239
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:51,960
Speaker 1: So in the moment the book of book is Frank Herbert's do not and we both read it and I got a lot to say.

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 1: So the next Thursday episode of geek nights will be a week from tomorrow.

241
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,127
Speaker 0: Yes We're gonna talk from today.

242
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:07,391
Speaker 1: for most of you the geek nights book club is gonna talk about Dune which I had never read all the way through in my life until recently and To give you a preview of what we're gonna say about that book.

243
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:14,475
Speaker 1: It is way Simpler and more straightforward than the internet and people I have talked to over the years.

244
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,759
Speaker 1: that led me to believe I'm gonna even know the spoiler.

245
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,200
Speaker 0: Nowhere in the book do the words quote the spice must flow appear.

246
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, was that in the movie?

247
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,354
Speaker 0: It might be in the movie.

248
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,760
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to go watch the movie I think so I could add it into the conversation.

249
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:36,540
Speaker 0: Well, I went and read even though I've heard bad things about the movie and I believe them but I gotta watch it anyway.

250
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:37,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could watch it.

251
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:37,886
Speaker 1: Now.

252
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,940
Speaker 1: What I really want to do is play the Dune board game again.

253
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,405
Speaker 0: I have played the food dude.

254
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,015
Speaker 1: I have played it, but I have not played it since I read Dune.

255
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:45,316
Speaker 0: Sure.

256
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:55,276
Speaker 1: Ah Never before has an intellectual property been applied to a game So literally and yet still been an actually good game.

257
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:56,099
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm like.

258
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:04,169
Speaker 1: It's kind of amazing and I'm actually like legit shocked by that and I feel like we could do a whole episode on that Concept on a Tuesday.

259
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,578
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, cuz it's nuts.

260
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:15,260
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I feel like you could do the same thing with Game of Thrones But I don't know if anyone will because the Game of Thrones game is not that I played it.

261
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,102
Speaker 1: Of course.

262
00:19:16,142 --> 00:19:17,674
Speaker 1: wasn't there a second edition that we didn't play?

263
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,500
Speaker 1: that fixed some issues?

264
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,332
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

265
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:22,853
Speaker 1: Hmm That was in our recess back when we used to go to those in the meta moment.

266
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,379
Speaker 1: other than the book club.

267
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,840
Speaker 1: We gonna pick the next book club book which we'll do at some point.

268
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,705
Speaker 1: I think Scott said he has an idea so I'm able to go with that If you do have an idea.

269
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:39,575
Speaker 1: if you listen to this because you her found us at Connecticut And you're somehow still listening all the way to this point.

270
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,919
Speaker 0: Whoa One what's wrong with you?

271
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,800
Speaker 1: I'm amazed that you figured out we do a podcast because a lot of our fans like seem to not realize that.

272
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:51,660
Speaker 1: Like we have fans on YouTube who don't know about the podcast and vice-versa.

273
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,685
Speaker 0: Even though you're now putting the podcast on YouTube It doesn't help.

274
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,379
Speaker 1: that is starting to help a lot.

275
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:57,463
Speaker 1: I see my seal.

276
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:00,395
Speaker 1: I've actually seen an uptick because I've been watching the Libsyn cuz.

277
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,423
Speaker 1: I'm trying to like now that I'm paying For it directly.

278
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:06,219
Speaker 1: I'm trying to tune what we pay for and tune my bit rates and all that stuff.

279
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:09,939
Speaker 1: But anyway, I've seen an uptick and I think they're starting to help in that way.

280
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,906
Speaker 1: I've also noticed something interesting.

281
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:14,313
Speaker 1: the Thursday shows get the most live streams.

282
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,360
Speaker 1: the Wednesday shows get the least live streams.

283
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,489
Speaker 0: Maybe this is because the day it might be.

284
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:27,378
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the content of the day or what but If you found us at Connecticut and you wanna and you like want to know more about any of the panels.

285
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:37,434
Speaker 1: we did Little little fun fact to three of the panels that for four of the panels We did a Connecticut are already on YouTube from other conventions.

286
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:43,555
Speaker 1: And if you watch them on YouTube They're just better more polished versions of what we have as Lee did a Connecticut.

287
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:49,750
Speaker 1: So that's the secret And otherwise like you should follow all our stuff on the internet.

288
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,830
Speaker 1: Scott's YouTube channel has a lot of live streams like you were live streaming Like us running the panel's department at Connecticut.

289
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,014
Speaker 1: No, they're pretty interesting videos.

290
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:58,499
Speaker 0: I watched the one I was using.

291
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:02,377
Speaker 1: I watched the one with you and Kate and I watched the one of you walking around.

292
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,020
Speaker 1: they were entertaining.

293
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,448
Speaker 1: I was legit entertained.

294
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,540
Speaker 1: All right, I feel like we should do that more.

295
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,760
Speaker 1: I think we should live stream a random crap from conventions.

296
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Speaker 1: We go to way more often because it totally works and like it's moderately entertaining.

297
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:17,652
Speaker 1: uh What else do we got?

298
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,360
Speaker 1: nothing really?

299
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:24,900
Speaker 1: I guess the only important thing is because a lot of you are emailing me about this or posting random comments.

300
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,629
Speaker 1: I'm like random videos on my channel about this.

301
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,899
Speaker 1: So one now the Connecticut and all that travel is done.

302
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:33,949
Speaker 1: We're resuming all the projects that were on hold.

303
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,436
Speaker 1: So the convention we're trying to start.

304
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:37,580
Speaker 1: we're working on that now.

305
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,869
Speaker 1: The utenna geek nights presents show.

306
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,420
Speaker 1: we're gonna put an episode up real soon.

307
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,479
Speaker 1: We're gonna produce it like I got my shit together.

308
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:48,800
Speaker 1: All those other like the game show all that crap we were talking about.

309
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,668
Speaker 1: We have time to work on that now.

310
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:57,552
Speaker 1: The only thing that will get in our way between now and October is that if it's really nice outside, we're not doing shit.

311
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:01,345
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and also the packs.

312
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,906
Speaker 0: the next convention is real packs.

313
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:17,787
Speaker 0: labor day weekend in Seattle I always forget until like cuz I'm always focused on my next summer when summer ends Real packs arise.

314
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,714
Speaker 1: I mean we've got to the point in our lives.

315
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:20,697
Speaker 1: It's kind of fascinating.

316
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:29,835
Speaker 1: the conventions We go to no matter what now are magfest Packs West packs East packs out packs Australia packs unplugged packs dev.

317
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,219
Speaker 1: There's there's a pattern there.

318
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:36,578
Speaker 1: Yeah Thank icon And we pretty much dropped almost everything else.

319
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:39,031
Speaker 1: we'll see Boston now that I'm inspired to do some.

320
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:39,333
Speaker 1: I only

321
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:40,840
Speaker 0: skipped anime Boston one time

322
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:51,191
Speaker 1: Yeah and I feel actually kind of refreshed by skipping it because this year was just a busy year that we might be able to bring an A-game to the next anime Boston because we're not missing good weather if we go to that.

323
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:58,960
Speaker 1: Mmm, but packs West is The packs and me and Emily are gonna be in Seattle for nine days.

324
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:00,609
Speaker 0: It's a lot of days.

325
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,115
Speaker 1: Yeah it is.

326
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,266
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be there for less days.

327
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:04,792
Speaker 1: Well, cause you don't go to pecs dev.

328
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:07,120
Speaker 0: I'm gonna arrive Thursday and leave Tuesday.

329
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:13,360
Speaker 1: I'm gonna arrive I think Monday Sunday night or Monday and then we're gonna leave like the following Tuesday.

330
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:15,927
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna fly Delta though.

331
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:17,856
Speaker 1: I think it might be done with the jet blue.

332
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:19,840
Speaker 0: Mmm I already got jet blue tickets.

333
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:32,685
Speaker 1: so I want to say the majority of my flights to or from packs for the past few years have been late and I don't think I've been on a single late flight might have been and I was looking as I fly a lot and actually Jet blue.

334
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,720
Speaker 1: is this really like dropping in the on-time performance?

335
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,815
Speaker 1: Domestically and their fleet is aging pretty badly and the Delta tickets are actually cheaper.

336
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,283
Speaker 1: So We'll see.

337
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:48,470
Speaker 1: thing is if I do jet blue partly I got a ton of miles So I gotta like blow them all I get for free flights.

338
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:52,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how many true blue points or whatever I looked never used my points.

339
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:55,920
Speaker 1: I've only yeah me there so I got a shit ton of points.

340
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:05,520
Speaker 1: Mmm, you know we could do though if I don't use them on packs Maybe we should just use them to go down to like Puerto Rico or something and like yes Let us go to a tropical place.

341
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:08,673
Speaker 0: No other reason then let's go to a tropical place.

342
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:14,580
Speaker 1: actually cuz I'm not the whole crew can do that But maybe like you made Emily's just do that like take a long weekend and just like pop down there use up all our miles.

343
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:15,883
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

344
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:18,800
Speaker 0: I'm actually I'm feeling that that's that's my idea.

345
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,060
Speaker 0: You're stealing my idea the idea that I keep saying and everyone else is me.

346
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:26,240
Speaker 0: Well, because not everyone every time every time it's like where do we go?

347
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaker 0: I'm like, let's go to a place where the water is blue Why not like this guy could do both and everyone's like meh and I'm like, what is wrong with you?

348
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,819
Speaker 0: Let's go to a place where the water is so clear that you can see the fishies.

349
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:42,576
Speaker 1: Part of well The thing is that the thing about going to the Jersey Shore is that the place of the water is black.

350
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:50,740
Speaker 1: that place but all Our friends can go because there isn't the barriers to entry of taking a bunch of time off work and or flying and or like.

351
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:55,660
Speaker 0: Let's go to a place where our anime will be anime of our lives will become island episodes.

352
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,791
Speaker 0: Let us go the island episode.

353
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:58,233
Speaker 1: We haven't.

354
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:59,460
Speaker 0: let us go to that place.

355
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:04,000
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm uh, I'm looking for an excuse to go back to Costa Rica cuz I want to visit Emily's family down there.

356
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,047
Speaker 0: Cuz what color the water they got?

357
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:10,797
Speaker 1: Uh, it's it's colorless cuz you can see all the way to the bottom Even when you swim way out there.

358
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's super except the only.

359
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,500
Speaker 1: the only drawback is if you go to give those beaches.

360
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:24,550
Speaker 1: The sand was so hot that if you tried to walk across the beach without sandals You would literally burn your feet to the point of blisters.

361
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,398
Speaker 0: I mean that happened even in Jersey.

362
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:33,120
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I remember running and feeling really bad about myself at Sandy Hook last year in the last trip we did.

363
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,240
Speaker 1: Also, I think I got a minor sinus infection from the bacteria in the water on our last Sandy Hook.

364
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,910
Speaker 1: So yeah, maybe some clear water might be a good idea.

365
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:41,533
Speaker 1: I don't have a problem.

366
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:43,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I swam a lot more than you.

367
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,500
Speaker 1: I also got a bunch of water at my nose cuz I kept swimming underwater.

368
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,166
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm just I'm feeling beaches.

369
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:50,431
Speaker 1: Maybe we should go to Sandy Hook this weekend.

370
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,037
Speaker 1: Mmm every weekend.

371
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:52,680
Speaker 1: Just keep going.

372
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,965
Speaker 0: It's a lot of money together.

373
00:25:54,145 --> 00:26:03,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still looking at Airbnb's - maybe we can go down to like Jersey Shore but further north and just rent a house and we don't have to deal with you know Restrictions or people.

374
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:04,349
Speaker 0: why don't we at least go to?

375
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:11,314
Speaker 1: I mean at least go to Virginia Beach, which is nice thing Yeah, but it's way easier to just rent a car and just drive down the Garden State like an hour.

376
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:11,455
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

377
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,271
Speaker 1: So you might recall we do our judge anime by its cover.

378
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:28,000
Speaker 1: when we do go to anime Boston and stay tuned We might just start doing that as a YouTube show because I think it's really good And I also like doing it and it's shockingly low effort because we're not even allowed to research the shows.

379
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:35,180
Speaker 1: But one of the shows we reviewed based on one screenshot and a few sentences was the eccentric family.

380
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,294
Speaker 1: And now we've both seen the entire first season.

381
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,340
Speaker 0: I've seen about half of this.

382
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,580
Speaker 0: I could have swore you I've watched this a long time ago, but I'm re-watching it now.

383
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:48,160
Speaker 0: I just finished re-watching the first season anyway, because season two just came out.

384
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,666
Speaker 1: Season two is real good.

385
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:55,520
Speaker 0: I haven't watched even any episodes of season two because yet just yesterday I finished re-watching season ones.

386
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,540
Speaker 0: I've seen the entirety of season one two times very and once very very recently as in yesterday.

387
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:07,240
Speaker 0: So and I could have swore we did an episode about this show after only watching a few episodes.

388
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:11,819
Speaker 0: But I guess you didn't find it doesn't matter because we're an eccentric doesn't even show up in the back end.

389
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:16,608
Speaker 0: search Yeah, and we definitely have not done An episode on it.

390
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:21,840
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure what happened is we might have completed We might have mentioned it like as we both watched a couple episodes.

391
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,372
Speaker 1: I think we just mentioned it in like the early part of an episode.

392
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,558
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and that's probably it.

393
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,060
Speaker 1: so Sport knows we'll we'll save spoilers to the end and we'll warn you.

394
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,653
Speaker 1: So don't worry because season one alone does not really deserve a like Full final thoughts cuz it's not like Trigun where there's a lot.

395
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:41,133
Speaker 0: There's not a lot to say even though It's got a lot of eccentricities.

396
00:27:41,153 --> 00:27:50,148
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, this is my favorite show of last season like hands down Sure, cuz one punch man came out before that.

397
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:50,730
Speaker 1: Yes, it did.

398
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,920
Speaker 1: Uh, oh do I like this more than one punch man?

399
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,222
Speaker 1: I feel like.

400
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,774
Speaker 0: well, no, this isn't even a show of 20 of the last season.

401
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:00,005
Speaker 0: This is a show from years ago 2015.

402
00:28:00,005 --> 00:28:00,447
Speaker 1: yeah, you're right.

403
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:00,708
Speaker 0: He's in.

404
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:02,899
Speaker 1: one is old season two is right now.

405
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I like this and here's neither season came out the same time.

406
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:12,356
Speaker 1: as one bunch I like this show and one punch man equally for very different reasons.

407
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,520
Speaker 0: No, I want one more.

408
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:15,607
Speaker 1: I think I like them equally.

409
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 0: he who punches only once yeah, but bent and Sama and whatever.

410
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:27,458
Speaker 1: so the gist of this show is that it's set in modern-day Kyoto and It's based on a novel.

411
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:36,236
Speaker 0: The first novel came out 2000 something 2007 and then that first season of the anime covers the first novel.

412
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:40,560
Speaker 0: but then Another novel a sequel novel came out much more recently.

413
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:45,200
Speaker 0: So then they once that novel came out they guess they went into production with another anime.

414
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,481
Speaker 0: There's

415
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,516
Speaker 1: also a manga which I haven't seen even one screenshot from yeah

416
00:28:49,501 --> 00:29:01,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it this seems like it's the kind of thing that was like made out of like, you know Just because and wouldn't be that popular but apparently was popular enough to like just make another anime.

417
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:06,223
Speaker 0: So well, I'm very happy that like people like this so much that they keep making more so.

418
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:20,780
Speaker 1: the gist of the story is that in modern-day Kyoto the beasts and creatures and mythology of Japan is Alive and well and it just continues to coexist alongside humans just like it did in ancient times, right?

419
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,525
Speaker 0: So there's a huge.

420
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:28,097
Speaker 0: the human society is perfectly normal But there's also like Tengu's and tanukis and these sorts of.

421
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:36,218
Speaker 0: you know Mystical things, you know and they're combined in the same place and it's sort of hard to tell right?

422
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,483
Speaker 0: is it's like on the one Hand?

423
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,259
Speaker 0: are these things?

424
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,584
Speaker 0: You know, is it like?

425
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,220
Speaker 0: do the people see these tonic ease and things?

426
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,640
Speaker 1: They definitely do occasionally because one of the a good a nice point of the show like a plot point.

427
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,318
Speaker 1: Is that one of the tonic II?

428
00:29:50,922 --> 00:30:04,120
Speaker 1: Him and his dad one of their favorite things to do was he would shape-shift Into a particular tram that runs into used to run in Kyoto Yep, and just careen down the street scaring the ever-living shit out of drunk people late at night, right?

429
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:16,455
Speaker 0: So it's weird because on the one hand people can obviously See human beings can obviously see and interact with the Tengu's and the tonic ease and things like that because sometimes the tender good Tengu and tanuki are fucking dangerous to those humans.

430
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:16,898
Speaker 0: Sure.

431
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:28,439
Speaker 0: But at the same time like when humans talk it's like they don't seem to know that like tonic ease Transform and like they think tonic ease are just animals in the woods

432
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:35,306
Speaker 1: which makes sense because you know to a modern person else you in less than a tonic II like Middle by transformed in humans

433
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:44,660
Speaker 0: are having a festival and is like boats flying in the sky That are clearly Visible and they don't seem to be reacting or giving a shit.

434
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,326
Speaker 1: The show sort of sets up that like.

435
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:52,551
Speaker 1: there's definitely this like liminal separation between the worlds because a lot of times Characters go to a place.

436
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:54,039
Speaker 1: That's like a it's not.

437
00:30:54,982 --> 00:31:03,518
Speaker 1: It's not a physical place in the same sense as like the rest of the area that they're in like they'll enter basically some sort Of like TARDIS like space all the time.

438
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:18,320
Speaker 0: But I just think it's really an interesting way of avoiding those sorts of questions like you know about the boundaries between the worlds By just sort of being like man, you know, we'll just we'll just do whatever is convenient scene to scene.

439
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,749
Speaker 1: It fits more with like.

440
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,380
Speaker 0: this is not sturdy pots.

441
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:30,769
Speaker 1: It fits more with my sensibility my understanding of like Japanese Sensibility toward mythology in that these are things that sort of exist on the edges of your perception Like you see something weird.

442
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,699
Speaker 1: Maybe that was a tonic II like you don't know.

443
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:36,971
Speaker 1: So it sort of fits into that like the humans who interact with these things.

444
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:43,208
Speaker 1: It is brief transient interactions that Startle or surprise them usually right?

445
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:46,780
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's called eccentric family and it's about this family of tanuki.

446
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they live in like a temple or whatever and they have powers to transform because they're tanuki.

447
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,406
Speaker 0: there You can do.

448
00:31:53,426 --> 00:31:57,091
Speaker 0: they're in the little cute animal form But they also can turn into many other forms.

449
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:59,060
Speaker 1: The cute animal form is super cute and different.

450
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:04,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, different different tanukis have different amounts and varieties of transformation power, right?

451
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,672
Speaker 0: So the oldest brother can transform into a tiger and fucking bite the hell out of you.

452
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:12,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he's way high strong Little bait.

453
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,714
Speaker 0: the kid who's you know, I guess he's elementary school age.

454
00:32:14,995 --> 00:32:18,164
Speaker 0: He isn't so good at transforming Electricity.

455
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, he has electricity powers.

456
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,558
Speaker 0: He can recharge his phone just wherever he is.

457
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:21,940
Speaker 1: season two.

458
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,217
Speaker 1: He keeps reading like books on Maxwell like he's gonna be dangerous someday.

459
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:25,760
Speaker 1: I think sure.

460
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:38,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, you have this family and the story is that their dad was like the best tonic II Into an entire fucking mountain to fool some Tengu who are super powerful.

461
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz Tengu are.

462
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:43,480
Speaker 1: Tengu are like one step below gods in this world.

463
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,460
Speaker 0: So this guy was basically like the legendary god tanuki and this is his wife and and his idiot for idiot son.

464
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,725
Speaker 1: And he's also an idiot.

465
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:52,086
Speaker 1: Sure.

466
00:32:52,106 --> 00:33:00,380
Speaker 0: You're all idiots as far as we can tell right, but this family especially Inherited the idiot blood from their godlike tanuki.

467
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:05,556
Speaker 1: He's a blood into four idiot types among his own combined his four children.

468
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:16,345
Speaker 0: you get him basically But you only have the four children left and they all have different aspects of him and the story mostly focuses on Isaburrow, yep.

469
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:19,800
Speaker 0: Oh, it's hard to remember all their names because they're all wide Japanese.

470
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,146
Speaker 1: I was the main kid and why?

471
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:34,300
Speaker 1: what I like the most is that and this sort of is a theme throughout the entire show It is very rare to see non-human characters in fiction who Legitimately are portrayed as having non-human sensibilities.

472
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:38,252
Speaker 1: Usually you see oh, it's animal people, but it's just people.

473
00:33:38,392 --> 00:34:02,720
Speaker 1: but like the way these characters interact with magic and death and The things around them is very clearly and very specifically Non-human like what happened like oh, yeah dad messed up and the Friday fellows Just cooked him and ate him in a hot pot and like yasaburo is friends with one of the people who murdered his dad and Ate him in a hot pot because that's just a thing that happens sometimes.

474
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:09,580
Speaker 1: and Then this is sort of exemplified in this character because he's sort of like a laid-back lazy.

475
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:23,087
Speaker 1: Like my only goal in life is to just get into trouble have an interesting life yep, but as so he just will randomly be a girl for no reason just because like he doesn't really care like gender doesn't really Mean much to him and he's a tonic.

476
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, he don't transform into whatever.

477
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:26,440
Speaker 1: That's just what he can do.

478
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:32,040
Speaker 0: But yeah, the thing that I like a lot about the show also is that you know, he's the main character, right?

479
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:40,599
Speaker 0: But usually in an anime a stereotypical generic average anime The main character will always be sort of the character that doesn't have any character.

480
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,139
Speaker 0: They'll be sort of just a generic.

481
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,284
Speaker 1: Why would a room?

482
00:34:43,525 --> 00:34:46,293
Speaker 1: Oh No is like the the perfect archetype.

483
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:53,380
Speaker 0: the main character is a generic Nobody and all the other characters are interesting and quirky and you care about them.

484
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:56,009
Speaker 0: But the main character is blessed a full metal Alchemist.

485
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:58,919
Speaker 0: right Edward Elric is kind of average adventure guy.

486
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:01,649
Speaker 1: But then you got King Bradley and you're like, what's his?

487
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,438
Speaker 0: do right, but all the other characters are really cool.

488
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,380
Speaker 0: or You know, what's another good example?

489
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:14,674
Speaker 1: Like almost any Rishi boyo almost milk toast boring, dude And everyone around him is like a crazy dangerous goddess.

490
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:22,600
Speaker 0: any mecha show The main pilot of the mech is boring generic person and all the other mech pilots and villains are totally awesome.

491
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:28,267
Speaker 0: So in this show, however There is no boring generic character.

492
00:35:28,368 --> 00:35:31,898
Speaker 0: right every character is wacky and crazy and interesting.

493
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:35,012
Speaker 0: So It's like you care about all of them, right?

494
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:36,480
Speaker 0: I care about this main character.

495
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:39,190
Speaker 0: Usually the main character is the person you care about the least.

496
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:43,847
Speaker 0: I can't say I care about the main character the most But there's no characters.

497
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:44,690
Speaker 0: I don't care about.

498
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,794
Speaker 0: there's no characters.

499
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,058
Speaker 0: Like I hate and want to go away.

500
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like they're all you know, even the annoying bad guy brothers with your kaku and king kaku.

501
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:57,732
Speaker 0: Normally they would be super annoying like oh my god, they're basically Starscream one and Starscream -.

502
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,560
Speaker 0: Normally you're like get the fuck out of here, but actually it's like, okay, they're kind of funny, you know, they're not the worst.

503
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,423
Speaker 1: I love all their sisters.

504
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,090
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, there's such pieces of shit.

505
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:11,705
Speaker 1: But then if anyone else calls them pieces of shit She's like, hey don't make fun of my brothers.

506
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,267
Speaker 0: That's right.

507
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,159
Speaker 1: but Non-human sensibilities so like the.

508
00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:30,087
Speaker 1: The gist of the show like the core of it really is that this family is partly blood relatives and partly just friends of the family like the old Tengu who threw his back out and can't really Tengu around so much anymore.

509
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:43,034
Speaker 1: and They face the same sort of Nuanced and complex problems that real families do except everything is sort of twisted with this Weird fantastic element like the one.

510
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:52,408
Speaker 1: brother is depressed But the way that expresses itself is that he transformed into a frog to sit in the bottom of a well because he's depressed and can't face the world anymore.

511
00:36:52,428 --> 00:37:00,653
Speaker 1: and yet he literally like forgets how to Unshift from being a frog and that is like a point of drama in the family.

512
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:07,799
Speaker 1: and the mom has like a deep phobia of Thunder and dad was murdered by these people who still live in the city and just hang out there.

513
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:21,040
Speaker 0: and There's kind of really complicated relationships with all the characters way more complicated than anything in Dune Yeah, and like even though you know, they have these sort of complicated relationships that are you know?

514
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,740
Speaker 0: It's like they just still like sort of hang out and talk to people.

515
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:24,362
Speaker 0: what's like.

516
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:27,714
Speaker 0: there was a. there was an episode where there's been ten.

517
00:37:27,774 --> 00:37:28,617
Speaker 0: who is the human?

518
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:36,420
Speaker 0: who a Human who is abducted by a Tengu and got Tengu powers and she's real danger and she's ridiculously powerful.

519
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,931
Speaker 0: And she seems like she's evil.

520
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:41,060
Speaker 0: and I just like she's so mysterious like what's her deal?

521
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,811
Speaker 0: You don't even know and they don't tell you explicitly.

522
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:48,060
Speaker 1: the show is all about this sort of like Incidental storytelling, right?

523
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:57,585
Speaker 0: But then there's a part where like you Saburo Runs out of town for like a year long period of time to run away from her because she's so mad at him Theoretically, he's afraid

524
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,630
Speaker 1: she's gonna just kill him and eat

525
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,066
Speaker 0: him and now when she finally catches him It's just sort of like man.

526
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,520
Speaker 0: It's sort of like this really tense scenes.

527
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,225
Speaker 0: It's a tense episode.

528
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:09,712
Speaker 0: Well, it's because we're like what's gonna happen here.

529
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,637
Speaker 1: I don't know these characters like.

530
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:12,560
Speaker 1: it's a world.

531
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,267
Speaker 1: It's a fantastical world.

532
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:20,556
Speaker 1: So some of the characters like the the Tengu even the old one are Real dangerous to be around.

533
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:30,318
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm like there's a moment where the Tengu goes on kind of a rampage later in season one and Like I feel like some of the people who are in those cars that were nearby might not have made it maybe

534
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:40,220
Speaker 0: But like they're just hanging out like, you know, there'll be ones like one minute They'll like be getting drunk with this dude and the next minute like they're running away from because he's so dangerous.

535
00:38:40,360 --> 00:39:02,929
Speaker 1: So the problems and like the relationships are very much non-human and mystical But at the same time they evoke all the feelings that real families have with the real family drama Like, you know, you've got your brother who's depressed and you've got your other brother who's like running for office But he kind of sucks at it and he needs you to help him But you don't want to because you're busy with your own stuff.

536
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,514
Speaker 1: and then your old the friend of the family grandpa Who's in love with this woman who's actually really bad for him and all that kind of stuff like it's.

537
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:16,060
Speaker 1: it's real family drama But it's a bunch of tonic II and Tengu and the family drama is all tonic II and Tengu drama.

538
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:27,139
Speaker 0: The only thing that makes me uncomfortable in this show is the arranged wedding to the cousin which I guess if you're a tonic II you can get with your cousin, but They're in human form and that's kind of gross.

539
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:30,086
Speaker 1: I don't think that's so bad.

540
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,075
Speaker 0: That's so that is cousin fucking.

541
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:36,565
Speaker 0: not so bad Books array, but it in the books.

542
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:43,487
Speaker 1: rim says cousin fucking not so bad is arranged cousin marriages and things like that are not that uncommon Even today around the world.

543
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,700
Speaker 0: I'm saying that's not a good thing Even though it's true.

544
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,518
Speaker 1: There was like a sideshow recently that was talking about how actually the danger of cousin is way low.

545
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:52,598
Speaker 1: rim.

546
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,576
Speaker 0: I guess rim has some hot cousins.

547
00:39:54,616 --> 00:40:02,906
Speaker 0: He's looking Also Who's in favor of cousin screwing?

548
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:03,387
Speaker 0: Not Scott?

549
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:08,480
Speaker 1: I point out a big part of that anti cousin romance the eccentric family.

550
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:27,832
Speaker 1: You know the the the shimo gamo family that we're talking about is like the the known idiot branch of like the greater family and their related family the Ebisugawa who are all they're like the more noble like they have real jobs and things family and there's sort of this weird fighting family Rivalry like.

551
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:34,860
Speaker 1: they're two Important bloodlines that are tied in ancient times and that was like an arranged marriage to combine them again.

552
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:39,277
Speaker 1: But then it broke up because the father was dead and there's a whole bunch of plot around that too.

553
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,992
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I liked out the girl cow.

554
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:43,280
Speaker 1: Oh, what's her name?

555
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,131
Speaker 1: There's just so the girl who was a cousin.

556
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:52,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, who was pledged to be married to ya Saburo Won't let him see her.

557
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:53,048
Speaker 0: Yeah.

558
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:56,300
Speaker 1: He has never seen what she looks like and there's some great scenes.

559
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:03,268
Speaker 1: We're like, they're in a bathhouse like on opposite sides yelling at each other and fighting But she won't let him see her at any point.

560
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:04,712
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but they're still friends.

561
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:12,820
Speaker 1: Like everyone's even the enemies are relatively friendly Except where there's a few points where there are some enemies who are not friendly.

562
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,192
Speaker 0: But that's right and they can go from being friendly to like.

563
00:41:17,212 --> 00:41:19,980
Speaker 0: is this huge range of interactions between?

564
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,894
Speaker 1: Characters cousin marriage are legal and considered totally normal in Japan.

565
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:32,300
Speaker 0: in quotes in the chat great Sure, that's that rims moving to Japan to get with this Japanese cousin.

566
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,674
Speaker 1: But uh Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything cuz I mean the.

567
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:39,680
Speaker 1: really this is a review, right?

568
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,666
Speaker 1: You should just watch this show.

569
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,233
Speaker 1: It is one of the best anime to come out.

570
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:47,227
Speaker 0: Not only is the show Good enough to be worth watching.

571
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,154
Speaker 0: I won't put it as a plus anime.

572
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,600
Speaker 0: I'll just put it as a anime.

573
00:41:50,982 --> 00:42:03,040
Speaker 0: It's not a legendary all-time show, but not only is it so great It's not animated like in a special way It's just well animated like the arts and the character designs especially are so good.

574
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:09,180
Speaker 0: You know between all the different forms the katana keys take and things like that and people are wearing different clothes and different scenes.

575
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,762
Speaker 0: It's like y'all.

576
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,447
Speaker 0: they put effort into this thing, right?

577
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:12,290
Speaker 0: It's never like.

578
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,320
Speaker 0: there aren't a lot of garbage animation mistakes and things.

579
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:21,020
Speaker 1: All those scenes were like Benton is dragging that one drunk guy around on the roofs.

580
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,561
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

581
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,751
Speaker 1: they're all just deeply Japanese and beautiful.

582
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,940
Speaker 1: and if you've been to Kyoto it that is Kyoto like one.

583
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:30,260
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, everything is just taken from actual real.

584
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:37,899
Speaker 1: No, like a lot of the places you see in the show like we've been there Yep, but the number one reason to watch this show is simply that it's unique.

585
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,877
Speaker 0: There's no animes like this besides this one that I can think of.

586
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:42,580
Speaker 1: not that we're good.

587
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:48,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the only anime that is like this and that alone makes it worth watching even if it were bad.

588
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:50,140
Speaker 0: But guess what is good?

589
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:51,244
Speaker 0: So watch it.

590
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:55,500
Speaker 1: and season two is on crunchyroll and season one was re-added to crunchyroll.

591
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:56,344
Speaker 1: So you can get.

592
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:59,479
Speaker 0: season one was temporarily removed from crunchyroll, but now is back.

593
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:04,199
Speaker 1: So one annoyance though, they changed the translation direction in season two.

594
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:04,802
Speaker 1: Oh real.

595
00:43:04,842 --> 00:43:07,873
Speaker 1: so they so like in season one the their dad.

596
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,945
Speaker 1: he had a title that nice a Mon Yep in season two.

597
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:15,419
Speaker 1: They actually just translate that literally to what to like tricksters I forget already.

598
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:26,090
Speaker 1: But it's like there's a set of Japanese terms that are translated literally and a set that are translated That are not translated and you just get like these Japanese.

599
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,572
Speaker 0: I mean philosophically it should be Translating to English, right?

600
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:36,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in season two They saw that you're just used to seeing nice a Mon because they did a bad job in season one.

601
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now you don't know what they're saying.

602
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:44,960
Speaker 1: in season two Some words that were translated are now not and some words that were not translated are now translated.

603
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:49,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they also they'd stop calling the Friday fellows and call him the Friday Club.

604
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:53,411
Speaker 0: I Think actually I remember Friday Club seems closer.

605
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,359
Speaker 0: Well, no, I remember hearing with my ear.

606
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:59,860
Speaker 0: So yeah, the word club boo as someone was talking.

607
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:03,577
Speaker 0: So, I don't know where the Friday fellows part came from.

608
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:08,780
Speaker 1: Yeah I also really wonder what their deal is cuz it seems like it's just a bunch of schlubby humans.

609
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:13,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like that's the one scary old guy except for the scary old guy who seems to have some kind of power.

610
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:26,849
Speaker 0: It seems like it's just a you know a human meetup group that no different than like anything else on meetup.com like it's just some people who hang out and Making a hotpot once a year is just a thing they do and they don't have any sort of well

611
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:37,074
Speaker 1: Like when yasaburo is sort of trip forced or tricked into performing for them and he does a bunch of transformations And they don't seem to really understand that.

612
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,340
Speaker 1: that's legit real magic.

613
00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:39,547
Speaker 0: No, well the get.

614
00:44:39,587 --> 00:44:44,719
Speaker 0: then again, the old guy wasn't there at that time true The old guy who seems to know anything so besides Benton.

615
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:49,152
Speaker 1: Uh, the one thing I can say about that old guy is I noticed something.

616
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:56,964
Speaker 1: that old guy is the only person I have ever seen Benton in any way Respect.

617
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:01,140
Speaker 1: Yep, which implies that he is way dangerous.

618
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:11,220
Speaker 0: He definitely was the only person in the show Character in the show where you're like, whoa, that dude is actually evil bad guy or at least like dangerous.

619
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:13,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, like watch out for him.

620
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:17,847
Speaker 1: But you know, I keep saying subtle but the show is super subtle in that It has.

621
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,760
Speaker 1: it has a lot of really big funny moments and everything.

622
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:27,800
Speaker 1: It's just a great show all around but so much of the story and so much of the nuance is just sort of Like the show doesn't come out and tell you thing.

623
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:33,340
Speaker 0: Everything in the show is completely unspoken for anything that matters is like not said out loud.

624
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,652
Speaker 0: You know it just you have to watch it to understand and show.

625
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,375
Speaker 0: but it's not like.

626
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:40,240
Speaker 0: it's like easier to follow than like utenna.

627
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's they don't.

628
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:42,727
Speaker 0: no one says.

629
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:47,280
Speaker 1: but utenna is like allegorical and obtuse on purpose to make these meta points.

630
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,546
Speaker 1: This show is just.

631
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:51,079
Speaker 1: it trusts you to be paying attention while you're watching it.

632
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,020
Speaker 1: Because if you pay attention you can figure out a good chunk of Benton's backstory.

633
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:58,212
Speaker 1: You can figure out a lot about why the family's the way it is.

634
00:45:58,694 --> 00:46:03,709
Speaker 1: and I just really like Media that respect the audience to figure shit out on their own.

635
00:46:04,371 --> 00:46:09,747
Speaker 1: and especially because the stuff you can figure out isn't super important You can enjoy it Even if you don't notice those.

636
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:14,262
Speaker 0: and knowing that it was originally novels I would really like for the novels to be Translated.

637
00:46:14,282 --> 00:46:16,530
Speaker 0: a lot of stuff is always like light novels and like.

638
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:20,265
Speaker 0: I have no interest in those but like actual novel I want to read dead.

639
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:25,328
Speaker 1: So briefly I will say that not only the show great But I've watched half of season two.

640
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,075
Speaker 1: It is also great.

641
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:28,400
Speaker 0: It just keeps me sure it is.

642
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:42,860
Speaker 1: I've never watched any season two though season two has a lot more serious dangerous stuff a lot of jikoku like hell and Love me some hell and all sorts of nonsense starts appearing at a call doom guy get your hell problem.

643
00:46:43,202 --> 00:46:44,349
Speaker 1: Oh my god rock us.

644
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,677
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say no spoilers.

645
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:45,858
Speaker 1: here.

646
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:49,772
Speaker 1: a character Ends up in hell.

647
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:54,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Hell is great, of course it is.

648
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:56,280
Speaker 1: hell is like super great.

649
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:00,667
Speaker 1: Of course, I can't key taro's hanging out down there But you see the hell stuff it is.

650
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:03,760
Speaker 1: it is exactly what you Scott want it to be.

651
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:09,373
Speaker 0: It is so perfect demons dancing and having a good time that are all freaky Yeah, but also like no.

652
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,420
Speaker 1: seriously, this is hell.

653
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,505
Speaker 1: This is a good place.

654
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:13,896
Speaker 0: real bad people getting set on fire because they were so bad.

655
00:47:13,936 --> 00:47:14,478
Speaker 0: They deserve it.

656
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:19,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but maybe not everyone there deserves also Satan's a total badass who loves metal.

657
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:24,121
Speaker 1: So, I guess That's it Like.

658
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:29,990
Speaker 1: we're gonna talk to a few spoilers because I don't want to talk about some like the whole season so you can come back After you've seen the show, so I don't know.

659
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,996
Speaker 0: I don't really have anything else to say.

660
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:31,540
Speaker 0: we want to spoil.

661
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:32,679
Speaker 1: All right, I won't spoil it.

662
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,064
Speaker 0: We already spoil some stuff.

663
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:48,156
Speaker 1: my favorite scene in season one is there's a trope that you've seen in some movies and TV shows but you know the trope where there's a bunch of characters with a bunch of plots and then They all end up in the same restaurant.

664
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:48,940
Speaker 0: You mean like snatch?

665
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:57,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, like snatch where everyone just happens to be in the same place at the same time when the car accident happened and then Everyone realizes what's going on and all hell breaks loose.

666
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:05,743
Speaker 1: That's kind of how season one ends and the scene with a bunch of tanuki Scattering.

667
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:08,320
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm is one of the funniest things I've seen.

668
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,951
Speaker 0: We can make all the hot pods we want like that scene.

669
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:15,040
Speaker 1: I was laughing so hard during that scene.

670
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:16,344
Speaker 1: I like.

671
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:22,365
Speaker 1: I guess it's get like how when you like you watch a lot of anime that aren't that great you kind of forget What a great anime is like.

672
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:26,400
Speaker 1: and then you see a great anime again like when we were watching a bunch of crappy shows.

673
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just watching like generic your pedal, which I'm not gonna stop watching.

674
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:30,896
Speaker 1: It's good, but it's not.

675
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,743
Speaker 0: it's not something That's memorable.

676
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:38,970
Speaker 1: watching cuz there's bikes in but then you watch like a random episode of Ava and you're like, oh shit Right and real anime exists.

677
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:39,594
Speaker 0: It's out there.

678
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:40,840
Speaker 0: Just doesn't come around too often.

679
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:46,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're looking for some great anime to watch you should watch eccentric family.

680
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,006
Speaker 1: It is so good.

681
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:50,577
Speaker 0: My favorite scene and part is the bathhouse.

682
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:51,280
Speaker 0: There's a whole episode.

683
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a whole episode in a bathhouse and it's awesome.

684
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,947
Speaker 0: There's so much going on in that one.

685
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:59,939
Speaker 0: like almost most of the episode happens just in the bathhouse.

686
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:04,100
Speaker 0: There's that iron underwear that they had and they keep the iron underwear going.

687
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, all this stuff keeps coming back.

688
00:49:06,562 --> 00:49:08,289
Speaker 1: You two pieces of shit you not on.

689
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:10,759
Speaker 1: did you not realize the failure of your underwear plan?

690
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:16,060
Speaker 0: the Fujin Raijin fan from the very beginning of the show comes back at the end of the show, right?

691
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,830
Speaker 1: There's also this song that'll play in the back cuz it does pretty good soundtrack.

692
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,262
Speaker 1: Like it's kind of nondescript doo doo doo doo doo That one.

693
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:36,948
Speaker 1: but no there's there's the one that's kind of jazzy that whenever it starts Shenanigans are about to follow and it's gonna be the tonic use fault Mmm, and that song you start to recognize it.

694
00:49:36,968 --> 00:49:38,133
Speaker 1: cuz the season do they keep that up.

695
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:40,120
Speaker 1: stuff will be serious serious.

696
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,166
Speaker 1: And then the song starts playing.

697
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:45,356
Speaker 1: and the next thing, you know tonic explosion tonic everywhere.

698
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:50,244
Speaker 1: Mmm say I watch the show and Don't let the drunk.

699
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:58,938
Speaker 1: old Tengu drink all the port wine if the tea kettle that's letting your flying ship continue to fly Also needs port wine to keep flying.

700
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:00,605
Speaker 1: That is like the moral.

701
00:50:00,866 --> 00:50:02,030
Speaker 0: they just bring more.

702
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,720
Speaker 1: part one they did and he drunk it.

703
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:12,102
Speaker 1: No You notice they had another box that was like behind a bunch of stuff and there's a shot where you see that that box is Also all drunk.

704
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:15,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they could have just brought yet another box.

705
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:20,400
Speaker 1: I get another but I think they brought twice as much as They needed three times as much.

706
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,966
Speaker 1: Like I feel like that.

707
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:24,310
Speaker 1: Tengu could literally drink.

708
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,497
Speaker 0: also, why is that guy hooked on port so much?

709
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:27,320
Speaker 0: doesn't he like anything?

710
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:35,400
Speaker 0: Well, he also likes us really really really long cigars Mmm, I mean if you're a Tengu fine, it's not gonna hurt you, right?

711
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:39,860
Speaker 0: If I and if I was some sort of mystical being I'd be doing all kinds of dangerous drugs and shit.

712
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,262
Speaker 0: I also enjoy the joy the sort of subtext that yes Alvaro is definitely like if I see someone smoking and I say man That's gross.

713
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:46,744
Speaker 0: Stop that shit.

714
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:50,360
Speaker 0: You're poisoning yourself to death and say actually no, I'm magical and this doesn't hurt me at all.

715
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,826
Speaker 0: I would say damn I'm jealous.

716
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:52,809
Speaker 0: I would do that if I were you.

717
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:55,439
Speaker 1: but that cigar is like more than a foot long.

718
00:50:56,082 --> 00:51:03,456
Speaker 1: Listen if I saw someone who looked like him smoking a cigar that was a foot long I would I'd be more impressed than angry.

719
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:04,099
Speaker 1: Mmm.

720
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:10,155
Speaker 1: But I do also like the sort of really complex relationship specifically between the main character.

721
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:14,947
Speaker 1: Yes, Alvaro and Benton because He's afraid of her.

722
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:16,292
Speaker 0: She's dangerous.

723
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,199
Speaker 1: He's also kind of in love with her.

724
00:51:18,821 --> 00:51:26,844
Speaker 1: He's also trying to like understand her and those are three different threads going on in his character And they don't resolve.

725
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:33,112
Speaker 1: they just continue to increase the tension that he has around her and season two keeps that going in a big way.
