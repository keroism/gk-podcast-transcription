Speaker 0: Usually I jump all on you for doing that wrong.

28
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,193
Speaker 0: I apologize.

29
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:36,593
Speaker 0: Anyway, I was incorrect.

00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:41,439
Speaker 1: October 18 1920 Burning con.

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,409
Speaker 1: 2013 the pentec logon.

32
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:45,351
Speaker 0: you still buy tickets.

33
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:46,354
Speaker 1: I don't know.

34
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,180
Speaker 0: I still got to submit my game.

35
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,420
Speaker 1: Yep, I might miss Saturday.

36
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:52,384
Speaker 0: What?

37
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,492
Speaker 1: there is a netrunner tournament?

38
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,094
Speaker 1: Really?

39
00:01:55,234 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaker 1: No, okay, so Normally I would be like netrunner tournament.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,993
Speaker 1: There's like two netrunner tournaments and one and there's one burning con a year.

41
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:05,920
Speaker 0: So Saturday is the heavy-hitting day.

42
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,759
Speaker 1: Why why would I skip the heavy-hitting day of burning con?

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Speaker 1: For a netrunner tournament of which there are two a month when there is only one burning con a year?

44
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,091
Speaker 1: that is just fucking stupid.

45
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:22,117
Speaker 1: right and Normally, I would but this isn't just any netrunner tournament.

46
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:22,720
Speaker 0: Okay?

47
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:27,160
Speaker 1: This is the netrunner plugged in tour.

48
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:29,626
Speaker 1: They're basically the fantasy flight.

49
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:44,079
Speaker 1: peoples are traveling around the country to only a handful of places to run basically super netrunner tournaments between October 4th, so November 3rd netrunner tournament from a regular one.

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:49,834
Speaker 1: Basically, the official dudes are gonna be there and it's all super serious business and they're giving away.

51
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,980
Speaker 1: I don't care about the sweat rare cards.

52
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,655
Speaker 1: No, it's just swag like play mats and stuff.

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,520
Speaker 1: I don't care about that shit.

54
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,354
Speaker 1: okay, but if you go to one of these you can vote.

55
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:14,456
Speaker 1: there's two runners and You vote on which one you want to be real and then whichever one wins all the voting and it's only voting by people at These tournaments will become an actual runner card and the other one will be forever.

56
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,090
Speaker 0: D rezzed great So rainbow - is gonna be the next row.

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,913
Speaker 1: No, it's this.

58
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,419
Speaker 1: the two choices are right.

59
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,935
Speaker 1: here There's the collective and there's Laramie Fisk.

60
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:24,940
Speaker 0: I vote for Laramie Fisk.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,632
Speaker 1: I also vote for Laramie Fisk simply because he's not only better in every way.

62
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,778
Speaker 0: He's better in one way his name.

63
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:35,200
Speaker 1: Yeah He's a criminal and we got the other ones a shaper and we have plenty of shapers.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:48,575
Speaker 1: So the collective what that one does is this the first time you perform the same action three times in a row each turn Gain a click which is pretty powerful because like if you're running a magnum opus with those guys You could just be like magnum

65
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:48,938
Speaker 0: magnum

66
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,240
Speaker 1: magnum

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,341
Speaker 0: Magnum

68
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,185
Speaker 1: exactly,

69
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:51,908
Speaker 0: but

70
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,826
Speaker 1: their minimum deck size is 55.

71
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,915
Speaker 0: well 50 I thought you were gonna say 50.

72
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,080
Speaker 1: No, it's big 50.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Speaker 1: They have to have a big deck and their influence is 5.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,458
Speaker 1: So it's pretty much shape for cards and more shape for cards and not gonna play with ya Laramie Fisk.

75
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:24,165
Speaker 1: He's normal He's a criminal 4515 normal numbers and it says the first time you make a successful run on a central server each turn You may force the corp to draw one card When their hand is full.

76
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,411
Speaker 1: with five cards you run HQ.

77
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:27,253
Speaker 1: you take a look.

78
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,680
Speaker 1: see maybe with a nerve agent or an HQ interface.

79
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:37,400
Speaker 1: Then if they still have five cards, you know now they've got six and then their turn starts and they draw another one.

80
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:42,952
Speaker 1: now they got seven and They're gonna have to throw something out or use it all or something.

81
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,340
Speaker 1: and so run HQ again with your HQ interface.

82
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,264
Speaker 0: Scott Point.

83
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,159
Speaker 0: the first it's not Tuesday It's Monday.

84
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,303
Speaker 1: All right point.

85
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:56,540
Speaker 0: the second you always give me shit for talking about this shit in the non meta moment section of the show.

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,084
Speaker 0: That's true.

87
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:57,829
Speaker 0: So what gives?

88
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:01,085
Speaker 1: it's an intentional Back attack up.

89
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,776
Speaker 0: So you realize all you have done is given me carte blanche.

90
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:07,286
Speaker 0: No You legitimize me Scott.

91
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:07,828
Speaker 0: Not at all.

92
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:12,595
Speaker 0: And if you and Emily have learned anything about me, it's that legitimizing Me is the last thing you want to do.

93
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,466
Speaker 1: Did you right?

94
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:17,540
Speaker 1: did not try to shut me down.

95
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:22,536
Speaker 0: I let you talk for almost five minutes about netrunner.

96
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,723
Speaker 0: Yeah Monday show But you're.

97
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,070
Speaker 0: you have noted that it was not good.

98
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,700
Speaker 0: Have you not so are you so therefore or not?

99
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,246
Speaker 1: If my netrunner talk was no good Then also all your talks are no good.

100
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,710
Speaker 0: only meta talks.

101
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,960
Speaker 1: in the pre meta all your talks are belong to crap.

102
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,285
Speaker 0: So Up on new video card.

103
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:45,350
Speaker 0: about time.

104
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,225
Speaker 0: I've been rocking a GTX 260.

105
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 1: That's not a bad card that can play a lot of games.

106
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,968
Speaker 1: What game what game out today.

107
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,160
Speaker 1: counter-strike go needs a better card than counter-strike go.

108
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,392
Speaker 1: How does counter-strike go not run at full frames of the 260 Scott?

109
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,999
Speaker 0: It doesn't really.

110
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,969
Speaker 0: yeah No, so actually it will run at full frames.

111
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,932
Speaker 1: It's not full quality.

112
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:09,200
Speaker 0: by cutting your draw distance big deal.

113
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:18,677
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand how narrow My draw distance is between my body and what I can hit in pretty much any map.

114
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,830
Speaker 0: if there's a window And I want to snipe in that window.

115
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,000
Speaker 0: I cannot see beyond the window.

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,550
Speaker 0: Sometimes I can't even see the window.

117
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,100
Speaker 1: that sounds more like reflections than draw distance.

118
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,429
Speaker 1: No window in behind the window either.

119
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:32,071
Speaker 1: So just shoot.

120
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,673
Speaker 1: It's a window.

121
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,500
Speaker 0: There might not be someone there.

122
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,600
Speaker 1: So you wasted some bullets?

123
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,252
Speaker 0: Also the windows big and I can't see where to shoot it is.

124
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,088
Speaker 0: having a 260 has Significantly impacted my ability to win.

125
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,034
Speaker 1: you get a gun that fucking zooms.

126
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it zooms into nothing.

127
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:51,634
Speaker 0: You can't see player models that far away if there's no window.

128
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,320
Speaker 0: I can't see if there's a person.

129
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,054
Speaker 1: So so if there is a person there he kills you and you can't even see him.

130
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,200
Speaker 1: Yes, that sucks.

131
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,690
Speaker 0: Yes, the GTX 260 is too old.

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,051
Speaker 1: What do you just turn down like the texture qualities and increase the other?

133
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,038
Speaker 0: you can't control the draw distance.

134
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,868
Speaker 0: as far as I can Tell it's all dynamic.

135
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:13,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, also details Disappear to a surprising degree and they do it so well that you don't notice it.

136
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,345
Speaker 0: But if you're paying attention at all, like you're running and suddenly a tree like all these leaves appear on it Oh my my 680.

137
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,289
Speaker 1: don't know what that's like.

138
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what.

139
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,340
Speaker 0: my 770 didn't cost that much.

140
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,696
Speaker 1: No, it didn't fry for the my 680 by a lot, but Adobe will just recognize Adobe.

141
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,458
Speaker 0: You'll have recognized 770 now.

142
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,489
Speaker 1: Good yeah, in fact, I got their fucking shit together asshole.

143
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,337
Speaker 0: I got Adobe to recognize my 260.

144
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,260
Speaker 1: nice doesn't work.

145
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,704

00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,475
Speaker 1: one Photoshop related news.

158
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:12,665
Speaker 1: They now have creative cloud Photographer Edition.

159
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,614
Speaker 1: you pay ten bucks a month.

160
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:15,800
Speaker 1: I think there's a limited time deal.

161
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,175
Speaker 1: So if you want it get it right away.

162
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:21,617
Speaker 0: You said they have no plans to raise the price in the foreseeable future.

163
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:22,018
Speaker 1: That's good.

164
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 0: granted We know that Adobe can finish saying what the hell this is about exactly one year.

165
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,288
Speaker 1: Ten bucks a month.

166
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:35,533
Speaker 1: you get the full Photoshop the real deal and The full Lightroom the real deal with perfect upgrades forever.

167
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:45,053
Speaker 1: Just like all the other creative cloud stuff Yep, and you get some other stuff like a Behance account and all that stuff You don't gonna use and it's only ten bucks a month now.

168
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,860
Speaker 1: That's a hundred and twenty dollars a year.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,565
Speaker 1: This is for the real Photoshop.

170
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:52,940
Speaker 1: This finally a reasonable price for a big expensive software.

171
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,166
Speaker 1: This has never happened before.

172
00:08:54,186 --> 00:09:01,540
Speaker 0: it's huge for another reason to the biggest complaint That was semi legitimate against creative cloud because most people complaining are morons.

173
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,760
Speaker 0: They don't realize that paying that monthly fee is actually way less than buying the full editions all the time.

174
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:11,380
Speaker 1: Well, it's only cheaper if you upgrade all the time.

175
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:16,260
Speaker 1: If you never if you buy the full creative suite and never up ever then you're better off doing that.

176
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:17,704
Speaker 1: No I'm the creator only.

177
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:24,687
Speaker 0: you were only better off if you bought one of those limited subsets because you didn't use the rest of it To buy everything everything the master suite.

178
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was expensive.

179
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:29,985
Speaker 0: Yep, but like a production premium Yeah, I could have gotten away.

180
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:44,809
Speaker 0: I was just keeping my cs4 anyway, but anyway, the biggest legitimate complaint was that Photoshop is special in that there's a huge huge number of people whose profession is photography or who are Serious photography hobbyist.

181
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,060
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people the only goddamn thing they need is photo.

182
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:52,840
Speaker 1: Need all that That Photoshop is used more than all those other things combined.

183
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,000
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use more than one Adobe thing.

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,360
Speaker 0: You probably use like five or ten Adobe things or you just use Photoshop and Lightroom.

185
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,721
Speaker 1: Yeah, even most people use Photoshop not even Lightroom I know.

186
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:12,439
Speaker 0: but now just like how with creative cloud suddenly people started using Adobe They normally didn't use like I started using in design and illustrator because before I didn't have it.

187
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,738
Speaker 1: But now what I learned, you know typekit where all the fonts come from.

188
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:22,800
Speaker 1: Yeah Creative cloud the one we pay for actually includes a very high class typekit account.

189
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:25,380
Speaker 1: I thought I had to pay for those fonts and it was just an integrated thing.

190
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:33,722
Speaker 1: I already paid for those fonts without even knowing Yeah I can just go get fonts and use them all I want and if I use them on a website I can do That too.

191
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,353
Speaker 1: as long as I don't the website doesn't get a fuck ton of traffic.

192
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,260
Speaker 1: and then I had to pay a little bit of money.

193
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:44,748
Speaker 1: But as long as the website just doesn't get crazy traffic I can use those fonts on a website Or anything I want.

194
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,140
Speaker 0: so you you implied that there was another piece to your news.

195
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:50,513
Speaker 1: Alright, so the second piece Photoshop added a feature today.

196
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,260
Speaker 1: That is incredibly interesting.

197
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,330
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people out there, you know Photoshop is.

198
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,814
Speaker 1: it is a tool of many uses.

199
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,480
Speaker 1: many uses not intended, right?

200
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,919
Speaker 1: It was originally intended for photo editing Yep.

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,077
Speaker 1: And now people use it for three like in every raster image any any imaging thing period.

202
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,120
Speaker 1: they use Photoshop, right?

203
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:16,947
Speaker 1: One thing people use Photoshop for is to draw websites and they basically draw a picture of a website and then cut it up into Pieces and make a website.

204
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,910
Speaker 0: I'm gonna flash back to the year 2000.

205
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,195
Speaker 0: Yeah I was at RIT and we're going to.

206
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:26,128
Speaker 0: I'm taking my Intro to new media class and they're like make a website.

207
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,684
Speaker 0: and they told us and they gave us the software to draw it But not in Photoshop.

208
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:43,020
Speaker 0: They were like the noobs would use Photoshop for this but your pros we got to use fireworks Which is dead now fireworks 3.0 right alongside Macromedia director, right?

209
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,900
Speaker 1: So anyway, the new feature they added to Photoshop was basically sort of what Microsoft is an Excel move, right?

210
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,494
Speaker 1: Excel people like Microsoft is like you're gonna use Excel for that fine.

211
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,819
Speaker 1: We'll help you out and make that better.

212
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:55,876
Speaker 1: So Adobe is basically fine.

213
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:01,037
Speaker 1: You want to use Photoshop to draw websites and not use all this edge and stuff that we made for you.

214
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:01,137
Speaker 1: fine.

215
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,160
Speaker 1: Here's this feature.

216
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,960
Speaker 1: So what the feature is this you draw a website you keep all the pieces of the website in different layers, right?

217
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,328
Speaker 1: And you tell it hey Photoshop.

218
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,373
Speaker 1: I'm drawing a website.

219
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:14,333
Speaker 1: Yo, it says alright, bro I got you.

220
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 1: every layer is then turned into a JPEG GIF or ping and put into a folder and It's constantly updated.

221
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:29,740
Speaker 1: So as you edit the layer It'll update the JPEG the GIF or the ping in that folder so that you can just go reload.

222
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,180
Speaker 1: You can edit the Photoshop reload your website edit the Photoshop reload the website.

223
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,669
Speaker 1: That's on your local machine until it looks right.

224
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,760
Speaker 0: that is actually, you know, I'm not gonna make fun of it.

225
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:42,340
Speaker 0: It's an excellent example of use case driven design philosophy.

226
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,272
Speaker 1: That is a crazy good feature.

227
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:48,569
Speaker 1: if you're making websites and photo Yeah That efficiency gain you get from that feature.

228
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,599
Speaker 0: zoom out a little bit off the hook when people make software.

229
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,380
Speaker 0: in general Way too many people for websites for software design for everything.

230
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:00,166
Speaker 0: They have a vision of what their things should be used Yeah, and they strive toward that.

231
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:04,500
Speaker 0: no look at what people actually try to do and make that easier.

232
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like think about what the workflow was before it was going to Photoshop.

233
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:16,221
Speaker 1: Yeah Edit a bunch of stuff Cut a piece out save it in a separate folder and every time you wanted to cut a piece out save it in a separate Folder.

234
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,425
Speaker 1: now, it's just always.

235
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,730
Speaker 1: maybe you were checking.

236
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,413
Speaker 1: There's no cutting.

237
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:20,718
Speaker 1: There's no cutting none.

238
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:28,137
Speaker 1: No cutting other than the layers which you should be just automatic is it's automatically a full a folder full of files.

239
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:33,079
Speaker 1: automatic not bad It's gonna save people like hours a day who do this stuff.

240
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:43,360
Speaker 0: if Except some of the people who should use that kind of feature the ones who won't or they don't know about it yet because it's Only in the newest newest Photoshop people have 3 and refused to upgrade.

241
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only in the creative cloud Photoshop if you pay for the you know $10 or the more dollars.

242
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:52,719
Speaker 0: so in all this talk about the NSA and encryption.

243
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,889
Speaker 1: and Have we not talked about this enough?

244
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,260
Speaker 1: We've been talking about this since forever.

245
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,332
Speaker 0: Oh, well one we haven't talked about it that much.

246
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:05,235
Speaker 1: on geek nights did a whole episode Multiple episodes on privacy and encryption and security.

247
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't talk about the NSA stuff.

248
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:16,993
Speaker 0: but in all of that it seems like people talk about bitcoins a lot too and My news is to remind you that they're not that related.

249
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,520
Speaker 0: no bitcoins are not anonymous.

250
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,299
Speaker 0: No guys, they're not.

251
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,793
Speaker 0: They're pseudo anonymous.

252
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,947
Speaker 0: They're Intrinsic is the word you should use.

253
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:33,652
Speaker 0: but they are not anonymous because there's the thing called a blockchain Which is how the whole goddamn thing works.

254
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:40,899
Speaker 0: So this researcher took a Bitcoin Analyzed his blockchain and it was like right there.

255
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:53,179
Speaker 0: That's where the guy bought drugs on Silk Road and figured out how you can basically track what people have done with bitcoins And there's a good chance you could track the actual person that did the transaction if you really wanted to.

256
00:14:53,846 --> 00:15:00,416
Speaker 0: Okay now People could take steps to a doubly triply anonymize and use services and everything.

257
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:09,798
Speaker 0: But the fact remains that Bitcoins primary use is not that it's anonymous It's that it's intrinsic and you can use it without trusting the other person you're doing business with.

258
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:13,560
Speaker 0: Mmm It's almost like a cash escrow except the cash is all virtual.

259
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:19,560
Speaker 0: So if you think you can use bitcoins to do anonymous shady stuff, I recommend you read this article.

260
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,409
Speaker 0: I got one more little news.

261
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,112
Speaker 0: That one was little.

262
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:27,680
Speaker 0: so, uh There I heard there's a lot of sexism in the universe.

263
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,289
Speaker 0: In the tech industry in particular.

264
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,660
Speaker 1: there's a high concentration of it in that particular place.

265
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,847
Speaker 1: That's sort of where it comes from these days.

266
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:41,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, it pretty much comes from the MRA subreddit and from the tech industry, but So those aren't the same thing.

267
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:47,260
Speaker 0: And I don't think a lot of people who post to MRA actually made it to the tech industry.

268
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,753
Speaker 0: I think they're wishing they could be in the tech industry, but haven't actually quite gotten there.

269
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:57,549
Speaker 1: They get closer to their to their Mecca but Some people, two dudes.

270
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,699
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I have their names here from Sydney.

271
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,564
Speaker 1: Uh, JethroBots Great name.

272
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:04,768
Speaker 0: David Bolton.

273
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,451
Speaker 1: Okay.

274
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,197
Speaker 0: At a TechCrunch event.

275
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,742
Speaker 1: Oh Great.

276
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:09,344
Speaker 1: Yeah.

277
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,712
Speaker 1: Already this is looking worse and worse every second.

278
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:11,973
Speaker 1: Yup.

279
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:15,420
Speaker 1: Disrupt, which is a hackathon It's it's pretty much the worst thing ever.

280
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,980
Speaker 0: They presented their joke app and it was supposed to be a joke and their joke app was TitStare.

281
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,860
Speaker 1: Wow great job guys, that's gonna win them over.

282
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:31,741
Speaker 0: Yeah It was pretty bad and I see a lot of the internet starting to try to defend them like look guys What?

283
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:32,565
Speaker 0: No.

284
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:32,946
Speaker 0: What?

285
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,392
Speaker 0: Just stop it.

286
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:35,616
Speaker 1: WAT what?

287
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:40,549
Speaker 0: Yes Anytime you forget how egregious this shit is.

288
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:45,899
Speaker 0: This is just to remind you that shit like this happens at these conferences Pretty much all the time.

289
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:47,627
Speaker 1: Do you even internet?

290
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:57,060
Speaker 0: For every one scandal that happens that a PAX are related to a PAX There's like a hundred related to tech conferences and they're way worse and it's like how clueless are these people?

291
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,080
Speaker 0: They did apologize, but it looks like it's because they were forced to by TechCrunch.

292
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, TechCrunch is also not the greatest.

293
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:07,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at least they put the token effort forth.

294
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:17,631
Speaker 0: Sure The thing is the app itself what it does were it not a Joke and were it not presented in this way could actually be cool.

295
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,340
Speaker 0: because the idea is let's say I buy a new video card Right.

296
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:20,943
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

297
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,230
Speaker 0: So here's what I was the app I would make.

298
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,960
Speaker 0: I'd call it unboxing and use some clever web 3.0 spelling of boxing.

299
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,532
Speaker 0: Yeah So I take my video card and I hold my phone up.

300
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,792
Speaker 0: one camera is pointed at the package The other one's pointed at my face.

301
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:41,760
Speaker 0: I Unbox it live and it videos the unboxing and my reaction to the unboxing at the same time.

302
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,460
Speaker 1: Why don't we just make a app called double cam that videos both cameras at the same time?

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,951
Speaker 0: But I would call it unboxing and really sell it as and in.

304
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,216
Speaker 0: have the site be all about.

305
00:17:52,497 --> 00:18:05,519
Speaker 0: you set you tag What you unboxed so you can go to the site and be like video cards GTX 770 and you'll get all the unboxing videos of people who just got that or their own people would like Photoshop.

306
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,395
Speaker 1: people would end Up using it just for the double cam part and oh, you know what?

307
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:10,400
Speaker 0: That's great.

308
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:16,739
Speaker 0: But having that conceit like vine or like Instagram gets it that initial cachet among morons.

309
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,331
Speaker 0: Yeah So yeah guys make this app.

310
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,220
Speaker 0: just don't make it hit stare.

311
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:33,639
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day Ever wonder why we can't use our phones on planes.

312
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,955
Speaker 0: Bullshit, this video is not what you expect and it is.

313
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,422
Speaker 0: it is great Cuz.

314
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,433
Speaker 1: it would annoy the fuck out of everyone else on the play.

315
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,740
Speaker 0: the conceit of this videos.

316
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:45,880
Speaker 0: The stewardess is like make sure you turn off your cell phones and this guy's like why?

317
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,363
Speaker 0: Like really why?

318
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:48,508
Speaker 0: I just want to know I'll turn it off.

319
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,573
Speaker 0: just explain to me why.

320
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:53,585
Speaker 0: and she explained so like, okay But okay, how come?

321
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,394
Speaker 0: I've turned off my Kindle and it just escalates.

322
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,517
Speaker 0: this one woman's like wait a minute So can I hold the plane hostage with my 3ds?

323
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:02,700
Speaker 0: And it just goes off from there.

324
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,777
Speaker 0: This is an excellent video and I just want to point out that part of this video is kind of true.

325
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 0: I have flown Around the world With work blackberries that I always forget to turn off.

326
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,580
Speaker 0: They're just on in my carry-on the whole time when I was on the flight to Australia.

327
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:25,755
Speaker 1: There were some other packs people on that plane and and they played Wireless Mario Kart in flight and didn't give a fuck with each other.

328
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:34,720
Speaker 0: I on our flight home from fax as soon as the Stewardess walked past me after telling everyone to turn everything off.

329
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,520
Speaker 0: I just turned my Kindle back on and kept reading and the plane didn't crash.

330
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:38,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

331
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,250
Speaker 1: Most people I see on planes.

332
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,600
Speaker 1: It's like you're supposed to turn your shit off off.

333
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,759
Speaker 0: Oh, I've never ever turned my.

334
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:50,560
Speaker 0: no I've never seen anyone on the plane actually put the phone in autistic mode and that's it.

335
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just freaking you know, they don't even really do airplane.

336
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,660
Speaker 1: But sometimes they do airplane mode most of the time, but most people just friggin just put the phone away.

337
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,365
Speaker 1: They like click it.

338
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,594
Speaker 1: It's the screen goes blank.

339
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:06,076
Speaker 1: They think that's off And sometimes just cuz they're dumb and not you know, so yeah, that's what I got.

340
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:06,558

Speaker 1: No and George Carlin.

354
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,331
Speaker 1: Yeah I did not Appreciate who either of them was when I was very small.

355
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:51,720
Speaker 0: you want to know something that really says a lot about my childhood.

356

358
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,900

359
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,698
Speaker 0: I think that says more about my parents than about me.

360
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:07,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't watch either one.

361
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,874
Speaker 0: this is actually a pretty good video in the meta moment.

362
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,740
Speaker 0: wait Scott already ruined the meta moment.

363
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:13,608
Speaker 0: It's over.

364
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:15,984

00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:31,920
Speaker 0: And again, I can't stress this enough The reason I want you to read this book is because you're not nearly mad enough about the NSA.

372
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,660
Speaker 1: Why would I read a book when I could just watch salty bit?

Speaker 1: I think our next Tuesday show was salty bets.

411
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:33,859
Speaker 1: I think it is so no show no talking.

412
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,673
Speaker 0: right now I'm gonna spoil just so you guys know to listen to that show I watched a match.

413
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,755
Speaker 0: this character's name was Goku Goku And there was nothing there.

414
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,640
Speaker 1: Nothing why I watched a fight yesterday.

415
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:51,920
Speaker 1: It was I forget who against Mike Tyson as in punch-out Mike Tyson all in on Tyson.

416
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,418
Speaker 1: I was all in on Tyson, and that was not a bad idea.

417
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,008
Speaker 1: No one fucks at the champ.

418
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,220
Speaker 1: Iron Mike was made of iron.

419
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:03,200
Speaker 0: So I can't believe we never did a show on motherboards.

420
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:04,549
Speaker 1: I hope we didn't.

421
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:11,335
Speaker 0: I searched our website and maybe Interesting to see if our opinions on motherboards have changed since the last time we did a show.

422
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,825
Speaker 0: if we have in fact talked about mother I hope we haven't.

423
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,360
Speaker 1: but yeah, I searched our archives didn't find an episode.

424
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,311
Speaker 1: I think I searched on Newegg And I said what part of a computer haven't we done a show on?

425
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,239
Speaker 0: and I know when we got to the point of like.

426
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:27,140
Speaker 1: See optical drives CD R double you dig in the bottom of the barrel.

427
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:30,414
Speaker 1: But again the motherboard is the most important part of the computer.

428
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:32,041
Speaker 1: Have we not done a show on it Now?

429
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:37,159
Speaker 0: I'm sure we've talked about them in a secondary sense in our like how to build a PC.

430
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:43,369
Speaker 0: I'm sure we have yeah, but Motherboard actually kind of matters less than it used to.

431
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:47,040
Speaker 1: in some ways it matters more and in some ways it matters less.

432
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,945
Speaker 1: It matters more.

433
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,216
Speaker 1: and that it's called the motherboard for a reason right.

434
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:53,027
Speaker 1: like the mothership It is the core it is the computer.

435
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:57,100
Speaker 1: most of it right it is like the important part that connects everything together.

436
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:01,172
Speaker 0: But at the same time the processor does know what the processor does.

437
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,920
Speaker 1: the work, but all everything goes through the motherboard.

438
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:09,820
Speaker 0: Right, but it's interesting if you grab made a graph of like how important the decision of your motherboard is.

439
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:17,405
Speaker 0: You basically didn't have a choice until I mean the era of people building their own computers who weren't Mid to late 90s.

440
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you people didn't build their own 46. is that commonly?

441
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, it happened much more.

442
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:31,349
Speaker 1: when the Pentium lines came out is when computer building started to appear and not really until the Pentium Pro 2 did it really start to have.

443
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:34,840
Speaker 0: yeah that in the when the AMD k6 chips came.

444
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,740
Speaker 1: That's when modern PC building really started to happen.

445
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:45,087
Speaker 0: Yeah That is when you'd go to egghead.com and you'd spend an entire week doing research on This motherboard computer.

446
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:54,582
Speaker 0: when you computer shopper magazine was around in the late 90s You know, but the modern sensibility of picking all your components and building a computer Widespread.

447
00:25:54,703 --> 00:26:00,804
Speaker 1: no computer shopper magazine was the only way to do it before Internet's really took over before Egghead.com.

448
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:01,990
Speaker 0: that was not something I did.

449
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,398
Speaker 0: the first computer I built it was a k7.

450
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, the k7 was when first one I built was a Pentium 3.

451
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did not build a Pentium.

452
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,651
Speaker 0: I never built a Pentium back at first.

453
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,159
Speaker 1: so speaking of motherboards, right?

454
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:21,268
Speaker 1: So the most important part of the motherboard is basically the North Bridge South Bridge and that's basically been the way motherboards have been made For a long ass time.

455
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:29,499
Speaker 1: It used to matter a lot what you picked yeah, but basically there's these chips on the motherboard that are the North Bridge in the South Bridge and those do all the work of.

456
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:44,933
Speaker 1: You know getting the memory to talk to the you know processor to talk to the video ports right to do all this sort of other stuff to talk to the the IO ports with the SATAs and all that kind of stuff is all in the North Bridge in the South Bridge.

457
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,317
Speaker 1: It's split between these two chips.

458
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:56,608
Speaker 1: all right and When I first bought a computer it was a for Intel 440 BX The most reliable chip set on earth.

459
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,132
Speaker 0: that PC ran forever.

460
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:01,580
Speaker 1: that Pentium 3450 never died when I thought it was dead.

461
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,813
Speaker 1: It was actually the power supply, and I didn't realize it.

462
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:05,946
Speaker 1: when I got a new power supply It just worked again.

463
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:14,066
Speaker 0: It wasn't so much that it the hardware didn't die It was also that it was just really stable, but I think that was partly due to the fact that Younger kids might not remember.

464
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:17,660
Speaker 0: home-built computers used to be mad unstable.

465
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:26,160
Speaker 0: If you didn't know what you were doing you had to actually do a lot of research like all right setting up all these timings And the bio and voltages this via chipset.

466
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:32,238
Speaker 0: But if I buy this video card it might not work unless I change the clock on this.

467
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,406
Speaker 0: or well I bought this one kind of RAM.

468
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,340
Speaker 0: I gotta up the voltage a tiny bit to make it work.

469
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:41,293
Speaker 0: But if I up it too much, it'll burn out modern BIOS's.

470
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:46,690
Speaker 1: and now EFI which is in most motherboards Just automatically does all that shit correctly almost all the time.

471
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:55,712
Speaker 0: I remember the first time I overclocked with my a bit motherboard So excited no one in there And I up the multiplier and it wouldn't fucking post because that was a mistake.

472
00:27:55,933 --> 00:28:03,476
Speaker 0: and then instead I increase the FSB Yeah from a hundred megahertz to a hundred and thirty three megahertz.

473
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:12,475
Speaker 0: oh That was a huge Huge performance gain and It also crashed about once a week.

474
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:15,690
Speaker 0: playing Counter-Strike More frames right.

475
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:40,188
Speaker 1: so when you're shopping for motherboards You're gonna see they're gonna tell you sort of like what the what kind of chipset is on there right in terms of North and South Bridge and in turn I don't know all of them these days But I know the Intel ones is sort of split between the ones that have the letter Z and the ones that don't and the ones Z. those tend to have like these integrated video cards and stuff like that going on and the ones without the Z. Those don't have that.

476
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,059
Speaker 1: those are more like just motherboards.

477
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:50,722
Speaker 0: Yep You know now if we're talking about advice on buying motherboards what it really comes down to nowadays is the more expensive ones usually aren't Better.

478
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,476
Speaker 0: they just have more features that you probably don't need.

479
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:55,098
Speaker 1: right and time.

480
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,251
Speaker 1: I'm practically speaking right.

481
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:02,431
Speaker 1: when you buy a motherboard today It's all about how many connectors does it have of which kinds?

482
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:02,933
Speaker 1: right?

483
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:06,486
Speaker 1: so you know it's like how many USB ports Can I get on this thing?

484
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,611
Speaker 1: how many do you need?

485
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,600
Speaker 0: I need a lot of fucking USB ports?

486
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,635
Speaker 0: I don't want to buy USB hub Scott said connectors for the longest time.

487
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:15,040
Speaker 0: I would look at a spec on a motherboard.

488
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:15,700
Speaker 0: I'd be like all right.

489
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:28,816
Speaker 0: I need at least two ISAs and I need like six PC eyes because what I'd have sound card MIDI card Separate game controller card video card they used to not be like AGP or all these.

490
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:34,270
Speaker 0: we have like those things in My SCSI card another hard drive control.

491
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,656
Speaker 1: Mike and my old my Pentium 3 had so many cards.

492
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:38,140
Speaker 1: my computer now has a video card.

493
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:38,662
Speaker 0: I know.

494
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:39,184
Speaker 0: I don't.

495
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,730
Speaker 0: I don't think I've put our card.

496
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:42,518
Speaker 0: that wasn't a video card in any computer.

497
00:29:42,578 --> 00:30:02,519
Speaker 0: I've built since 2000 and 2000. yeah, nope I put the sound card the the PCI sound card Into the computer I built around 2004. okay, it had one PCI legacy slot for that sound card.

498
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:10,837
Speaker 1: cool But yeah, it's all about how many connectors slots are still sort of important if you're gonna put stuff in them But there's just less stuff to put in them these days.

499
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,370
Speaker 1: How many RAM slots are there?

500
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,154
Speaker 1: right?

501
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,627
Speaker 1: how many Really important?

502
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,600
Speaker 1: how many s ATA connectors are there?

503
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,687
Speaker 1: So how many drives can you connect?

504
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,153
Speaker 1: does it even have a floppy connector?

505
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:23,839
Speaker 1: if you have an old floppy drive does it even have?

506
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,289
Speaker 1: Old IDE connectors?

507
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:30,434
Speaker 1: if you have really old hard drives You know or maybe your CD ROM isn't s ATA and it needs an old.

508
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,502
Speaker 1: You know ID ribbon table You know what.

509
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:34,510
Speaker 0: seriously don't bother with ID.

510
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,511
Speaker 0: if you if you have any device that needs ID Get an external thing.

511
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:39,760
Speaker 1: we get all the data at it.

512
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,289
Speaker 0: No, just buy a new one of that device.

513
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,878
Speaker 0: a CD RW is like 12 bucks.

514
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,923
Speaker 1: That's true You know.

515
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:50,015
Speaker 1: does the motherboard have connectors for like you know all the audio inputs.

516
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,119
Speaker 1: on the front of your case I?

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,511
Speaker 0: Would argue you don't want to use the onboard sound anyway.

518
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:56,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, well does it have?

519
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,000
Speaker 1: well most people?

520
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,345
Speaker 0: Motherboard supports that.

521
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,633
Speaker 1: sure you know they have every month.

522
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:02,874
Speaker 0: No.

523
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,620
Speaker 0: There's two standards would be deprecating.

524
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,520
Speaker 1: It could be in a different spot on the motherboard.

525
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,584
Speaker 1: It's annoying to connect to.

526
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:08,386
Speaker 1: you know.

527
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:14,428
Speaker 1: the arrangement of the things on the motherboard also matters a lot because if you pair up a Motherboard with a case it's like it's ATX ATX.

528
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:17,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll fit, but will the wiring be nice?

529
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:17,696
Speaker 1: I know.

530
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:24,320
Speaker 0: I would argue that the case matters way more than the motherboard in the modern era because there's very little variation in motherboards.

531
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,584
Speaker 1: There's still some variation.

532
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:38,060
Speaker 1: like if you use this motherboard with a case that has a bottom power supply instead of a top power supply Suddenly the wirings janky because the power connector on the motherboards in a weird spot Except the power connectors are almost always in the same spot almost always.

533
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:46,254
Speaker 1: But there's other connectors on the back of the computer that are important like if you've got the onboard video card Is there an HDMI or just a VGA or a DVI?

534
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,480
Speaker 0: I have not yet looked.

535
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,200
Speaker 0: I've been clicking on like 10 motherboards here.

536
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,027
Speaker 0: I've not yet found one that didn't have HDMI.

537
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:54,340
Speaker 1: if it had integrated video does it still have ps2 mouse and keyboard if you need?

538
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,466
Speaker 0: I know I have not seen one yet.

539
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:58,432
Speaker 0: That does not have that does the?

540
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,980
Speaker 1: how many USB threes are there versus USB twos?

541
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,912
Speaker 1: How many fire wires are that doesn't even have fire wires?

542
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:05,880
Speaker 1: is the onboard sound card?

543
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,829
Speaker 1: It just stereo sound or is it surround sound?

544
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:12,120
Speaker 1: does it have optical out or just the analog audio out?

545
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,699
Speaker 0: But I guess the point we're getting at and then Scott's really getting at here.

546
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:22,480
Speaker 0: The feature set is what matters now not the back end Performancy stuff that used to matter or the compatibility stuff that used to matter.

547
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:30,399
Speaker 0: Yeah You can just pick a motherboard that has the features you want and if there's two that are pretty much equal and one cost more Money look at them side by side.

548
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:39,047
Speaker 0: most likely the more expensive one just has extra stuff more USB more SATA a Dedicated say to controller with rage.

549
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,354
Speaker 1: Well more expensive one could also be smaller.

550
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:45,958
Speaker 1: smaller is usually more money Except for when it's just not as good, right?

551
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:52,680
Speaker 0: You know like thing is again that's more limited by case and whether or not you want a game or video card.

552
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,838
Speaker 0: Yep, there's also a factor ATX AT micro.

553
00:32:55,898 --> 00:33:03,660
Speaker 1: of course There's also some other boards that is made with better components like more better capacitors that are all solid-state might raise the price.

554
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,111
Speaker 1: Name brand raises the price.

555
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:07,920
Speaker 0: Yep, but what is the name brand?

556
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,353
Speaker 0: Cuz when I the last time I was buying motherboards It was pretty much you bought a bit if you overclocked and wanted features.

557
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,260
Speaker 0: you bought aces if you never wanted it to crash.

558
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:15,843
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

559
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:16,606
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what.

560
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:19,480
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell, you know, there's no name brand.

561
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,967
Speaker 1: That is just better than the others.

562
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:21,590
Speaker 1: It's pretty much.

563
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:23,920
Speaker 1: is it name brand or not name brand?

564
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,920
Speaker 0: Is it anything other than aces a bit gigabyte MSI?

565
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,021
Speaker 1: Right.

566
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:28,744
Speaker 1: Is it not?

567
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:32,920
Speaker 1: is it one of the known motherboard brands or is it not one of those brands?

568
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,328
Speaker 1: Is it like some ghetto brand right?

569
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,473
Speaker 1: Like I have an ASRock.

570
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:37,095
Speaker 1: That's a pretty much.

571
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:37,396
Speaker 1: Okay.

572
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,320
Speaker 1: That's a pretty well-known brand.

573
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,368
Speaker 0: It's actually really popular for HTTPS.

574
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of ones out there that are the big brands.

575
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:50,509
Speaker 1: But there are other brands out there like I'm pretty you know, I know star Biostar, but then you get into the second tier.

576
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:59,254
Speaker 0: I think all right new egg only lists six Alrighty, then aces ASRock gigabyte MSI ECS biostar.

577
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,240
Speaker 1: ECS is the only one that I've never heard of.

578
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,411
Speaker 0: Let me look at these ECS motherboards.

579
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:06,865
Speaker 0: Let's see there They look like motherboards.

580
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,275
Speaker 0: They're as expensive as the other brands.

581
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:10,735
Speaker 0: Okay.

582
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:11,137
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

583
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:11,839
Speaker 0: This was only 50 bucks.

584
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,079
Speaker 0: Let's see what's going on here.

585
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:23,739
Speaker 1: Yeah every motherboard manufacturer seems to have a full lineup from the cheapest to the most expensive with lots of Variations and it's like I really wonder like how many people are buying each of these slight variations.

586
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,606
Speaker 1: I know that it matters shouldn't?

587
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,813
Speaker 1: they have like fewer motherboards of like just like.

588
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,139
Speaker 1: here's the crazy gamer one with a million slots.

589
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,049
Speaker 1: Here's the sort of normal one with a regular number of slots.

590
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,480
Speaker 1: Here's an 8 micro ATX that has like one video card hole.

591
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:37,463
Speaker 1: That's it.

592
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:38,246
Speaker 1: What else?

593
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,389
Speaker 1: what else do you need guys?

594
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:39,752
Speaker 1: Really?

595
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:43,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the differences are always really Subtle crap.

596
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:43,879
Speaker 0: It's never like.

597
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:56,344
Speaker 1: well This one only has one SATA controller with six connectors and this one has a second SAT controller with ten SAT connectors, but those four extra ones are on a separate, you know Controller.

598
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:58,812
Speaker 0: Yep, that has its own separate like raid thing.

599
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:02,391
Speaker 1: Yeah that launches after the first one launches Post.

600
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:03,179
Speaker 1: it's like what?

601
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,388
Speaker 0: But I really I just there's.

602
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:13,320
Speaker 0: I need so little from my motherboard that I pick a name brand and I just picked the cheapest One that has all the holes I want in my mother.

603
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other of course most important thing about the motherboard is the socket.

604
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,000
Speaker 1: right the socket is the thing.

605
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,279
Speaker 1: That's where the CPU goes and you need it to be the right shape.

606
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,270
Speaker 1: You need it to be the right shape to match the CPU.

607
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,093
Speaker 1: You're gonna put in it.

608
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:31,293
Speaker 1: the motherboard determines which kind of CPU it can hold and which kind of RAM it can hold.

609
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:44,068
Speaker 1: and if you want a CPU that is Newer than or too far older than that motherboard or not the right shape for its socket or RAM That's faster than or slower than and not the right kind for that motherboard Need a motherboard now.

610
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:52,280
Speaker 0: at the same time a lot of motherboards that list all the speeds of RAM They'll take but a lot of those speeds are non-standard and don't mean anything unless you're overclocking.

611
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:58,239
Speaker 0: And in fact a lot of RAM will say it supports X speeds But yet you're never gonna actually put that in the stock of it.

612
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,760
Speaker 1: It's so weird how the motherboard companies encourage overclocking and the CPU companies encourage overclocking in the video card companies.

613
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,540
Speaker 0: In the old days they used to try to actively lock you out of overclock?

614
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,313
Speaker 1: No, the CPUs would be the ones to over to lock you out.

615
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:11,840
Speaker 1: The motherboards didn't want to lock you.

616
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:21,557
Speaker 0: Well, but I remember there was a time when a bit seemed to be the motherboard that didn't stop you But all their motherboards didn't really give you any way to overclock without really fucking around.

617
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:24,824
Speaker 1: Oh But yeah It's it's motherboards.

618
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:28,439
Speaker 1: don't even give a shit about overclocking the CPUs of the companies that don't want you to.

619
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:31,413
Speaker 1: But even they don't seem to be stopping anyone anymore.

620
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,518
Speaker 1: They're just like go for it.

621
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:32,880
Speaker 1: What else?

622
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:44,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, well partly because I think manufacturing technology is improved and Binning is probably more common because it they're not making as many bad chips It's a guess.

623
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:48,497
Speaker 0: so things are eminently overclockable and you're paying for the guarantee.

624
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:48,978
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:56,343
Speaker 1: so another thing to watch out for with motherboards is flash and Flare.

626
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:03,807
Speaker 1: right the motherboards that have like crazy colored metal coloring covering things Like you can't avoid it.

627
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,673
Speaker 0: gamery shit, you can't avoid it.

628
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:07,960
Speaker 1: and look how look at all the orange garbage all over that one.

629
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:08,823
Speaker 0: Yeah you know what.

630
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:17,360
Speaker 0: you can't avoid it because that's the heat pipe and all the stuff and The pea kinds of people who drive the motherboard consumer market now are gamer guys.

631
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,869
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's like you buy some ram even ram chips.

632
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,580
Speaker 1: you buy some ram chips and it's got like these blue spikes all over it.

633
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,278
Speaker 1: It looks all crazy.

634
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,900
Speaker 0: Well, because all ram chips now in the old days you'd buy ram.

635
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,785
Speaker 0: They all look the same.

636
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,640
Speaker 0: and then you could buy ram coolers that you never needed.

637
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,065
Speaker 0: You could stick onto your RAM.

638
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:35,860
Speaker 0: now pretty much all the RAM comes with these crazy heat sinks sticking off the top.

639
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like the this.

640
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,500
Speaker 1: the design of them is so ridiculous.

641
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't avoid it.

642
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:46,399
Speaker 1: So the more expensive motherboards always have more ridiculous stuff on them.

643
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,111
Speaker 0: Well, you can get the fatality editions of things.

644
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,160
Speaker 1: I guess still yeah, those are the more expensive ones.

645
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,805
Speaker 1: Yeah And the more gamer you get the more ridiculous the motherboard looks to try to convince you to buy it When it's actually not any bet.

646
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:11,276
Speaker 1: it's like they'll have another motherboard that's exact just as good maybe has a few less connectors on it and It's like really really They just need to somehow psychologically convince you to buy that motherboard.

647
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:11,537
Speaker 1: That's $100 more.

648
00:38:13,443 --> 00:38:32,960
Speaker 0: I just I really am fascinated that for the longest time for most of the pcs I'd built in the course of my life motherboard decision mattered so much for so many reasons and now it's Fairly a generic choice that comes down to a very limited set of features I require and most of the things I used to care about I don't care about anymore.

649
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, my decision-making process for buying motherboard is pretty much this I have this many hard drives and other CD ROM drives and such.

650
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:42,893
Speaker 1: does it have enough s ATA connectors for all of those?

651
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:50,657
Speaker 1: if it doesn't it's ruled out - does it have a PCI Express slot that will handle the video card that I'm putting into it?

652
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:51,620
Speaker 1: the maximum speed?

653
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,379
Speaker 1: Okay, good it has that it's not ruled out.

654
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,700
Speaker 1: Does it have a CPU socket matching the CPU that I'm going to purchase?

655
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,880
Speaker 1: Does it have enough RAM slots to hold the RAM that I'm going to put into it?

656
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 0: My trouble is the computer I built has six dim slots.

657
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:20,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as it has that a lot as long as it has yes to all of those questions Then it's an okay motherboard and I'll get it and any you know Whichever one the cheapest that meets all of the requirements.

658
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:28,900
Speaker 0: that is from a name-brand Yep, like when I think about what I look at because I'm not gonna build a new computer yet I bought between buying the video card and buying some more hard drives.

659
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:44,156
Speaker 0: I've staved off having to upgrade this computer that I built in 2009 mind you for at least another year Maybe longer, but if I were to buy a new computer now because I did the research, you know It's worth seeing should I just buy a new computer rather than upgrading the one I had

660
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:44,377
Speaker 1: on the?

661
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,040
Speaker 1: you need new computer.

662
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:51,280
Speaker 0: I thought the research concluded that I don't because buying a few hard drives cost almost nothing compared to buying a new computer.

663
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:59,539
Speaker 0: but When I when I was doing my research the things that I was doing the most research on I found were the CPU.

664
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,040
Speaker 0: again Like what is the exact price point to make a computer that I will not upgrade again anytime soon?

665
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,858
Speaker 0: Like do I really need the i7 nowadays as opposed to in the old days?

666
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,367
Speaker 0: well, the i5 be good enough like those kinds of questions and Beyond that it was just how much RAM do I really need?

667
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:16,948
Speaker 0: 12 or 24?

668
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:17,289
Speaker 0: I have 32.

669
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:17,630
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

670
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:24,525
Speaker 0: I don't even need that much yep, and That's it.

671
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,640
Speaker 0: Like I think the case is what I'm gonna agonize over the most.

672
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much So motherboards.

673
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,589
Speaker 1: do we have anything else to say about that?

674
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,496
Speaker 0: I know I mean unless we get into anecdotes.

675
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:42,397
Speaker 0: I mean remember When I had that motherboard at RIT and it started flipping out and eventually stopped working.

676
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,420
Speaker 1: the capacitors exploded.

677
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,889
Speaker 0: We opened it up and all the capacitors that exploded all over it because it was that Janky stolen formula of the.

678
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,437
Speaker 0: it was the sabotage formula for capacitor fluid.

679
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,638
Speaker 0: Yep Those are good days.

680
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,451
Speaker 0: Now I just have all these extra motherboards laying around nothing to do with them.

681
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,899
Speaker 1: How many times people tried to push a CPU?

682
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:10,040
Speaker 1: Heatsink onto a motherboard pushed too hard and broke the CPU and/or cracked the motherboard because they didn't have the motherboard seated properly.

683
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:11,479
Speaker 0: I have never done that.

684
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:15,014
Speaker 0: I've never done but I always think I did it every time I install the CPU.

685
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:19,500
Speaker 1: cuz when you put that heatsink down it Goes click click click and you can't tell between that noise and the motherboard breaking.

686
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:24,800
Speaker 0: I know because the motherboard breaking just makes a really loud single crack and so does the heatsink actually linking in.

687
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, so does the CPU actually linking in.

688
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,412
Speaker 1: not as much.

689
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,860
Speaker 0: it used to used to make a mush louder cracking noise.

690
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,660
Speaker 1: Well, now they've moved the pins from the CPU onto the motherboards.

691
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,165
Speaker 1: The sockets have changed.

692
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:40,783
Speaker 1: used to be the pins were on the bottom of the CPU and when the pin was bent the CPU was Ruined.

693
00:41:40,863 --> 00:41:43,540
Speaker 1: now when the pin is bent the motherboard is ruined.

694
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:52,932
Speaker 0: One thing you can say is there was a time when they when they went to the socket from the socket to the slot The nice thing about the slot was that that was not a problem.

695
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:55,580
Speaker 0: You just slid your CPU in like you did a video card.

696
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:58,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are other problems with that like performance.

697
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,129
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny how cooling.

698
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,047
Speaker 0: for actually for the short term cooling and Some kinds of performance were easier.

699
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:09,217
Speaker 0: They did that because they could fit a fuck ton more cash on the thing.

700
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:12,205
Speaker 1: That was Something for its time.

701
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:19,910
Speaker 0: Yes, and then we admit it me it's so quickly we got from Cooling and cash mattering more to.

702
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,020
Speaker 0: oh the physical distance actually matters a lot.

703
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,153
Speaker 0: We got to actually physically get the CPU closer to the motherboard again.

704
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:26,575
Speaker 1: Yep.

705
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,733
Speaker 0: Oh, wow Yeah, motherboards are not as interesting as they used to be.

706
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,470
Speaker 1: Oh your motherboard these days I guess we didn't mention also includes your network card.

707
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:37,020
Speaker 1: Yeah used to be a to buy Ethernet cards.

708
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,600
Speaker 0: In fact at my first computer that had a network card at an ISA network card And I also had an ISA sound card.

709
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:55,435
Speaker 0: I had a Sound Blaster all 32 plugged in to my one ISA slot and on the same ISA bus I had an ISA network card connected via 10 base Ethernet to my cable modem.

710
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:59,271
Speaker 0: up until like Anytime I started a big download.

711
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:02,043
Speaker 0: my audio would stutter I think.

712
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:08,380
Speaker 1: up until like when we lived in Beacon my computers had Ethernet cards that weren't the motherboard.

713
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:14,034
Speaker 0: Right my computer at RIT the one I built at RIT while we were living there.

714
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,080
Speaker 0: I bought a dedicated network card.

715
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:18,733
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's interesting now how it's like.

716
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:28,694
Speaker 1: even when I went to college I had to buy a network card on the internet and bring it with me to college because I had just a modem a USB Modem attached to my computer not an Ethernet card USB modem.

717
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:29,979
Speaker 1: I had an ISA modem.

718
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, home computers just had friggin modems.

719
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,160
Speaker 1: They didn't have network cards.

720
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,993
Speaker 1: You didn't have a LAN in your house right.

721
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,000
Speaker 1: hardly anyone had that.

722
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,326
Speaker 1: Routers were not home equipment now.

723
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:40,490
Speaker 1: They're routers at home equipment.

724
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:43,340
Speaker 1: people have ethernet cards just built into the good.

725
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,990
Speaker 1: But now people are using wireless cards.

726
00:43:46,351 --> 00:43:48,078
Speaker 1: some motherboards even have wireless built-in.

727
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:54,359
Speaker 0: It's crazy But the fact that the moral of this whole show is that motherboards are a lot less interesting than they used to be.

728
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:59,532
Speaker 1: It's a weird, but becoming more interesting by include just having more.

729
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:03,188
Speaker 1: you know commodity stuff just built into the motherboard That doesn't matter.

730
00:44:03,228 --> 00:44:06,844
Speaker 1: like sound cards network cards The they matter less.

731
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:12,340
Speaker 1: you know it used to matter more when the motherboard did less stuff because then you know those different.

732
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,753
Speaker 1: You know, but now that motherboard does so many things.

733
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:15,960
Speaker 1: It's all commoditized.

734
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:20,820
Speaker 1: So your choice is kind of meaningless, and we're seeing this across all aspects of home computing.

735
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:29,700
Speaker 0: I mean when I built computers back in the day to talk about RAM for a second I'd have to research the RAM timings and the RAM brands yup of my motherboard and figure out the compatibility.

736
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:32,419
Speaker 0: And then I actually would have to look at what?

737
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,107
Speaker 0: Cast latency cycle do I want?

738
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,893
Speaker 0: am I willing to pay more for cast?

739
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:37,616
Speaker 0: who RAM?

740
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:38,600
Speaker 0: is that a cast three?

741
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,496
Speaker 0: Nowadays if you look at RAM it gives you all these ridiculous statistics about cast.

742
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:52,240
Speaker 0: you know like twelve Six four four four two two two one and all these numbers that from a performance standpoint mean nothing.

743
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,448
Speaker 0: Benchmarks, there's no way to tell it does not matter in 99.9 repeating percent of the.

744
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:02,982
Speaker 1: it only matters if over clocking is your hobby and over clocking is a Stupid hobby.

745
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,420
Speaker 0: well even that if it is even if it is your hobby most of those numbers don't matter anymore.

746
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:10,994
Speaker 1: Yep, all the things what there aren't.

747
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:12,060
Speaker 1: at least in those days.

748
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:18,638
Speaker 1: There were some games that no one could get full frames on with any equipment right like the software was outpacing the hardware you could Have at your house.

749
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,969
Speaker 1: You got like crisis the day it came out.

750
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,680
Speaker 1: or I forget what the other game big deal game was before that.

751
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,856
Speaker 1: It's like you couldn't full settings full frames it no matter what you bought, and you really needed that.

752
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:29,839
Speaker 1: a super expensive shit.

753
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:35,219
Speaker 1: now You can full frames full settings with like you know last generation.

754
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:38,399
Speaker 0: well I mean, I think part of that is the advance of video cards.

755
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,163
Speaker 1: That's also.

756
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:40,691
Speaker 1: the video card does more than anything.

757
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,440
Speaker 1: my previous computer was a core to duo.

758
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:48,225
Speaker 1: I upgraded the video card in it from an 8800 GT to a 460 or a 470.

759
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:51,321
Speaker 1: I forget and Just.

760
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:52,626
Speaker 1: it just went crazy fast.

761
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:57,180
Speaker 1: all the all the games are suddenly crazy crazy performance huge boost even though nothing else change.

762
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:04,327
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's the video card does all the work, and that's why when Scott said you know rib You don't need to build a new computer now I built my computer in 2009.

763
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:11,047
Speaker 1: the only thing that I think should be good for two more years at least things that are obsolete Are video cards and spinning discs.

764
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,840
Speaker 1: that thing should be good for two if not three more years and by then who even knows?

765
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:30,752
Speaker 0: Because there is actually a problem it does not support PCI Express 3 fully the new the new high speed so I will actually not get full Theoretical performance out of my GTX.

766
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:34,871
Speaker 1: when you do upgrade in two years You'll probably be able to bring that video cart over with.

767
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:49,763
Speaker 0: yeah when I say upgrade my computer You know what that would entail in the modern era a new CPU a new motherboard RAM to put in it if it doesn't use the same RAM I already have and new hard drives maybe Maybe?

768
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:53,140
Speaker 1: hard drives tend to be the thing that lasts the longest like my drives.

769
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,694
Speaker 1: I think I usually carry drives around for like 15 years before.

770
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:01,299
Speaker 0: the only reason I need to upgrade drives Is that this computer was built before?

771
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,526
Speaker 0: SSDs were really available.

772
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:11,286
Speaker 0: I mean I bought a 32 gig SSD at considerable expense And I ran my games off of that 32 gigs.

773
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:21,675
Speaker 0: Now I can just buy a bunch of hybrid drives and whatever and actually I'm thinking about sticking these two new drives into doing A RAID 0 just for video editing performance.

774
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:22,699
Speaker 1: You do whatever you can do.

775
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:32,329
Speaker 0: yeah, but the point is the computer upgrade cycle is so drastically different from what it used to be that my CPU is a limit on rendering video.

776
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:38,379
Speaker 0: if I render a video and I had a faster processor It might take four less hours out of the 18 hours it takes.

777
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,820
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
