1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,785
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday October 20th.

2
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:11,487
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:16,180
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight the scary flying ghost ship.

4
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:24,233
Speaker 0: It's not scary Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:37,987
Speaker 1: I remember a time at RIT when the only way I would get to play DDR Was when the anime club would be like hey, we're playing DDR, and they'd set it up at like this club space.

6
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,952
Speaker 0: That was the year Mm.

7
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,440
Speaker 1: We've been playing DDR for a decade.

8
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,030
Speaker 1: yep, and I still can't beat some of those nine-footers.

9
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:48,716
Speaker 0: It's cuz.

10
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:49,829
Speaker 0: you've been playing DDR for a decade.

11
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:55,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's sad, but I feel like I might have.

12
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,510
Speaker 1: finally for the first time like you know we're getting old.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,920
Speaker 1: I'm pushing 30, and it bothers me, but at the same time.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:10,785
Speaker 1: I haven't felt the effects of age too much yet until this past week Because I've been playing DDR a lot lately just for various replaying DDR without caffeine.

15
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:14,789
Speaker 1: oh, yeah Except even with caffeine I couldn't do it.

16
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:21,290
Speaker 1: But my trouble is I'm playing DDR And I decided I'm going to get to the next level the level I never reached in the old days.

17
00:01:21,652 --> 00:01:24,889
Speaker 1: I want to be able to pass every nine-footer the same way I can pass every eight-footer.

18
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,196
Speaker 1: I'm about three-quarters.

19
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:30,090
Speaker 0: the way there that nine foot is a lot bigger than the eighth foot.

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know all feet are equal.

21
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,050
Speaker 1: I can pass almost every nine-footer.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,853
Speaker 1: That's not my trouble.

23
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:41,117
Speaker 1: my trouble is that then I thought so there's those ten-foot fuckers like max 300 and legend of max.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,443
Speaker 1: you know all that stuff.

25
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:46,138
Speaker 1: the crazy challenge to the So I was practicing.

26
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,625
Speaker 1: I've been practicing max 300 for two weeks now.

27
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:54,350
Speaker 1: Just now Scott saw I got within three seconds of beating it on maniac.

28
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,622
Speaker 0: It's bully and you had to beat it or you don't?

29
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,013
Speaker 1: yeah, but at the same time I'm getting there.

30
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:11,390
Speaker 0: see what I think they should have done right in DDR is instead of using this foot system of Difficulty they should rank every DDR song ever with a number of how hard it is and change them as new songs.

31
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,534
Speaker 0: I see I would agree.

32
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,961
Speaker 0: This is the number one hardest song.

33
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:21,436
Speaker 1: Here's why I disagree because some stuff like a rhythm in police and I don't know they love you like a fool.

34
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:27,116
Speaker 1: our two are similarly difficult songs that are very different in the manner that they're Difficult like.

35
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,688
Speaker 1: I can do songs with a lot of streaming.

36
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,330
Speaker 0: yeah But whatever you just pick whatever number you just rank them next to each other and then people can argue about it.

37
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:34,394
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

38
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:35,659
Speaker 0: What do you care if you're konami?

39
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:36,301
Speaker 0: It'll give a shit?

40
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so you just but they had a good system.

41
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:39,880
Speaker 1: I mean I like the foot system.

42
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,010
Speaker 1: I like that web graph.

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,430
Speaker 1: They added remember where it shows like why it's difficult like this is a jumpy song.

44
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

45
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,102
Speaker 0: anyway people playing don't even pay attention to that.

46
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do replay.

47
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,410
Speaker 1: We paid attention to it a lot.

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,772
Speaker 1: I remember.

49
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,903
Speaker 0: normal people do not even know.

50
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:54,728
Speaker 1: people don't play DDR.

51
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:55,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

52
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:58,724
Speaker 1: DDR is dead except among hardcore fans.

53
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,430
Speaker 0: hardcore people don't need the little chart.

54
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,177
Speaker 1: I would say we're hardcore.

55
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:05,530
Speaker 1: no there are people who are just hardest core whatever anyway.

56
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:07,638
Speaker 1: So I can almost pass it.

57
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:15,150
Speaker 1: so I've been playing you know legend of max and max unlimited And I reached a point that I never thought I'd reach in my life.

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,972
Speaker 1: I just I knew it.

59
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,607
Speaker 1: you know kind of intellectually, but I never viscerally really believed it until now.

60
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,976
Speaker 1: I Know the arrows.

61
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,145
Speaker 1: I know exactly what I need to do.

62
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,170
Speaker 1: I see them come in.

63
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,113
Speaker 1: I think you know like.

64
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:28,516
Speaker 1: I know it.

65
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:33,530
Speaker 1: I know it perfectly and I literally just can't move my legs fast enough to execute it.

66
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's that's how it is.

67
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,470
Speaker 1: I've never run into something like that in my life before.

68
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:39,254
Speaker 1: This is this is it.

69
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:48,610
Speaker 0: I'll go run like the New York Marathon, and it'll be like uh yeah You didn't realize it is that many miles all at once, but I feel like I could train for that.

70
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,676
Speaker 1: I feel like with this in particular I just there will.

71
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:54,064
Speaker 1: there is a physical limitation that I have hit that.

72
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,949
Speaker 1: had I attempted this when I was younger I probably would have been able to pass it.

73
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:02,550
Speaker 0: I do not know if I'm yeah, because you know why you're able to do when you're younger tiny legs.

74
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,380
Speaker 0: We have big legs which are younger.

75
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,810
Speaker 1: I'm talking like when I was at RIT.

76
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,820
Speaker 1: I'm not bigger now than I was then.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,402
Speaker 0: there you are.

78
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:11,890
Speaker 1: I'm not bigger.

79
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:15,083
Speaker 0: I stopped growing like well you're definitely not bigger than me.

80
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:16,690
Speaker 1: That's like senior year of high school.

81
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:20,934
Speaker 1: I didn't get any taller after that I Mean.

82
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,570
Speaker 0: I think that's why the Japanese people are so good at DDR because they're like they are so tiny.

83
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,949
Speaker 1: How do you explain fanboy in the mall?

84
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:32,140
Speaker 1: He is fat Doing the fanboy piston.

85
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:36,409
Speaker 0: yeah, so when he steps It doesn't push his body up because his body is weighing his leg down.

86
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:42,670
Speaker 0: We bounce which makes it harder to hit another arrow again because your foot is farther away from it because it bounced.

87
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,796
Speaker 1: Anyway before we get into the one I guess anime news I do want to mention this briefly.

88
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:50,189
Speaker 1: Deno coil an anime that is highly acclaimed that I haven't seen yet either.

89
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,850
Speaker 0: Scott I downloaded the whole thing by doing well.

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:02,189
Speaker 1: I only watch like episode one Alex and Emily and everyone watching these legitimately released I don't know, but it's supposedly awesome all right, and it's about augmented reality and gaming and that sort of thing.

91
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,276
Speaker 0: It's I think we have that now.

92
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,445
Speaker 0: wasn't there penny arcade comic with the Invisibles.

93
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's Deno coil.

94
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,577
Speaker 1: So here's the problem.

95
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,223
Speaker 1: then I keep saying here's the problem.

96
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:15,378
Speaker 1: then our coil is gonna get a video game And it's gonna be made by game on.

97
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:24,070
Speaker 1: and I bring this up only because this is one of those situations Much much like our egregiously unrealized potential panel at PAX where we asked why there's no Pokemon MMO.

98
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:30,190
Speaker 1: This is a game world and a concept that could be an amazing game And I'll bet you any money.

99
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,968
Speaker 1: It is going to be a generic shit MMO or even worse like hexide a generic shit fake MMO.

100
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:36,951
Speaker 0: Yes, sir I was giving.

101
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,078
Speaker 1: yeah, that's all I got.

102
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:42,710
Speaker 1: that's it so much more important the New York anime festival, New York comic-con.

103
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,950
Speaker 0: I know it was already like two weeks ago, but we haven't done a Wednesday episode So we haven't done any posts reviewing talk about it.

104
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:54,916
Speaker 1: I talked about it a little bit on the gaming episode because yeah We talked about burning.

105
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,890
Speaker 0: can we talked about the gaming aspects of it?

106
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,430
Speaker 0: But we didn't really talk about all the stuff that went on there, so we should just do it briefly.

107
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:04,021
Speaker 0: You know some of the stuff we saw there good and bad and whatever.

108
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:09,743
Speaker 1: well the New York comic-con New York anime festival the double Double mega con had one thing going for it.

109
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:11,330
Speaker 1: there were a lot of goddamn people there.

110
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only went on Friday, but supposedly Saturday was insane in terms of the number of people.

111
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,050
Speaker 1: Saturday was completely sold out.

112
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,938
Speaker 1: There's no way to get in if you didn't already have a badge.

113
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're reported.

114
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:24,435
Speaker 0: turnstile figure is 96,000 ish.

115
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:29,270
Speaker 0: so the thing is a lot of people get the one-day badge especially Saturday and Sunday.

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,784
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking real numbers probably in the 50 to 60 thousand area.

117
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:35,268
Speaker 1: I'd top it at around 70.

118
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:35,770
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

119
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is Sunday there was a line.

120
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,590
Speaker 0: You know I only went Sunday, and then Sunday's kids day, so everyone brings their kids on Sunday.

121
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:44,741
Speaker 1: No, here's the scary thing.

122
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:45,610
Speaker 1: it wasn't just kids.

123
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,623
Speaker 1: So I'm walking around and the con is still crazy crazy crowded.

124
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:58,543
Speaker 1: and when I go to leave I said I've the whole kind of seen this gigantic line like snaking all around the inside and then going out a door and then snaking All around the outside of the Javits.

125
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:04,628
Speaker 1: so on the way out I'm looking I'm like what the fuck is this line for and I asked someone and they're like I'm just trying to get in.

126
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:09,890
Speaker 1: Every one of those people was trying to buy a one-day badge to get in and they were trying to buy it at the door.

127
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is they were also will call everyone's in the same line.

128
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:14,604
Speaker 0: Whoa will call?

129
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,549
Speaker 0: so the non will call line was short.

130
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,037
Speaker 1: They were all one as far as I could tell.

131
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:22,086
Speaker 1: okay, but the trouble was the trouble.

132
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,190
Speaker 1: I keep saying that I don't know why.

133
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,523
Speaker 1: Suffice it you got you got trouble.

134
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,087
Speaker 1: I got trouble.

135
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:37,049
Speaker 1: indeed The line was crazy and only about half the people in the line had kids with them and the kid Presence on Sunday did not seem substantially greater than the kid presence on Friday night.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:45,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, for I was only there Friday and because I went in like an hour early I could have gone in it like 10, but I went in it like noon and It wasn't.

137
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,160
Speaker 0: you know, it wasn't early.

138
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,202
Speaker 0: It was in during the professional hours So I was able to see everything without a lot of traffic.

139
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:57,210
Speaker 0: and then you know I stayed there all day Friday and it never got you know, intolerably crowded on Friday.

140
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:10,194
Speaker 1: I'm curious if you had this problem on Friday because I had it Friday evening and I had it times 10 on Sunday and Emily And you know a bunch of our friends went on Saturday and they had this problem times a thousand Buckers just bump into you.

141
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,963
Speaker 0: No, my problem was people.

142
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:15,050
Speaker 0: just you know, stop it in the in the aisles.

143
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,830
Speaker 0: You know a little bit on Friday, right?

144
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:24,109
Speaker 0: You'd walk down an aisle and it's like I want to move and this room on the other side There's like two people in front of me and then there's space to move.

145
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:39,080
Speaker 0: But there's people to the left looking at something people to the right looking at something and people in the middle just standing still And it's like you people in the middle Move to the other side of these two blobs and then there's empty space just beyond you where I would like to go You know and it's like just keep walking.

146
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:39,663
Speaker 1: simple fix.

147
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:41,070
Speaker 1: it would take minimal staff.

148
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,690
Speaker 1: All I would do if I you know ran the double mega con is have directions.

149
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,123
Speaker 0: I would also one way.

150
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,330
Speaker 1: every aisle is one way.

151
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,277
Speaker 0: Yes, every aisle should be one way.

152
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:54,990
Speaker 0: and also I would just ban picture-taking in aisles.

153
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:57,970
Speaker 0: It's like there is the picture-taking of cosplayer area.

154
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,369
Speaker 0: You may not take pictures of cosplayers anywhere else and risk camera confiscation.

155
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,829
Speaker 1: Scott It's too hard to ban and there's no way you'd have enough staff to actually enforce that it.

156
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,255
Speaker 0: no But the thing is you don't.

157
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,524
Speaker 0: what you had to do is it's the same kind of thing.

158
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:10,990
Speaker 0: You don't enforce all of it, right?

159
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:15,505
Speaker 0: If a staff guys there, you know, no one's gonna risk it now.

160
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:16,348
Speaker 1: No one's gonna even know.

161
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:16,970
Speaker 1: no one'll even know.

162
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,433
Speaker 1: It's a rule.

163
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,590
Speaker 1: no one reads anything in the con book except the schedule.

164
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,134
Speaker 0: That's their problem.

165
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,964
Speaker 1: No, I think that's a terrible way to go.

166
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:23,990
Speaker 0: I think it's a great rule.

167
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:28,589
Speaker 0: I think that's 99% of the traffic and aisles is stopping to take pictures.

168
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,510
Speaker 1: Scott Maybe because you went on Friday when it was less on Saturday and Sunday.

169
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,530
Speaker 1: The problem was there's just too many people trying to walk in both directions.

170
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,390
Speaker 0: It was just a solid sea of people apparently at no point did the fire marshal think it was a problem.

171
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's watching the whole time because they had a cap.

172
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,934
Speaker 1: Uh-huh The trouble is just.

173
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:45,659
Speaker 1: they really need one-way lanes.

174
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:47,906
Speaker 1: that would probably solve most of the overcrowding.

175
00:09:48,388 --> 00:10:02,430
Speaker 1: and then beyond that It's just a. I feel like comic cons have this problem where anime and gaming cons don't so much of people just bumping into you Not like you know Squeezing by or crowded like Otacon crazy crowded in that upper skywalk and trying to get across.

176
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,315
Speaker 1: You're like the 300 level going.

177
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one.

178
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:12,200
Speaker 1: just like slams into me full-on at Otacon Or anime Boston or packs or anything.

179
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:18,910
Speaker 1: yet at this con that dudes not just fat dudes But they were the biggest offenders would literally just like bang into me while I was walking.

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,116
Speaker 0: I think I only got bumped once.

181
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,342
Speaker 1: I got back course.

182
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:25,921
Speaker 1: you bang some people with those goddamn Boxes you had to pick up and then I had to carry to the stupid cab.

183
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,048
Speaker 0: Hey, but I got fancy boxes now.

184
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,890
Speaker 0: So yeah So it could have been a lot more inconvenient.

185
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:41,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I show up at the con you're like, oh wait We got to go get a dolly and get these heavy fucking gigantic boxes and carry them around the con And then get a cab at the Javits at night when there's no way to get a cab.

186
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,957
Speaker 0: It wasn't that bad.

187
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,586
Speaker 1: It's like 20 minutes to get a cab.

188
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,212
Speaker 0: That's fun Would you?

189
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:47,755
Speaker 0: okay?

190
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,166
Speaker 0: would you rather pay the shipping for the for the boxes?

191
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:50,970
Speaker 1: They're not my boxes.

192
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,829
Speaker 1: So yes, I would rather you have paid the shipping for the boxes since that stuff.

193
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,161
Speaker 1: Then you try to dump them a cat's artist alley table.

194
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,190
Speaker 1: They're bigger than the space behind her table.

195
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:01,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would fit back there.

196
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:05,566
Speaker 1: Anyway, nevermind trying to squeeze them past the fat dudes to get to her table.

197
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:06,148
Speaker 0: That's all right.

198
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,990
Speaker 0: So What about you know, regardless of that situation, right?

199
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 0: What kind of you see any cool stuff at the?

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,370
Speaker 0: I mean because it was mostly booths, right?

201
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:23,103
Speaker 0: it's one of those cons where you see every booth and Unless there's a specific programming you really want to see or a specific famous person You really want to meet right then?

202
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:28,592
Speaker 0: You see all the boobs and you leave and most of the famous people you want to see are like sitting at an artist alley Table.

203
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:29,980
Speaker 0: so it's sort of a mocha situation.

204
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,977
Speaker 0: You don't have to go to their panel, right or There they have.

205
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:37,430
Speaker 0: you have to pay to get an autograph with them So you don't see them or you look at them from far away and go there's a famous person.

206
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:50,065
Speaker 1: All right Honestly, the only thing that drew my attention that was really like stood out that I remember and really enjoyed was Other than checking out a couple of specific booths for like, you know publishers I know was all the models of Gundams in the middle.

207
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,430
Speaker 0: Well, that was the Bandai booth.

208
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely by far the best booth.

209
00:11:54,428 --> 00:12:02,376
Speaker 1: Oh my god The Bandai booth was made a win and there's stuff like that at like that sort of model kind of stuff at PAX in the Crazy expo hall but not to that scale.

210
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:11,475
Speaker 0: This is the one and I had every single current model built and on display well presented in these glass cases and It was pretty awesome.

211
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:15,829
Speaker 0: If you are a fan of plastic robots, it was like the greatest thing I ever saw.

212
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,403
Speaker 0: Yeah terms of plastic robots and I bought the best one that they had.

213
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,390
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I just walked around the whole place.

214
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,290
Speaker 1: I have mostly impressions about the con in general.

215
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,338
Speaker 1: I'm trying to avoid all the meta that no one cares about.

216
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:33,090
Speaker 0: just some stuff that I saw that was interesting right was There was a the hendane, you know, doujinshi people.

217
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:37,782
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah They were up against the wall facing the wall in the back backity back back.

218
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,670
Speaker 1: cannot but hope that that was intentional.

219
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:41,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

220
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,182
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of fucking yaoi panels though.

221
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, we panels.

222
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:45,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, we paddles.

223
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:48,838
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, cuz they were actually letting him sell them.

224
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:56,609
Speaker 0: those big heavy boxes that I bought were actually the comic cubes Which are like these it's like, you know, you buy comic books and you put them in a cardboard box.

225
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:01,310
Speaker 0: But this is basically the same thing only it's actually nice furniture.

226
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:05,130
Speaker 0: So you can put it out with the furniture and it's super nice and it was totally worth it.

227
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:08,083
Speaker 0: And it let me make room in the closet for the vacuum cleaner.

228
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:08,304
Speaker 1: Yep.

229
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:09,610
Speaker 1: All you need now is the hoplite.

230
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:12,961
Speaker 0: Yeah animal planet had a really fancy booth.

231
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,506
Speaker 0: what I don't know.

232
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,430
Speaker 0: what they were doing there.

233
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,242
Speaker 1: Why is animal planet the network of ghosts and midgets?

234
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,490
Speaker 1: There are no animals on the animal planet except things like yetis.

235
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,049
Speaker 0: Maybe ghost yetis, I don't know.

236
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,996
Speaker 1: And even there you know what they were promoting.

237
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,790
Speaker 1: they were promoting some like I don't know paleo zoology.

238
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,586
Speaker 1: Let's go find like cryptids and yetis and crap.

239
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,270
Speaker 1: Yeah That's what they were actually promoting.

240
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,300
Speaker 0: Sengoku Basara, that's the show with the horses that have mufflers.

241
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had some really good promotion.

242
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:45,545
Speaker 1: basically, you know They're psycho mufflers not you know muffler mufflers.

243
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how Samurais wear flag on their back.

244
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,712
Speaker 0: They were set.

245
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:52,070
Speaker 0: they were giving out these Sengoku Basara flags for people to wear on their back.

246
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:56,550
Speaker 1: Realize if you know the e-commerce is coming along after the legal stuff is sorted out.

247
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,575
Speaker 1: Do you guys want like?

248
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:00,630
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone would really want this but I want to make some of those.

249
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:02,123
Speaker 0: That's all you.

250
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:13,459
Speaker 0: They had these two shamisen playing dudes who were not the Yoshida brothers But I went to see them just by chance like I kind of wanted to see them and I just happened to stay Arrive at their panel room.

251
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,130
Speaker 1: I really wanted to see him but I was at work.

252
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,882
Speaker 0: They were way awesome and they totally played smoke on the water on the shamisen.

253
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,166
Speaker 0: It was wicked crazy.

254
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,270
Speaker 1: Really like shamisen.

255
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,302
Speaker 0: Alright, uh, they're gonna be at Carnegie Hall in March.

256
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:24,703
Speaker 0: We can go.

257
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,430
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think you mentioned that before.

258
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,096
Speaker 1: We should get some tickets.

259
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a guy cosplaying.

260
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,820
Speaker 0: I don't know if he was cosplaying or if he was.

261
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,130
Speaker 0: you know a company paid for it to happen But he was the high chew King and he was giving out high chew.

262
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:41,090
Speaker 1: Actually, I saw a perfect Zangief, but I realized college humor was probably there.

263
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:44,160
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was the dude who played Zangief in the later years.

264
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,782
Speaker 0: You think so?

265
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:48,514
Speaker 1: You look exactly like that guy maybe Exactly.

266
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,430
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk to him, but I was actually in a hurry.

267
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:56,950
Speaker 0: I Went to Vamps panel, which I realized I learned a few things in this Vamps panel, right?

268
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:09,030
Speaker 0: basically, they had this guy come out who sort of worked with them in the US and He basically killed time and bullshitted for the vast majority of the panel Meaning that they only had to actually do their panel for a very short amount of time.

269
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,341
Speaker 1: We should hire someone to do that for us.

270
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:23,546
Speaker 0: Like imagine there's a panel It's our panel and then for the first 45 minutes some guy comes out in bullshits and then the cosplay Come out and answer questions very slowly for 15 minutes and then we leave.

271
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:29,056
Speaker 0: and that was you know I asked them if they ate crab Any to know that.

272
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,124
Speaker 0: I actually you know that I everyone laughed.

273
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,933
Speaker 0: but then I asked them what you know They're.

274
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,026
Speaker 0: the best meal they had was and one guy he ate.

275
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,002
Speaker 0: I forget what the one guy ate but the other guy had like a bagel.

276
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:40,366
Speaker 0: He thought was really good New York bagel That works Yeah.

277
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:41,876
Speaker 0: And then we went to the.

278
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:47,339
Speaker 0: the big thing was right before our panel was the Hatsune Miku panel With the guys from Krypton future media.

279
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,910
Speaker 1: now as always whenever I go to a panel like this Usually the people presenting it even it packs like big game people.

280
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:58,127
Speaker 1: They really know their stuff and they're important people, but they're really bad at presenting presenting skills.

281
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:58,990
Speaker 1: Not the grade.

282
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,010
Speaker 0: They basically just read off their PowerPoints, which was pretty sad, but the information they presented was pretty top-notch.

283
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gave us all this stuff.

284
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:14,283
Speaker 0: We learned about all this shit and I have it pretty much come to the conclusion That these guys the only guys in Japan that I know of so far

285
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,212
Speaker 1: other than maybe project X cup noodle Yeah

286
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:21,408
Speaker 0: that knows what the fuck is up in terms of like business models for the 21st.

287
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,753
Speaker 0: but here's why.

288
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,596
Speaker 1: here's why thank.

289
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:27,752
Speaker 0: the whole world can learn from these guys and the reason is is because they're Programmers.

290
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,359
Speaker 1: I was about to say they're technologists.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,257
Speaker 0: They know that they said open source like 20 times During their panel because they know.

292
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,670
Speaker 1: anyone who knows technology kind of has these obvious things.

293
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,349
Speaker 1: The only difference is they decided to actually pursue a business.

294
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,935
Speaker 0: Yeah Look the number.

295
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,763
Speaker 0: this guy was in charge of the company.

296
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:44,768
Speaker 0: number one guy.

297
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:48,840
Speaker 0: number one President founder of Krypton future media and he was a programmer.

298
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,163
Speaker 0: He was he wasn't a businessman.

299
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,610
Speaker 0: He wasn't an animator not a businessman.

300
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:58,230
Speaker 0: He wasn't entrenched in any old ways, you know And he understands open source and Linux and everything.

301
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,030
Speaker 0: And if you look this is why even you know, their Hatsune Miku character is so open source, right?

302
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,409
Speaker 0: They know what's up.

303
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:19,960
Speaker 0: They understand creative commons and free culture and that is why they are kicking everyone's ass so hard right, and they don't even have an anime or a manga Reno really and You know, meanwhile, they're just completely dominating.

304
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,530
Speaker 0: You know Miku is like taking over the whole world.

305
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:29,874
Speaker 1: Yeah there were like seven Hatsune Miku cosplayers at the panel and then a whole bunch more people cosplaying as other characters from the program

306
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:36,679
Speaker 0: and the panel was packed and they presented a whole bunch of really impressive statistics and You know, I could go on and on and on but they were.

307
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:39,894
Speaker 0: they were awesome dudes and I asked him what the first computer He had was.

308
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:41,787
Speaker 0: it was like an Apple LC 2 or whatever.

309
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:46,590
Speaker 1: Yeah What made me really happy though was that it seemed like the interest in the panel.

310
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,307
Speaker 1: Like I was worried that people showing up the panel were gonna be fangirls caring about.

311
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,950
Speaker 1: you know The the videos people have made or the music or the character.

312
00:17:54,492 --> 00:18:06,712
Speaker 1: But most of the people in the panel seemed primarily interested in getting a hold of the program in English and making stuff Yeah, and I think it bodes well for the future because what is it that we think makes gaming cons so much better than anime Cons?

313
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:11,173
Speaker 1: by and large the creator culture or at least the participate Participatory culture?

314
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:15,369
Speaker 0: the thing is the anime and comic cons of the artists alley and the gaming cons do not have that.

315
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:16,510
Speaker 0: You know.

316
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,570
Speaker 0: They don't have the the anime cons of the physic the physical space for that culture to live and the gaming cons don't.

317
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,502
Speaker 1: Every time I talk to keel I'm like.

318
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,956
Speaker 1: so we're gonna get an artist Elliot packs We're gonna get an artist Elliot packs.

319
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:27,198
Speaker 1: Come on.

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,002
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:28,867
Speaker 0: Go go go.

323
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, right We'll see.

324
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:32,404
Speaker 0: I think you'd need to talk to Dave though to get that one.

325
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:33,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's his name?

326
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,052

Speaker 1: yeah Kehil and you know pork fry and all the people that helped us do that.

328
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,657
Speaker 1: that thing we did That we did.

329
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,549
Speaker 1: that was bad that we may not ever do again.

330
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:46,997
Speaker 1: We do it again.

331
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,886
Speaker 1: It'll be like a moth turning into a butterfly.

332
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,596
Speaker 1: No, a better moth.

333
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:53,319
Speaker 0: Whatever.

334
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,461
Speaker 1: Anyway, so after that we did our panel which Was a panel.

335
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:01,310
Speaker 1: it was not the pan I want to talk about it though because we didn't plan to do that panel.

336
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,174
Speaker 1: We were gonna.

337
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:11,670
Speaker 1: we had all these other panel plans and then as the con got more and more Commercial and they brought more and more professionals doing their kind of you know I'm a professional who doesn't know how to present were very well panels.

338
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:19,418
Speaker 1: We cut it down to just one and then the one panel he wanted us to do was not even one I offered Yeah, I gave you.

339
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:19,962
Speaker 1: I had this list of.

340
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,777
Speaker 1: alright if we just want to do one Here are the three like awesome ones.

341
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,490
Speaker 1: pick one and they're like, why don't you do this one anime?

342
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,495
Speaker 1: You never thought you'd like.

343
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:30,956
Speaker 1: and I'm like, that's actually a two-hour screening That's not really a panel.

344
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,905
Speaker 1: and they were like, can you do a panel called that?

345
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:37,450
Speaker 1: and I was like, yeah I can do that and we threw it together and it was really popular.

346
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,093
Speaker 1: It was anime.

347
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,264
Speaker 0: You should see with a slightly different list of anime.

348
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:40,787
Speaker 1: Actually.

349
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:48,190
Speaker 1: It was about 75% different anime and we approached it from a side with a different list of anime, but we presented slightly different.

350
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,629
Speaker 0: We presented it in the same manner.

351
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,414
Speaker 1: Sort of we did.

352
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,942
Speaker 1: at least this was a panel.

353
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,690
Speaker 1: That was nothing more than an excuse to show.

354
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:56,817
Speaker 0: No, we always have the show.

355
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:57,179
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

356
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,673
Speaker 1: No, I feel like we should show that in every panel We ever do.

357
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:04,210
Speaker 0: it was great because I'm like, I'm gonna show Oh No But I saw it like the fifth row on the right.

358
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,010
Speaker 0: There was like a lady with her kids and the kids looked like they were six or eight.

359
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm like, I'm gonna show Oh No, and I'm like, well this is the North Star is for eight-year-olds in Japan.

360
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,163
Speaker 0: Yep, and I was looking at the same woman the whole time I was like and then she and then when Oh No happened she was laughing.

361
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,110
Speaker 0: I was like the mom was like hysterical.

362
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,095
Speaker 0: I was like, that's right.

363
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:27,765
Speaker 0: You can't withhold the power of the Oh No I'm glad we're on the same wavelength because those on kite can defeats all.

364
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:35,073
Speaker 1: because when we were doing the panel I said fuck just in the course of doing the panel and I immediately realized wait a minute and I noticed them and I was Like, oh, all right.

365
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:39,690
Speaker 1: I got a how we gonna do this and I'm glad that we at least had the same secret concern.

366
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, I always have that slight concern.

367
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:47,620
Speaker 0: Not that You know, not that I care about offending anyone depends.

368
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:48,423
Speaker 0: I just don't want.

369
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,290
Speaker 0: I just don't want them to complain to the convention.

370
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,655
Speaker 1: No, it depends on the con.

371
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:55,789
Speaker 1: I mean remember when someone complained about our rape glorification.

372
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:01,961
Speaker 0: exactly It's like I don't care about if I if I actually do a rape glorification panel I just don't want someone to complain to the convention about me.

373
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:07,442
Speaker 1: I kind of do because that gets attention Negative yeah, but you know this depends on the con like packs.

374
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,794
Speaker 1: if someone complained about us swearing at a panel What do you think?

375
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:17,750
Speaker 0: He'll is gonna say he's gonna say what they swear at the Q&A What the fuck is what he's gonna say.

376
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:30,090
Speaker 1: But the cool thing was hardly anyone at the panel knew who we were which meant there are people who are still fans of anime Even though I think the majority of the people at this con were comic or Hollywood fans and they were not anime fans.

377
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:33,044
Speaker 0: Someone wrote a great article that they put up today on their blog.

378
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:34,671
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get the link for it right.

379
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:49,950
Speaker 0: pretty much talking about the anime ghetto right and I was sort of 50/50 on it is the one thing is The con had the big expo Hall area and in the expo Hall area was all the dealers of and all the exhibitors Right, but they were segregated.

380
00:21:50,090 --> 00:22:03,310
Speaker 0: so like in the back right corner was selling plastic toys in like the pop cult zone and in the front right area was all The guys selling old dusty comic books and in the front left was all like the big boos from big companies.

381
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:08,017
Speaker 1: They made it way too easy to just go to the parts You cared about and not see random.

382
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:16,886
Speaker 0: in the middle was like the comic publishers that you know Weren't Marvel in DC and in the you know And all the anime people were in sort of the middle right in the back.

383
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:17,710
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mix it up.

384
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:25,809
Speaker 1: I would have been like guy with a rage spider-man guy with swords guy with yeah I mean sci-fi continuum was actually in the middle left sort of on its own.

385
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,819
Speaker 0: there I was like, yes, I have a continuum good spot Selling good stuff best dealer at every anime.

386
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,230
Speaker 0: con can't lose course part of the trouble about some lone wolf and cub volumes.

387
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,160
Speaker 1: What anime dealers are there that are left?

388
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,223
Speaker 1: I mean all the anime stuff.

389
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:40,190
Speaker 0: that was anime castle anime pavilion.

390
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,684
Speaker 1: What they're selling?

391
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:58,250
Speaker 1: they're selling the same The same job is or or they've got Mangas I say cheap DVDs because the DVDs No one in the dealer's room could beat Amazon by even within not even the six dollar DVD booth.

392
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,137
Speaker 1: Are you kidding the six dollar DVD booth?

393
00:23:00,197 --> 00:23:07,770
Speaker 0: I found some of the stuff for like two bucks on Amazon, but they had like He had like Ghostbusters one and two together for six bucks.

394
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, I already own that.

395
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:12,448
Speaker 0: and they had like all of She-Ra all of it six bucks.

396
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:16,462
Speaker 1: All right I'll clarify there were some good deals on non anime.

397
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,307
Speaker 0: Okay, but anime, okay They didn't have any anime at the six dollar DVD booth.

398
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was no anime.

399
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,710
Speaker 0: and that con as far as I could tell that was Continuum had there, you know, you can get all of Pat LeVoir for like, you know, 60 bucks total.

400
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,583
Speaker 1: That's like three separate boxes and look how much it is online.

401
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,090
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah about the same.

402
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:37,390
Speaker 1: I was walking around with my smartphone for like an hour and I couldn't find a single deal anyway.

403
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:41,284
Speaker 0: And then they had like it because there was construction going on at the Javits.

404
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:42,810
Speaker 0: So that was the expo area.

405
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,875
Speaker 0: Then they had another area.

406
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:51,586
Speaker 0: That was the comic artists alley the sort of You know exhibitors that aren't really exhibitors like the podcasters and some other folks.

407
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,873
Speaker 1: or I guess Tally was cool But a little sad.

408
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:58,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, then there was like a variant stage which is just the annoying stage.

409
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:06,210
Speaker 1: Oh my god Did not want to be anywhere near that thing, you know Jedis and that sort of shit they had that by the by the maid cafe.

410
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,859
Speaker 0: No, that was not the very no.

411
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,850
Speaker 0: I'm saying that was the maid stay.

412
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:12,700
Speaker 1: I know what I'm saying is in the maid cafe.

413
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,807
Speaker 1: There was another stage just like that.

414
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,655
Speaker 0: That was just no It wasn't just like.

415
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,579
Speaker 0: it was completely different.

416
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,950
Speaker 0: In fact, they're annoying people yelling on it.

417
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:30,119
Speaker 0: Okay, the variant stage has a schedule right and there's actually the groups that are on the variant stage Scheduled to be on there like, you know The Mario Bueno guy and the Jedi's and all those people.

418
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,169
Speaker 0: the maid stage is just whatever the fuck.

419
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,750
Speaker 0: I think you can just go up there and sing and do whatever you want every time.

420
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:37,854
Speaker 0: Schedule for it.

421
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:40,243
Speaker 1: There were the same people running game shows up there.

422
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:41,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just decided to do that.

423
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,065
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is they were equal from a from a fan perspective walking around the con.

424
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,878
Speaker 1: they were equally annoying Mainly because they were way too loud.

425
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:57,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing was is I think that the impressions Is that is that people think that these stages are popular and that's why they keep them.

426
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,646
Speaker 0: But the fact is people are sitting near these stages because that's the only place this.

427
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:01,470
Speaker 0: tables and chairs.

428
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:10,461
Speaker 1: Yep if you know if you had tables and chairs away from all this sad moment in the anime ghetto where someone's trying to work up The crowd and literally no one there is saying anything.

429
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:13,110
Speaker 1: They're like facing away like sitting at their table reading comics.

430
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:17,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just wanted a place to sit which happens to be near this annoying stage You know.

431
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:20,766
Speaker 0: and while the people on the stage love the stage people sitting near the stage.

432
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,673
Speaker 0: Nobody gives a shit To go.

433
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:23,537
Speaker 1: I want to do.

434
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,170
Speaker 1: if packs ever had like an artist alley equivalent like a beat bring your own awesome room.

435
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,592
Speaker 0: They do it.

436
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,482
Speaker 1: I want there to be a stage in that room.

437
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,850
Speaker 0: They have many stages of packs.

438
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,839
Speaker 0: They have the mode mostly musical though.

439
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,090
Speaker 0: You can go to the the you know, the magfest room.

440
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want a generic stage and they have the rock band stage.

441
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,630
Speaker 1: I want the stage where some weirdos gonna get up there and do something weird and questionable.

442
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:46,090
Speaker 0: So you go and they could just be a sign-up sheet and you sign up and you get ten minutes.

443
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,890
Speaker 0: Yeah period for set up and everything and that's it.

444
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,734
Speaker 1: I think that'd be cool.

445
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,361
Speaker 0: the ten minute sign-up stage.

446
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:55,880
Speaker 0: you get up there you get ten minutes do whatever you want You can give it you can get a soapbox it you can do whatever.

447
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,830
Speaker 1: um one victory from the con.

448
00:25:58,295 --> 00:25:59,610
Speaker 1: We did our when we did our panel, right?

449
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,590
Speaker 1: We did the woo game thing and we tricked.

450
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:02,632
Speaker 1: You know We people did woo.

451
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:08,130
Speaker 1: we give him the woo game and for the first time ever the crowd listened and I realized the problem.

452
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:18,806
Speaker 1: If you stop the woo game No one was reacting to anything for the rep Like the second half of the panel other than this one guy on the front who was basically breaking his nose Trying to show me that he knew all the anime.

453
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:22,430
Speaker 1: he was cool But there was like no visual feedback at all.

454
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,487
Speaker 1: And then at the very end of the panel when everyone was like that was awesome.

455
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:26,050
Speaker 1: That was awesome.

456
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,670
Speaker 1: I was like, oh we didn't bomb it cuz everyone just said you guys I could tell when I'm doing.

457
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,054
Speaker 0: I don't see.

458
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:31,570
Speaker 0: the thing is for a panel like that.

459
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Speaker 0: I don't even need the audience reaction anymore to know if it's doing and if I'm doing it right or doing it wrong.

460
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:37,398
Speaker 1: We will prove that we got to do it on video.

461
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's your video.

462
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:39,950
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

463
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:43,801
Speaker 0: The only other thing is so the anime right.

464
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:45,610
Speaker 0: so there was the main expo area.

465
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:53,250
Speaker 0: It was the sort of secondary expo area with the gigantic awesome comic artists alley the autographs the variant stage and the podcast errors and whatnot.

466
00:26:53,972 --> 00:27:00,150
Speaker 0: And then there was the comic panel area which is down into the right which all the comic-con panels were in this ghetto hallway.

467
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,135
Speaker 0: That was pretty much empty.

468
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:01,799
Speaker 0: the whole that was.

469
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:02,683
Speaker 1: I went there Sunday.

470
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:03,910
Speaker 1: I have some videos I grabbed.

471
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,149
Speaker 1: It was very early empty.

472
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,263
Speaker 1: There were maybe 50 people spread out through that entire area.

473
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,490
Speaker 0: comic people were not interested in going to panels.

474
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,513
Speaker 0: But I think there were like a few incredibly famous people panels that yeah I saw.

475
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:23,506
Speaker 1: some of those got a big crowd and then I saw a lot of them were like Person like semi-famous person or comic arts or something doing a panel and there was there's.

476
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,739
Speaker 1: there was no one in those rooms Maybe like five or ten people.

477
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,807
Speaker 1: they were all pretty much empty.

478
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:31,462
Speaker 1: well And if you walked all the way down to the back I don't think anyone even knew there were panel rooms over there.

479
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:32,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are hidden panel rooms.

480
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,643
Speaker 1: I saw three panels on Sunday in that hallway that had panelists sitting on stage.

481
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:41,764
Speaker 1: their panels had been quote unquote going for like 20 Minutes and there was no one in the audience.

482
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:42,510
Speaker 1: They were just sitting there.

483
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:46,385
Speaker 0: That was the comic-con panels, but and they had another areas the anime area.

484
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:47,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, our panel was like full.

485
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:50,033
Speaker 1: Close the door.

486
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,845
Speaker 0: they had an anime artists alley which I'm sort of for and against.

487
00:27:53,865 --> 00:28:00,747
Speaker 0: right because it's like on the one hand you Can't charge the girl with the bookmarks the same money You're charging the comic people which is a lot of money, right?

488
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:06,669
Speaker 0: So put them in the same table and it would be unfair to put them at the same tables in the same area and charge different amounts.

489
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,594
Speaker 0: But Right on the other hand.

490
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,850
Speaker 0: It's unfair to sort of put them in this ghetto, you know far away from all the action.

491
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:14,513
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

492
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:20,240
Speaker 1: if I were one of those anime people and I knew I could do well I would have just gotten a table with a comic-con instead.

493
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll cost too much.

494
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:22,910
Speaker 0: They can't afford it.

495
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,741
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be economically feasible for them.

496
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:33,790
Speaker 0: You know some high school girl, whatever the other thing was is like You know, they sort of hid the anime people away.

497
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:42,673
Speaker 0: Yeah The only people who saw any of that anime stuff were people who sought it out on purpose and most people just like didn't go Down there at all.

498
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:56,960
Speaker 0: and even people I knew who sort of wanted to get like a mixed experience And see everything and get an idea for it didn't go down there because it was a ghetto and they just didn't end up going Down there because it was out of the way in another place.

499
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:59,110
Speaker 0: and really you got to mix it up.

500
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,790
Speaker 0: You know, the thing is what's the point of you know, this segregation, you know?

501
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,846
Speaker 0: Mix it all up so that people end up being forced to experience all this different stuff.

502
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:08,910
Speaker 0: That's what it's all about.

503
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,410
Speaker 1: I think the trouble is and this is where why Pax is such an example.

504
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,458
Speaker 1: I know we always harp on how awesome Pax.

505
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:17,470
Speaker 0: They got the tabletop and the video games and it's all mix.

506
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:18,554
Speaker 1: Oh, but not just that.

507
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:23,030
Speaker 1: I have a very particular and specific point because Pax is this third way.

508
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,403
Speaker 1: We've got one way the Otacon way, which is we're fans.

509
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,250
Speaker 1: The industry will never be the boss of us.

510
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:33,462
Speaker 1: We're gonna do everything, you know in a kind of unprofessional way Internally, like we're all just fans.

511
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,286
Speaker 1: No professionals.

512
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:35,050
Speaker 1: No industry.

513
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,299
Speaker 1: Tell us what to do and you all know the problems that causes.

514
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:48,090
Speaker 1: the exact opposite side of that is the ultra professional Only really doing it for the money and what the industry wants which is mostly what the New York Comic Con anime festival was.

515
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:51,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, the third way is what Pax is doing which is in the middle.

516
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,450
Speaker 1: They're saying they've made themselves to the point where the industry needs them.

517
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,595
Speaker 1: They don't need the industry because the people would go to that con if there were zero industry and it was just people playing games Yep, and I feel like.

518
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:21,310
Speaker 1: but at the same time while they're a fan convention really they run the convention in a professional manner Yes, and like if anime cons ran themselves internally like professionals if they acted like adult professionals Even if they still told the industry to fuck itself They would be awesome.

519
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:26,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, that third way is the way to go and Pax is the only convention I've ever seen.

520
00:30:26,086 --> 00:30:28,177
Speaker 1: Magfest might be closed But Magfest is kind of.

521
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:29,385
Speaker 0: we've never been to Magfest.

522
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,070
Speaker 0: We don't know what it's like.

523
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're just going based on the culture of it, which is similar to our culture.

524
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,598
Speaker 0: We don't actually know how it's run.

525
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,283
Speaker 1: We'll find out.

526
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:36,210
Speaker 1: I'm excited about it.

527
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna.

528
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,130
Speaker 0: it's probably a good party, but I feel four days.

529
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:49,565
Speaker 1: but I feel like the New York Comic Con New York anime festival combined is Really harmed by the fact that if you look at where the money is and you chart the money based on who was Important Hollywood.

530
00:30:49,868 --> 00:31:04,346
Speaker 1: Yes the top of like the top of the comic-con hierarchy is Hollywood and under that is Big comic people like Stan Lee, you know I love on DC and under that is the indie comics and under that is old-school comics.

531
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,432
Speaker 1: under that is like Gaming.

532
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:07,335
Speaker 1: cuz Watsy was there.

533
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:08,138
Speaker 1: They had a little thing.

534
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:08,539
Speaker 0: Yep.

535
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,438
Speaker 1: Yeah the whole area under that is Professional anime industry.

536
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,130
Speaker 1: under that is fan done anime stuff.

537
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:20,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's you know, it was sort of you know, I would have rather had the con be all mix.

538
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,583
Speaker 0: You know have mix all the panel rooms together.

539
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:33,810
Speaker 0: be like, okay in this room It's gonna be Stan Lee at 10 followed by Riven Scott followed by a showing of some anime followed by indie comics company followed by Vamps I guess all in the same room.

540
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:41,782
Speaker 1: I guess my worry is that and my guess is that the anime convention will never go away the anime aspect of it But it will not grow and if anything it is only there.

541
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:42,907
Speaker 0: it was already not growing.

542
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:47,888
Speaker 1: That's why they merged it I know and I think it's only going to exist in that ghetto forever and it's only going to be there to.

543
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:53,550
Speaker 1: you know All I've noticed that there's the same group of people like anime fans that go to every single anime related thing in New York.

544
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,174
Speaker 1: Yeah Every anime thing.

545
00:31:55,194 --> 00:32:00,051
Speaker 1: they're there and they'll all go to this forever and they don't bother with the comic-con stuff and the comic-con doesn't bother With them.

546
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,778
Speaker 1: Yep, kind of sad.

547
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,601
Speaker 0: It's gonna.

548
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:10,186
Speaker 0: it's a way to easily up the numbers, you know They put in a tiny little artists alley They put in some panel rooms and they get a whole.

549
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:10,930
Speaker 0: they get all that.

550
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,434
Speaker 0: You know time people coming in.

551
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:18,290
Speaker 1: there was one good panel that had a bunch of audience at the comic-con area on Sunday.

552
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:18,809
Speaker 0: What was it?

553
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,905
Speaker 1: It was the kind of panel that we would do or that an anime person would do.

554
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:23,488
Speaker 0: who was doing it?

555
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:23,990
Speaker 1: if they were?

556
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,190
Speaker 1: I Don't even know but if you were doing like at an anime con they did the archaeology of Indiana Jones.

557
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:31,621
Speaker 1: Oh interesting like how you know, what was feasible?

558
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:32,184
Speaker 1: What wasn't?

559
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:33,410
Speaker 1: where'd all these legends come from?

560
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,112
Speaker 1: What would you know?

561
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,962
Speaker 1: What did they use and not you?

562
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,027
Speaker 0: it was really well done.

563
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:39,616
Speaker 1: I like that Yeah, and it was packed nice.

564
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:41,041
Speaker 1: and yet that was.

565
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,170
Speaker 1: that was not the average panel in the comic.

566
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:47,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of the comic panel areas were we're a company.

567
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:53,090
Speaker 1: We're gonna make our announcements and They looked like we're a company.

568
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,530
Speaker 1: We're doing this panels that we can then say in a press release that we did this panel.

569
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it seemed like as no one was in those panels.

570
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:10,086
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day.

571
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:15,080
Speaker 1: this guy made a shrubbery shaped like a cock and balls and he got in trouble with the law.

572
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:18,973
Speaker 0: That's it You must give us.

573
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:28,406
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good cock and balls - So this guy he's.

574
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,309
Speaker 0: he works at Sega.

575
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,052
Speaker 0: his name is Jerry.

576
00:33:30,232 --> 00:33:40,020
Speaker 0: he got married to some hot lady named cat And their cake for their wedding was shaped like the macross, however, it was not just shaped like the macross.

577
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,257
Speaker 0: They also made recreated a scene from macross the.

578
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,376
Speaker 0: you know The wedding flight is the scene that is recreated for.

579

580
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,594
Speaker 1: That's pretty awesome.

581
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:57,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at that not bad.

00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:17,101
Speaker 0: That's it.

591
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:18,184
Speaker 0: Any other metas?

592
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,547
Speaker 1: now, let's get right on because I want to talk about our show.

593
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:23,146
Speaker 0: All right Well, it's what's your show?

594
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:25,536
Speaker 1: So our show the anime we watch.

595
00:34:25,556 --> 00:34:26,139
Speaker 1: we're gonna review it.

596
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:32,820
Speaker 1: It's something I don't think many of you have seen and the subtitles that I watched were translated from Russian to English.

597
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:42,692
Speaker 0: Well, that's because this anime was actually a Russian Japanese co-production in 1969. that's really really old like way old.

598
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,820
Speaker 1: and guess who did the key animation?

599
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:50,101
Speaker 0: Well, one of the people did the key animation was Miyazaki in 69.

600
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:54,797
Speaker 0: He was animating this movie and the thing is it's only a 60-minute movie, which is kind of.

601
00:34:54,877 --> 00:34:55,760
Speaker 0: it's kind of nice, right?

602
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,520
Speaker 0: It's like you get an anime movie.

603
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:59,725
Speaker 0: They don't have to wait 90 minutes.

604
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:00,888
Speaker 0: You only gotta wait 60 minutes.

605
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:01,249
Speaker 0: It's over.

606
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,215
Speaker 1: It might have been nice had it been better.

607
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:12,353
Speaker 1: Oh snap so The flying ghost ship is literally about a flying ghost ship.

608
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,499
Speaker 0: really you don't say it's.

609
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:19,777
Speaker 1: They started out and you expect it to follow this certain kind of vibe.

610
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:23,960
Speaker 0: right in the beginning It was sort of Hardy Boys sort of Johnny Quest sort of Scooby Doo, right?

611
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,676
Speaker 0: You know, there's a kid on a boat with his parents and he's got a dog.

612
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,930
Speaker 0: The dog doesn't talk but it has a lot of personality.

613
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,100
Speaker 1: now now this dog is basically Scooby.

614
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:37,460
Speaker 1: It's Scooby Doo, but it doesn't talk and the kid Hayato is even wearing a goddamn ascot.

615
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:44,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know he's not it's not Scooby Doo cuz he doesn't talk but it is might as well be right and the kid is basically Fred.

616
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but none of the other Scooby cast is in it It's just him know.

617
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:53,077
Speaker 1: so Hayato is on the boat with his family and this gets into space.

618
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:58,943
Speaker 0: crabs in the end Don't play you skipping and spoiling the crab people That's not.

619
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:00,452
Speaker 1: that's not the spoiler the spoilers.

620
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,820
Speaker 1: who was running the crab people?

621
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway, they see a car crash right and they go to investigate.

622
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:07,519
Speaker 0: now that way and his eight people?

623
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,939
Speaker 1: now Here's where it gets crazy.

624
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:17,560
Speaker 1: so Hayato is just on the boat with his dad and everything's all cool and Everyone likes to hold their mouths open for a way long time after they stopped talking.

625
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:20,440
Speaker 0: They also like to sense because it was Russian mouth movements.

626
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:27,989
Speaker 1: But they also when they're just like they're not talking and a character just kind of looking at something Their mouth is usually open and their brows furrowed.

627
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,659
Speaker 1: They make the look that someone who is dumb and angry makes.

628
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,209
Speaker 1: I Wasn't looking that close and they make this.

629
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:42,439
Speaker 1: they basically look like this all the time But like it kind of looks like the guy in that one Perry Bible Fellowship with the scar-eyed shark and he figures it out.

630
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,785
Speaker 1: They all kind of make that face.

631
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,236
Speaker 1: now Jack has this bag and they never really explain the dog.

632
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:49,858
Speaker 0: Jack's the dog.

633
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:52,597
Speaker 1: Jack the dog Has this bag and he's got all his stuff in it.

634
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:56,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't really explain it Like we let in the beginning.

635
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,914
Speaker 0: the subtitle is like we let you hold the bag But then throughout the rest of the movie, it's pretty much just like it's they make.

636
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,660
Speaker 0: it's sort of like it's the dog's bag.

637
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:09,363
Speaker 0: It belongs to him Yeah, and he keeps all the points in it his doggy stuff in the bag and it's just a thing He has.

638
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:11,554
Speaker 0: they don't really explain why or how it's got.

639
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:16,160
Speaker 0: I like the idea of like Especially that one part where he sort of whips it around his neck, you know, that was a key.

640
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like.

641
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,694
Speaker 1: he's like I'm courage dog now.

642
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:19,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go.

643
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,260
Speaker 1: So but they see a car accident, right?

644
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,800
Speaker 1: They're on a boat and this car just flies off a cliff like a hundred feet up and crashes upside down.

645
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,553
Speaker 0: They go and investigate and it's the boss of the company the dads works for.

646
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,822
Speaker 0: that's like if I work for Microsoft and I saw A car crash.

647
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:34,425
Speaker 0: I go and investigate.

648
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:35,047
Speaker 0: It's Bill Gates.

649
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:35,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's mr.

650
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:36,273
Speaker 1: Kuro.

00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:37,518
Speaker 0: She is Steve bomber.

652
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:42,595
Speaker 1: Oh shit I thought it was Kuro Shiro, but no, she is Kuro Shiro.

653
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz Emily was like black white.

Speaker 1: a skeleton in the road the fuck's wrong with.

678
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:49,072

682
00:38:58,178 --> 00:39:02,170
Speaker 0: this time At least this kid Hayato is just like a ghost.

683
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,857
Speaker 0: really sometimes they did.

684
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:05,685
Speaker 0: I'm eight years old I don't believe in that shit.

685
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,879
Speaker 1: Sometimes they take the mask off and it's red herring.

686
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:14,565
Speaker 0: That's wrong show that's Canon.

687
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:18,714
Speaker 0: it's not canon because it happens away in the future.

688
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:22,128
Speaker 1: now the funny thing is when they're on the boat in the beginning It's canon.

689
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:30,360
Speaker 1: if they age like Merlin They have this weird shot where they show his mom like look at this perfect smiling mom and that reeked of she's totally gonna die.

00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:32,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, she totally dies.

691
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:38,940
Speaker 1: But anyway, so they get into the spooky mansion and it's full of like Ravens and just crazy.

692
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:45,082
Speaker 1: It's totally spooky all over the place on purpose and everyone's afraid and they lay everybody down and then immediately What do they do?

693
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,769
Speaker 1: The dad's like let's split up.

694
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,155
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go get firewood.

695
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:49,440
Speaker 1: you guys wander around.

696
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:52,068
Speaker 0: So they wander around and investigate.

697
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:53,032
Speaker 1: they leave courage.

698
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,820
Speaker 1: Oh just laying on the couch unconscious still.

699
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:58,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like he's gonna wake up and empty in this empty scary house.

700
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:03,320
Speaker 0: He'll think he's in hell or some shit You don't know anyway or think he's been kidnapped.

701
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:13,978
Speaker 1: Oh remember when the wife first wakes up on the road and she's like lightning strikes and she sees the dad's face and she's like For no reason and then she's like, oh, oh, it's just a guy just a dude.

702
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:14,460
Speaker 0: That's a dude.

703
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:22,511
Speaker 0: Alright, let's uh, so they investigate and of course they find a skeleton Rooting through the fridge a guy in a skeleton mask.

704
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,096
Speaker 0: No clearly living in the fridge.

705
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:25,320
Speaker 1: It must be a real skeleton.

706
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:33,140
Speaker 1: Yeah real skeletons go in fridges all the time, but it's rooted in the fridge and The way they were they literally walk into the room and there's a guy rooting through the fridge.

707
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,664
Speaker 1: they tap on the back he turns around skeleton face and it just cuts between the skeletons face and The mom's face.

708
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,834
Speaker 0: Well, no the the what the wife the wife of Kuroshio's face.

709
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:49,598
Speaker 1: and there is this like 30-second scene where she makes all these different faces, but doesn't scream.

710
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:55,991
Speaker 1: She's like And then she screams.

711
00:40:56,374 --> 00:41:01,437
Speaker 0: yeah, like it is hilarious I basically showed every state and then the animation in this isn't?

712
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,165
Speaker 0: you know There's no music to speak of.

713
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:11,756
Speaker 0: really right and the animation is pretty like, you know The drawing and the colors are actually pretty good for 69, but the animation is a lot of panning.

714
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:20,219
Speaker 0: There's a lot of You know still shot with the moving mouth, you know, there's a lot of back, you know You know the water just goes wish wish wish wish back and forth.

715
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:26,960
Speaker 1: There's a lot of times where like a particular like movement is really really well animated and everything else is just completely static.

716
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:31,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the dog whips the bag around his neck is really well animated but at the background

717
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:53,339
Speaker 1: The wife screaming because you know angry video game nerd James Rolfe is doing his monster madness right now and in old 50s horror movies It's a common trope for a woman to you know The heroine to run into like a skeleton face like in the screaming skull and not scream right away But just like stare in increasing shock and then scream and pass out.

718
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,632
Speaker 1: Yep, and that is what she does but the way it is animated.

719
00:41:56,652 --> 00:42:01,060
Speaker 1: I was laughing so hard it hurts Like I couldn't deal with it.

720
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,964
Speaker 0: So then the this after they run away from that the dad comes back with a firewood and then eventually the police show up But before the police.

721
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:10,278
Speaker 1: no, no, no, the police don't show up before

00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:14,296
Speaker 1: chief of defense for the country shows up, but

724
00:42:14,336 --> 00:42:22,202
Speaker 0: before he shows up Basically the goat does the skeleton haunts them and scares them and tells them spooky mess Which was

725
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:25,454
Speaker 1: good because up until that point they forget about that skeleton pretty quick.

726
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:34,460
Speaker 1: They run away and the dad's like hey Hey, and then the skeleton shows up and it's like, oh you're bad There's a good series of scares where they get back and they're there.

727
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,755
Speaker 1: They're like, oh my god, there was a skeleton and then something's coming.

728
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,763
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the dogs the thing You know, it's the dead.

729
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:40,646
Speaker 1: something's coming.

730
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:41,950
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the skeleton.

731
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is obviously though.

732
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,040
Speaker 0: The skeleton was not real.

733
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,440
Speaker 0: It's totally got a mask, right?

734
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,409
Speaker 0: and it's like how is he scaring them from this window?

735
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,648
Speaker 0: and if the kid throws a rock at the window and breaks the Window and it goes right through the skeleton.

736
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,174
Speaker 1: It's like I want to call bullshit.

737
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:59,088
Speaker 0: on a later scene later scene They say that he says oh, yeah That was using a projector onto the glass.

738
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:01,960
Speaker 0: then shouldn't the part of the glass that was broken made?

739
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:05,091
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know made part of the skeleton disappear, but it didn't.

740
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:09,466
Speaker 1: but the ghost is like, ooh I'm a spooky ghost.

741
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:11,051
Speaker 1: I was murdered.

742
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:16,328
Speaker 1: I was left on a boat and burned by someone And then the cops come.

743
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:17,414
Speaker 1: he's like I gotta go.

744
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,258
Speaker 0: now The cops are coming.

745
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:28,320
Speaker 0: I Yeah, ha all the cops, you know if I can bust out and goes never do that.

746
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:33,020
Speaker 1: But then as soon as the chief of defense comes curse, he was like, yeah that guy's back.

747
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:35,150
Speaker 1: We got to do something about this ghost ship.

748
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:40,139
Speaker 0: So you immediately know that The red herring girl she was a bad guy.

749
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:49,519
Speaker 1: So then the movie just kind of picks up with the kid and his family just doing the normal stuff like dad and kid are In a car in the city and then a robot attacks the town.

750
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:54,380
Speaker 0: Yeah out of nowhere a giant robot attacks the city and smashes the fuck out of everything.

751
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,104
Speaker 0: It's like what.

752
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,254
Speaker 0: what the hell did that have to do with scooby-doo?

753
00:43:57,274 --> 00:43:58,460
Speaker 0: suddenly scooby-doo is over.

754
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:00,780
Speaker 0: It's astro boy time, but the lead-up to this is awesome.

755
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:06,568
Speaker 1: There's like five full minutes of the kid being like I like to drink boa juice And he's like you shouldn't drink so much of that.

756
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:12,879
Speaker 1: and then they're just talking about mom and talking about stuff It's like.

757
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,050
Speaker 1: But they kind of goes down like it's a weird.

758
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,160
Speaker 1: they say it funny but they use that.

759
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,174
Speaker 1: I think they showed this on TV and actually use those as the commercial brakes.

760
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:30,720
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know I wouldn't be surprised anyway But then then suddenly your traffic's been stopped for a long time like they're stuck in traffic and normally in a show.

761
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:31,826
Speaker 1: That's just kind of like you.

762
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:33,716
Speaker 1: don't worry about that in this.

763
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:40,280
Speaker 1: after a while The dad's like, you know The traffic hasn't moved in a while and then immediately fucking tanks destroy every goddamn car on the road.

764
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:45,337
Speaker 0: Yeah the tank the tanks that which are people are driving them trying to help save the town from the robot.

765
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:51,418
Speaker 0: the Military in the tank doesn't care about killing people and then they fail to kill the robot.

766
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:52,000
Speaker 1: but it's great.

767
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:59,634
Speaker 1: The tanks just crush all these cars probably kill a whole bunch of people and then they just start shooting and then the camera spins Around and you see they're shooting at some building.

768
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,683
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's not a building It's a giant robot.

769
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:07,784
Speaker 1: and then golem the robot says I am golem the robot the robot who was sent to destroy you by the Ghost ship.

770
00:45:07,926 --> 00:45:09,420
Speaker 1: I am golem goes robot.

771
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,200
Speaker 0: So golem is working for the ghost ship and to destroy the town and the military is fighting back.

772
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:18,740
Speaker 0: And you haven't even seen the ghost ship yet, so all you know is the title is flying ghost ship.

773
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:25,853
Speaker 0: So it's like why would the ghost ship that I don't even know about Anything where it's comes from or anything about it send a robot to destroy the town?

774
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,003
Speaker 1: and the robot isn't using missiles or heat get Erase or anything.

775
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:33,460
Speaker 1: He just has two big mace fists and he's just fucking smashing stuff, but he's gigantic.

776
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,704
Speaker 0: He's bigger than a skyscraper.

777
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:41,325
Speaker 1: So he is smashing shit up big time and they show you you're pretty sure the body count on this Movie is astronaut.

778
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,152
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure most of the people in the world are dead.

779
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:55,360
Speaker 0: if that was New York City like Millions are dead millions of people would have been killed in that robot attack and they actually do a somewhat Astro-boyish job of portraying the fact that all these people actually did die.

780
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,700
Speaker 0: It was a horrible massacre catastrophe that spanned many miles in many bodies.

781
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,880
Speaker 1: The dead is pretty smart because he you know, he gets hit on the head and it sounds like I'll take you to the hospital.

782
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,847
Speaker 1: He's like the hospital.

783
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:06,370
Speaker 1: Are you kidding?

784
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,075
Speaker 1: Let's just go home.

785
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:10,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Sure enough home smashed mom's dead.

786
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:25,020
Speaker 1: And thus this is why Leiji Matsumoto is a brilliant brilliant man because when he wants to do melodrama He has motherfucking melodrama up in your business and you cannot help but get caught up in his melodrama moment.

787
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,259
Speaker 0: That's right this movie.

788
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:34,086
Speaker 1: The kid is sitting there crying over his dead mom and it's a great scene and the man for many minutes He is just screaming.

789
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:34,790
Speaker 1: Why did you die?

790
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,595
Speaker 1: Why did you leave me?

791
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:36,460
Speaker 1: Very melodramatic.

792
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:42,220
Speaker 1: Then his dad is like, how's mom is she gonna make it and he's like mom just died.

793
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:46,404
Speaker 1: And then the dad's like I'm gonna die soon, too But you're not my son.

794
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:51,860
Speaker 1: and then the dad dies and then there's double melodrama and it's like mom dies dad dies.

795
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,176
Speaker 1: You're not my son all at once.

796
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:58,176
Speaker 1: No, Matt, no elegance or mastery was used in this melodrama.

797
00:46:58,397 --> 00:46:59,340
Speaker 0: None whatsoever.

798
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:00,446
Speaker 0: It immediately goes off.

799
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:02,155
Speaker 0: I didn't care at all.

800
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,265
Speaker 1: I was like, okay The mom death was sad.

801
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:07,893
Speaker 0: the mom didn't even have any lines she was just seemed.

802
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:16,300
Speaker 0: oh she said she said okay Okay, she was definitely, you know, she was definitely portrayed as a cool mom, but she didn't say anything or do anything.

803
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,355
Speaker 1: She said okay when his dad said go behind the police in the boat.

804
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:23,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right But it was literally like he's crying over his mom.

805
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:32,211
Speaker 1: He's crying over his dad and then it cuts to him standing by himself on top of the ruins of his house with the dog Looking all melodramatic and hopeful and sad and everything.

806
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:34,239
Speaker 1: and then he tells the dog he hates it and go away.

807
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:35,062
Speaker 1: and then he says Never mind.

808
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:35,786
Speaker 1: I love you dog.

809
00:47:35,826 --> 00:47:37,415
Speaker 1: And it's just all this drama.

810
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:38,380
Speaker 1: That's going nowhere.

811
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:40,806
Speaker 0: And then what does he decide to do?

812
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:42,471
Speaker 0: to go to mr.

813
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,120
Speaker 0: Kuroshio's house the evil head of the company?

814
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,883
Speaker 0: He doesn't know he's evil.

815
00:47:45,923 --> 00:47:47,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, he gets adopted basically.

816
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, he like goes gets adopted by mr.

817
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:49,781
Speaker 0: Kuroshio Cuz.

818
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:50,846
Speaker 0: he doesn't have anywhere else to go.

819
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:53,360
Speaker 0: He doesn't have any friends or family or anything.

820
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:57,500
Speaker 1: They probably all got crushed by the robot and they're like, all right your stepson now, that's cool.

821
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:00,576
Speaker 0: It's like really I'll go to Bill Gates house if that's gonna work.

822
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:04,217
Speaker 1: and then immediately golem comes back and attacks the ghost ship.

823
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:06,286
Speaker 1: and This is when things get awesome.

824
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,900
Speaker 1: because the ghost ship before you see like this like ghost ship floating out in the water.

825
00:48:10,442 --> 00:48:14,840
Speaker 1: It just fucking flies out of the water and has missiles coming out of it and it just fight.

826
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:22,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like a really old busted ship like a ghost ship, but it's got really modern missiles and shop coming out of it.

827
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,249
Speaker 0: So obviously inside it's a modern ship.

828
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:26,920
Speaker 1: I like how they show the same features technologies.

829
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,637
Speaker 1: They show the same missile coming out like a hundred times.

830
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:30,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

831
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:32,229
Speaker 0: So it's like wait a minute.

832
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,660
Speaker 0: I thought golem was working for go ship.

833
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,515
Speaker 0: Why is golem fighting go ship and the kid doesn't know who to root for?

834
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,599
Speaker 0: cuz he's like fuck that evil.

835
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:38,940
Speaker 0: go ship.

836
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,854
Speaker 0: Wait, fuck that evil golem who killed my parents.

837
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:41,539
Speaker 0: Wait, what what?

838
00:48:42,601 --> 00:48:47,116
Speaker 1: so of course the kid wanders around in the mansion of Kuroshio who's not around.

839
00:48:47,136 --> 00:48:51,159
Speaker 1: he disappeared somewhere and Finds a room that just has a chair in the middle of it.

840
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:57,316
Speaker 0: So he sits in this weird room that has a chair and of course It's Batman chair, of course right before it happened.

841
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:57,960
Speaker 0: It goes to do it.

842
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:03,920
Speaker 0: It's like you when you want to hide something like that You don't make a room that has a chair in it because that stands out so bad.

843
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,137
Speaker 0: What you do is you take your regular old chair and you have a bus next to it with a secret button.

844
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:10,628
Speaker 1: even Adam West Batman.

845
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:13,100
Speaker 1: you had to move the statue to make it appear.

846
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,520
Speaker 0: So I said you had to tilt the bus head push the button and then the bookcase open.

847
00:49:17,607 --> 00:49:22,600
Speaker 1: No This guy has a room as big as our geek night studio with just a chair in the middle of it and nothing else.

848
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:26,560
Speaker 0: So the kid goes down in the chair and he gets to the bottom and there's another chair.

849
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,085
Speaker 1: I love that.

850
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,220
Speaker 1: so he's like this warrants exploration.

851
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:36,636
Speaker 0: So he checks out the second chair and that takes him to see the secret evil base.

852
00:49:36,817 --> 00:49:38,724
Speaker 0: We're clearly dr Evil's base.

853
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:41,860
Speaker 1: clearly they have built a golem because golem comes back to get repaired.

854
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,560
Speaker 0: Why is golem in this base and hit the whole time?

855
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,357
Speaker 1: He's just sitting in the chair not thinking what if I get caught down here?

856
00:49:47,397 --> 00:49:47,840
Speaker 1: What's going on?

857
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,689
Speaker 1: He's thinking he's just trying to figure out the mystery.

858
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,819
Speaker 1: I sure hope we solve this mystery.

859
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:56,671
Speaker 0: So the best part is that my favorite scene is the one that comes up next.

860
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,437
Speaker 1: Oh my god with the robot justice.

861
00:49:58,577 --> 00:49:59,239
Speaker 0: robot justice.

862
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:14,760
Speaker 0: so so he goes to the basically takes the chair all the way the end and apparently Kuroshio and the defense minister and all the evil guys are having a meeting and They're yelling at the defense minister because apparently golem failed and golem was the defense minister's idea.

863
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:19,920
Speaker 0: And this is great because the other people are like listen, they're like listen, dude, your golem idea didn't work.

864
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:30,891
Speaker 0: You wanted to destroy the city and blame it on golem and have golem blame it on the ghost ship to make everyone hate the Ghost ship, but then you attack the ghost ship, but then you attack the ghost ship But now the whole thing has failed.

865
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:31,859
Speaker 0: and look what you cost us.

866
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,525
Speaker 0: Your golem was wicked expensive.

867
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:41,615
Speaker 0: all those, you know, military tanks and airplanes you destroyed with the golem were expensive And the whole time all the city all the city you destroyed and the people you killed.

868
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:42,700
Speaker 0: it was really expensive.

869
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:46,720
Speaker 0: They don't care about the morality they care about the expense.

870
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:51,139
Speaker 0: Right now like your plan totally failed and cost too much money What do you have to say for yourself now?

871
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,300
Speaker 1: The scene was very reminiscent of like the nerve and the sele scenes in Ava except that it was stupid.

872
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:00,395
Speaker 0: So he's like don't even you don't even get to say anything.

873
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,180
Speaker 0: We know what you're gonna say.

874
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:02,295
Speaker 1: He just sits there the whole time.

875
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:06,631
Speaker 0: like So like we're Minister of Defense, we're gonna let this computer.

876
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:08,197
Speaker 0: this computer knows everything you did.

877
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:08,880
Speaker 0: It's great.

878
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,410
Speaker 1: He's like we're gonna lose all your sins.

879
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,880
Speaker 0: We're gonna let the computer decide your fate.

880
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,826
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god computer justice.

881
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:20,540
Speaker 1: and literally he's like slides a punch card through the computer and it just sits there going.

882
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:26,400
Speaker 0: It's like that episode of the Twilight Zone where there's a computer that tells them how to survive in the post-apocalypse.

883
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,026
Speaker 1: Thank you, Peter.

884
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:33,380
Speaker 0: The computer is right But then when they find out that it is a computer they smash it and then they fail to live in the post-apocalypse.

885
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:34,616
Speaker 0: Cuz they didn't listen to the computer.

886
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,365
Speaker 1: Yep But basically it's.

887
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:41,386
Speaker 1: the scene is long and then the computer stops and it's all quiet for a while and everyone should stare into the defense minister.

888
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:45,991
Speaker 1: the defense minister is sitting there like And then his chair just gets dumped down.

889
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:48,120
Speaker 1: he disappears and then they're like, alright and they move on.

890
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,397
Speaker 0: But then the kid is in this room meanwhile watching and the room is a glass floor.

891
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,220
Speaker 0: You can see the ocean.

892
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,953
Speaker 1: But I love how you see the guy's hat just kind of float by in the ocean.

893
00:51:55,993 --> 00:52:00,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like ah snap He got eaten by the fishes or drowned or whatever some combination of the above.

894
00:52:01,235 --> 00:52:02,520
Speaker 1: but the funniest thing.

895
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:10,180
Speaker 1: I almost want to make a Dave and Joel tribute here because at one point after they kill the defense minister They're arguing about what to do now and they turn to this one guy on the board.

896
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,820
Speaker 1: They're like you come up with a plan and the guy looks so Japanese and so befuddled.

897
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:19,516
Speaker 1: There is no way that he is not Tanaka as in the Tanaka of Dave and Joel.

898
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:20,780
Speaker 0: He's definitely that was Tanaka.

899
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:24,780
Speaker 1: I feel like you could take Dave and Joel audio and put it over the scene and just make something epic.

900
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:25,879
Speaker 0: It would be so awesome.

901
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:44,404
Speaker 1: So the kid is like I gotta tell the world about this and he's mad and he's like Kuroshio killed my dad my mom and my dad It wasn't the ghost ship and he's punching the wall and there's this fucking button on the wall and he accidentally punches the button And sets off the alarms and then he's like, oh no, they must have found out I'm in here somehow

902
00:52:45,147 --> 00:52:48,240
Speaker 0: and then he runs away and he succeeds in running away with no trouble.

903
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,114
Speaker 1: Now does this the rest of this before we?

904
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,644
Speaker 1: because we didn't talk about Certain things yet.

905
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,895
Speaker 1: You remember this movie that our friend Amber made us watch called the stuff.

906
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,120
Speaker 0: I Remember being forced to watch it, but I don't remember it at all.

907
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,420
Speaker 1: The plot of the stuff was a meteor landed and it had this stuff in it that tasted really good.

908
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:10,169
Speaker 1: So they market and sell it to people and if you eat it Eventually turns into a zombie and then turns you into it.

909
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:10,591
Speaker 0: All right.

910
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:12,680
Speaker 0: Well, isn't that the same shit is like Slurm, right?

911
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda except Slurm didn't turn you into anything.

912
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:18,019
Speaker 1: It turned you into a big fat Slurm only if you had the special Slurm.

913
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:23,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but in the stuff, you know, and the thing is some people figure this out and no one believes them.

914
00:53:24,138 --> 00:53:33,180
Speaker 1: So The movie cuts to Tanaka not Tanaka to Hayato Going to the police being like look I found the secret base and I know we're going me and the police.

915
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:36,273
Speaker 0: It's like what really the police are not gonna believe that story dude.

916
00:53:36,615 --> 00:53:37,760
Speaker 1: The police are like, yeah, what the fuck?

917
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:41,515
Speaker 1: So he tries to tell people in the street and they don't care.

918
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:42,900
Speaker 0: It's a they-live situation.

919
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:45,129
Speaker 0: It's actually that like the camera angles.

920
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,355
Speaker 0: He actually reminded me of.

921
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:48,764
Speaker 0: they live like you, you know These people were.

922
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,373
Speaker 0: you know, they ate the bad people and yeah sunglasses on.

923
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the guys did have sunglasses.

924
00:53:53,259 --> 00:53:53,460
Speaker 0: Yeah.

925
00:53:54,521 --> 00:54:06,240
Speaker 1: But then while he's telling these people suddenly one guy melts into goop in the street Randomly and then a whole bunch of other people melt into goop and all these people had bottles of boa juice.

926
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:08,499
Speaker 0: And it's like obviously the boa juice makes people melt.

927
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:09,323
Speaker 0: There's a reason.

928
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:14,360
Speaker 1: they were focusing on boa juice before and it was just like in the stuff and no one's gonna believe him either.

929
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,274
Speaker 1: And then he's freaking out and he's not think he's a boa juice drinker.

930
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, he drinks a ton of boa juice.

931
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, and apparently is for.

932
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,420
Speaker 1: But if we're to believe what the movie has told us today most of the people in the world drink a lot of boa juice.

933
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:36,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's basically imagine if coca-cola made you disintegrate into coca-cola.

934
00:54:37,301 --> 00:54:38,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's drinking it.

935
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:48,092
Speaker 1: But he doesn't have time to react to this because he's immediately picked up by these yakuza looking dude clamps That were sent by Kuroshio to bring him back.

936
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:49,720
Speaker 1: He's like, oh no curse you knows I broke in.

937
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,190
Speaker 0: The thing is these guys bring him back and what do they do?

938
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:54,400
Speaker 0: and it's like they're acting all evil like mugsy and bugsy.

939
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,425
Speaker 0: They're gonna take him back.

940
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:57,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, we caught you kid and it's like oh shit.

941
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:58,060
Speaker 0: He got caught.

942
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:00,259
Speaker 0: They just bring him to go beep on TV.

943
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:00,869
Speaker 0: It's like what?

944
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,606
Speaker 0: So obviously Kuroshio doesn't know this kid knows anything because he just wants to put him on TV to talk about how evil the ghost Ship is.

945
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:15,993
Speaker 0: because you know He thought he thinks the kids still upset about having his parents being killed by golem in the ghost And this is the best Astro Boy moment of the entire.

946
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,580
Speaker 1: but it's like why did you send thugs?

947
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,745
Speaker 0: We're all evil to get him.

948
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:19,893
Speaker 0: It should have just been Kuroshio.

949
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:24,470
Speaker 1: Like hey, let's go the TV piece I think the Simpsons gives us precedence for that when there's knock-knock.

950
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:25,152
Speaker 1: Who's there?

951
00:55:25,273 --> 00:55:27,600
Speaker 1: goons goons who hired goons?

952
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:32,420
Speaker 1: And then, you know burns bring, you know, they bring him in and he's just like a hired goons.

953
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,351
Speaker 1: That's what I said, like should I have sent something else?

954
00:55:35,451 --> 00:55:36,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, how would I?

955
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:37,700
Speaker 1: how else am I gonna get you to come?

956
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, right exactly I mean hired goons are probably all this guy has cuz.

957
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,040
Speaker 1: he is really really evil really.

958
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:47,940
Speaker 1: But this is an Astro Boy moment because the guys like what do you do to fight the ghost ship?

959
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,154
Speaker 1: If you like we let you like and it's just TV shows on TV.

960
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,900
Speaker 0: He's on world TV like everyone can see him and the kid is like.

961
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,946
Speaker 1: Well, then of course use the evil guy.

962
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:58,528
Speaker 1: I saw it.

963
00:55:58,668 --> 00:55:59,571
Speaker 1: the secret bases under.

964
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:06,280
Speaker 0: he tells the entire story all the ultra rare Beams are spilled and then they then they interrupt him with some boa juice commercials.

965
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the message non-stop message already got out and there's all these scenes of people watching the TV going.

966
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:18,680
Speaker 0: but the problem here is the movie at this point explodes because Boa was watching that Boa Boa was watching.

967
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,316
Speaker 0: So now basically you don't realize, you know Kuroshio was only the the regular boss.

968
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:24,660
Speaker 0: Boa was the square boss.

969
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,707
Speaker 0: So Boa is like, oh shit.

970
00:56:26,747 --> 00:56:28,332
Speaker 0: Now the whole world knows I exist.

971
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:30,138
Speaker 0: Well time to fight back.

972
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:36,539
Speaker 0: So immediately Gigantic robot crabs that were apparently hiding in the walls of everything appear everywhere.

973
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,320
Speaker 0: I don't know how they were hiding without anyone noticing them.

974
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:48,167
Speaker 0: They were gigantic robot crabs, but the giant robot crab people appear everywhere in the whole world all at once also Big blue lobsters.

975
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:55,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the blue lobsters and the red crabs everywhere They're robots and they freaking attack and they disintegrate Kuroshio pretty quick.

976
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,891
Speaker 1: They pick him up and the voice comes like and it's like I am Boa.

977
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:00,415
Speaker 1: What the fuck dude.

978
00:57:00,616 --> 00:57:02,945
Speaker 0: You totally Kuroshio You have fucked up.

979
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:04,372
Speaker 0: you are now disintegrated.

980
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:09,500
Speaker 1: and then he spit some bubbles on him Which I guess are boa juice and turns them into boa juice super concentrated boa juice.

981
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,460
Speaker 1: So the kid runs away and there's panic everywhere and by this point I'm pretty sure he's about to get killed by the crabs.

982
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:18,656
Speaker 0: But then finally the flying ghost ship comes in and rescues.

983
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:24,578
Speaker 1: if I had to summarize how Stupid and crazy this movie is the scene where he is saved by the ghost ship.

984
00:57:24,598 --> 00:57:31,668
Speaker 1: the ghost ship Which looks like a radio chip is just floating over the city with like a beam Pulling him into the body UFO.

985
00:57:31,688 --> 00:57:37,740
Speaker 1: and then they pull him on and they're like, we're the ghost ship We're fighting Boa Boa's evil.

986
00:57:38,482 --> 00:57:44,324
Speaker 1: Let's show you the ship and diagram and the blueprints and tell you about all the things in the ship that we're gonna use in The rest of the movie.

987
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:50,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was totally like, you know a diagram of Mazinger Enumerate the powers of the ghost shit.

988
00:57:50,640 --> 00:58:00,965
Speaker 1: I've got a laser on the front and an EMG on the back and I've got a radar blocker and a wave motion gun The the skeleton.

989
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:04,020
Speaker 1: yeah dude in a mask he's like, yeah, I wear a mask as my face was burned.

990
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just suddenly like the guy with the skeleton mask is the captain of the ghost ship and he just has a friendly chat With him.

991
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,230
Speaker 0: He's just like hey, so you're the captain.

992
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, why do you wear that mask all the time?

993
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:15,280
Speaker 0: Cuz my face was horribly burned and I want everyone to see it and I'm used to wearing the mask.

994
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:15,762
Speaker 0: Okay.

995
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:18,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, also our ship is invisible to radar when we turn on this thing.

996
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,240
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's why we're the ghost ship.

997
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:25,684
Speaker 1: and then the kid freaks out and Clearly it is the Boa poisoning.

998
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,109
Speaker 1: He's gonna turn into Boa juice.

999
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:31,522
Speaker 0: Yep, and he accidentally hits a button that turns off the radar Invisibility.

1000
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,559
Speaker 1: what is with this kid and randomly flailing and then hitting buttons?

1001
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,320
Speaker 1: So he really plot moves in this movie twice because he randomly hits a button on a wall.

1002
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:47,220
Speaker 0: Yep, so he he accidentally turns off the Inviso radar the doctor takes care of his boa juice poisoning with a shot and then Boa fucking missiles the.

1003
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:58,329
Speaker 0: The boat gets missled so bad that everyone on the flying ghost ship dies except for the captain who's injured the girl who's the girl the doctor and the and the main character kid.

1004
00:58:58,389 --> 00:59:01,783
Speaker 0: everyone else in the whole ghost ship dies and it's ruined and it crashes under the Sea.

1005
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:03,680
Speaker 0: and that's the end of the flying ghost ship.

1006
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,731
Speaker 1: so they're sitting on this ruined ghost ship.

1007
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:13,706
Speaker 0: only four of them are alive and The captain in the go in the mask is Basically, you know out of commission.

1008
00:59:13,746 --> 00:59:20,303
Speaker 1: so that this girl who's there is being really friendly with him and she's like we should go kamikaze On this asshole.

1009
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:27,630
Speaker 0: Well, this isn't first right the kid that because the captain gets injured They take his mask off and the kid realizes.

1010
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,100
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the captain of the ghost is my real dad.

1011
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,791
Speaker 1: Oh, right, and he kind of looks good.

1012
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:35,120
Speaker 1: His burns are very like avatar bird.

1013
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:40,556
Speaker 0: This is a purple Blotch on the whole side of his face and he's like two-faced purple and not purple.

1014
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,746
Speaker 1: That's it Yeah, and he's like.

1015
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:43,671
Speaker 1: I'm your dad.

1016
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:45,620
Speaker 1: Okay, this is awesome.

1017
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:54,740
Speaker 1: And then you know, the girl is like, all right Hayato We should totally go kamikaze on Boa because they gave us but they just talked about not minutes ago.

1018
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,679
Speaker 0: how look we know that Boa's fort is here and we know it has this big star in the middle and we know that is.

1019
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:01,747
Speaker 0: We haven't figured out any way to penetrate it.

1020
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:05,040
Speaker 0: We're doing everything we can possibly do to attack Boa's fort.

1021
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,814
Speaker 1: And she's like we should kamikaze and the kids like but it won't work.

1022
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,980
Speaker 1: and she's like, what are you a pussy?

1023
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like dude.

1024
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,020
Speaker 0: Listen, if we knew if kamikaze would have worked before we could have done it with the in the perfectly working ghost ship.

1025
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,160
Speaker 0: now You want to do it with two people and a broken ass?

1026
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,426
Speaker 0: Missile to hell ghost.

1027
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:23,260
Speaker 1: or maybe they didn't want to do kamikaze because they had other options.

1028
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,091
Speaker 1: But now that they have no options, there's no reason to not kamikaze.

1029
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:28,580
Speaker 0: They're gonna die anyway, so they go to kamikaze.

1030
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:37,246
Speaker 0: The Boa with the broken ass go ship and the kid who's never piloted it before is piloting and the girl who's lived on the Ship for a while is helping.

1031
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:38,673
Speaker 1: the weird thing is through this whole scene.

1032
01:00:38,713 --> 01:00:39,517
Speaker 1: She's like, let's go.

1033
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:43,420
Speaker 1: kamikaze He's like no it won't work and she's like Ben up Nancy boy.

1034
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:48,980
Speaker 1: And then when they're going he she's basically like it's not gonna work and he's like man up Nancy boy.

1035
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,903
Speaker 0: It's like what.

1036
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:52,189
Speaker 1: and they just fucking kamikaze.

1037
01:00:52,209 --> 01:00:54,436
Speaker 1: through to this like there's a pillar event.

1038
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:55,800
Speaker 0: That's a giant octopus, right?

1039
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,673
Speaker 0: There's a. there's two or three obstacles.

1040
01:00:57,713 --> 01:00:58,680
Speaker 0: they managed to escape.

1041
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,690
Speaker 1: I think the best obstacle the octopus whatever but there's the.

1042
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:04,620
Speaker 1: I love the scene of the octopus robot losing his shit.

1043
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:08,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no Reming itself in crane crush under a rock.

1044
01:01:08,026 --> 01:01:12,780
Speaker 0: No, but with the undersea mines, they they fail all the undersea mines explode, but they're okay.

1045
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:16,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the fuck the fact that Boa doesn't isn't like.

1046
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,480
Speaker 1: why did all my mines just blow up and my robot octopus disappear?

1047
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,685
Speaker 1: and This movie just really.

1048
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:30,462
Speaker 0: in the end they kamikaze and at the last second the captain shows up and says dude eject the bridge so we don't die.

1049
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:31,828
Speaker 0: and then they do and then it's over.

1050
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:37,907
Speaker 1: so we say it's over because I Don't even know what to say about this.

1051
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,272
Speaker 1: So the diagram.

1052
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:49,839
Speaker 1: and when you see Boa's lair It is like this kind of concentric design and there's a tower with a star in the top poking out And that's what opens and closes and all the robots come in and out through there.

1053
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:53,086
Speaker 1: They ram it and it explodes.

1054
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:57,620
Speaker 0: well, they ram it basically by flying this relatively tiny go ship, right?

1055
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,611
Speaker 0: It's a big ship, but it's tiny compared to the base.

1056
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:01,321
Speaker 1: It is nuclear-powered or something It's

1057
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:14,880
Speaker 0: true, but they they drive this incredibly tiny ship into Basically this club, you know slowly closing Hall and it fits through the hole at the last second sort of like, you know Yeah, you escaped from the aliens in Independence Day, you know, you fit through the closing door hatch at the last

1058
01:02:15,322 --> 01:02:15,562
Speaker 1: Yep,

1059
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:20,060
Speaker 0: and then they eject and then that is enough to destroy the entire base.

1060
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:25,355
Speaker 1: Well, well, it turns out and I wish I was side of that little hole was Boa.

1061
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:26,820
Speaker 1: Yes, that is Boa.

1062
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,565
Speaker 1: In fact, that wasn't a hole to Boa.

1063
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:36,110
Speaker 1: that was Boa because you see Boa is a giant Goddamn motherfucking clam.

1064
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:38,819
Speaker 0: How does a giant clam or oyster?

1065
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:43,152
Speaker 0: Make Boa juice talk to Kuroshio build robots etc.

1066
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:43,533
Speaker 0: Etc.

1067
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:43,974
Speaker 0: Etc.

1068
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:49,280
Speaker 1: Even if it's a really giant mystical clam How the fuck it must have just been really pissed off about being a clam.

1069
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:50,105
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1070
01:02:50,347 --> 01:02:51,836
Speaker 1: it died kind of the way a clam would?

1071
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:52,360
Speaker 1: it kind of goes?

1072
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,979
Speaker 1: Oh, it comes out and then goes back down.

1073
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:57,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, and just what I mean?

1074
01:02:57,226 --> 01:03:02,260
Speaker 0: a giant clam that big eating a ship that small like that's gonna kill it instantly.

1075
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:03,691
Speaker 1: Let's summarize.

1076
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:08,129
Speaker 1: There's a world Boa's trying to kill goddamn everyone.

1077
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:12,407
Speaker 1: the ghost ship stops Goa Boa But it's too late.

1078
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:14,320
Speaker 1: Boa juice has killed most of the people in the world.

1079
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,671
Speaker 1: The crabs have killed half the rest of the people.

1080
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,300
Speaker 0: golem has killed a whole bunch of people.

1081
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:20,028
Speaker 1: Basically, everyone's dead.

1082
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:22,440
Speaker 1: but then there's this epilogue or everyone's totally fine.

1083
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:29,182
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean as soon as Boa is dead all the crab robots just stopped working immediately and the world is fine and all the buildings Are in one piece.

1084
01:03:29,243 --> 01:03:31,068
Speaker 0: like didn't golem smash them all?

1085
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:32,914
Speaker 1: but maybe they were showing other places.

1086
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:33,957
Speaker 1: I don't know but possible.

1087
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:37,346
Speaker 1: even so Boa was a giant clam.

1088
01:03:37,566 --> 01:03:41,360
Speaker 1: The plot of this is that a giant clam sent robots to kill all humans.

1089
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:52,800
Speaker 0: And then at the end is a tiny epilogue scene where the the I guess real dad who was go ship captain is totally chill And the main character and the girl are on a boat in the ocean and they're having a good old time.

1090
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:55,220
Speaker 1: Oh, but poor Jack loses his bag, right?

1091
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,067
Speaker 0: It's like the dog loses his bag full of stuff and it's like.

1092
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,660
Speaker 0: was that supposed to be symbolic of something because I mean it could have been.

1093
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,087
Speaker 1: But he lost his baggage, I guess.

1094
01:04:04,128 --> 01:04:05,512
Speaker 0: but what was it symbolic?

1095
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:06,816
Speaker 1: Oh, I just felt bad for Jack.

1096
01:04:06,836 --> 01:04:07,980
Speaker 1: Jack loses his bag.

1097
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,925
Speaker 1: It's clearly his bag.

1098
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:09,869
Speaker 1: He cares a lot about it.

1099
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:11,035
Speaker 1: And the hiato is just like.

1100
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,428
Speaker 1: we'll get you another bag Not much better bag be fine.

1101
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:14,749
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1102
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:25,105
Speaker 1: Oh and forgot to mention, you know, not real mom's Shoe that really didn't play into it the movie at all though It's just oh it didn't.

1103
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:29,100
Speaker 0: it was just like an excuse to have a discussion with a girl about his real parents.

1104
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,940
Speaker 1: It's about a giant clam that tries to kill everybody.

1105
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:42,637
Speaker 0: But I mean look it starts off with Scooby Doo then it's Astro Boy with a robot Then it's giant clam under the sea and in between it's like generic robot show.

1106
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:49,500
Speaker 0: It's evil Businessman, it's like what the fuck dudes what the fuck giant clam?

1107
01:04:49,821 --> 01:04:50,203
Speaker 0: They say.

1108
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,119
Speaker 0: the saving grace of this movie is that it's 60 minutes.

1109
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,973
Speaker 0: So you only what the fuck for a little while and then it's over.

1110
01:04:56,153 --> 01:05:01,794
Speaker 1: and as the movie goes on people Increasingly make that I am angry and also confused.

1111
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,180
Speaker 1: look with the furrowed brow.

1112
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,570
Speaker 0: So if you want 60 minutes of what the fuck?

1113
01:05:07,092 --> 01:05:07,593
Speaker 0: why is this?

1114
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,800
Speaker 0: five different animes barely squished together?

1115
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,964
Speaker 1: Maybe you don't believe us.

1116
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:12,390
Speaker 1: You're gonna be like yeah clam.

1117
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:14,540
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a clam like the naked cars new tenant.

1118
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

1119
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:16,608
Speaker 1: Those are literally naked cars.

1120
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:18,254
Speaker 1: This is literally a giant clan.

1121
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:20,962
Speaker 0: That's right flying go ship 1969.

1122
01:05:20,962 --> 01:05:27,320
Speaker 0: I guess for 1969. it's something special and it has historical value being by Miyazaki with the key animation.

1123
01:05:27,568 --> 01:05:29,839
Speaker 1: but Well, there's also.

1124
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:33,400
Speaker 1: You'll watch it and are you know, it seems to move slowly.

1125
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,417
Speaker 0: I mean like it's not good, but it's like there's something to see and get out of 55 minutes.

1126
01:05:38,421 --> 01:05:41,150
Speaker 0: There's something to learn from watching it 55 minutes in.

1127
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,778
Speaker 1: all I could think was how the fuck are they gonna resolve this in?

1128
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,123
Speaker 1: five minutes?

1129
01:05:45,545 --> 01:05:49,802
Speaker 0: it just doesn't have any direction or pacing or Anything.

1130
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:54,240
Speaker 0: it's like they just took ten scenes from random anime and pasted them one after the other with the same character.

1131
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:59,216
Speaker 0: It's literally a giant clam giant clam giant robot scooby-doo.

1132
01:05:59,236 --> 01:06:01,866
Speaker 1: eject the bridge And the girl.

1144
01:06:44,946 --> 01:06:48,336
Speaker 1: had the decency to not father showing us the giant plan.

1145
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,399
Speaker 1: It was clearly again.

1146
01:06:50,743 --> 01:06:52,660
Speaker 0: That was bad equally bad in a different.

1147
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,031
Speaker 1: But would it be better if the thing had gone in and then went to credits?

1148
01:06:57,051 --> 01:06:59,237
Speaker 1: it was like five minutes later.

1149
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,883
Speaker 1: Boa stopped Transmitting.

1150
01:07:01,903 --> 01:07:02,708
Speaker 0: Boa was transmitting.

1151
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:04,960
Speaker 1: I guess how else was it controlling all those robots?

1152
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,760
Speaker 0: I didn't explain that because the robot stopped when Boa died.
