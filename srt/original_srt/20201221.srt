1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,812
Speaker 0: It's Monday December 21st 2020.

2
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,939
Speaker 0: I'm rim, I'm Scott and this is geek night.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,778
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about the last decade in technology.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,079
Speaker 0: It's like a mega tech news roundup, let's do this.

5
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,599
Speaker 0: It's uh, you know, it's funny because we did that.

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:40,190
Speaker 0: Usually we'll talk about this more in the main bit but we usually skip a lot of episodes around this time of year because we got like holiday stuff going on in conventions and We kind of baked that into our schedule and our process.

7
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:45,199
Speaker 0: and I realized part of the reason why we were struggling to come up With shows that we weren't skipping shows like we normally do.

8
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,460
Speaker 1: We're always struggling to come with shows.

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,594
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But we were struggling more because we usually have some slack at the end of the year.

10
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:51,620
Speaker 0: where there's like a week or two where?

11
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,418
Speaker 0: We won't do shows.

12
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:57,660
Speaker 1: Well anyway, so, you know normally nothing's happening because we're staying at home doing nothing.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,892
Speaker 1: But something happened that I got to talk about right?

14
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:04,215
Speaker 1: All right, so My family long ago, right?

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,544
Speaker 0: It's about the tapestry No, and the children?

16
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:13,336
Speaker 1: when the children became adults right in the late 90s to the early 2000s, right?

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,114
Speaker 1: It became sort of silly to continue to buy gifts for you know each other.

18
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and also bothersome.

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:30,812
Speaker 1: so we did like one time we tried to do like a Not Secret Santa where you'd still have to buy a gift.

20
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:36,679
Speaker 1: right but like one of those Trading game ones, you know and it was it was meh.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,325
Speaker 1: So that was it the end.

22
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:43,047
Speaker 1: just hey the gift we give to each other is you don't have to deal with any of that gift.

23
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:43,520
Speaker 1: nonsense.

24
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,195
Speaker 1: It's like fuck that noise, right?

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:02:01,639
Speaker 1: Amanda's family still does Christmas with presents or whatever and they all feel obligated to buy presents for every single other person and it seems like a big hassle and they What they end up doing is just telling each other exactly what they want and then buying it.

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,448
Speaker 0: Emily's family is a good middle ground where it's a lot of like low-key gifts that are just like generally nice but not like what I mean.

27
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like the traditional like here is a present.

28
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,040
Speaker 0: That is a big deal and might be expensive.

29
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:16,929
Speaker 1: It's more like well It's like my family does not like never buy gifts.

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,856
Speaker 1: what they do is like sometimes they'll be somewhere and they'll see something and they're Like, you know so and so would fuck.

31
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:23,824
Speaker 1: Oh my god Look at that.

32
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:25,758
Speaker 1: so and so would fucking love that and they'll just buy it.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,784
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a trial device.

34
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,534
Speaker 0: It looks like a boo in a cornucopia.

35
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:32,234
Speaker 1: All right, right It's like and the next time they see that person they'll be like here.

36
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,300
Speaker 1: I got you this, right?

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, that's our friends.

38
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,191
Speaker 0: all are like we give each other gifts.

39
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:43,840
Speaker 1: when like we find something that is gift-worthy Or someone will just be like, you know, oh man, you know, I lost my you know scarf.

40
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,690
Speaker 1: It's like oh, I mean, I'll knit you one.

41
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, which one you want, right?

42
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:53,017
Speaker 1: You know that kind of thing, right, but there's not this formal must buy gift holiday thing, right?

43
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,509
Speaker 1: So You know, we don't really Need or want anything.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,578
Speaker 1: we have everything we could.

45
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:10,175
Speaker 1: possibly We're well off and live in New York like right when I get Secret Santa's I'm like donate to a charity in my name.

46
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:19,080
Speaker 0: that is not racist or You know, etc, etc, like literally everything that I transphobic or I either have or is not reasonable.

47
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:26,830
Speaker 1: right, they all the things that you could actually get me as a gift are Unreasonable to give as a gift.

00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:43,094
Speaker 1: it's like Upgrade my computer with one that has four 3080s in it.

51
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,178
Speaker 1: You can do that.

52
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:44,660
Speaker 1: That works.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,647
Speaker 1: You can put four 3080s in one computer.

54
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,613
Speaker 1: They make those right?

55
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,456
Speaker 1: It's like there's nothing.

56
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,259
Speaker 1: What else could you get me?

57
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,715
Speaker 1: Right, I can't even imagine a boat.

Speaker 0: get me a life of idle pleasure.

62
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,159
Speaker 1: Get me a DDR machine and a place in which to keep it.

63
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 1: Now if someone could get me those things like yeah Sure, so Amanda's mom messages and she's like, you know The gift that she's getting us was like in the mail and it was many pounds like 50 plus pounds already.

64
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:27,179
Speaker 1: I'm like, I'm like, oh There is nothing that weighs that much.

65
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,431
Speaker 1: That is something that we need and want.

66
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,744
Speaker 0: maybe a 30 90. there are three slots wide Right.

67
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:41,330
Speaker 0: I'm like and we'll go in this house The house where I can't record without tearing down my living room.

68
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:43,276
Speaker 1: This is already trouble.

69
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:56,014
Speaker 1: whatever the hell this is I Love it because I already know the story of what this is, but I don't know what the dimensions are right, but anyway, the box shows up and we drag it upstairs.

70
00:04:56,034 --> 00:05:00,107
Speaker 1: Amanda drags upstairs and Luckily, it's a box in a box.

71
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,614
Speaker 1: So opening the outer box.

72
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,276
Speaker 1: I didn't I was.

73
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:04,117
Speaker 1: I already said, okay I'm gonna open the outer box.

74
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:11,820
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to see if I can identify the item simply from the writings and whatever papers are in there packing slip something.

75
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:17,260
Speaker 1: So I don't have to open the inner box because already good chance of me needing to get rid of this thing.

76
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:18,458
Speaker 1: Whatever it is, right?

77
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,892
Speaker 1: So what it is, it was a lot of money.

78
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:32,740
Speaker 1: first of all, right, which is ridiculous but it's some sort of like Automatic hydroponic garden thing and it's way too big to fit anywhere in our apartment.

79
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,711
Speaker 1: The idea at its core is not awful.

80
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,414
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the kind of thing.

81
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,880
Speaker 0: I would love if I had a house.

82
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:39,988
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is the.

83
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,680
Speaker 1: the idea at its core is not an awful idea.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,100
Speaker 1: Right a little hydroponic system to grow stuff because you know, you don't have a yard, right?

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,547
Speaker 1: That's that's like the core idea is good.

86
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,799
Speaker 1: The problem is the size obviously is a problem.

87
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:57,379
Speaker 1: The cost is also a problem, but it was a gift.

88
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:04,313
Speaker 1: but the cost is still a problem because what this amounts to is a pot and A light.

89
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,918
Speaker 1: that's it's really.

90
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:06,861
Speaker 1: it's a pot and a light.

91
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:11,088
Speaker 0: so it's a weed grub gonna grow some weed pretty much Not that kind of pot.

92
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:18,133
Speaker 1: It's like I could go to the garden store and even if I bought a very good growing light because there are cheapo ones And it's and fan.

93
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:21,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got a cheap one hanging from the ceiling to keep our plants alive in the winter.

94
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:26,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you got a fancy one, it still would only be less money than this thing And I mean ours is literally.

95
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:29,985
Speaker 0: I bought a light bulb for $20 and I hung it right.

96
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,610
Speaker 1: you have a four dollar outlet Yeah, but I mean you could buy a good one.

97
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,456
Speaker 1: It would wouldn't be as expensive as this.

98
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:39,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can get a pot at the garden store for nothing, right?

99
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,387
Speaker 1: They just got stacks of them.

100
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,010
Speaker 0: That kind of stuff is just like in every shape and size timing it for like what kind of plant you're growing.

101
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:46,814
Speaker 1: Sure.

102
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,076
Speaker 1: Sure.

103
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:56,981
Speaker 1: Sure, but that's the thing is you could just You know just on your phone use like your reminders app to be like I actually just for my crap old plants on the windowsill.

104
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:58,486
Speaker 1: I have a Google task.

105
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,050
Speaker 1: That's like water the plants It just boop, right?

106
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:14,130
Speaker 1: What this thing has to justify its enormous price is all sorts of unnecessary technological integrations akin to remember that juice thing the where you'd like juicer.

107
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, you put the bag of fruit and it would.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,410
Speaker 1: it was like connect to Wi-Fi and squeeze the juice out or whatever.

109
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,157
Speaker 1: This is like that.

110
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,141
Speaker 1: It's like it has.

111
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,266
Speaker 1: I shit you not.

112
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,270
Speaker 1: it's not an exaggeration.

113
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,297
Speaker 1: This is why I'm talking about in tech day as Amazon Alexa integration Right.

114
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,228
Speaker 1: It's got Wi-Fi.

115
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:35,515
Speaker 1: It's got like all this ridiculous stuff To like.

116
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,625
Speaker 1: it can take care of the plants when you're not at home.

117
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,829
Speaker 1: when you are at home It can adjust the lights.

118
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:52,093
Speaker 0: It's like this really sounds like a weed grower because the thing so from trying to invest in that industry Is that weed plants in particular compared to most other plants are little divas and if you look at them wrong They just die.

119
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:57,230
Speaker 1: So people is the thing very much sold environments much like the juicer.

120
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,297
Speaker 1: Oh, it comes with you have to.

121
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,604
Speaker 1: you can't just like get some seeds and toss them in.

122
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:10,620
Speaker 1: it has these proprietary Like little seed things you have to buy from them Coffee cups or some bullshit, right?

123
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,409
Speaker 1: So they're like these little triangle.

124
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,542
Speaker 0: That is very different from what I was imagining.

125
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:19,795
Speaker 1: So basically at the top of the pot There's like a plastic.

126
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:20,539
Speaker 1: I didn't open it to.

127
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,970
Speaker 1: I just looked at the pictures on the internet at the top of the pot.

128
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:34,625
Speaker 1: Imagine that there is a sort of piece of plastic with holes in it and You have these sort of cones and you put the cones through the holes Pointy side down and the pointy side is now where the seeds are in the water.

129
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,769
Speaker 1: the hydroponic right?

130
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,297
Speaker 1: No dirt Yeah, and then it comes the.

131
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,246
Speaker 1: the plant would come out the top of the cone and towards the.

132
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:55,763
Speaker 1: the light that you have Right, so without some I guess you could just get like a cone of some kind that fits in the hole And as long as the bottom reaches the water and is appropriately has holes in it You could grow other things you wanted to in there.

133
00:08:56,144 --> 00:09:00,039
Speaker 1: You can't just toss a seed in the water That's just a seed in water.

134
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,349
Speaker 1: That's not gonna do anything.

135
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,688
Speaker 1: So, yeah, don't buy this thing.

136
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,415
Speaker 1: But also be.

137
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:12,470
Speaker 1: we are now burdened with this giant box taking up a lot of our apartment Waiting to figure out how to get rid of it.

138
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,564
Speaker 1: It's not like we can carry it to those full disclosure.

139
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:18,790
Speaker 0: when we heard this story We were like, ooh, I wonder like because we would need up we needed a better girl life.

140
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,270
Speaker 0: Then we looked it up to like see what the deal was and we were both like yeah that can stay at Scott's apartment.

141
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, like getting rid of it is now an ordeal.

142
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,889
Speaker 1: so instead of giving us a gift we have been given an ordeal.

143
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:36,990
Speaker 0: At least it's not a great ordeal.

144
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm hoping that I emailed the company.

145
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:40,970
Speaker 1: They haven't gotten back to me.

146
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:51,530
Speaker 1: I'm hoping that they will say yes some sort of delivery person will come And just take it right away and the money will go back to whoever we want to deal with it.

147
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,070
Speaker 1: But um, I don't know what's gonna happen.

148
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:54,606
Speaker 1: We'll see.

149
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,230
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I think back way back when my camera died and I finally had to like ship it back to get a replacement.

150
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:04,810
Speaker 0: The only way to actually ship it back was to like go physically to a UPS store or a FedEx.

151
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:14,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel bad though for whatever delivery person had to unnecessarily Carry this thing from A to B and now B to who knows where.

152
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:24,300
Speaker 0: oh, it's tough in general Like the like obligation rituals of American society can often be odd Yeah, but I mean like, you know, some delivery person's got to do this.

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,869
Speaker 1: and then how much fossil fuel was wasted transporting this.

154
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,836
Speaker 1: It's just like it's just.

155
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,063
Speaker 0: oh, you know, yeah, I was these were I was the kid rose.

156
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,110
Speaker 0: the gifts were like I just wanted anything.

157
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,680
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't have any money and I have wanted stuff.

158
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,307
Speaker 1: You know how many Nintendo it's like.

159
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:39,890
Speaker 1: I would go to it.

160
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,849
Speaker 1: I would go to Toys R Us and there was a wall of Nintendo and I got to pick one like once a month.

161
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, maybe.

162
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:53,143
Speaker 1: and so it would be like hey, I want every single one of these I don't care what even the crappy ones.

163
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,210
Speaker 1: I want every single one.

164
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,455
Speaker 1: So it's like you could.

165
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:57,626
Speaker 1: you could never run out of gifts to get me.

166
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,025
Speaker 1: just keep buying ones I don't have and we're good to go.

167
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:07,710
Speaker 1: But now I have every NES game that has ever been made in any country ever on a hard drive or a micro SD card.

168
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:16,850
Speaker 0: That is now very silly Yeah, so my only my only recent tech adventure is I actually bought a Fitbit because I wanted a more reliable heart rate monitor.

169
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,945
Speaker 1: How is it any more reliable than like Apple watch?

170
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:20,910
Speaker 1: Well, partly the same method.

171
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,181
Speaker 1: This is the same method.

172
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,170
Speaker 1: the Apple watch does so one.

173
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,610
Speaker 1: I don't have an apple like shiny Android watches and they but I'm saying it just shines a light into your arm.

174
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,732
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah doesn't use a different method It's.

175
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,010
Speaker 0: it's more like what algorithms does it use and how often does it track and everything?

176
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:40,410
Speaker 0: But basically my Android watch was only good for like specific like I'm going for run right now And I wanted to do like more long-term like heart track.

177
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,952
Speaker 1: So it doesn't.

178
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,021
Speaker 1: it doesn't track when you're not running.

179
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,230
Speaker 0: It doesn't unless I turn that stuff on like it doesn't.

180
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,770
Speaker 1: Oh the Apple watch just tracks all the time.

181
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:55,370
Speaker 1: But obviously if you do exercise it then it like yeah Constantly tracks for the duration if you're not actively if you haven't told it you are currently working out.

182
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,809
Speaker 1: It'll just check it once in a while.

183
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,672
Speaker 0: Yeah That's what this does.

184
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:04,189
Speaker 1: you can even if you like pay attention which I never do but you can actually see the green light turning on underneath.

185
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:05,873
Speaker 1: You know.

186
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:06,596
Speaker 0: the other thing was.

187
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:11,174
Speaker 0: I realized that Strava at some point seems to have gotten rid of the ability to just connect sensors To it directly.

188
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:14,269
Speaker 0: it'll only integrate with like other apps to get heart rate data.

189
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:23,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never tried to connect to it directly used to be able to used to be able to buy like a Bluetooth like ant Whatever like a whatever compliant heart rate monitor, and it would just work.

190
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:29,470
Speaker 1: and they seem to have gotten really I just I mean I'm these days and doing everything in Swift and then Swift just when it Swift is done.

191
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,688
Speaker 1: It just saves its results to Strava.

192
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:38,324
Speaker 1: And if I do another a non biking exercise You know I just use on the Apple watch.

193
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,438
Speaker 1: I just say Apple watch I am Italy.

194
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:47,598
Speaker 1: Apple watch will actually tell me it'll be like hey Are you walking outside now, and I'll be like you got me Outside and it's like okay.

195
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:49,590
Speaker 1: You want to record this and I'm like yeah fine, whatever.

196
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:55,828
Speaker 1: But the only time I would use Strava directly is if I'm biking outside, which not doing too much of yeah.

197
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:08,082
Speaker 0: But it was interesting because one thing I wanted to see was you know it's been a while since I tracked like My heart rate all the time like overnight into data analysis And I've been training really hard like Morse like this year when kovat.

198
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:08,624
Speaker 0: What did I do?

199
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,190
Speaker 0: I doubled down on getting totally ripped.

200
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:13,220
Speaker 0: So I wanted to like actually track like.

201
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,067
Speaker 0: how is that affecting my heart rate long term?

202
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:22,922
Speaker 0: because we had a conversation recently among our friends where people were Calling into question my current max heart rate and my current resting heart rate.

203
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,045
Speaker 1: well you were used.

204
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:24,326
Speaker 1: you were.

205
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:33,159
Speaker 1: you were you know doing A usual rim right saying something that is technically correct, but is also an exaggeration Like yes my maximum heart rate is this and it's like.

206
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,410
Speaker 1: that is a heart rate that your heart reached for like one Single reading at one moment.

207
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,837
Speaker 0: Now that I've had this Fitbit I'm tracking it kind of reliably with the same measure.

208
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,161
Speaker 0: I discovered that the Android watch.

209
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,127
Speaker 0: I have not that accurate.

210
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,650
Speaker 0: this thing is way more consistent.

211
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,177
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm actually surprised.

212
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,764
Speaker 1: How consistent the Apple watches.

213
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:52,708
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm sure they have watch.

214
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,997
Speaker 0: I don't great I just don't have an eye now.

215
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:54,199
Speaker 1: Well.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,429
Speaker 1: I now no longer feel it.

217
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:58,367
Speaker 1: I was thinking of buying one of the strappy chest ones now.

218
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:04,736
Speaker 0: I don't care I would only get enough stress chest one if I was also getting the ones that track Chest expansion and compression.

219
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:09,470
Speaker 0: so I can do more advanced metrics, but you can't use those with Strava anymore, so I bother.

220
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:11,825
Speaker 1: Well, I could use them with Swift.

221
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:25,910
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah I can safely say that my resting heart rate is like locked in at 47 beats per minute and my sleeping heart rate is like Okay, yeah, I don't know my sleepy one because I just I charge the Apple watch overnight.

222
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:32,494
Speaker 0: Part of the thing about the Fitbit is it'll last constantly tracking for like a week Like nothing.

223
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:34,484
Speaker 1: it's probably not doing anything else.

224
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:35,690
Speaker 0: Oh, it is doing nothing else.

225
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:44,106
Speaker 0: It'll show me the time with the screen a little bit and I can see my heart right now And it doesn't fucking do anything else, but it won't show you like your text messages.

226
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:44,186
Speaker 1: now.

227
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:47,433
Speaker 1: Two watches.

228
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,276
Speaker 1: you weren't two watches?

229
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:54,975
Speaker 0: well actually I don't know where my Android watch is anymore cuz about Couple months into COVID I just stopped wearing it.

230
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,400
Speaker 0: cuz I'm not going anywhere.

231
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,329
Speaker 1: can't on your phone say find my watch and then your watch will start.

232
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,579
Speaker 0: beep I could but my watch ran out of battery probably months ago.

233
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,523
Speaker 0: It's somewhere in the apartment.

234
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:07,598
Speaker 0: Oh Notice how I stopped talking about my heart rate for a while.

235
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,943
Speaker 0: that's cuz I don't know where my watch is.

236
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:10,529
Speaker 1: good job.

237
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:12,882
Speaker 1: Well, it's not far.

238
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:17,150
Speaker 0: That's good I guess but mostly the only before we get into the actual like tech show.

239
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,529
Speaker 0: The thing I noticed is if it's alright like yeah, take it or leave it.

240
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:37,381
Speaker 0: But what bothers me is that thing I noticed about Strava and as I poked around the ecosystem of Health related metrics collection devices just being able to be used with software is getting increasingly Siloed and monetized in a way that I am uncomfortable with.

241
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,030
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, I'm feeling in the bicycle area, right?

242
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,490
Speaker 1: There's the ant ant plus standard whatever and everything seems to work with that no matter what you get.

243
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,869
Speaker 1: So I'm not feeling too bad in the biking area, but I guess there and there might be problems in other areas.

244
00:15:50,150 --> 00:16:00,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mostly all the bike computers all the bike all the bike sensors that I've seen are ant ant plus whatever It's called and all the bike computers support them.

245
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:10,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all of the apps that bike people actually use, you know Zwift Strava the other ones that compete with those right ride with GPS, whatever.

246
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,230
Speaker 1: They're all using the same thing and they all work together.

247
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:21,162
Speaker 1: and I feel like it's in a situation where if any of Those apps tried to say we don't want to work together.

248
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,285
Speaker 1: We want to do our own thing.

249
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,850
Speaker 1: Everyone just stop using that.

250
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,723
Speaker 0: Yeah It's mostly what Strava seems to have stopped working with is just use a raw device that doesn't have some sort of other app or service associated with it.

251
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:39,539
Speaker 1: Also at the same but at the same time in the bike computing space There is pretty much Wahoo and Garmin and no one else's.

252
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:40,442
Speaker 1: that's it.

253
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:40,803
Speaker 1: Right?

254
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:48,710
Speaker 1: So but neither of those The Wahoo apps on your phone don't really do what Strava ride with GPS do.

255
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,970
Speaker 1: They're really just for sort of yeah working with the computer.

256
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:55,201
Speaker 1: So you think so they need those integrations.

257
00:16:55,301 --> 00:17:07,348
Speaker 1: if Wahoo or Garmin made a Strava Competitor or a you know ride with GPS competitor, which would be hard to do, but they could do it Then they could pull away if they wanted to yep.

258
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:14,259
Speaker 0: But basically that's part of the other reason I got this thing is what I've been using to track all my other health stuff is Google Health and just.

259
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:21,170
Speaker 0: I was thinking a lot recently about What's Google gonna shut down next and I don't really trust that any of the Google Fit stuff is gonna stick around.

260
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,816
Speaker 1: Google Health is so shutting down.

261
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:26,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I need I wanted to move to something that will probably stick around longer.

262
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,896
Speaker 0: So Fitbit does all the stuff.

263
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,182
Speaker 0: I was using Google Hell or Google Fit or whatever for.

264
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:41,314
Speaker 1: so there is something though to say that Even though I think under normal circumstances Google would have shut down a lot of things that it has I mean even more than it already has.

265
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:48,430
Speaker 1: yeah, is that anything that is basically a part of Android that is sort of matching a feature?

266
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,618
Speaker 1: Yeah

267
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:53,330
Speaker 0: Like an Android phone will just kind of do some health stuff automatically because that Google Fit exists

268
00:17:53,912 --> 00:18:00,318
Speaker 1: Right is like there are things that they have to have on Android because iOS has them right so they feel like they also have To have them even if no one uses them.

269
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:08,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, so whereas on Apple's side It's like Apple has all this stuff and you're like how many people are actually using that shit?

270
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:14,210
Speaker 1: Using the Apple home automation thing that they have the Apple I home or whatever the hell it's called, right?

271
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,281
Speaker 1: It's like there's got to be no one fucking using that thing But Apple keeps it there and that forces.

272
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:25,257
Speaker 1: I guess Google now thinks it has to have that also For some god-awful reason right?

273
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,550
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know an Apple people will never tell you right?

274
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,197
Speaker 1: It's like how many people actually talk to Siri.

275
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:38,330
Speaker 1: how many people actually you know use the like the EKG thing that you put in the Apple watch?

276
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:53,950
Speaker 1: How many people are actually doing that versus you put it there you talk about it you forget about it And it's now just a thing Whereas you know, but Apple won't kill those things whereas Google wants to but they might not because Apple is there.

277
00:18:54,331 --> 00:19:01,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm just being cautious with Google on anything that I'm actually like, yeah, I'm back up that I back up that shit.

278
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,519
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I've exported all that data out.

279
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,945
Speaker 0: I've got a plan now.

280
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:05,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

281
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,509
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Even though it's really hard to get data out of Fitbit too, but I think that'll last longer.

282
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

283
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:13,928
Speaker 0: Anyway got any news?

284
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:16,818
Speaker 1: What was my news?

285
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,969
Speaker 1: oh, yeah really tiny news.

286
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:19,673
Speaker 1: So, you know how?

287
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,920
Speaker 1: these days you go to some websites and this banners.

288
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,296
Speaker 1: they say yo, we got some cookies you want them And I've you know, you can install.

289
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:31,702
Speaker 1: I have a plug-in in Firefox a Firefox add-on that hides a lot of those Banners, which is nice.

290
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:37,890
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I should still add block micro block just to not show me the GDPR banners, right?

291
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,705
Speaker 1: So this is because of the GDPR law in Europe general data protection regulation.

292
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:44,190
Speaker 1: It's not a US law.

293
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:52,450
Speaker 1: so if you're not operating your You know business in Europe, I feel like a US only like eShop or something.

294
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,414
Speaker 1: You don't have to do this.

295
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:54,980
Speaker 1: and what's Europe gonna do right?

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,226
Speaker 1: Just don't take European orders.

297
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're good to go.

298
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:03,539
Speaker 0: And if you do but if Europe isn't a big deal you see some people who just like Block Europe from their site.

299
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,207
Speaker 0: the end that's happened actually more often.

300
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:05,809
Speaker 1: You can do it.

301
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:07,618
Speaker 1: So github is.

302
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,550
Speaker 1: this is owned by Microsoft now, right?

303
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:15,331
Speaker 1: It has been for a little while and they operate worldwide as worldwide as they can places They're.

304
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:20,150
Speaker 1: they're usually the ones getting blocked right because they're hosting something that the country doesn't want, right?

305
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,226
Speaker 1: Like software that helps you get through, you know, evil firewalls and things like that.

306
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:33,244
Speaker 1: So anyway so GitHub has removed all of these GDPR cookie banners from its site.

307
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:34,950
Speaker 1: Well, they're clearly operating in Europe.

308
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,710
Speaker 1: They have a lot of users in Europe and they're a business operating in Europe.

309
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,610
Speaker 1: They charge money to European companies to use github with their company accounts.

310
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:45,538
Speaker 1: So how how are they doing this?

311
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,884
Speaker 1: How do they get rid of their banners?

312
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,090
Speaker 1: It's really fucking simple.

313
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,969
Speaker 1: How they got rid of the banners, they stopped using fucking cookies.

314
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:53,400
Speaker 0: The buried lead the thing.

315
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,070
Speaker 0: no one fucking talks about that.

316
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,070
Speaker 0: Those banners are only there because you're collecting evil data for advertising networks, right?

317
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,160
Speaker 1: So you're actually allowed to have cookies on your site.

318
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:07,157
Speaker 1: You're just not allowed to have any Non-essential cookies, right?

319
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:11,150
Speaker 1: So the cookie that keeps you logged in to github that cookies allowed.

320
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,700
Speaker 1: That's a normal cookie usage, right.

321
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:22,749
Speaker 1: if the cookie added some other features to your website Like maybe I don't know what else you would use a cookie for besides keeping you logged in these days There's other ways to do this, but that's it.

322
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:28,172
Speaker 0: Every site that has a GDPR cookie warning is using cookies for nefarious purposes Right.

323
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:33,285
Speaker 1: GitHub does not send any information to third-party analytics services, right?

324
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,130
Speaker 1: I guess they're analyzing you themselves.

325
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just their own analytics, right?

326
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:39,734
Speaker 0: They only have like.

327
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:41,321
Speaker 0: no third party can uniquely track you.

328
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,550
Speaker 0: only they can uniquely track you use the website.

329
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:51,652
Speaker 1: GitHub will only ever use cookies that are required and none to track display ads or send information Anywhere.

330
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:59,918
Speaker 1: and because they're only using cookies basically to keep you logged into github, right and nothing else They don't have to display the stupid banner.

331
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,506
Speaker 1: So when you see the banner on the website, right?

332
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,481
Speaker 1: Don't just think Oh this stupid law.

333
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:06,890
Speaker 1: It's just like a reminder.

334
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,582
Speaker 1: It's like you knew this already, but I just want to remind you right that it's like.

335
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:14,780
Speaker 1: don't just blame this law from Europe Right, don't just blame.

336
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,890
Speaker 1: there are other parts of that law we can discuss other times.

337
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:24,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that may or may be good or bad that laws Is it both a blessing and a curse is my opinion, but this aspect of the law the cookie banner aspect, right?

338
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,413
Speaker 1: You see the banner.

339
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:28,540
Speaker 1: you're like all the stupid law put this banner here.

340
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,490
Speaker 1: It's like no that website you're visiting, right?

341
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,649
Speaker 1: Maybe they poorly designed the banner and made it extra annoying, you know, maybe that's their fault, right?

342
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:45,618
Speaker 1: Maybe you know, right but what's really is that website that's putting up that banner is a operating in Europe Which is why not right?

343
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:49,133
Speaker 1: and be they are Announcing to you.

344
00:22:49,675 --> 00:23:03,575
Speaker 1: They're tracking your ass and selling information about your behavior on that website to someone else and therefore If you're going to accept those, you know, don't like accept the cookie Right.

345
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:06,730
Speaker 1: Just try to get rid of the banner without accepting the cookies.

346
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,349
Speaker 1: Fuck them.

347
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:20,240
Speaker 1: yeah, they could get rid of that banner if they just decided that your experience on the website and having you be a Happy customer slash visitor was more important to them than selling your data to somebody.

348
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,501
Speaker 0: black dynamite.

349
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:33,642
Speaker 1: So right, so when I when you see that banner right in your I think most of the time myself included people think That annoying law or I make this banner go away.

350
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,790
Speaker 1: You need to think this evil.

351
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:39,530
Speaker 1: This is an evil website telling me it's evil website.

352
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:40,855
Speaker 1: yeah, that's what you need to test.

353
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:50,010
Speaker 1: the first thought you need to think when you see the banner show up right is This is an evil website that's been forced by law to tell it to notify me of its evil ways.

354
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:51,435
Speaker 1: Fuck this website.

355
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:53,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, also a subtle point.

356
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,230
Speaker 0: You don't have to click accept to use websites.

357
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,289
Speaker 0: You're actually they're not allowed to do that.

358
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:04,749
Speaker 0: You can instead click on the banner and go in and actually say no don't fucking use those cookies and they have to comply Or they're a deep shit.

359
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,234
Speaker 1: Yep, you can basically find some way to get rid of the banner without clicking Except cookies.

360
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:13,104
Speaker 1: I don't think I've ever clicked except cookies once in my life.

361
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:14,550
Speaker 0: No, I don't think I have either.

362
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,130
Speaker 0: Of course, I usually don't ignore the banner.

363
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, there may I don't remember I may I don't know it's and I can't guarantee that.

364
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:26,059
Speaker 1: but like I don't remember doing it And I guess I can look at my people see what's in there.

365
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely not my default behavior.

366
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:29,530
Speaker 1: And yeah, you could always do that.

367
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,267
Speaker 1: If you're worried that you might have clicked it one time just delete all your cookies and start over again Into places, right?

368
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,033
Speaker 0: So, uh, we're.

369
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,397
Speaker 0: we don't really have like.

370
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:44,645
Speaker 0: there's not enough information for us to talk about the biggest news like deeply But I just want to touch on it and link to a couple of websites you can read about it.

371
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:59,520
Speaker 0: But if you're not aware solar winds got hacked like crazy and For for a bunch of complicated reasons almost definitely Russian state-sponsored espionage and this is a big deal.

372
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:12,690
Speaker 0: like this story is one of the most important tech stories of the decade and Ongoing, like we don't know the extent of the damage from this because it's a big deal and everyone's trying to figure it out.

373
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:17,543
Speaker 1: Yep, so if you don't know solar winds is basically sort of like a Cisco competitor kind of.

374
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:19,610
Speaker 0: yeah sort of easy way to ish.

375
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:26,587
Speaker 0: Kinda, you know How do I manage my network and enterprise infrastructure generally?

376
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're like, you know Why you?

377
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:34,430
Speaker 0: this is literally like the enterprise kind of crap that I built my whole career around.

378
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:42,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you don't you know, this is not a something that normal people are, you know Concerned about right?

379
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:43,629
Speaker 1: It's like it's only a business thing.

380
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:52,510
Speaker 0: Yeah like the kind of person who knows a lot about solar wind stuff is the kind of person who uses like computer associate software or BMC software.

381
00:25:53,551 --> 00:26:08,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, what happened was is in order to log in to some solar wind stuff they were using this thing called duo which is a single sign-on service right sort of like one login or even you know, Like login with Google is a is a single sign.

382
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,350
Speaker 0: single sign on is not trivial to implement.

383
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,325
Speaker 0: There's a reason why there are vendors that provide tools and even hosting to do it.

384
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:26,190
Speaker 1: Yeah active directory Solution right, you know kinda but anyway So what happened was is there was some sort of vulnerability?

385
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,114
Speaker 1: where by There are these?

386
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:33,285
Speaker 1: when you set up duo right on your end, right?

387
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:38,190
Speaker 1: You're the company and you're gonna say, okay I want all my employees to log into all of our company systems with duo.

388
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:58,670
Speaker 1: So we're gonna set up duo and we need a private key that we're gonna hide from everybody right except for us and the duo company and then That will be used for you know, verifying when people log in right generating You Know TOTP all kinds of secret stuff.

389
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,402
Speaker 0: We're trying to avoid like this in detail because it's it's.

390
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,230
Speaker 0: it's a little bit as a point.

391
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,309
Speaker 0: You don't know how this stuff works.

392
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:12,870
Speaker 1: the point is if you get a hold of that key, right the only ones who should have that key are duo and The company that is using duo for their systems, right?

393
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,609
Speaker 1: If you someone else were to get that key, you could just log in.

394
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, as anybody.

395
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,270
Speaker 0: in general having a private key to anything gives you absolute power.

396
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:28,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, so and duo even in the documentation is like yeah, don't let anyone get this key y'all you'll be you'll be boned.

397
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:55,952
Speaker 1: and so SolarWinds was using duo and the key got out and Therefore people were able to log in to SolarWinds systems at many companies And they were able to log in, you know, basically almost Undetectedly because obviously it was detected as almost undetectedly, but basically they didn't need to have the two-factor authentication Right.

398
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:56,957
Speaker 1: They were able to.

399
00:27:56,997 --> 00:28:03,608
Speaker 1: just you know, sometimes you go to a website and it'll be like, okay Tell me your two-factor authentication code and you're like remember me for 30 days.

400
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:09,614
Speaker 1: So I don't have to do this hassle again and it's like, okay And the way it does that is with a cookie Not a cookie.

401
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,610
Speaker 1: that will not a cookie that will generate a GDPR banner a normal cookie.

402
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,509
Speaker 1: And now you don't have to type in your to TP again for 30 days, right?

403
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,116
Speaker 1: But if you have the secret key You could just use that secret key.

404
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:25,170
Speaker 1: just make the cookie and just put it in your browser out of whole cloth.

405
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:31,244
Speaker 1: Just open up a blank web browser Take the secret key run some code Go to into your browser and be like new.

406
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:32,070
Speaker 1: you can actually do this.

407
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,930
Speaker 1: You can go into your browser if you didn't know and go new cookie and just create cookie up.

408
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,093
Speaker 0: Just type some stuff in there.

409
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:39,220
Speaker 1: You can be like front row crew.

410
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,748
Speaker 1: calm new cookie, right of key.

411
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:50,452
Speaker 1: Your name You know value, you know, Joey Jojo Shabbat in the early days of cookies and web browsing Are you?

412
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:54,110
Speaker 0: I would like look at cookies that were on my computer to learn things about websites.

413
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,982
Speaker 0: I might have been interested in messing with it.

414
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,150
Speaker 1: You can still do that.

415
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,475
Speaker 1: But yeah, and then we're going to be a lot more human readable and simple Sure, but then you go to front row crew.

416
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:05,002
Speaker 1: calm and guess what your bread browser is gonna send.

417
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:10,450
Speaker 1: front row crew calm the information That your name is Joey Jojo Shabbat.

418
00:29:10,992 --> 00:29:18,288
Speaker 1: You won't see it but that data will go over the wire and our web server will ignore it and do nothing with it Because it's not looking for that, right?

419
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,549
Speaker 1: But regardless you could go in and say yes session ID equals a correct working session ID and you'll just be logged in.

420
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:34,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have to you don't have to type in any username password do to be nothing Yeah, and depending on the system you're interacting with you might not even leave like log traces.

421
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:36,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll just look like you.

422
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:42,182
Speaker 1: someone was logged in and doing stuff and the only way you could like notice That's something shady was going on.

423
00:29:42,222 --> 00:29:47,170
Speaker 1: You'd be like, wait a minute Because you couldn't like make a user you had still a login as an existing user.

424
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:48,555
Speaker 1: You could like wait a minute.

425
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:59,469
Speaker 1: rim was logged in and doing stuff from Russia Right from the shady VPN service in I don't know an island, right?

426
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,313
Speaker 1: Something.

427
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:00,676
Speaker 1: Yep.

428
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,270
Speaker 0: Now there's a lot of things going on here.

429
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:09,560
Speaker 0: Like there are reports that solarwinds they are their own update server had a password that was literally like solarwinds 1 2 3.

430
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:16,249
Speaker 0: But suppose That was not even used as part of this attack that was just discovered by accident.

431
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:22,330
Speaker 1: Like well, it's you know, once you get attacked suddenly, you know, the eye of Sauron is upon you.

432
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,070
Speaker 0: I guess there's two takeaways for all three takeaways.

433
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,314
Speaker 0: I think you need like.

434
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:28,903
Speaker 0: we cannot talk about this yet because there's not enough info.

435
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:29,786
Speaker 0: just read these articles.

436
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:39,737
Speaker 0: But number one Probably the single biggest threat to large enterprises and governments like in the United States For like a hackers and attacks like this.

437
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,550
Speaker 0: It's probably this this kind of attack the supply chain attack.

438
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:45,775
Speaker 0: You don't attack the fancy bank.

439
00:30:46,116 --> 00:31:00,090
Speaker 0: you attack the dumpy ass software vendor that the fancy bank uses to do something boring Mm-hmm, because the bank is gonna run that software inside of its network and just trust it in many cases Mm-hmm.

440
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:21,995
Speaker 0: The second takeaway is Uh as this as you know, like that password thing we talked about even without supply chain attacks The guess the best way to put this is security in most places like everywhere is a lot less Capable than you probably think and very much at the edges of these networks.

441
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:24,586
Speaker 0: if you get past the edge You're bait.

442
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,039
Speaker 0: you basically get root at that point.

443
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:27,623
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much.

444
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,589
Speaker 0: and the third sort of like.

445
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:39,800
Speaker 1: it's sort of like you can take really good care of your keys to your safe Deposit box, you know keep them separate and be super hide them in a really good place And that does nothing for you.

446
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,660
Speaker 1: If the safe deposit box at the bank has like, you know a drop ceiling and someone just comes in through the roof of the bank.

447
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:46,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, which has happened.

448
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:47,794
Speaker 1: I've seen that in the news.

449
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:48,599
Speaker 1: That's why I mentioned it.

450
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,440
Speaker 0: Yep, or like case in point, you know many of my jobs.

451
00:31:52,681 --> 00:32:03,540
Speaker 0: I you know, I'm an expert in the fixed protocol this like finance protocol Like that's a. I know a terrifying amount about the stupid protocol, but in the old days like a decade ago You know how that protocol was secured.

452
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:04,484
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

453
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:13,960
Speaker 0: it was plain text stock orders and transactions all this stuff We're just ASCII raw human readable being sent over networks with no security at all.

454
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,826
Speaker 0: Why was that not a problem?

455
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:22,299
Speaker 0: because it was all inside of private networks and private lease lines So no one really had access to that.

456
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,211
Speaker 0: But if anyone got inside that network, it was all just there.

457
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:29,480
Speaker 0: get root on any server that interacted with this stuff.

458
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,052
Speaker 0: There's the whole transaction log.

459
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:31,717
Speaker 0: There's everything.

460
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,813
Speaker 1: So you can start trade and you can start trading.

461
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,820
Speaker 0: yeah, you should.

462
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:50,604
Speaker 0: In fact, I was once at a place where it wasn't me, but someone else a developed a QA person Accidentally connected to a production connection and century like hundred thousand dollars worth of orders of a test suite out to the market And they all executed

463
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:51,589
Speaker 1: only a hundred thousand.

464
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:51,830
Speaker 1: Whoo.

465
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:53,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how we fixed it.

466
00:32:54,101 --> 00:33:01,218
Speaker 0: He wrote a script that wrote the inverse of every one of those orders and we ran it through the same QA pipeline to undo the positions.

467
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,808
Speaker 0: Okay, and we actually made a profit.

468
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,462
Speaker 0: so it was really funny in the end, but it was also Terrifying.

469
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,751
Speaker 1: also, you're fired.

470
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:12,870
Speaker 1: Yeah Accidentally made us money and you're fired.

471
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:15,159
Speaker 1: We have to tell the SEC about this.

472
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,517
Speaker 0: We did have to tell them about it, of course he did.

473
00:33:19,537 --> 00:33:23,380
Speaker 0: I'm not joking Yeah, no, no, it was I. I helped write some of the incident report for that.

474
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,370
Speaker 0: It was a. that was a. that was what I know.

475
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,099
Speaker 0: that was early in my capital markets.

476
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,578
Speaker 0: career Shall we say cost several multiple jobs ago?

477
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:41,377
Speaker 0: but the third takeaway here that I think is Really needs to be talked about and it's kind of terrifying that our own government because of the incompetence of the current Republican administration Is not talking about it.

478
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:47,793
Speaker 0: This is a state-sponsored Attack on American markets and American infrastructure.

479
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,720
Speaker 1: Well, I mean also world, you know.

480
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,119
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's except the state committing the thing.

481
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:53,065
Speaker 0: Oh, they're definitely.

482
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:53,769
Speaker 0: I'm confident.

483
00:33:53,829 --> 00:34:02,620
Speaker 0: similar attacks are going on globally right now But it is pretty directly clear that the Russian government is behind these attacks.

484
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:14,091
Speaker 0: no one seems to disagree on this fact and I don't think the United States is even like Remotely prepared to deal with actual modern cyber warfare.

485
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,460
Speaker 1: No, I was trying to tell this to someone the other day.

486
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,627
Speaker 0: It's I was watching that conversation you were having.

487
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:28,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you're a Russian right a Russian tech person Yeah, and you are for some reason the evil and not opposed to your own government, right?

488
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,340
Speaker 1: You like you're a Russian who likes Russia.

489
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you're into Putin like you're down for this or at least you're not, you know opposed, right?

490
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you're or maybe you know, you're terrified of that government and this is a way to not get you know.

491
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,600
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons someone might do this kind of thing.

492
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,351
Speaker 1: I'm saying the only like even me as a tech person.

493
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:54,639
Speaker 1: the only reason that I could see not Wanting like if I imagine Scott, would you like to apply for the job work for Russia being you know?

494
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,720
Speaker 1: You know engaging in you know clandestine espionage via computer.

495
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,580
Speaker 1: I would say the only thing I don't like about that job is the morality of who I'm working for.

496
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:09,614
Speaker 1: There's literally nothing else about that job that I find unfun uninteresting unexciting.

497
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,753
Speaker 0: that kind of job itself would be Super fun.

498
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:19,380
Speaker 1: some of the best About that job sounds fucking awesome, except I'll be working for the bad guy.

499
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:25,760
Speaker 0: All of our IT was the class where half of us were computer security and the other half were hackers.

500
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:28,392
Speaker 0: And then you swap the next quarter one group.

501
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:30,000
Speaker 0: You got to provide a bunch of services.

502
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:30,945
Speaker 0: Don't get hacked.

503
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,633
Speaker 0: the other group your only job.

504
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:34,020
Speaker 1: I took that class as well.

505
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,765
Speaker 0: No, it was a fun class anyway So the own.

506
00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:48,898
Speaker 1: so obviously there are probably plenty of highly skilled Technological people in Russia who are loyal to Russia and are perfectly happy with that Otherwise awesome job because they don't consider it to be an evil job the way I do.

507
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,666
Speaker 1: yeah Meanwhile in the United States right.

508
00:35:52,087 --> 00:36:00,655
Speaker 1: if the United States was hiring that for position come to the NSA or the CIA and do clandestine computer espionage for United States right.

509
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:09,650
Speaker 1: and even if The you know we got rid of all the Republicans and was only Democrats in both Congress and the president And it was all Democrats.

510
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:15,433
Speaker 0: Let's even assume magically It's the only that is always doing the right thing and there is no ethical question.

511
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:17,700
Speaker 0: magical future world right?

512
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,022
Speaker 1: They're only asking me to do Espionage.

513
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,186
Speaker 1: is that I am okay with?

514
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:21,949
Speaker 1: right?

515
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:23,795
Speaker 1: that I can see are for the good of the world.

516
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,320
Speaker 1: that job sounds like awful.

517
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:30,600
Speaker 1: That sounds like the worst job to work right with all sorts of government bureaucracy bullshit.

518
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,902
Speaker 0: This is.

519
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:38,140
Speaker 0: the US government would never ever hire the kind of person who is good at that kind of thing, right?

520
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,120
Speaker 1: It's like you know and not even I'm not opposed like the core principle of being a public servant like I'm all down with that.

521
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:54,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just actually being a public servant in the United States especially for the federal government is Awful, it's like there's so much bullshit.

522
00:36:54,532 --> 00:37:05,530
Speaker 0: You got a deal like oh wait, so I work That in my life I can work way harder make like a tenth what I will not attend more like a fifth of what I Make now have to move somewhere.

523
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,380
Speaker 0: I don't want to live and deal with bureaucracy.

524
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'll just stay in the private sector.

525
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,880
Speaker 1: Right exactly And that's why we're getting our asses kicked.

526
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:26,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, but one of the one of the one of the major reasons we're getting our asses kicked Yeah, but what I'll leave you with is and I'm not saying that a kinetic force is what we should do Don't get me wrong, but no American doctrine.

527
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,196
Speaker 0: Is that a text like this?

528
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:33,706
Speaker 0: cyber attacks are tantamount to kinetic attacks like.

529
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:41,489
Speaker 0: that is an act of war and we reserve the right as a nation to respond with either Cyberattacks or kinetic attacks like.

530
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,315
Speaker 1: yeah, that's only that's I'm pretty sure.

531
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:51,719
Speaker 1: you know I've that's been true for a while But I believe that since no one has ever fucking you know Done that it's pretty much become a you.

532
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:52,986
Speaker 1: You know.

533
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:56,000
Speaker 1: yeah Yosemite Sam you're crossing this line.

534
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:00,731
Speaker 1: Nobody is ever gonna do it.

535
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,480
Speaker 1: It's not it's not actually true.

536
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Speaker 1: It's only written on paper an excuse in case someone actually gets the balls to do it, but there's something even worse.

537
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,195
Speaker 0: It's there's this like there's a way worse.

538
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:11,658
Speaker 0: part of this.

539
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:26,832
Speaker 0: everything We're talking about is like they attack the government directly which happened like the Department of Energy got hacked by this like FYI Yep, and if you don't know what the Department of Energy does go look it up because if you don't know what it does You're probably gonna be really surprised when you find out what it does.

540
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:29,240
Speaker 1: the Department of Energy doesn't handle the power plant.

541
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:31,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Department of Energy handles energy.

542
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:34,286
Speaker 1: The big energy.

543
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,020
Speaker 0: yeah the biggest the biggest we know about.

544
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:53,231
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the real places where these where these attacks will happen Even if our government was secure is all the support structure around our government the economy itself Private power companies like that whole sector.

545
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:59,680
Speaker 0: if you think it sucks to work for the federal government doing IT Imagine working for like a power company in Oregon.

546
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:03,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Con Edison's IT.

547
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:04,610
Speaker 0: Yeah imagine that job.

548
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,657
Speaker 1: I see I see their website and how it works.

549
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:07,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see that website.

550
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:08,766
Speaker 0: I know what it would be like to be.

551
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:09,168
Speaker 0: it's not.

552
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,979
Speaker 1: oh, it's got okay parts, but it's also Obviously not a place I want to work.

553
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,579
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day.

554
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,160
Speaker 0: So remember a while ago, we found the worth it kids channel and had a million great things.

555
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,123
Speaker 0: So can't just leave.

556
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:27,785
Speaker 1: that was that.

557
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,212
Speaker 1: was you who found that I actually watched any of those?

558
00:39:30,272 --> 00:39:31,416
Speaker 0: you haven't watched Big Top Burger.

559
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,730
Speaker 0: I Don't remember though the Wow go watch Big Top Burger.

560
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:36,634
Speaker 0: The show is really short.

561
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:37,898
Speaker 1: I might have.

562
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:38,400
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

563
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:43,395
Speaker 0: It's about a clown and a bunch of people dressed as clowns working in a burger truck.

564
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:46,047
Speaker 1: I Don't think I saw that.

565
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:49,314
Speaker 0: It's it's up your alley specifically anyway.

566
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:54,018
Speaker 0: So I found another channel like this randomly this jewel haver.

567
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,104
Speaker 0: But this channel I just found.

568
00:39:56,124 --> 00:40:09,159
Speaker 0: this video was recommended to me by the algorithm, but it was just this like weird like early 80s looking computer rotoscope kind of thing and it's called playing an RPG for the first time and it's just this.

569
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:15,480
Speaker 0: Animated comedy sketch of an adventurer is often his first adventure and he sees a rat and he murders it.

570
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,408
Speaker 0: then he sees a ghoul and he murders it.

571
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:30,546
Speaker 0: and then he goes into town looking for a quest and I thought it was gonna be okay funny, but about halfway through it goes from pretty funny to Really funny.

572
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:33,600
Speaker 0: the voice acting in this is stellar.

573
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:37,673
Speaker 0: This is equally funny to some of the worth it kids, but for different reasons.

574
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,920
Speaker 0: this thing was really really funny to me.

575
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,949
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna spoil it.

576
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,119
Speaker 0: It's three minutes long.

577
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,532
Speaker 0: This channel is worth subscribing to based on this video alone.

578
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:58,318
Speaker 1: I Actually just in my mind as I was thinking of my current thing of the day a Flash came in and was like wasn't that gonna be the thing of the day, but I guess that one will be Wednesday.

579
00:40:58,378 --> 00:41:04,042
Speaker 1: So You know me I like a fossil but I really like a trilobite That's.

580
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,539
Speaker 0: one of the first things I learned about you was that you like trilobites.

581
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,613
Speaker 1: Trilobite is a cool-looking fossil.

582
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,480
Speaker 1: if you find a cute one.

583
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is if you had an actual live trilobite somehow that would be scary as fuck.

584
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,318
Speaker 1: Get that thing away from me, right but a trilobite fossil is hella cool.

585
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:27,920
Speaker 1: So I found this article like a month ago and I dug it up here for my thing of the day today And it's basically do you know like the first time anyone saw a trilobite?

586
00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 1: And it's like there was this guy in like, you know, some royal collection and like Oxford who noted this fossil He thought it was some kind of flat fish or something Welsh the Reverend lewd.

587
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:42,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't know if it's like Lloyd lewd something like that.

588
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,620
Speaker 1: Anyway, but he was you know credited as yeah, this is Southwestern Wales.

589
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Speaker 1: Yeah credited as being like the trilobite discoverer, but that's obviously the colonialist interpretation.

590
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like he didn't discover the trilobite, right?

591
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:05,140
Speaker 1: He's just the first person to in English writing in the West, you know Make note of it in a scientific journal, right?

592
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,723
Speaker 1: So that's something.

593
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,570
Speaker 1: but it's not like a discover right.

594
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:13,771
Speaker 1: and this article really goes pretty interesting Goes into like.

595
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:23,070
Speaker 1: yeah, actually People going way way way way way back to super ancient times You know, these were you know Stone Age right.

596
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,772
Speaker 1: think Stone Age.

597
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,820
Speaker 1: the rocks are real important in the Stone Age.

598
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,185
Speaker 1: That's why it's the Stone Age right.

599
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,751
Speaker 1: people are making things out of stone.

600
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:31,180
Speaker 1: They were paying a lot of attention to stones.

601
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,165
Speaker 1: They didn't have television.

602
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:32,888
Speaker 1: They didn't have internet.

603
00:42:33,391 --> 00:42:35,200
Speaker 1: So yeah, they're playing with rocks.

604
00:42:35,842 --> 00:42:39,955
Speaker 1: They would note and be like, you know what this rock is a real special rock.

605
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:56,805
Speaker 1: It's got look it's different Look, it's a mini and there were like cave drawings of trilobites, right and people would make You know jewelry's out of trilobite fossils and stuff and it's like the trilobite was discovered way before This dude at Oxford.

606
00:42:56,885 --> 00:42:58,409
Speaker 1: so really fascinating here.

607
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:01,458
Speaker 1: history of the trilobite that I did not know is is obvious.

608
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:04,354
Speaker 1: in retrospect Trilobites are cool.

609
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:08,471
Speaker 0: All right in the meta moment.

610
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,840
Speaker 0: I have not put up the signal.

611
00:43:11,364 --> 00:43:13,200
Speaker 0: I have not read for the Tale of Genshin.

612
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:16,975
Speaker 1: I I thought I was in bed last night and I'm like I could do it.

613
00:43:17,457 --> 00:43:20,191
Speaker 1: I could do it Cuz I don't have to go to work.

614
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:20,995
Speaker 1: I don't gotta do nothing.

615
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,879
Speaker 1: I could just do it right now.

616
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,845
Speaker 0: You know what I ended up doing.

617
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:32,639
Speaker 0: I never reading a long article about CIA tactics Because I've been watching a bunch of lectures from that woman who did the TED talk on like CIA Disguises and I went down a deep rabbit hole.

618
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:37,353
Speaker 1: I'm going back to playing that um that Hades game that I almost beat.

619
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,240
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna beat it and then I'll be good.

620
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:43,265
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, I'm finished I'm getting near the end.

621
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:44,930
Speaker 1: You think you're getting near the end?

622
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,492
Speaker 1: You have the eye?

623
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:46,314
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:48,260
Speaker 0: Yeah that that opened up some things.

625
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,960
Speaker 0: I found some interesting conversations.

626
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:52,064
Speaker 0: Some people are were.

627
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:55,820
Speaker 0: some of the characters in this game are worse than I thought and some of them are actually better than I thought.

628
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,721
Speaker 1: Yep Chowderman Showed.

629
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:07,231
Speaker 0: I pointed some friends at the Chowderman's music video the other day.

630
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:10,720
Speaker 1: There's one spread the chowder love.

631
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:19,579
Speaker 0: You know what the Chowderman music video from that game reminds me of the music videos that were on Windows PCs in the multimedia era.

632
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:25,599
Speaker 0: Well, that's what this is trying exactly, but specifically octopus of love if anyone remembers that one.

633
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,225
Speaker 1: Yes So, yeah the Conventions not happening.

634
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:36,196
Speaker 0: at least there's gonna be like an online Zenkai con so we'll figure out.

635
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,219
Speaker 0: we'll probably do something for that.

636
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,247
Speaker 1: Am I gonna go to Zenkai con?

637
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:39,789
Speaker 1: Whoa.

638
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,299
Speaker 0: Yes, this would be Scott's first Zenkai con in like a decade.

639
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:44,286
Speaker 1: It's been that long.

640
00:44:44,326 --> 00:44:46,740
Speaker 0: I think the last Zenkai con you went to it was still in King of Prussia.

641
00:44:48,401 --> 00:44:51,451
Speaker 1: I know I went to one in the other in the nuke in Lancaster.

642
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:59,765
Speaker 0: Yeah once you lent Lancaster one time I go every year because it's actually my favorite small Lancaster two times.

643
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:00,468
Speaker 1: it's possible.

644
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:01,672
Speaker 0: I could check the archive.

645
00:45:01,692 --> 00:45:03,720
Speaker 0: I have that database of every convention performance.

646
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Speaker 1: They have gone to Lancaster two times, but I definitely went at least one time because there's a comic book store near the train station.

647
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,042
Speaker 0: You know what?

648
00:45:09,062 --> 00:45:10,110
Speaker 0: I actually don't track.

649
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,137
Speaker 0: Yes, you did.

650
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:13,470
Speaker 0: We stopped at that comic book station both years.

651
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:15,320
Speaker 0: a comic book store by the station.

652
00:45:15,825 --> 00:45:17,320
Speaker 0: I don't track which of us went to a con.

653
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,647
Speaker 0: I only track what panels we did.

654
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:28,100
Speaker 0: but I can usually derive if you were at a con Because you really never do cons without me, but I often do cons without you and I'm gonna go do a con without rim.

655
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:29,679
Speaker 0: Now do it go for it go.

656
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:45,060
Speaker 0: But if anyone wants Scott at their con to do a talk without any rims because you don't need some you don't need hair then Invite Scott with that but then come to me privately and make sure that I'm also there and make me the moderator of Scott's panel.

657
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:46,663
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

658
00:45:46,723 --> 00:45:47,506
Speaker 0: That'll be really funny.

659
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,553
Speaker 1: It won't be funny someday.

660
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:51,580
Speaker 1: Maybe the moderator of rims panel.

661
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,697
Speaker 0: But for the time being we're gonna be doing online cons only.

662
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:56,220
Speaker 0: so stay tuned.

663
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:56,622
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

664
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:06,318
Speaker 0: if there is an online convention that you would like to see us do something at especially if you'd like to see us do something other than just pre record a panel and give it to you like

665
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:12,740
Speaker 1: and The online convention already has enough not white not straight not dudes on its roster.

666
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:17,320
Speaker 1: That is the point for it that they can afford to add two white dudes and still be okay.

667
00:46:18,221 --> 00:46:20,014
Speaker 1: Then have the convention call us up.

668
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:24,220
Speaker 0: Yep Otherwise, I don't have any more work the rest of this week.

669
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,472
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm gonna work out some stuff, but I'm not gonna say what.

670
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:29,440
Speaker 0: so I don't shit-talk anything, but I'm working on two.

671
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:37,182
Speaker 0: I'm working on two projects that you might see the fruits of and a third project that I ain't saying shit about for another couple Years.

672
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:48,832
Speaker 1: the only things I am actually doing that I've Can say that I'm doing because I've done them is I am streaming myself solving advent of code every day Yes, and some good Scott problem-solving ASMR.

673
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:50,661
Speaker 0: I Guess.

674
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:55,495
Speaker 1: and then I'm a bike and I biked again after a little break.

675
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:57,588
Speaker 1: I'm biking to nowhere.

676
00:46:57,669 --> 00:47:18,620
Speaker 1: so you can come and watch a twitch stream of me biking in place stationary biking And talk to me about anything appropriate while I am For when I know and if you don't and there's no times on these things, it's pretty much whenever I feel like doing them Every day that I'm not working just on my twitch channel.

677
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:22,794
Speaker 1: You can also come to our discord and there is a channel on the discord.

678
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:26,388
Speaker 1: that will tell you when the twitch goes live And you can click on that and so forth.

679
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,960
Speaker 0: I haven't been hanging out in that discord much the last couple weeks.

680
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,740
Speaker 0: I've just been really busy, but I'm getting back to my normal life.

681
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:33,159
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of work stuff going on.

682
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:40,079
Speaker 0: That's actually taking a lot of brainpower and time But I'm trying to get back to my normal life of goofing off more and doing more like geek night stuff with all of you.

683
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:45,305
Speaker 0: So stay tuned Mm-hmm, uh That's all I really got there.

684
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:46,289
Speaker 0: Let's get right to the main bit.

685
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:50,185
Speaker 0: We we thought for you know, we're not going anywhere There's no holiday travel.

686
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:53,360
Speaker 0: So we're actually around for the entire end of the year to do shows.

687
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:58,519
Speaker 0: We happen to have exactly two weeks left of the year meaning one geek nights episode of every day.

688
00:47:59,202 --> 00:48:06,755
Speaker 0: So a great way to not have to come up with a show I thought was let's talk about like 2020 like what we did in 2020.

689
00:48:06,755 --> 00:48:14,300
Speaker 1: Yeah Every magazine and every media outlet in the whole world has these stupid repeating things.

690
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,240
Speaker 1: This is why you know, you know time magazine is always like person of the year.

691
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
Speaker 1: You know why they do that because that's a whole one whole issue.

692
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,020
Speaker 1: They don't have to fucking think about what the title of the cover story is gonna be.

693
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,860
Speaker 0: Why do you think I get so excited when Scott lets me do a tech news roundups?

694
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,266
Speaker 0: Like I don't have to do anything.

695
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:30,334
Speaker 0: Let's just go find some tech news, right?

696
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:31,880
Speaker 1: So here we go four episodes.

697
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,191
Speaker 1: You don't have to think about what the thing is.

698
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:37,693
Speaker 1: We're just gonna do Decade and maybe also year in whatever.

699
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:39,200
Speaker 1: so in tech, right?

700
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,475
Speaker 1: 2010 verse 2020 and also I guess 2019 verse 2020 maybe right?

701
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:44,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

702
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,874
Speaker 0: So we'll keep it fluid for the Monday show.

703
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:47,720
Speaker 0: We'll see how this goes.

704
00:48:47,880 --> 00:49:02,395
Speaker 0: But this is actually particularly easy for me because I moved to New York City In late 2009, yep I also moved to New York City in very early 2010 like the end of 2009 right after you.

705
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:07,445
Speaker 1: so for my life right Everything changed very.

706
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:14,792
Speaker 1: it's very easy for me to remember what 2010 this Decade was like because I just have to think about my entire time.

707
00:49:14,812 --> 00:49:21,422
Speaker 1: not not, you know working in New York City Which is much longer but living on my own in New York City Right.

708
00:49:21,824 --> 00:49:22,887
Speaker 1: is this decade?

709
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:23,809
Speaker 1: where is the previous?

710
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,460
Speaker 1: anything that isn't me living in New York was a previous decade.

711
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:28,120
Speaker 0: No, what's weird?

712
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:37,523
Speaker 0: so you think about the fact that the previous decade included the entirety of college and Like the first five years of geek nights That's right.

713
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:40,800
Speaker 0: Like I was being on the radio in Tokyo.

714
00:49:42,142 --> 00:49:43,633
Speaker 1: Yes, that happened.

715
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:44,459
Speaker 0: That was the thing.

716
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,292
Speaker 1: That was the thing one time in the ancient.

717
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:48,980
Speaker 1: I have the wave file for it somewhere.

718
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,009
Speaker 1: Yep, I saw it in my backups.

719
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:52,716
Speaker 0: Anyway, I also had this idea.

720
00:49:52,797 --> 00:50:04,409
Speaker 0: I thought all right I'm gonna go back in Google Photos and scroll back down to like January 2010 and I'm hoping those photos will like jog my memory of like things I Didn't start using Google Photos until 2011.

721
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:10,613
Speaker 1: So I have a better way to jog my memory because Luckily or at least for technology specific.

722
00:50:10,673 --> 00:50:12,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah new egg orders.

723
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,950
Speaker 1: No, luckily or unluckily, right?

724
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:21,617
Speaker 1: I was my apartment in 2010 Maybe 2011. it was early in the decade.

725
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:24,386
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You got was burgled.

726
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:25,832
Speaker 1: It was burgled.

727
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:35,380
Speaker 1: There's an episode about it and I Had to list all the things that were burgled for insurance purposes because I had renters insurance.

728
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,968
Speaker 1: You should get renters insurance if you rent.

729
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:37,551
Speaker 1: get it today.

730
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:38,757
Speaker 1: It's so cheap cost like a dollar.

731
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:43,089
Speaker 1: If you can afford to rent you can afford renters insurance you.

732
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,032
Speaker 1: it's like must-have.

733
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:47,100
Speaker 0: you spend more money on losing quarters in the laundry.

734
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,590
Speaker 1: I've spent like $100 a year on renters insurance for ten years.

735
00:50:51,871 --> 00:50:55,020
Speaker 1: the one payout is I'm still making a profit anyway.

736
00:50:56,749 --> 00:51:01,753
Speaker 1: so What kinds of things Technology were?

737
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:02,500
Speaker 0: so here's a big one.

738
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:17,200
Speaker 0: I can think of a big change that began right in the early 2010s like it was actually 2011 when this happened, but Adobe switched from buy our software to we are software as the service pay us a monthly fee and you'll always be up to date.

739
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:36,504
Speaker 0: that was about a decade ago, but I think there's a theme of the decade of this was the decade of a huge amount of software used by professionals shifted to subscription models and the whole like ecosystem of software as a service completely Reimagined itself.

740
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,932
Speaker 1: Well, I just think cloud everything in general.

741
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:39,454
Speaker 1: Yep, right.

742
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:40,477
Speaker 0: I mean creative everything.

743
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:43,368
Speaker 0: It's in the title Yeah, everything clouded.

744
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:43,649
Speaker 1: right.

745
00:51:43,689 --> 00:51:48,123
Speaker 1: you stopped using Microsoft Office, right and you started using Google Drive.

746
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:53,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you started using like Microsoft's Office cloud thing, right in 2010.

747
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,220
Speaker 1: What was Google Drive was just like what like a cute thing that they bought from someone else like Google Docs.

748
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,535
Speaker 0: I wonder what my oldest file even is on Google Drive.

749
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:01,220
Speaker 0: Let me do a query.

750
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like everything moved to the cloud.

751
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:05,970
Speaker 0: Like.

752
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:08,778
Speaker 0: I moved everything I do to the cloud.

753
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:10,425
Speaker 0: for the most part I like change how.

754
00:52:10,445 --> 00:52:17,660
Speaker 1: it wasn't just a place for it wasn't just like Flickr where it's like, okay, you have your local file collection and you share it on Flickr.

755
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,571
Speaker 1: It's like no now your your file collection is just on.

756
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,639
Speaker 0: the 2010s was the decade where I shifted to.

757
00:52:23,122 --> 00:52:25,292
Speaker 0: Almost everything I do is either software.

758
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:26,860
Speaker 0: I subscribe to or a web browser.

759
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,806
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much All.

760
00:52:29,907 --> 00:52:30,872
Speaker 1: but here in 2010, right?

761
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,876
Speaker 1: The con the game console that I had was a week and maybe Xbox 360 that I barely.

762
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:40,449
Speaker 0: we both bought those Xbox 360s and they got rid of them.

763
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:43,110
Speaker 1: Yeah Is that right?

764
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:46,469
Speaker 1: that 4k was not a thing in 2010?

765
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,563
Speaker 1: right 20 the 2010s was 4k going from.

766
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:53,489
Speaker 1: basically in the beginning part of the decade only.

767
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:58,754
Speaker 1: maybe like ultra professional TV movie people could have any 4k fucking anything.

768
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:03,264
Speaker 1: and now like GoPros have had 4k since forever.

769
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:17,446
Speaker 1: I bought the gh4 this decade, which was like the first like, you know Consume almost almost consumer like highest end but still consumer Possible prosumer camera and it could record 4k video.

770
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:24,067
Speaker 1: It was like the first one Basically, and now every camera has 4k like the cheapo.

771
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:24,789
Speaker 1: GoPros have 4k.

772
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,033
Speaker 1: They've had him for years.

773
00:53:26,435 --> 00:53:26,635
Speaker 1: right.

774
00:53:27,157 --> 00:53:28,923
Speaker 1: 4k TVs are not ridiculous.

775
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:30,990
Speaker 1: 4k monitors are not ridiculous.

776
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:33,666
Speaker 0: I'm looking at two 4k monitors right now doing gig nights.

777
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:34,390
Speaker 0: I bought them recently.

778
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:39,676
Speaker 1: People have monitor, you know, people have very high-resolution screens Even if they're not 4k.

779
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:41,264
Speaker 1: the pixels now are so small.

780
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:45,157
Speaker 1: at the beginning of the decade 1080p was like the best right?

781
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:46,802
Speaker 1: It was like yeah 1080p's fuck.

782
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:49,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, right now 1080p's like yeah.

783
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:56,286
Speaker 0: This was the decade where 16 by 10 as an aspect ratio just finally disappeared completely.

784
00:53:56,727 --> 00:53:57,288
Speaker 0: rest in peace.

785
00:53:57,348 --> 00:53:57,790
Speaker 0: I miss you.

786
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:04,773
Speaker 0: the world standardized on 16 by 9 or but I you know what I noticed with compute.

787
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:18,028
Speaker 0: computing shifted to like tablets for one thing, but monitors are all 16 by 9 or the ultra wide gamer format and Laptops shifted to whatever fucking weird aspect ratio just to make the hardware good.

788
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:18,550
Speaker 0: No one cares.

789
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:26,420
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much like laptops are all weird aspect ratios, which would have messed with my early 2010 sensibilities And I just don't care in the 2020s.

790
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:35,170
Speaker 1: Now the smartphone, you know was really Originated in the previous decade with the palm trio the other palms.

791
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:36,756
Speaker 1: iPhone is from 2000.

792
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,884
Speaker 0: I got my first smartphone in like 10.

793
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:40,631
Speaker 1: It was the first iPhone 2006 or 7.

794
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:40,992
Speaker 1: I don't know.

795
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,317
Speaker 1: iPod nano was 2005.

796
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:46,310
Speaker 1: I want to say it was late 2008.

797
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:54,140
Speaker 0: I got my first smartphone ever because my work gave me a modern blackberry like a like a one that actually Blackberries were very last decade blackberries.

798
00:54:54,281 --> 00:55:03,984
Speaker 1: Um, but if you look at the numbers on smartphone adoption Smartphone adoption while they did exist there were iPhones in the late 2000s.

799
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,730
Speaker 1: They were numbers wise.

800
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:14,324
Speaker 1: They were only the domain of the wealthy the tech enthusiasts the well-connected the you know I guess elite whatever you want to call it people like me.

801
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:19,190
Speaker 1: Yeah Who had a lot of money with those are the only people who had like iPhones?

802
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:28,890
Speaker 1: By the way with 3g only right in the late 2000s Only in this decade that everyone has a smartphone.

803
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,877
Speaker 1: Everyone has 4g.

804
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:34,352
Speaker 1: right 4g didn't really exist in the late 2000s.

805
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:45,370
Speaker 0: like we went from smartphones are this playground and people like really rely on Wi-Fi or Specialized tethering devices - and like people have replaced their computers with smartphones.

806
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:50,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, people just don't have computers anymore and that goes hand in hand with the cloud thing.

807
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,090
Speaker 1: Right is that it used to be that you needed your even though you had this other smartphone II stuff.

808
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,396
Speaker 1: Right those first smartphones.

809
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:59,450
Speaker 1: you would plug in your iPhone to your computer to sync it with iTunes, right?

810
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,760
Speaker 1: It couldn't do its own thing.

811
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,790
Speaker 1: It couldn't live on its own.

812
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:06,162
Speaker 1: Whereas we went from that to well everything's in the cloud.

813
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:08,090
Speaker 1: So really your computer doesn't matter.

814
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:09,370
Speaker 1: You're not storing anything locally.

815
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,489
Speaker 1: You can just throw your computer in the garbage as long as you've erased it.

816
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,225
Speaker 1: You know for safety's sake right get a brand new one and be up and running so quickly because all you do is log into All your services and you're good to go.

817
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:20,434
Speaker 1: Everything.

818
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:21,940
Speaker 1: nothing's on your computer anymore.

819
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,970
Speaker 1: All right, your software's not your computer anymore.

820
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:32,456
Speaker 1: And that was like this dream that they had in the 90s or 80s even older of this sort of Networked computer.

821
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,844
Speaker 1: and that's actually what they started with.

822
00:56:33,945 --> 00:56:34,770
Speaker 1: right the mainframes.

823
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,957
Speaker 1: You would just be at a terminal.

824
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:47,310
Speaker 1: and so what they were thinking with like You know thin clients and stuff right in the 90s 2000s was like hey You're gonna have a computer and I guess the chrome the chromebook was also sort of attempting to do this.

825
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:53,410
Speaker 1: You're gonna have a computer that's really just a terminal and you're gonna all the work is gonna be done by CPUs in the cloud.

826
00:56:53,651 --> 00:57:06,021
Speaker 1: Right, you're gonna do nothing locally, but what ended up happening was simply absconding right sort of repurposing the web Right and web api's as a way to.

827
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:06,623
Speaker 1: okay.

828
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,147
Speaker 1: You still have a local CPU.

829
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:26,330
Speaker 1: that's doing a bunch of stuff but Most of your data and the software is on some other computer and we're gonna send you part of the software to run locally but not all of it and So you're getting that effect right but not necessarily the original imagined implementation.

830
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, the you know client-only computer.

831
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,690
Speaker 1: I think in general though that all happened in the past ten years.

832
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:43,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, so computer workstations like an actual like full-on PC as much as they decline in terms of normal people using them People who don't have like a purpose for them as a tool or a gaming PC or whatever.

833
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:47,222
Speaker 0: we saw the like full talk of this more on Tuesday next week.

834
00:57:47,543 --> 00:58:04,669
Speaker 0: the fall of and then like ultra Renaissance of PC gaming like PC gaming in the previous decade before the 2010s was in a real like coming into a really bad state and Like it has had a lot of ups and downs, but it's like it always exists.

835
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,020
Speaker 1: So we like can never die.

836
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:29,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like exploded over this past decade coupled with It's easy to forget like the beginning of this decade was an era where Intel was the undisputed master computer chips Like that was like the end of the Nehalem era in the beginning of the Sandy Bridge era Like that was when we went from don't waste your money on an Intel to fucking.

837
00:58:29,363 --> 00:58:30,647
Speaker 0: don't buy anything but Intel.

838
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,741
Speaker 0: for the love of God Yep, it'll boot on the first.

839
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,871
Speaker 0: try works every time like that We.

840
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:36,313
Speaker 0: that was.

841
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,406
Speaker 0: that was a sea change for me and how I worked with computers.

842
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:46,921
Speaker 1: computers became now I don't know if I'm gonna buy another Intel, you know That's a long time the one I have but like.

843
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:52,642
Speaker 0: but it's hard to remember that the decade that 2010 computers unless you had a lot of money.

844
00:58:52,662 --> 00:59:04,542
Speaker 0: We're still fickle and unstable Mmm, and the 2010 through 2020 computers like desktop workstations are so rock-solid Even if you get like an AMD like.

845
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,510
Speaker 0: they're fine.

846
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,014
Speaker 0: They're easy to build.

847
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:10,505
Speaker 0: people can build computers without knowing a lot about computers.

848
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:12,130
Speaker 0: that happened during that decade.

849
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,656
Speaker 0: Like that whole decade was like that.

850
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:14,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,886
Speaker 1: Oh, we started with Windows Vista.

852
00:59:15,906 --> 00:59:17,011
Speaker 1: now, we got Windows 10.

853
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:22,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, all those other windowses were in between there, whatever Storage.

854
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,802
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think about what kind of storage I had in 2010.

855
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:28,230
Speaker 1: But uh, oh, yeah, let's talk about right.

856
00:59:28,591 --> 00:59:30,159
Speaker 1: So we went from.

857
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:38,767
Speaker 1: there were SD cards in The 2010s because I'm in the early the late 2000s because I had a crap.

858
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:44,030
Speaker 1: Oh digital camera Right a little pocket cannon power shot, whatever and it took an SD card.

859
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:51,436
Speaker 1: But I think that SD card was maybe like I don't know what the maximum size was like four gigs Maybe 16 gigs at the most.

860
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:52,360
Speaker 1: like it was not big.

861
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,524
Speaker 1: Yeah at all.

862
00:59:53,605 --> 00:59:55,010
Speaker 1: It might not even been that big.

863
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,016
Speaker 1: I might just be missed.

864
00:59:56,077 --> 01:00:02,304
Speaker 0: and like USB flash drives went from Critical to why do you even own one over the course of this past decade?

865
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:06,637
Speaker 1: I see best SD card 2009. can I even find this?

866
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:10,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, I usually look at what was I buying in 2009?

867
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,095
Speaker 1: Which flavor of SD?

868
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:14,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, four gigabyte something like that.

869
01:00:14,627 --> 01:00:15,350
Speaker 1: eight or sixteen?

870
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:15,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, four.

871
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:19,988
Speaker 0: so in the 2009 so like four minutes of a gig nights panel, right?

872
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:24,244
Speaker 1: So in 2009 you could get like 16 gigs would be like a big one.

873
01:00:24,244 --> 01:00:31,054
Speaker 1: 32 was like the biggest expensive mega one like if you had a camera that shot raw Most people.

874
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:35,130
Speaker 1: I guess we're using compact flash then because the SD wasn't big enough.

875
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:38,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the Marantz not the Marantz takes compact flash still, right?

876
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:39,851
Speaker 1: Now.

877
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:44,145
Speaker 1: so I think that 2010s were clearly the rise of flash memory.

878
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:50,678
Speaker 1: not just SD micro SD right But also m2.

879
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:52,267
Speaker 1: right m2 basically didn't exist.

880
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:59,210
Speaker 0: Yes, these were still like oh if you're fancy put an SSD in your computer and they weren't that big either.

881
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,059
Speaker 1: Nor were they actually the best right.

882
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:10,456
Speaker 1: the density of flash memory Absolutely exploded this decade and now you can get you know ridiculously large Storage you can get.

883
01:01:10,476 --> 01:01:11,039
Speaker 1: like an iPad.

884
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:11,703
Speaker 1: you can get an iPad.

885
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:13,070
Speaker 1: I think with like a terabyte of storage.

886
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,499
Speaker 1: I think and I've had Pro does is there?

887
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:16,803
Speaker 1: is there a terabyte option?

888
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:17,827
Speaker 1: Let me see.

889
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:19,915
Speaker 1: Hold on This big ones is?

890
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:25,398
Speaker 0: I mean the computer I have now that I built several years ago Like fuck God like five years ago at this point.

891
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,750
Speaker 0: I bought a one terabyte m.2 by NVMe drive.

892
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:32,081
Speaker 1: If you buy an iPad Pro your choices are 128 256 512 or a terabyte.

893
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,107
Speaker 1: So big big flash storage is taking over the world.

894
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,670
Speaker 1: Yeah tiny micro SD cards.

895
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:46,344
Speaker 1: We started off last decade with like a regular old fucking USB.

896
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:46,826
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

897
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:48,030
Speaker 1: do we even have micro USB?

898
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:49,234
Speaker 1: I think I might only had mini.

899
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:49,897
Speaker 0: I think we had.

900
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:53,110
Speaker 0: I think we had made I don't remember but yeah, I feel I don't remember.

901
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:57,043
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is micro but now USB C.

902
01:01:57,405 --> 01:02:04,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, it took over like lightning cables Is like the cheap option for like crappy stuff and stuff.

903
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:06,670
Speaker 0: that doesn't matter but everything's USB C now.

904
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:15,115
Speaker 1: Yep Camera sensors, I already talked about 4k, but you know, that's not just the screens But I just want to say also the cameras.

905
01:02:15,195 --> 01:02:16,921
Speaker 1: right cameras at the beginning.

906
01:02:17,082 --> 01:02:22,021
Speaker 1: get a get a digital camera from 2010 and compare it To 2020. it's like chocolate and shit.

907
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:23,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not even close.

908
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,650
Speaker 0: I mean I think about the camera we used to use to record gig nights compared to what I got now, right?

909
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:39,489
Speaker 1: The camera that you get in an iPhone today even a low-end iPhone today is better than a like a Canon Multi-d mark whatever from ten years ago, right?

910
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:50,646
Speaker 1: That camera obviously also has advantages that the iPhone won't have but I'm talking about just like the image, you know sensor Right just unbelievable advancement in that area.

911
01:02:50,706 --> 01:02:57,470
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah in 2010 I bought a 4 gigabyte USB flash drive USB 2 so slow as molasses.

912
01:02:57,873 --> 01:03:01,013
Speaker 0: I spent ten bucks on that thing day.

913
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:07,883
Speaker 0: four gigabytes of very slow storage Mm-hmm, but it's not just that you like.

914
01:03:07,944 --> 01:03:09,210
Speaker 0: storage like that got bigger.

915
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:14,573
Speaker 0: It's that how people use storage changed a lot Like we went from.

916
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:18,303
Speaker 0: you put files on USB sticks and pass them around to everyone.

917
01:03:18,323 --> 01:03:20,570
Speaker 0: just transfers files directly via or via the cloud.

918
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:23,739
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much like I have.

919
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,525
Speaker 0: you know what I use the USB store.

920
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:26,790
Speaker 0: I was a stick for recently.

921
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:31,483
Speaker 0: I had a. I have a cheap car to get through COVID if there's emergency travel.

922
01:03:31,804 --> 01:03:33,730
Speaker 0: It has a USB hole in it.

923
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:36,220
Speaker 0: I put a USB stick in that hole.

924
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:38,610
Speaker 0: It'll play mp3s on that USB stick.

925
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:41,137
Speaker 1: There's better ways to do that, but that's a way.

926
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:45,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a way that that car supports natively cuz that cars from 2012.

927
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:48,879
Speaker 1: Yeah So what was I gonna say?

928
01:03:48,899 --> 01:03:49,744
Speaker 1: There was something else?

929
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:54,410
Speaker 1: Oh Oh my god, why did it just slip my mind?

930
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:57,730
Speaker 1: I Talk about something while I try to remember.

931
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:04,901
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some other big changes that have happened Especially in technology that affects us like I think about how we record gig nights.

932
01:04:05,322 --> 01:04:07,470
Speaker 0: We saw the final death of firewire.

933
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:22,790
Speaker 0: like firewire is finally gone and there is professional audio equipment that uses modern stuff like USB-c has basically actually Finally replaced firewire and I went driving this giant Mackie mixer.

934
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:23,352
Speaker 0: Do.

935
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:29,016
Speaker 0: now I have this tiny little one you thing that does like everything that Mackie did and more is Just better in every way.

936
01:04:29,056 --> 01:04:32,413
Speaker 0: just plugs in with USB-c just works Like the geek.

937
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:38,153
Speaker 0: nice pipeline has gotten so much tighter and the other thing related to that We went from.

938
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:44,348
Speaker 0: it is a gigantic difficult expert pet task to stream any video to anyone to.

939
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,220
Speaker 0: OBS exists and streaming is trivial and free for people to do.

940
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:51,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're using like you stream right?

941
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,338
Speaker 0: Oh my god We did a live stream.

942
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:55,244
Speaker 0: What did we do that?

943
01:04:55,264 --> 01:05:00,230
Speaker 0: I think that was actually 2007. we did that streams something like that.

944
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,295
Speaker 0: But streaming was hard.

945
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:02,179
Speaker 0: like think of what.

946
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:04,610
Speaker 0: think about when did we start streaming gig nights live?

947
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,410
Speaker 0: Kind of recently during this decade because it was kind of a pain in the ass until pretty recently.

948
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:13,153
Speaker 1: So for consumer technology Right.

949
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:29,410
Speaker 1: I think the absolute biggest advancement in any single like narrow thing and versus its impact on the entire world is It wasn't invented this decade, but the advancement of the lithium ion battery.

950
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,078
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

951
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:36,775
Speaker 1: and the last ten years is basically behind Everything else right?

952
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:41,110
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I'm not a fan of the electric car not a fan of any car, right?

953
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:45,263
Speaker 1: But you got your electric car basically was not a thing ten years ago.

954
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:47,230
Speaker 1: Now people just drive them around like it's no big deal.

955
01:05:47,481 --> 01:06:00,245
Speaker 1: Yeah You got your every single device you have that you walk around with being not super heavy had lasting a long time Right all these things even if the chips were all.

956
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:06,282
Speaker 1: they all kept up with all the chip Advancements and every other area right that we've you know advanced in.

957
01:06:07,124 --> 01:06:20,369
Speaker 1: if the lithium ion battery had not advanced It's like Apple would be like, well, we made this really tiny Apple watch at this tiny amazing screen and this tiny little CPU But the battery lasts ten minutes or it's as big as your arm.

958
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:33,389
Speaker 0: Yeah like I got to the point to where I have a hot and it burns your arm like I have a powerful laptop that I Could play like sieve six on for like hat like four to six hours before I have to plug it in.

959
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:37,387
Speaker 0: like That's kind of amazing how far that advanced from.

960
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:47,342
Speaker 0: like How desperate I was for there to be holes if I was on like a plane or a train like by the time there was An outlet on those two things I could plug computers into.

961
01:06:47,362 --> 01:06:50,353
Speaker 0: I didn't need that outlet anymore You know.

962
01:06:50,393 --> 01:06:56,567
Speaker 1: and obviously all these technologies that we've been talking about have Horrifying capitalist externalities.

963
01:06:56,648 --> 01:06:57,612
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, you want to talk.

964
01:06:57,632 --> 01:07:02,290
Speaker 0: the biggest theme of the last decade is technologies converged on a singularity of cyberpunk dystopia.

965
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:15,354
Speaker 1: Yes, but I think the lithium Right the need for the world's desire for lithium going up has maybe caused more damage than any of the other Things.

966
01:07:15,374 --> 01:07:15,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

967
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:16,478
Speaker 1: It's like.

968
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,806
Speaker 1: it's like yeah horrifying.

969
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:25,410
Speaker 0: they you know Not just lithium and rare earth metals like there's a small number of things we need to drive.

970
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:28,882
Speaker 1: It is like the elephant in the rare earth metal room, right?

971
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:34,522
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like, okay Yeah, they're mistreating workers in a factory making phones.

972
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:36,650
Speaker 1: That's horrifying and the worst right?

973
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,101
Speaker 1: It's like where do you see where the lithium comes from?

974
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:42,610
Speaker 1: It's even more horrible, right?

975
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:51,272
Speaker 1: It's like and and that lithium is in Everything Like almost like it's rare that you would even want to buy something Like.

976
01:07:51,533 --> 01:07:56,330
Speaker 1: what do you need in life that you don't already have unless it's powered by a lithium-ion battery?

977
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:56,652
Speaker 1: so

978
01:07:56,713 --> 01:08:13,470
Speaker 0: one thing I have appreciated about this is that We also saw because lithium batteries got better and because like the software and the understanding of how to manage them got better a lot of things converge to the point to where a Lot of stuff now charges in a standard unified way via USB.

979
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:21,993
Speaker 0: Like who would have thought over the last decade that USB would become the modern power outlet for most things Mmm, like.

980
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:25,011
Speaker 0: I didn't think USB would be it Mm-hmm.

981
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:30,362
Speaker 1: So yeah, I guess yeah, you know, obviously, you know the Twitter.

982
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:31,564
Speaker 1: we talked about the dystopia.

983
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:33,368
Speaker 1: right Twitter existed in the late 2000s.

984
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,956
Speaker 1: Yeah Facebook existed way before then.

985
01:08:36,996 --> 01:08:42,450
Speaker 0: who would have thought that Facebook would rise to cause possibly more damage to American society than any other social technology?

986
01:08:42,611 --> 01:08:43,616
Speaker 0: I mean that seriously.

987
01:08:43,657 --> 01:08:44,401
Speaker 0: Facebook should be right.

988
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:51,305
Speaker 1: but none of those things Really took off and became world conquering.

989
01:08:51,404 --> 01:08:54,657
Speaker 1: world owning things Until this decade, right?

990
01:08:54,676 --> 01:09:00,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, they existed last decade, but they were pretty much the realm of like Computer people right?

991
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:05,149
Speaker 1: It's because of the battery the phone the cloud.

992
01:09:05,732 --> 01:09:12,917
Speaker 1: That was the the only platform which could skyrocket those existing things To be more than what they were right.

993
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:20,049
Speaker 1: they were, you know, maybe not completely innocent But relatively innocent in there, you know young days.

994
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:28,250
Speaker 1: But the that platform that we invented this decade is what allowed those things to just conquer the entire world and ruin us all.

995
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:28,633
Speaker 0: well, I'd say.

996
01:09:28,674 --> 01:09:47,533
Speaker 0: in general technology like if you look at like 1990 through 2000, you know The information age like internet went from not existing for any practical purpose for normal people to existing But wasn't like fully realized yet and there was a lot of ideas about like what we could do with it But it wasn't quite in

997
01:09:47,553 --> 01:09:48,457
Speaker 1: the space outlaw.

998
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:48,899
Speaker 1: Yep.

999
01:09:49,683 --> 01:10:05,370
Speaker 0: The 2010s was like, all right We're building and like the 20 things were we build all this stuff and we almost Discovered that humans might not have been ready to be able to talk to each other all at the same time Mm-hmm, like it might literally be that humans are not ready for that technology.

1000
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:09,150
Speaker 0: I said this a decade ago and I think I was right.

1001
01:10:09,855 --> 01:10:16,508
Speaker 0: Not that it was hard to be wrong about this that Social technology like this and the idea of like memetic warfare would become real.

1002
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:17,292
Speaker 0: here We are.

1003
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:38,430
Speaker 0: our news was literally about hacking and like cybersecurity Meme warfare has became real in a literal sense this decade And I don't know what's gonna happen like I can't even predict like that space evolved more between 2016 and 2020 than it did between 2016 and like 1916. yeah, right.

1004
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:45,764
Speaker 1: So it's like on the one hand it sort of feels like man Technology doesn't move anymore like it used to right because we had huge movements, right?

1005
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:51,674
Speaker 1: We went from you know CD to mp3 Spotify.

1006
01:10:51,794 --> 01:11:02,290
Speaker 0: I went from like cassette 8-track to cassette Like a decade but cuz you have to CD to mp3 to nothing like I just stream stuff that went by like a lightning.

1007
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:08,030
Speaker 1: Right also, yeah that because of the cloud thing right we went from mp3 to stream this decade.

1008
01:11:08,095 --> 01:11:16,725
Speaker 0: Yeah We killed physical media except for collectors and nerds and people who don't have access And people who really just insist on principle and like collectors and take it down.

1009
01:11:16,745 --> 01:11:17,888
Speaker 1: I'll just pirate it.

1010
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:21,734
Speaker 0: Come on Oh Piracy you didn't get destroyed.

1011
01:11:21,774 --> 01:11:23,841
Speaker 0: piracy kept plugging along in about the same rate.

1012
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:24,543
Speaker 0: It always has.

1013
01:11:24,563 --> 01:11:26,489
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, absolutely nature.

1014
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:40,025
Speaker 1: well life finds a way Sure, obviously But you know if you think it's like even though there were these huge Change, you know society shattering advancements in technology in the 2010s, right?

1015
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:50,353
Speaker 1: like what we said where we started and where we are now it feels like it's slower because Those changes are like more Incremental.

1016
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:58,484
Speaker 1: it's like ah, we've replaced this USB with yup USB C Whereas before we were replacing like serial cable with us.

1017
01:11:58,504 --> 01:12:03,570
Speaker 0: before we replaced nothing With cell phone and then we replace cell phone with smartphone.

1018
01:12:04,552 --> 01:12:04,853
Speaker 1: Right.

1019
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:06,581
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, we're the.

1020
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:11,562
Speaker 1: they're meaningful upgrades We're getting but we're still getting and they're.

1021
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:13,370
Speaker 1: they're you know, just as earth-shattering.

1022
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:16,100
Speaker 1: But when you just look at them on face value, right?

1023
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:16,923
Speaker 1: It's like you.

1024
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:25,145
Speaker 1: look at 2000 verse 2010 2000. it was like, you know, Motorola StarTech and 2010 was like iPhone.

1025
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:31,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, or I want to say great Maybe iPhone 420 like the difference between but but different, right?

1026
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:37,870
Speaker 0: For like 3.1 is almost earth-shattering by itself, right?

1027
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,691
Speaker 1: But then you look at like iPhone 4 from 2010.

1028
01:12:40,691 --> 01:12:46,205
Speaker 1: I think that's right versus iPhone 12 and it's like oh that's not actually That huge.

1029
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,055
Speaker 0: Yeah well part of this is there's.

1030
01:12:48,096 --> 01:12:49,340
Speaker 0: there's a trailing edge of.

1031
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:52,332
Speaker 0: some of what happened this decade is Brand new.

1032
01:12:52,352 --> 01:12:59,637
Speaker 0: technology is extremely destabilizing and even though like you said we have this perceptionist moving slower It's actually moving faster and faster.

1033
01:12:59,718 --> 01:13:10,370
Speaker 0: The rate of change is accelerating and the but - there's this lagging indicator of People are adopting the technology that came about us in the beginning of this decade exactly.

1034
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:15,186
Speaker 1: We are way ahead of the curve the curve right that we hit in the 2000s.

1035
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:16,109
Speaker 1: We had all this stuff.

1036
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:22,197
Speaker 1: Yeah that stuff was adopted by the entire world and then Polished in the 2010.

1037
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,490
Speaker 0: that is where a lot of this earth-shattering societal change happened.

1038
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,737
Speaker 0: It wasn't someone invented social media.

1039
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:31,530
Speaker 0: It was a critical mass of humans have access to social media.

1040
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:46,410
Speaker 1: All the things we invented in the 2000s the 2010s wasn't about inventing new things as much as it was about Deploying the inventions of the previous decade to all humans who could possibly access it.

1041
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:46,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

1042
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:53,930
Speaker 1: and then making it easier and you know Incrementally making it nicer and nicer and nicer because so many people have it.

1043
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,549
Speaker 1: Well now there's more money in it to do that part, right?

1044
01:13:56,930 --> 01:14:04,279
Speaker 0: So something that's actually stuck out in my mind the last couple of months partly cuz I'm at home a lot I'm watching a lot of documentaries and read more just like nonfiction science.

1045
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:19,230
Speaker 0: It is easy to forget that in the last decade a Terrifying number of Scientific discoveries and advancements have happened that are kind of literally pushing into understanding the nature of existence.

1046
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:21,824
Speaker 0: We there are things that we just think we know that.

1047
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:25,237
Speaker 0: yeah We're literally discovered this decade.

1048
01:14:25,578 --> 01:14:31,355
Speaker 1: quantum all that stuff about like teleporting photons and shit all that stuff happened this day Like cut like there are.

1049
01:14:31,435 --> 01:14:44,530
Speaker 0: we've discovered all more about space in the last decade than possibly the previous 30 years Mm-hmm, and it seems like we almost have this and I say we is like society especially American society even like nerds like us.

1050
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:45,428
Speaker 0: We're very guilty of it.

1051
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:51,390
Speaker 0: The example I always use is doesn't it feel like Pokemon always existed like Pokemon's been around forever?

1052
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:55,068
Speaker 0: You almost like your brain almost make up memories of it around since then the mid to late 90s.

1053
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:59,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I was in high school and Pokemon was invented like yep, pretty much.

1054
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:05,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's easy to think Oh, yeah, this quantum physics thing that just seems obvious like yeah, what we knew?

1055
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:06,150
Speaker 0: we knew that what a hundred years ago.

1056
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,336
Speaker 0: It's like no we learned that thing Four years ago.

1057
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:11,365
Speaker 0: No one knew that before.

1058
01:15:11,426 --> 01:15:17,490
Speaker 1: four years ago Or at least someone had written it as a theory and that was in it floating around in your mind.

1059
01:15:17,811 --> 01:15:21,684
Speaker 1: But then the experiment that proved it right is like happened here.

1060
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:23,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're also large.

1061
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:29,350
Speaker 1: Large Hadron Collider was 2010s, but right some of these last decade talk about that trailing edge.

1062
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:35,250
Speaker 0: This decade was a huge advancement of material science and quantum mechanics.

1063
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:47,004
Speaker 0: The next decade is going to be not the met like not the like mass-market societal adoption of technology using that but the early practical applications of some of that advancement.

1064
01:15:47,366 --> 01:15:57,130
Speaker 0: the danger is Those advancements are Almost too powerful and too dangerous and the only people who will be able to leverage them in the next decade are mega corpse and states.

1065
01:15:57,992 --> 01:16:02,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the perfect example of material science I think is carbon fiber right.

1066
01:16:02,616 --> 01:16:07,310
Speaker 1: if you look in the 2000s carbon fiber was like this thing you saw someone making in a lab.

1067
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:13,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, right for some fan Or maybe it was and then it was on like an f1 car or something which is still is you see like a concept for a?

1068
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,593
Speaker 0: Carbon-fiber bike.

1069
01:16:14,774 --> 01:16:17,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and now I mean there.

1070
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:22,430
Speaker 1: I think there were carbon-fiber bikes maybe in 2000 But the point they were not accessible, right?

1071
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,909
Speaker 1: It's still not it's still not cheap.

1072
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,002
Speaker 1: But now if you have money, you can just get carbon fiber whatever.

1073
01:16:27,022 --> 01:16:34,110
Speaker 1: you can get a carbon fiber camera tripod You can get a carbon fiber, you know backpack, you know the carbon fiber fucking anything, right?

1074
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,640
Speaker 1: So whatever fit, you know, there are other fancy materials were.

1075
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:42,409
Speaker 0: so the first carbon fiber bike wasn't until the late 80s And it was bespoke.

1076
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:44,897
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, I mean they.

1077
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:51,260
Speaker 0: I was saying they existed but like now I go to a bike shop Like every bike has a carbon fiber fork at least.

1078
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:53,969
Speaker 1: Yep, ever all of them pretty much, right?

1079
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:55,853
Speaker 1: It's all over the place.

1080
01:16:55,893 --> 01:16:56,536
Speaker 1: Yep, but

1081
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:16,130
Speaker 0: I sued like a thing that I this sounds dumb But I've thought about this this whole decade cuz I I travel a lot I always like my whole adult life a lot of my career has been traveling and the thing that has stuck with me is you can tell when there are big advancements in material science when things get thinner and smaller to the like and planes

1082
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:17,334
Speaker 1: Seats

1083
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:22,474
Speaker 0: and armrests and backrests and like all that like boring stuff You don't think about.

1084
01:17:23,017 --> 01:17:29,270
Speaker 0: we're able to get thin enough to like cram Additional rows of seats into planes without reducing the space people have access to.

1085
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,089
Speaker 1: Also they took away legroom because they're assholes.

1086
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:40,489
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah They did also reduce space but some of that change was because the seats could literally be thinner Because material science had advanced to that point.

1087
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:44,250
Speaker 0: Material science advanced to a I keep saying terrifying degree.

1088
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:49,590
Speaker 0: But it's kind of true in the last decade in ways that are not obvious to people who don't work in these fields.

1089
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:55,655
Speaker 1: so now it's hard to see a decade out right because You know, it's hard to see.

1090
01:17:55,735 --> 01:17:57,682
Speaker 1: but what I can see in the more immediate future.

1091
01:17:57,702 --> 01:17:59,830
Speaker 1: We're talking about the chip war, right?

1092
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,034
Speaker 1: That's happening, right?

1093
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:04,166
Speaker 1: I still believe everything I've said about chip wars so far.

1094
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:05,370
Speaker 1: It's gonna have a huge impact.

1095
01:18:06,076 --> 01:18:13,391
Speaker 1: I think something else, you know What you have to do is you have to look around and you have to be able to see Right.

1096
01:18:13,452 --> 01:18:17,144
Speaker 1: It's like we look at like an iPod right an original iPod classic.

1097
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:19,955
Speaker 1: and you look at an iPod classic today The first iPod.

1098
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,730
Speaker 1: and you say wow, look at that chunky ugly boy.

1099
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:26,784
Speaker 1: But when it was new, it's like wow, that's fucking amazing, right?

1100
01:18:26,965 --> 01:18:28,210
Speaker 1: It didn't look chunky at all.

1101
01:18:28,331 --> 01:18:31,789
Speaker 1: It didn't look stupid that it was making a bunch of noise with the spinning hard drive in it.

1102
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:36,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it didn't look stupid that it's hard drive is small or any, you know, anything like that, right?

1103
01:18:37,195 --> 01:18:44,410
Speaker 1: It looked perfectly amazing But only in retrospect does it look chunky and bulky and obviously there was so much room for improvement.

1104
01:18:44,470 --> 01:19:00,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you have to do is you have to look around at things that seem To you currently as normal and you know great But actually they're chunky chunky boys in 2020 and they can be shrunk down.

1105
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:09,907
Speaker 0: So the chunky chunky boys that I see right now CRT is for me Unless CRT is monitors like LCDs because CRT is couldn't really shrink beyond a certain point but LCDs wouldn't like.

1106
01:19:09,947 --> 01:19:17,801
Speaker 0: they were pretty thick at the beginning of this decade and Now like even a pretty cheap LCD is crazy thin.

1107
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:21,552
Speaker 1: I'm talking about things that are chunky in 2020 Right.

1108
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:27,690
Speaker 1: Can you see something now that looks normal now, but is actually in 2030?

1109
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,219
Speaker 1: You're gonna look at it and say right.

1110
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,410
Speaker 1: So the things I see are the phones that fold.

1111
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:37,542
Speaker 1: Yep, right full screens that bend screens that bend.

1112
01:19:37,562 --> 01:19:40,190
Speaker 1: they're gonna make the screens because now they're selling them.

1113
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,240
Speaker 1: They're selling them in the store right now.

1114
01:19:42,823 --> 01:19:46,859
Speaker 1: So in ten years You're gonna have the screen that bends.

1115
01:19:46,939 --> 01:19:52,987
Speaker 1: I think is gonna be the real like super thin like in your bag Like the tablet is just gonna be like floppy like flop a flop a flop.

1116
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:56,018
Speaker 1: Ah, right It's not gonna be like a rigid rectangle.

1117
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,082
Speaker 1: You can roll it up.

1118
01:19:57,122 --> 01:19:59,269
Speaker 1: You can whack your fly with it, right?

1119
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:01,600
Speaker 1: It'll be fine something like that.

1120
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:15,114
Speaker 1: the other thing I see this really chunky Again in the battery department, you'll look at like e-bikes, right, you know The lithium-ion battery applied to so much transportation not just cars bikes scooters all those things You know.

1121
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:16,161
Speaker 1: drones all 2010s, right?

1122
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:26,143
Speaker 1: the e-bike is of 2020. a 2030 is gonna look like Not an e-bike.

1123
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:29,480
Speaker 0: I think By not be chunky right now the e-bike.

1124
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,170
Speaker 1: It's like it's chunky things stuck on your down tube, right?

1125
01:20:32,451 --> 01:20:32,993
