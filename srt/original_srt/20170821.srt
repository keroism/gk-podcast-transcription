00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, good fresh.

13
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:52,439
Speaker 1: They used to have a lot of good like takeaway lunch sandwiches But they really cut back on that to try to get you to pay way more money.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,110
Speaker 1: Yeah for basically the same food sitting down.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,535
Speaker 0: They sell the big cookie there.

16
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,860
Speaker 0: There's like a thousand calories.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,426
Speaker 1: I got something I shouldn't have gotten.

18
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,280
Speaker 1: they had a thing they called a cookie a french cream donut and it was - yo tart.

19
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,443
Speaker 1: it was basically just a fried pastry filled with like Vanilla cream.

20
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:09,005
Speaker 0: Yeah.

21
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:14,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it's a place and when I go there usually they had to sit this tartan.

22
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,788
Speaker 0: That's really good.

23
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:17,099
Speaker 1: All those tartans are so good.

24
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:23,280
Speaker 0: It's like ricotta cheese on a piece of bread and then they put prosciutto and fig and aruba.

25
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:27,848
Speaker 1: I used to get the one that had like salmon and dill And they put honey on it, right?

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:28,530
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

27
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,965
Speaker 0: So I was like, you know what I Was like thinking about it.

28
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,192
Speaker 0: Like I kind of want one of those.

29
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:40,229
Speaker 0: and then I was like, wait a minute That requires no cooking No cooking whatsoever.

30
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:47,120
Speaker 0: You can just buy bread Yeah, and a tub of ricotta cheese and I have honey and you buy a thing of prosciutto.

31
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:52,286
Speaker 1: so Discovered the ability to make your own lunch.

32
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 0: you can make this thing and like five minutes for way less money than they charge.

33
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:02,768
Speaker 0: The bread I got at the grocery was not as good as the bread they have but I guess I could have bought a bread There or made a bread.

34
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:07,838
Speaker 0: I mean you can buy just baguettes there Yeah, but it you know, they make it on that tartan bread, right?

35
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,770
Speaker 0: No Yeah, but you know the bread from the grocery store wasn't bad.

36
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,778
Speaker 0: It just wasn't the same bread, but it Tasted basically the same.

37
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:17,300
Speaker 0: So that was a good time.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,625
Speaker 0: I was like, oh and now I have like, you know The I have enough to like.

39
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:24,259
Speaker 0: make it again like, you know, like twice before I go to PAX.

40
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,387
Speaker 0: at least That's not too bad.

41
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,680
Speaker 1: We're picking up a CSA tomorrow.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,805
Speaker 1: So we got a cook every night starting tomorrow to use up all that food, you know, if anyone out there it's like think you know.

43
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:37,500
Speaker 0: when you go to a restaurant or something and you think about The things you're paying for there that cost a lot of money.

44
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,154
Speaker 0: It's like some of those things like you have fancy steakhouse.

45
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,180
Speaker 0: They make a fancy steak.

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,328
Speaker 0: It's like you could do that But like there's actually.

47
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:46,620
Speaker 1: that's a way easier to do than a lot of the other things.

48
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,678
Speaker 1: It's pretty simple is easy to do.

49
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,060
Speaker 0: But even if I have the instructions on how to do it just doesn't you want to make a steak like in those places?

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Speaker 1: Just sous vide it like it's gonna be fine.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,566
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's like the way they made.

52
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:03,400
Speaker 0: it's like I even if I try really hard and follow lots of internet instructions I just can't get it to taste the same way.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,440
Speaker 1: I look at it more like something I do with like cocktails, but I never order a cocktail.

54
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,486
Speaker 1: That's really easy to make.

55
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:11,060
Speaker 1: I order the ones that are a pain in the ass to make because I don't want to make.

56
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,047
Speaker 0: There are some things that you might be buying at places that for a lot of money like computers that you could make very easily Like computers, right?

57
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:19,368
Speaker 0: You couldn't.

58
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:20,934
Speaker 0: you couldn't make a video card easily.

59
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:22,139
Speaker 1: No, but I can buy.

60
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,874
Speaker 0: The recipe for the guac at Chipotle is on the Chipotle website.

61
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:28,616
Speaker 0: I've made it.

62
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:32,120
Speaker 1: it's ridiculously easy Yeah, but guacamole is pretty easy to make in general.

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,786
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you can get the even.

64
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,922
Speaker 0: it comes out even better than what you get at Chipotle when you buy it there because It's fresh.

65
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just goes bad real fast.

66
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,979
Speaker 0: So I hope you have a lot of friends in a party to eat it.

67
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,820
Speaker 1: So I went out to watch the Eclipse and everyone went out to watch you.

68
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, the streets are all blocked in Midtown like our streets weren't blocked.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,485
Speaker 0: Everyone was but there's I guess in the Times Square tourist zone There's lots of pedestrian walk.

70
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,780
Speaker 0: Yeah areas and the sign part was blocked by a lot of tall buildings.

71
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:01,997
Speaker 0: So people were huddled in masses in the areas where the Sun shone through.

72
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,831
Speaker 1: Yep Meanwhile shadow walkers like people just actually trying to get somewhere.

73
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,100
Speaker 1: We're like walking in the shadow between all these people.

74
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:09,980
Speaker 1: I was trapped in Bryant Park.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,507
Speaker 1: I actually jumped a fence to get into the subway and then I walked through the subway to get out on the other side to Get away from the crowd.

76
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:17,640
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't have that problem.

77
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:21,995
Speaker 1: But the craziest thing was that you know, New York like strangers don't interact.

78
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:26,287
Speaker 1: when a stranger interactions You they're either trying to rob you or they're crazy Or they're all.

79
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:30,889
Speaker 0: in return is when there's a reason to interact It's like but they don't if there's no reason.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,780
Speaker 0: they don't even you know, you don't acknowledge each other's existence.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,960
Speaker 0: But once you have a reason, you know, which takes some doing but then you interact with them.

82
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 1: Yeah And I watched a lot of people just like interacting and more importantly there weren't just like interacting and like talking about the Eclipse.

83
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:52,658
Speaker 1: people were like sharing and passing around their different Eclipse viewing glasses and it was like a big old block party.

84
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:55,025
Speaker 1: and So I actually the watch.

85
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:59,121
Speaker 1: I looked at it through a bunch of different kinds of glasses after checking them to make sure they weren't Fake.

86
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:00,144
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:05,240
Speaker 1: I saw easily two dozen people seriously hurt themselves looking at it without glasses.

88
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:06,828
Speaker 0: I saw people looking at the sun.

89
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,980
Speaker 1: I saw literally there's this husband and wife.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,376
Speaker 1: They're kind of standing behind me and I hear the wife go.

91
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:22,560
Speaker 1: man I wish I brought my sunglasses and the guys like mine are working fine and I turn around and they're clearly regular sunglasses And I feel like that guy's gonna have a real bad day.

92
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:26,111
Speaker 0: There are a lot of tweets showing stupid people looking at the Sun.

93
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:31,372
Speaker 0: my favorite though was those one That was like our own president looking right up ahead.

94
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,749
Speaker 0: It was a Twitter search for the words Hurt my eyes my eyes hurt.

95
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,115
Speaker 0: Yes, and there was a lot of results.

96
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,100
Speaker 0: and then there was another one.

97
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,164
Speaker 0: This is the really good one.

98
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,900
Speaker 0: It was just clips from neo gaff discussion.

99
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:48,720
Speaker 0: And oh, I saw that one too and it was like a bunch of people like before the Eclipse saying like it's a bunch of bullshit.

100
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:53,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, my mom's eye doctor says, you know People are getting crazy for no reason.

101
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,618
Speaker 0: and then a whole bunch of boats like oh my god.

102
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,280
Speaker 0: No, they weren't.

103
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,758
Speaker 0: It's like I'm a fucking moron.

104
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:01,880
Speaker 0: Why did we not believe?

105
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Speaker 1: But it was pretty cool.

106
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,680
Speaker 1: I'm glad I took the time to go and just sort of enjoy it because it didn't get crazy dark.

107
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,893
Speaker 1: I mean, we got like 70% in New York.

108
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,634
Speaker 0: I mean, I look it didn't get dark, but it's like I looked at it enough.

109
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,960
Speaker 0: I had brought my welding glass.

110
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I already owned and was.

111
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,136
Speaker 0: apparently I was like, oh I have a welding glass.

112
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,420
Speaker 0: I wonder if that's sufficient.

113
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:25,981
Speaker 0: I went to the NASA safety website Yeah, and NASA was like you need a welding glass of 12.

114
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:29,140
Speaker 0: But some people for some people 12 is still not good enough.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,362
Speaker 0: They you should get 14. mine was 12 and I'm like, well, they said it's safe with 12.

116
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:38,140
Speaker 0: So I looked at it for like a fraction of a second even with the glasses that seem legit.

117
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,092
Speaker 1: I only looked at it for like 10 seconds.

118
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:46,070
Speaker 1: I was like, okay, I saw it yeah, but I was more impressed by looking at the Dappling through the trees in Bryant Park.

119
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:54,335
Speaker 0: cuz it made a million little crescents all over the ground Reflections off the buildings like Buildings, but I also I brought made a box of the hole in it this morning.

120
00:06:54,375 --> 00:07:01,515
Speaker 0: It took like one minute Yeah, and then I looked at my box of the hole in it and then I was like, okay I'm still amazed at how many people today seem to have no idea.

121
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,068
Speaker 1: an eclipse was happening Like how do you how do you live your life?

122
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,773
Speaker 1: It is not no stuff.

123
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:07,475
Speaker 0: I don't know.

124
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:08,960
Speaker 0: How does that happen?

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,522
Speaker 0: I don't know.

126
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:15,371
Speaker 0: I feel like my feet has been nothing but people talking about the eclipse Also, I think a lot of people don't respect the box of the hole in it.

127
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:22,447
Speaker 0: Yeah box of the hole in it is real good Camera without a film or a sensor.

128
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't get the color aspect of it.

129
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,078
Speaker 0: Hey, dude, why not?

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,543
Speaker 1: I'll debate which poll because usually when people make the pinhole they use it to make the dapple effect and get the outline on The grounds.

131
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,654
Speaker 0: no, I made a box of the hole in.

132
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:35,700
Speaker 0: it is basically just a camera.

133
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,145
Speaker 0: You can look.

134
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:37,519
Speaker 0: you can like look at anything through it.

135
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know just you basically lets you look at stuff behind you as long as it's bright enough because it's a tiny pinhole.

136
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,577
Speaker 0: So you need a lot of light to see anything, right?

137
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,419
Speaker 0: Something behind you is real bright you can just see it in there.

138
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,700
Speaker 1: So anyway, that was fun and the next one will be a while from now.

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,679
Speaker 0: And I think the best thing I saw you could fly around the world to see a different one.

140
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:58,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best thing I saw was someone showed during the eclipses path.

141
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:09,220
Speaker 1: they took a Google or whatever one of those traffic sites and you can see the path of the eclipse in terms of where there were traffic jams When you're zoomed all the way out from the u.s.

142
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:09,823
Speaker 0: But I did.

143
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:14,066
Speaker 0: is I only looked at the eclipse a little bit because I figure I can see better Images of it on the internet.

144
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I can't.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,100
Speaker 0: and why risk my eyes even with protection?

146
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I spent most of my time taking pictures of the people.

147
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:28,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I saw a lot of people doing being really into it and cheering and people were again hurting their eyes and yelling.

148
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:35,166
Speaker 0: a lot of People were like a lot of people are trying to take a picture with their phone And then I had mobile.

149
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,595
Speaker 1: people ask me just randomly like why aren't my pictures turning out?

150
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:39,958
Speaker 1: I was just like what's wrong with you?

151
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:46,218
Speaker 0: Some people are putting their you know, they're protective glasses in front of their camera work.

152
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:51,066
Speaker 0: Okay Good luck exposing it properly.

153
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,133
Speaker 1: I watch someone do that.

154
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,340
Speaker 1: They held it and they took their little like glasses.

155
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:56,760
Speaker 1: They held it in front of their phone.

156
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,426
Speaker 1: They held their phone up and then they went.

157
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:03,176
Speaker 1: ah because they looked right into the Sun with the realize because they were holding their glasses, yep.

158
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:08,840
Speaker 1: So in some news Intel is launched in their 8th gen core CPUs.

159
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:10,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've been going real slow.

160
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,316
Speaker 0: But I think is AMD with their rise ends actually pushing.

161
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,600
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on.

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,569
Speaker 1: No, I'm honestly I'm not.

163
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:18,714
Speaker 1: it's really sure.

164
00:09:18,854 --> 00:09:19,276
Speaker 0: schedule.

165
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:20,040
Speaker 0: I don't know the deal is.

166
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:29,615
Speaker 1: I'm not really sure if this is Nvidia pushing if the AMD Leap forward is going to be sustained or is even really relevant or not.

167
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,438
Speaker 0: a joke in the long run.

168
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:30,819
Speaker 0: I don't know.

169
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,624
Speaker 1: uh, we'll see how this all goes.

170
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:38,177
Speaker 0: but anyway, the point the thing is this new a gen is Mobile only laptop only.

171
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:41,769
Speaker 0: so this is gonna be a big boost for like surfaces and Mac books and the.

172
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,819
Speaker 0: you know All the things we were complaining like the last MacBook is sucky.

173
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,522
Speaker 0: Yeah.

174
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:50,187
Speaker 0: Well, it's now when you get these chips in there It'll you it'll be significantly better, right?

175
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,327
Speaker 0: But the desktop is not upgraded yet, but it's coming.

176
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:54,990
Speaker 0: apparently.

177
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,513
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's not really.

178
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,744
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna be a major upgrade for the desktop area.

179
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:04,322
Speaker 0: really unless you're the kind of desktop That's like got an Intel CPU with no GPU.

180
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:06,893
Speaker 0: if you're that kind and maybe oh, yeah Then you're good.

181
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,925
Speaker 1: That's like the best use case for this.

182
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:17,234
Speaker 0: if you want to make a Tiny tiny computer that can play like 4k video, but if you are just if you have a GPU in there I don't think this is gonna be better.

183
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:21,530
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna build a new computer when the ninth gen CPU comes out.

184
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, whether it's the the what's I think this is what I don't not sure.

185
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,856
Speaker 0: There's like they want to talk about.

186
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,479
Speaker 0: there's like gonna be.

187
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,730
Speaker 0: the 10 nanometer is a 10 the next number.

188
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:30,272
Speaker 1: So.

189
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,903
Speaker 0: and then there's another one they talk about like coffee something.

190
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,771
Speaker 0: so I don't know which one of those is right now like.

191
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:46,410
Speaker 1: we're gonna wait and see which one of those is the good one by ridiculously fast like Crazy CPU on my new computer is running it like a little over a gigahertz right now.

192
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, my computer is actually just fine.

193
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:53,054
Speaker 0: I just you know, even the thing is Again, right?

194
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:58,048
Speaker 0: It's it's not nearly as bad as it was when I had that shady hard drive.

195
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:02,990
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That was crashing you but it's still got some some slight weird issues, right?

196
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,528
Speaker 0: so for example Like I'm not even near the computer and like it detects that like headphones have been connected in a dialog box.

197
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,070
Speaker 0: What?

198
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,876
Speaker 1: What?

199
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,909
Speaker 0: That's that's weird.

200
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:15,599
Speaker 0: It's not like before.

201
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:24,089
Speaker 0: it was like blue screening with some consistency But there was one blue screen like I came home from going out and those blue screen once and I'm like, huh?

202
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,595
Speaker 0: I want no blue screens.

203
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,248
Speaker 1: That is part of why I upgrade cuz my computer was way older than your computer.

204
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:35,070
Speaker 0: Yeah like Older, but it wasn't bad about maybe heat issues.

205
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:41,100
Speaker 0: So I'm definitely gonna get you know, it's like I could just buy a computer now with super cooling But that's stupid when I have a perfectly good computer.

206
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I gotta say like haven't gotten my new computer.

207
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,284
Speaker 1: It's just so nice that it's basically silent.

208
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:47,550
Speaker 1: It's so fast.

209
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,664
Speaker 0: Also somebody published this Google Doc.

210
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,790
Speaker 0: I can give you the link for it.

211
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:53,779
Speaker 0: That has.

212
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,990
Speaker 0: it's basically just a spreadsheet.

213
00:11:55,491 --> 00:12:04,610
Speaker 0: It's read-only but someone's keeping it up to date and it has all of these small computer cases available Oh and all their stats in one big spreadsheet.

214
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:05,544
Speaker 0: so you can be like Oh.

215
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:13,652
Speaker 0: So I could find one that lets you put the GPU in sideways and also allows water cooling and I can get these a really Tiny computer.

216
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,197
Speaker 0: that's also godlike.

217
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:16,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, not too shabby.

218
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:28,161
Speaker 1: Maybe because when my current htpc finally dies That's the route I'm going there's gonna be like a tiny CPU and a tiny motherboard with a tiny m2 drive and like one RAM stick no video card.

219
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a tiny Htpc, but it's got a 1070 in it.

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think I got a.

221
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:34,630
Speaker 0: I can play all the game.

222
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,030
Speaker 1: I think I still got a 460 in the htpc.

223
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,947
Speaker 0: I play all the games actually a better video card in the htpc than in my desktop.

224
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,158
Speaker 0: because you know Yeah, there's some games over there.

225
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:49,910
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this isn't really news I just want to point it out because it's kind of funny and I'm surprised this is being talked about as much as they.

226
00:12:51,074 --> 00:13:00,241
Speaker 1: But if you didn't see it There's this dude who basically complained that he did something with Visual Studio and it deleted Like all the code he's ever written.

227
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,769
Speaker 0: I know this is weird cuz just the you know.

228
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:17,050
Speaker 0: Well a while ago we were talking about someone who was like an intern or just a new hire or at something at a company following the docs to set up their environment and yeah leading the production database, right and You know, it's like we blamed the company, right?

229
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:20,665
Speaker 0: This guy's deleting his own work and we're gonna blame him.

230
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:21,790
Speaker 0: How does that work?

231
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,322
Speaker 0: Well, it really just comes down to who was responsible for having backups.

232
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:29,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, their intern wasn't responsible for making backups.

233
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:33,130
Speaker 0: So, you know and he was following documentation, right?

234
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,279
Speaker 0: This is someone who installed a piece of software on their own.

235
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:47,845
Speaker 0: probably wasn't following any documentation written by anyone else Just doing things without knowing what they do independently One hard drive and has never backed anything up ever leading their own data and not having a backup.

236
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:49,590
Speaker 0: so they're responsible, right?

237
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,817
Speaker 0: It's you know, just the circumstances.

238
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,603
Speaker 0: but yet again, we can't.

239
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:59,163
Speaker 0: I mean we remind people all the time But we can't remind you enough if your data is not backed up.

240
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:00,789
Speaker 0: You might as well just delete it now.

241
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:13,279
Speaker 1: Yep, if you're if you couldn't survive Literally reaching your computer right now pulling the hard drive out from the running system and smashing it with a hammer You're not backed up enough And you should back your stuff up.

242
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like if you did that to me right now I'd lose data for sure.

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not any data I'd give a shit about.

244
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:24,486
Speaker 0: all the data I give a shit about is it is a back it up very nice Caught fire.

245
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:32,164
Speaker 1: My computer is up and running and I lost maybe a few hours worth of the work I'd done like in the two days before it caught fire.

246
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:37,443
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I was fine Mm-hmm, if every hard drive in the room, I'm sitting in now died.

247
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:42,150
Speaker 1: All of geek nights is still online Mm-hmm and backed up in a couple different places.

248
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,677
Speaker 1: so yeah, but in much more important news, especially considering the Times that we live in in the u.s.

249
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:53,250
Speaker 1: In particular iOS 11 is adding a very important feature.

250
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:57,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the thing that you know is like we talk about really good passwords, right?

251
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,890
Speaker 0: And I won't lie the password to unlock my phone.

252
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,786
Speaker 0: It's not one of those stupid swipey things like Android and it's not some crap.

253
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,910
Speaker 0: Oh four digit pin It's a real a password.

254
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,030
Speaker 0: Yeah Which by the way iOS has a mode where you can force a real password to unlock your phone.

255
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:24,790
Speaker 0: The problem is if you make that real password a password of any length of any significance You got to type that shit in on his iPhone Keyboard and type it in once in an elevator and the security company that works that elevator has it now exactly.

256
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,960
Speaker 0: So that kind of sucks.

257
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,870
Speaker 0: So typing it is really annoying.

258
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:34,390
Speaker 0: So what you want to do is you want to use, you know, the fingerprint scanner, right?

259
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,930
Speaker 0: So that you don't have to type it in all the time.

260
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:41,589
Speaker 0: The problem is at least legally in the United States as of today and we're not lawyers, right?

261
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:51,653
Speaker 0: As far as I'm aware They can't force you to reveal your password if they say arrest you and question you and I believe that comes down to the Fifth Amendment.

262
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,849
Speaker 1: yeah the Fifth Amendment and they can't prove you didn't forget it.

263
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,154
Speaker 0: So exactly.

264
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:59,349
Speaker 0: but if you have a fingerprint thing enabled they can force you to touch it.

265
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,093
Speaker 1: They can't.

266
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:03,130
Speaker 1: you can't say I lost my finger and I don't remember where I put it.

267
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,918
Speaker 0: You can chop your finger off and set it on fire.

268
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:08,955
Speaker 1: Yeah that might wonder if that would count as Tampering or something.

269
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,870
Speaker 0: I don't know but I'm not about to chop my finger off to protect my phone.

270
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,910
Speaker 1: It would depend on what I just done What I was worried they would find on my phone anyway.

271
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,545
Speaker 0: So but how do you get the convenience of the fingerprint sensor, right?

272
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,190
Speaker 0: Plus it does add security, right?

273
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,570
Speaker 0: I mean if you try to use the fingerprint scanner ten times my phone's just gonna erase itself.

274
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:28,455
Speaker 1: I just thought of something.

275
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,430
Speaker 1: actually one way you could do it make a rubber finger.

276
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,761
Speaker 0: By the way, I don't give a shit because I have backups.

277
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:40,185
Speaker 1: make a rubber finger pad That has a pattern that you just draw like an illustrator or something and then you printed.

278
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:40,967
Speaker 1: you use that.

279
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:41,710
Speaker 1: don't like your phone.

280
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:42,874
Speaker 1: No, you just know.

281
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,441
Speaker 1: just tear it off your finger and throw it away.

282
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,083
Speaker 0: I don't know.

283
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:49,285
Speaker 0: But anyway, uh, So they're adding a new feature supposedly we don't know.

284
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,010
Speaker 0: this isn't for sure.

285
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,030
Speaker 0: We'll find out when iOS the next iOS actually hits but it seems pretty confirmed.

286
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:58,770
Speaker 0: They're adding a new feature where you can disable the fingerprint.

287
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:04,170
Speaker 0: So I think I read something along the lines of like you push the power button like five times fast or something.

288
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,660
Speaker 1: Yep, I got a quote here from a slash shot headline.

289
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,060
Speaker 1: this presents you with the emergency SOS option Which you can swipe to call emergency services.

290
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,750
Speaker 1: It prevents your iPhone from being unlocked without the passcode.

291
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:15,169
Speaker 0: Yep.

292
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,676
Speaker 0: So you basically hit the power button five times.

293
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 0: like what are there five?

294
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,670
Speaker 0: and now you need the passcode?

295
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,890
Speaker 0: The fingerprint sensor has been disabled until you re-enable it.

296
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,410
Speaker 0: So now you like you're about to go to the airport go one of your five and then don't unlock your phone until you're through all the security bullshit and on the plane.

297
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:38,030
Speaker 0: I feel like what then when you're getting when you're heading towards the customs in the other Airport go one of your five and So forth and now even if they try to search your phone, it's like good luck assholes.

298
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,590
Speaker 1: Now what I would really want is a step beyond this.

299
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,717
Speaker 1: However, I realized that if they made what I want.

300
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:53,369
Speaker 1: a lot of people use iPhones would fuck up and do this to themselves But I want the option where if I put in a different passcode or like I swipe a different finger It immediately just wipes the phone.

301
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:57,570
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like this my real password and then there's another pass.

302
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe the password should be delete my phone and press enter.

303
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:09,580
Speaker 1: But what I do what it would do is one it should immediately log in to a like pretty generic Interface with no accounts blank iOS screen.

304
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,923
Speaker 0: That looks like you just set up iOS with no data whatsoever And meanwhile while it presents that screen it is deleting everything.

305
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:16,425
Speaker 0: Yep.

306
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,750
Speaker 1: That's that's what I would like.

307
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,710
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm kind of like in certain cut, you know, the thing is everything on the phone is already encrypted.

308
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:25,610
Speaker 0: So deleting it is it's it's like alright, whatever.

309
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:32,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you're not gonna trust Apple who seems to actually for all we can tell they seem to actually care about the privacy.

310
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:33,873
Speaker 0: Oh, where was it?

311
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,085
Speaker 0: I read someone they were using to help unlock the dude's phone.

312
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:45,621
Speaker 1: Remember I think someone claimed I have a proof of concept of Compromising the security coprocessor on iOS like a reason.

313
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:46,725
Speaker 0: anything is possible.

314
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:50,633
Speaker 0: But the point is Apple seems to care Even though there may be Vulnerabilities.

315
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:59,262
Speaker 0: I think we can trust them at least on this one aspect also based on the pressure They've been under I get the fact that they would develop this feature earns them credit.

316
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:12,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, right not they're not a hundred percent trust No one is but it's like, you know If you're not gonna trust Apple after all they've done at least in this one area You just I guess you just paranoid nutjob might as well just make your own computer with the soldering.

317
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,008
Speaker 1: Well, you know we talked about this a long time ago.

318
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:21,270
Speaker 1: You gotta trust someone yeah, or if you're not gonna trust anyone you're gonna live a real hard life.

319
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:24,642
Speaker 0: I'll trust someone who makes this feature and fights the FBI, right?

320
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:25,104
Speaker 0: Yeah.

321
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,489
Speaker 0: I'm glad this feature is coming.

322
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:35,950
Speaker 1: So yeah, but anyway things of the day.

323
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:41,690
Speaker 1: I think I've seen people tweet like panels from this comic before but someone finally linked me to the comment.

324
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,264
Speaker 0: This is one of those things where it's like you don't realize it's a continuing webcomic.

325
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:48,115
Speaker 0: as you see it tweeted occasionally But you don't follow.

326
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:52,896
Speaker 1: I usually would see the one where this rabbits just sitting there and he's like, oh man What a fucking beautiful day.

327
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:53,981
Speaker 1: Look at that flower.

328
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,624
Speaker 1: Holy fuck.

329
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:54,986
Speaker 1: Yes.

331
00:19:55,729 --> 00:20:02,750
Speaker 1: Yep So this is the comic falls knees and it's basically that and I basically went through the whole archive.

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,859

00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:21,865
Speaker 0: You don't even know.

344

00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,261
Speaker 0: I basically forget it.

346
00:20:25,281 --> 00:20:26,567
Speaker 1: You know what I could read the whole thing again.

347
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,792
Speaker 1: It's pretty good Order.

348
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,658
Speaker 1: the stick has been escalating rapidly.

349
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,400
Speaker 0: I'm sure it has.

350
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,329
Speaker 0: I haven't read any webcomic in over a year, too.

351
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,458
Speaker 1: What was the last thing you remember happening in order of the stick?

352
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,106
Speaker 0: There was like they were at this like.

353
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,410
Speaker 1: is anyone a vampire?

354
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dwarf was a vampire.

355
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:51,216
Speaker 0: No, the dwarf is dead inside a dwarf vampire who was at the meeting of all the cleric, okay You're not as far behind as I thought you were.

356
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:55,529
Speaker 1: that's when I stopped reading webcomics, but there's good stuff going on in there now.

357
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:58,201
Speaker 1: SMBC xkcd.

358
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,317
Speaker 1: Penny arcade today was actually plenty.

359
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,265
Speaker 0: arcade is one of the comics that I still haven't.

360
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:07,226
Speaker 0: I probably haven't read all of them since I stopped reading webcomics.

361
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:10,483
Speaker 0: By the way to start reading webcomics wasn't intentional.

362
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,650
Speaker 0: it was just like an accident.

363
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:14,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now it's like too daunting to catch up.

364
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,583
Speaker 0: But penny arcade will tweet like new comic and I'll click it and I'll read.

365
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,158
Speaker 1: so the one today was pretty good Yeah, but false knees is just cute.

366
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,870
Speaker 1: And if you want to see animals just just read it.

367
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,467
Speaker 1: It's it's hard to describe why I find it funny.

368
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:26,890
Speaker 0: All right.

369
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,276
Speaker 0: So here's a my thing of the day.

370
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:32,339
Speaker 0: is this trailer for a movie and I think it's an independent movie Or is it British?

371
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:48,176
Speaker 0: I don't know where who's made it Doesn't seem like a Hollywood production, but it's a dark comedy about what a rims favorite not good people the style Joseph Stalin bad guy, so basically, the movie is about Stalin dies.

372
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:50,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, like in his office alone.

373
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,592
Speaker 0: I like the beginning and One.

374
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:59,050
Speaker 0: there's a whole bunch of other people who then freak out But it looks like an all-star cast.

375
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:08,790
Speaker 1: It's like it's like the Arrested Development slash Curb Your Enthusiasm Slash best in show kind of it looks and the way the trailer is set.

376
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,603
Speaker 0: It looks like the opening to snatch where they're like the Sun.

377
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,316
Speaker 0: Yeah the politician It's like.

378
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:25,550
Speaker 0: oh so you got all these, you know The cast of characters all getting all mixed up because Stalin just died and somewhat seriousness But also mostly comedy.

379
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I legit laugh.

380
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:31,430
Speaker 1: just watching like half of the trailer like this looks really good.

381
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:40,218
Speaker 1: It looks way good and bonus points for the fact that it is a movie made in English Set in Russia and instead of having everyone talk in fakie Russian accents.

382
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,600
Speaker 1: They just talk like themselves.

383
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:45,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's trying to do a fake Russian accent, which is nice.

384
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:50,056
Speaker 1: Yeah that counts for a lot, but this movie looks Real up my alley.

385
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:52,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, so check out this trailer.

386
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,409
Speaker 0: is the movie out.

387
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,857
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know anything about the movies release.

388
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:55,863
Speaker 0: You're gonna Google that yourself.

389
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,109
Speaker 1: I'll have to type it into IMDb.

390
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,476
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna do that right now.

391
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:01,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the moment the booklet book apparently is still dune.

392
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:03,357
Speaker 0: So it's the fifth element.

393
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,261
Speaker 0: I started reading it.

394
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,670
Speaker 1: I'm on the nice website and it says book club.

395
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,800
Speaker 0: I started reading the fifth season by NK jemisin on the train just now on the way here I'm in the prologue way.

396
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,439
Speaker 1: I was gonna do that But then I finish.

397
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,090
Speaker 1: I read the false son on the way to work.

398
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,492
Speaker 0: You know what?

399
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,910
Speaker 1: I realize I read the other other story on the way home.

400
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,910
Speaker 0: I realized recently I've made I found a way to make a simple but significant life improvement, right?

401
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,624
Speaker 0: All right, I finished basically playing race for the galaxy on my phone.

402
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:33,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, I win about 66% of the time now.

403
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think I can literally not do better.

404
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,250
Speaker 0: But anyway, I was done.

405
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,430
Speaker 0: I'm like, all right I'm done playing race to the galaxy on my phone and I started trying to play war bits which is advanced wars.

406
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,360
Speaker 0: But the problem is it's not easy to play.

407
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,170
Speaker 0: I got the levels got more complicated.

408
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:51,630
Speaker 0: I couldn't play them in one train ride or one poop or anything anymore because they're real levels now.

409
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,060
Speaker 0: Right, they have like airplanes and stuff and not even boats.

410
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,264
Speaker 0: yet too much.

411
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,110
Speaker 0: So and I'm like got two opponents.

412
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,829
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

413
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:07,143
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'm gonna get a new game and I went through the app store to look for a new game And I didn't really see much worth playing even stuff that caused money.

414
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:07,966
Speaker 0: There wasn't real.

415
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,493
Speaker 0: and you know, I'm like You know what.

416
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,304
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna play phone games anymore.

417
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:13,947
Speaker 0: It's gonna read.

418
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:14,730
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read.

419
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,743
Speaker 0: I'll use the Kindle app and set all those games.

420
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:17,770
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea.

421
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,945
Speaker 0: So whenever I feel like playing a phone game just open Kindle app read pages.

422
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,753
Speaker 1: once it's so winter again I'll start.

423
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:24,399
Speaker 0: I can just do that.

424
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:25,610
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna do that forever.

425
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:39,768
Speaker 1: I'm done with phone games because when I'm not a police of the short time in my life rather than reading what I usually do Is listen to podcasts, but when I listen to podcasts, I pretty much listen to Pseudopod and podcasts like it like short contemporary fiction.

426
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:42,760
Speaker 0: Hmm That's not to say I'm not gonna play any phone or mobile games.

427
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,646
Speaker 0: You're just only gonna play significant meaningful ones You know like yeah, like hey, let's play a carcass own while we're waiting.

428
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:53,630
Speaker 0: or hey I'm gonna play this war bits for serious or I'm gonna play Hearthstone, but I don't want to sit at the computer.

429
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, well playing race for the galaxy is just wrote at this point.

430
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:56,487
Speaker 1: So yeah.

431
00:24:57,671 --> 00:25:02,290
Speaker 1: So yeah, the fifth season will be the book club book and well, I'll probably read it to and from packs.

432
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,626
Speaker 0: This is a soup a relatively new Super award-winning.

433
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:15,529
Speaker 0: Oh my god awesome book and the game won the Hugo Award two years ago or last year and the sequel to this book won the award this Year and the third one in the series just came out.

434
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:20,749
Speaker 0: So I'm probably actually just gonna read the whole series But we'll do the book club book after reading just this first one.

435
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:26,690
Speaker 1: Multiple people who are already fans of this stuff have come out of the woodwork in the forums to be excited.

436
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,050
Speaker 1: So I'm actually getting more and more.

437
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:33,110
Speaker 0: So I picked it because it's like the biggest deal and the sci-fi fantasy novel world right now.

438
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:46,270
Speaker 1: And now that I sort of you know My momentum of reading the prince of nothing kind of over and into me literally reading the entire appendix Like I know there's a lot of entries that are just men of the tusk died on this date in this battle.

439
00:25:47,036 --> 00:25:49,054
Speaker 1: I read that entire fucking thing I didn't read.

440
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,929
Speaker 0: I only read a few choice entries.

441
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:56,030
Speaker 1: So some of the ones that don't look like they're gonna be choice that are like a paragraph but they seem like a lame heading.

442
00:25:56,653 --> 00:25:57,477
Speaker 1: Pretty choice.

443
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,427
Speaker 0: when you read I'll tell me what those ones are.

444
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:04,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's the rule Just skip anything that starts with man of the tusk because those are the only ones that are just like.

445
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:07,477
Speaker 0: alright What if it's man of the tusk and you skip it.

446
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:16,441
Speaker 0: and then meanwhile that second sentence was like, you know Oh cuz I read a journey to Ayana and because I read the ball Oh, you even read the man of the.

447
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:25,334
Speaker 1: the only one That was gave me any pause and I don't know if it was a mistake was that it did not list a death year for Confess.

448
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:25,937
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

449
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,541
Speaker 1: So I read that I Really want to see confess come back.

450
00:26:31,702 --> 00:26:33,650
Speaker 0: every other people who thought were dead came back.

451
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,453
Speaker 0: So why the fuck not?

452
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:41,818
Speaker 1: and also conferences greatest moment in all those books is your boy was when nayer Bent him over his knee and spanked him.

453
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:42,019
Speaker 1: Yes.

454
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:43,846
Speaker 1: I'll never forget that.

455
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,910
Speaker 0: see good old spank.

456
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,880
Speaker 1: That was a real good scene.

457
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,630
Speaker 0: also met a moment, right?

458
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:53,870
Speaker 0: We if you're I mean you're either watching this on YouTube or you're listening to this podcast somehow.

459
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:54,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

460
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,541
Speaker 0: That means you must really be.

461
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:00,529
Speaker 0: I mean that you shouldn't be do wasting your time on that Just like I'm not wasting my time on phone games.

462
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:06,600
Speaker 0: But I guess if you that's what you want to do You should know that there are other ways to interact with us on the internet.

463
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,680
Speaker 0: They're probably more worth your time like Twitter Facebook Etc, etc.

464
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:17,010
Speaker 0: You can just search Google for geek nights or search for geek nights on whatever your favorite social media service place is.

465
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:18,582
Speaker 0: We're probably there already.

466
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:22,481
Speaker 0: We even have an Instagram That we only used one time, but we'll try.

467
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,015
Speaker 1: if you take you guys into Google at this point We're literally the entire first page.

468
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:26,457
Speaker 0: I'm trying.

469
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:31,190
Speaker 0: I'm thinking you know, it's like my instinct is there's a TV tropes article about geek nights.

470
00:27:31,331 --> 00:27:31,893
Speaker 0: Yes, there is.

471
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:32,737
Speaker 0: I don't know who wrote it.

472
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:35,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's more in here than I expected right?

473
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:41,214
Speaker 1: So one lazy person one sad person wrote we used to have a Wikipedia till that crazy guy Positioned to the.

474
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:41,940
Speaker 0: we're not notable.

475
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,928
Speaker 0: So we shouldn't have one.

476
00:27:42,968 --> 00:27:45,477
Speaker 1: Yeah We won the per sec award.

477
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,622
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

478
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,150
Speaker 0: That's not notable either.

479
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:51,728
Speaker 0: Got it here sure?

480
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:53,709
Speaker 0: What was I saying?

481
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:56,982
Speaker 0: Alright, I'm like, I'm trying to decide like.

482
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:01,750
Speaker 0: on the one hand I feel like if we make content we should put the content out on every possible channel.

483
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:03,367
Speaker 0: That's like sort of in what we tried to do.

484
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:12,916
Speaker 0: But now I'm thinking like hey Maybe we should do a content on this channel then a different content on that channel and not force people to follow us in all The places right?

485
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,865
Speaker 0: It's like well, let's do an Instagram live stream.

486
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:15,990
Speaker 0: Let's do a YouTube live stream?

487
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,854
Speaker 1: I thought about that.

488
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,380
Speaker 0: Let's go fracture.

489
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,705
Speaker 1: Like I don't know anymore.

490
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:20,790
Speaker 0: I don't know either anyway.

491
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:28,870
Speaker 0: But yeah The most important place you should go that's actually worth spending your time and not a waste of time is our forum Which is at our website.

495
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:47,570

496
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,701
Speaker 0: But the current community is community our front recruit calm.

500
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,332
Speaker 0: They wrote.

501
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:07,598
Speaker 0: that is not a good reason.

502
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:08,804
Speaker 0: that is not gonna get you through.

503
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:17,062
Speaker 0: someone else wrote something along the lines of oh Some people on the podcast told me to type something here.

Speaker 0: Yeah, that is someone who clearly heard this message.

508

Speaker 0: We have said this for a few episodes now and people took our words Heated our words and have joined and have thus increased the forums potency.

513
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:49,863
Speaker 1: So you can add to that potency by following and last and certainly not least There won't be much geek nights next week meaning there won't be any Next week and maybe not even the week after.

Speaker 0: I know the last episodes.

523
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,234
Speaker 1: Maybe one more episode.

00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,860
Speaker 1: We're doing DuckTales on Wednesday.

525
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, Wednesday will be the last episode of unique nights.

526
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:24,044
Speaker 1: So You know not gonna lie mountain biking is more dangerous than skiing, but it turns out.

527
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,048
Speaker 1: I'm really good at mountain biking.

528
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:31,787
Speaker 1: But anyway We will be at PAX West and Emily and I will be at also PAX dev.

529
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:36,270
Speaker 1: We will be in Seattle for at least eight days.

530
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,940
Speaker 1: Gotta be there for like six days.

531
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,350

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,590
Speaker 1: Wednesday is dev Thursday all day.

534
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,349
Speaker 1: It's just all sticking around in Seattle and then pack starts the next day.

535
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:50,794
Speaker 1: So yeah, I guess.

536
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:52,240
Speaker 1: well, how late are you getting in on Thursday?

537
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:53,184
Speaker 0: I don't know.

538
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:54,410
Speaker 1: We'll check that later.

539
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,496
Speaker 1: We always get dinner or something.

540
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,970
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'll definitely probably be there for dinner better.

541
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:06,070
Speaker 1: Getting there super late cuz we're thinking of it We might go hang out outside of the places We normally hang out like hang out with her own Jeremy or something.

542
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:08,720
Speaker 1: We'll see cuz we're just around all day and there's nothing.

543
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:11,090
Speaker 1: packs dev ends a day before PAX West starts.

544
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:19,570
Speaker 1: But on Sunday at September 3rd at 6 30 p.m In the Hippogriff theater Hippogriff starts with H so you can assume it's in the Hyatt.

545
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,314
Speaker 0: It's in the Hyatt.

546
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,806
Speaker 1: We're doing the rage of the quitter.

547
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:27,362
Speaker 1: We're talking specifically Specifically about people who quit games at a butthurt rage.

548
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,328
Speaker 1: why and how they do that?

549
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:37,770
Speaker 0: I think it'll be pretty fun All right, so we were gonna talk about this last time We did a Monday show, but I guess we forgot like a minute after we said we were gonna talk about it.

550
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,923
Speaker 0: But we're having trouble with the Monday show ideas, right?

551
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:53,430
Speaker 0: It's it's not easy to come up with them partially because Like technology it's like technology moves fast But it's not moving as fast as it did and also we're less into it than we were before.

552
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,870
Speaker 0: And most of the things that change are small like, you know Intel CPU increased degeneration.

553
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,810
Speaker 1: Well, here's a good example.

554
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,770
Speaker 1: There was a time when which motherboard you chose had a huge impact on how well your computer worked.

555
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:08,801
Speaker 1: We are way past that point.

556
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,310
Speaker 1: It usually doesn't matter.

557
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is like, you know consider like anime is like.

558
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,038
Speaker 0: it's always new anime series coming out I'm watching.

559
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:20,687
Speaker 0: it's always news now It's always new games to talk about and the gaming show but it's like what it's like.

560
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,874
Speaker 0: there's not new Technology to talk about.

561
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:23,757
Speaker 0: the technology show.

562
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,205
Speaker 0: that much really it's you know, well there is.

563
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,368
Speaker 0: there was something it's like.

564
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:27,930
Speaker 0: think about it.

565
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,454
Speaker 0: It's like when early days of geek nights It was like oh my god this.

566
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:34,070
Speaker 0: iPhones now versus now where it's like the seventh iPhone is here.

567
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,680
Speaker 0: It's different from the previous existed.

568
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,042
Speaker 1: now.

569
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,150
Speaker 1: smartwatches haven't changed, right?

570
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,074
Speaker 0: So it's like they got worse.

571
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:45,730
Speaker 0: pebbles got all the other show ideas for tech We've already done and would come up with new ones.

572
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,137
Speaker 0: So, uh, I don't know what's gonna happen.

573
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:50,203
Speaker 0: We might have to change we haven't Early.

574
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:50,925
Speaker 1: I just wanted to.

575
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:57,709
Speaker 1: I was thinking about changing the format of Monday to and while it seems like a semi lame I know we can change a format to whatever we want.

576
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:58,734
Speaker 0: No one's paying us to do this.

577
00:32:58,774 --> 00:32:59,940
Speaker 1: We've said this for 12 years.

578
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,140
Speaker 1: We've never changed the format of anything ever, right?

579
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:10,969
Speaker 0: Well as the thing is like we're our original intent was to keep changing the format to find something that worked But I guess we're not using any metrics to judge what works.

580
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:14,520
Speaker 1: Well also man, but it's I've never even experiment, right?

581
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,120
Speaker 0: So I think we're gonna just start experimenting with Monday because otherwise we got nothing.

582
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,940
Speaker 1: So if you got any thoughts on our Monday show as opposed to the specifically Monday, that's all we care about right now.

583
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:24,799
Speaker 0: The other shows are fine.

584
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,046
Speaker 1: Then just let us know what you think.

585
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,634
Speaker 1: the best I can come up with is a lot of other tech.

586
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:37,980
Speaker 1: podcasts tend to just be Basically go through all the slashdot headlines from that day and just talk about them.

587
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,700
Speaker 0: But I found that those people they just do tech news roundup only which is why I don't want to do.

588
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:51,759
Speaker 0: But at the same time the main reason I don't want to do tech news roundup because Literally just makes us the same as every other tech, but at the same time I feel like we provide a very different.

589
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:58,520
Speaker 1: We're not Dvorak just not knowing stuff.

590
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:01,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't know a whole different set of stuff.

591
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:04,724
Speaker 0: our tech news roundup is better than anyone else's but I don't want to just Do that.

592
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:09,757
Speaker 0: That's like we're just doing the same show everyone else is doing but at the same time I the format is almost just.

593
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:12,871
Speaker 1: it's like the Substrate just to give us an excuse to talks.

594
00:34:12,911 --> 00:34:17,286
Speaker 1: what I've learned over the years, especially for the Thursday shows Is that he knows that it's tried.

595
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:26,114
Speaker 1: when we had a topic that was just an excuse for us to talk for an hour It did not matter what that topic actually was a lot of the early gig nights.

596
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,540
Speaker 1: We never even got to that topic.

597
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:35,659
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I tweeted out today in the Ignites account I said tell us your Monday tech show ideas are well has run dry and people submitted ideas.

598
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:36,504
Speaker 0: So we're just.

599
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,580
Speaker 0: we did this for Thursday previously when we were dry on Thursday.

600
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:42,407
Speaker 0: We are still sort of dry on Thursday But not as dry as Monday.

601
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,739
Speaker 1: Thursday's gonna pick up because there's a lot of movies and things.

602
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:48,210
Speaker 0: But we did an episode like this for Thursday before.

603
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,005
Speaker 0: we just went down a list of Thursday show ideas and and basically Hit them all real fast.

604
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,552
Speaker 0: So people tweeted Thursday ideas.

605
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,094
Speaker 0: We got a big.

606
00:34:55,415 --> 00:35:00,010
Speaker 0: all these replies to this tweet I'm gonna go through but I just want to also mention some.

607
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:05,363
Speaker 0: people sent in numerous ideas Like a few.

608
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,652
Speaker 0: like most of these ideas are from like three people.

609
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,520
Speaker 0: one person did way more than everyone else.

610
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:12,398
Speaker 0: That's a somewhat that guy thing to do.

611
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:17,060
Speaker 0: You should be sending in like one really good idea not a fucking course.

612
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:26,099
Speaker 1: If I say you submit one thing to someone and then you look and see that literally no one else is giving them anything Definitely then you fill the void.

613
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:27,282
Speaker 0: No Then you're like.

614
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:30,816
Speaker 0: that's even weirder if one person says a whole bunch and no one else is anything.

615
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:32,745
Speaker 0: at least we got a few People in here.

616
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:33,348
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,128
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the other thing is a Quality forgives almost all.

618
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:45,820
Speaker 0: so if those ideas were all good then all is forgiven Maybe but you know just to save time I'm not going to and also not to call out possible.

619
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,067
Speaker 0: I mean, this isn't like.

620
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:49,340
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say if you do this, you're definitely that guy.

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,707
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's like that guy.

622
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:51,552
Speaker 0: ish thing.

623
00:35:51,572 --> 00:36:01,011
Speaker 0: if to do this I'm soft on sort of like someone who sends too many fan letters right into the fan club Yeah as opposed to the one tasteful fan letter, right?

624
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:03,120
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I'm not gonna say who tweeted what?

625
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,700
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna go through the ideas and we're gonna judge them on their own merit and not based on the merit of whoever.

626
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:11,359
Speaker 1: I'm ready to type these into Google because you're gonna see how we do with the show All right.

627
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,720
Speaker 0: So the first one was someone who doesn't I guess has hearing problems and doesn't realize that the fixed protocol is the fixed protocol.

628
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,311
Speaker 1: People in the finance industry don't know.

629
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:22,440
Speaker 0: that person wrote the fix-it protocol.

630
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:25,914
Speaker 0: It's fixed as an F I X for you know what it stands for.

631
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,300
Speaker 1: It's a financial exchange protocol.

632
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,444
Speaker 0: I thought it's interchange.

633
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:29,629
Speaker 1: No financial exchange.

634
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:35,129
Speaker 1: They use the X because I don't know what's the I. then Don't get me started.

635
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:41,715
Speaker 1: fine if I financial Fi for financial X for the second letter of exchange because fuck you.

636
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:42,799
Speaker 0: It's not the fee.

637
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 1: So wait that they want to learn about the fixed protocol.

638
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:56,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I mean rim really loves time with the fixed protocol That I am a world-leading expert on the fixed protocol.

639
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:04,777
Speaker 1: There's a fine distinction between Knowing a lot about something and enjoying the fact that you know a lot about something.

640
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:05,699
Speaker 0: the point is is that?

641
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,302
Speaker 0: It's not really.

642
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:09,652
Speaker 1: I mean, what do we show it our show on?

643
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,600
Speaker 0: if we do a show about any protocol?

644
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,810
Speaker 0: HTTP TCP any protocol you come up with right?

645
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,760
Speaker 0: It's like as basically just reading documentation out loud at you, right?

646
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,930
Speaker 0: There's really no point to doing a show like that.

647
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,020
Speaker 0: There's not any opinions to add or anything.

648
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,014
Speaker 0: It's literally just here's how the thing works.

649
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:39,401
Speaker 0: You could make a podcast Fucking protocol of the week and that would be a garbage podcast and people would basically Find the episode on the one they needed to learn about and then they wouldn't listen to it because just reading the documentation is faster And better.

650
00:37:39,742 --> 00:37:43,594
Speaker 1: I think that would actually kind of interesting especially because I work.

651
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:45,760
Speaker 0: you want to make protocol of the week the podcast.

652
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:46,365
Speaker 0: That's all you.

653
00:37:46,406 --> 00:37:47,980
Speaker 1: why don't we do a Monday show on API's?

654
00:37:48,267 --> 00:38:00,740
Speaker 1: I Got a lot of opinions about like like soap versus rest and all the different ways people make API's and like how they serialize data and help some things do it well if something's do a poorly is

655
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:01,524
Speaker 0: Example

656
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,087
Speaker 1: of that's like

657
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:04,400
Speaker 0: that literally what Monday is and that's not it.

658
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,681
Speaker 0: That's.

659
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,660
Speaker 0: another problem is that is the thing that is very very poorly communicated with audio.

660
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:16,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to realize without diagram, but without diagram, but I was just using text Diagrams would help a lot.

661
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:20,523
Speaker 0: I think anyway, the point is I think it's not a good show But I can.

662
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:24,120
Speaker 1: so I could do a full hour talking about the fixed protocol more more.

663
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:33,042
Speaker 1: It'd be more like a college lecture though in the sense that even without diagrams or anything I feel like I could provide a sort of like the background like if like, you know The thing of this.

664
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:41,996
Speaker 1: if someone wants to learn more about something it helps for an expert to at least guide them toward The important broad strokes and like the hot the big picture of a thing.

665
00:38:42,377 --> 00:38:43,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's continue.

666
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:44,920
Speaker 1: I'll give them a brief summary.

667
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:49,960
Speaker 0: So the fixed protocol is basically this ASCII string to get through a whole bunch of more right things here.

668
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,544
Speaker 1: All right couple sentences.

669
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:57,400
Speaker 1: ASCII string format to send data between financial institutions or systems.

670
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,186
Speaker 0: We're not actually doing these shows now.

671
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:00,049
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand.

672
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:08,100
Speaker 0: We're shooting down these ideas and I think it's fine idea If you go for an hour then do a show on it later.

673
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,791
Speaker 0: We're not actually doing any of these shows now.

674
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,180
Speaker 0: the show is going through the idea.

675
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,454
Speaker 1: Alright fine 35 equals 3 anyway.

676
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,632
Speaker 1: So the next I know the 35 equals 839 equals 3 is a joke.

677
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:22,397
Speaker 0: So the next one 35 equals 3 would have been a bummer.

678
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:28,096
Speaker 0: Joe Convention 101 how not to suck at registration system both pre-sales and on-site.

679
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:29,280
Speaker 0: First of all, it's not a Monday show.

680
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,371
Speaker 0: So there is so that second of all we've done that show.

681
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,676
Speaker 1: I would want to say that topic.

682
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:40,619
Speaker 0: there is a Monday Component and a Thursday component sure, but we've done this show and is not a Monday show.

683
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:43,908
Speaker 1: I think they're gonna be a Monday show there pretty easily.

684
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:44,992
Speaker 0: We've done this though.

685
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,498
Speaker 1: Well when what what episode?

686
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,120
Speaker 0: super wait.

687
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,704
Speaker 0: We talked about convention so much.

688
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:49,226
Speaker 0: I'm sure we've.

689
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,470
Speaker 0: just we've definitely just.

690
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,940
Speaker 1: we've never talked about registration more than the technology side of it.

691
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,023
Speaker 1: How do you load balance?

692
00:39:55,064 --> 00:40:00,240
Speaker 1: How do you have systems that will concurrently handle all the people attempting to the buying part?

693
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's that's how you can split into two the whole the Thursday party.

694
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Speaker 0: We talked about that, but it has nothing to do even specifically with registration.

695
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,820
Speaker 0: It's just like have compute have enough computers for the number of people that are visiting.

696
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's an overly simplistic way to look at it.

697
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:15,079
Speaker 0: I that's all there is -.

698
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:19,795
Speaker 1: no It's not because you most of these systems care about the order that people attempt to register.

699
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,863
Speaker 1: so it can't just be Parallel.

700
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,349
Speaker 0: don't have a stupid system like that.

701
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:24,956
Speaker 1: So what do you mean?

702
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:25,880
Speaker 1: don't have a system like that?

703
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,083
Speaker 1: It's just gonna be random.

704
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:32,000
Speaker 1: when people hit like the penny arcade whatever to get their badges who gets into the queue and who doesn't?

705
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:34,689
Speaker 0: No, it's just like and you go to the site.

706
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:35,453
Speaker 0: you buy badges.

707
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:37,462
Speaker 0: if you click buy after this sold out You don't get them.

708
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:38,628
Speaker 1: All right.

709
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,220
Speaker 1: So how do you deal with the giant load?

710
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,429
Speaker 0: You have enough servers to handle the load.

711
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,320
Speaker 0: the people do the queuing systems because they're too cheap.

712
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,240
Speaker 0: They won't buy enough fucking servers, right?

713
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,466
Speaker 0: Just pay for the it's.

714
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:51,380
Speaker 0: this thing is up for like hours before it sells out, right?

715
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:54,539
Speaker 0: And if it's not something that's gonna sell out you don't need this to begin with.

716
00:40:54,821 --> 00:41:00,991
Speaker 0: so if you're that big that you're selling out instantly pay the money to turn on because Thousand fucking servers on Oz.

717
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:02,820
Speaker 0: so you can handle this enormous load.

718
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:08,620
Speaker 1: How do you how do you how do you architect your thing to take advantage of that massive parallels and turn them all off?

719
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:12,233
Speaker 1: How do you architect your thing to take care of that massive load balancers?

720
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:13,096
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

721
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,260
Speaker 1: How do load balancers work?

722
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,245
Speaker 1: We've never done a show on that.

723
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:17,095
Speaker 0: I think we have done a show on load balancers.

724
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:17,980
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't know.

725
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:19,304
Speaker 0: That's a good.

726
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,519
Speaker 0: load balancers is a good show if we haven't done it.

727
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz actually load balancing is way more complicated than you probably think.

728
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:29,231
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Like mmm load balancing will fuck up your day.

729
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:39,490
Speaker 0: But anyway and load balancing plus SSL Anyway Alright, so next next idea Iot, which if you don't know is Internet of Things.

730
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:42,120
Speaker 0: hype promise scary and reality today.

731
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:42,967
Speaker 1: So I'll show.

732
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:44,379
Speaker 0: the thing is internet.

733
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:51,640
Speaker 1: No Cuz I can answer the whole quest the whole thing And you always say that with utterly simplistic pointless answers that don't actually drive into the root of the problem.

734
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,700
Speaker 0: They do Internet of Things.

735
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,220
Speaker 0: So here's the only question is is a thing an IO device or is it a computer, right?

736
00:41:58,421 --> 00:42:05,244
Speaker 0: It's like I could plug a toaster into a computer in which by USB or something in which case my computer is now controlling A toaster with IO.

737
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:09,780
Speaker 0: Yeah and controlling turn it on turn it off toast time or whatever the controls are, right?

738
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,540
Speaker 0: And now merely I'm controlling the you know, the controls of the toaster with you know, a digital machine.

739
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:18,660
Speaker 1: No one cares about that semantic argument.

740
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,888
Speaker 1: I want to talk about my idea of increasing automation.

741
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:26,280
Speaker 0: if I put a computer into the toaster is the toaster now a computer?

742
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,805
Speaker 0: Right, and if it is continuing on that pedantic nonsense Yes.

743
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:41,660
Speaker 0: and if the toaster is now a computer because it has its own computer you have to worry about like Updating it and all is I write bullshit But you wouldn't have to worry if it was merely and it's an IO device attached to another computer.

744
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,840
Speaker 1: Nothing you said is the interesting problem the or the interesting question connecting itself to the internet and it's an extra.

745
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:52,880
Speaker 0: Everything is just like another computer connected the internet and that's not the interesting or controversial part from any other computer.

746
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,777
Speaker 1: The interesting topic there is around one.

747
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,009
Speaker 1: There's the security aspect of how do you secure a world

748
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:04,739
Speaker 0: which doesn't matter if you don't have your toaster be a computer And you just have it be connected to a computer

749
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:07,251
Speaker 1: Then the computer still has to be secure

750
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:09,641
Speaker 0: the same as all security concerns for any computer Which

751
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,348
Speaker 1: have still not been effectively dealt with.

752
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:15,057
Speaker 0: it being a thing doesn't make it computer.

753
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:19,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, again, you're hung up on this ridiculous semantic computers the computer.

754
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:20,640
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as a thing.

755
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,567
Speaker 1: There's a big difference between a very small number of computers or a very large number of computers Spread out among mass.

756
00:43:27,587 --> 00:43:31,000
Speaker 1: consumers don't know shit about computers in terms of where and how you secure them.

757
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:43,700
Speaker 1: and also the consequences of that security are much more drastic when it starts to increasingly control things that affect your physical meat life like Say the hot water heater or the like shotgun that you tape to your door with a solenoid.

758
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:55,480
Speaker 1: But the interesting topic there is more around aside from the security problem The uses that are good or bad or how like say we solve the security problems and the ease of use problems.

759
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,220
Speaker 1: There are a lot of really interesting things that could drastically change our lives.

760
00:43:59,326 --> 00:43:59,496
Speaker 1: Yes

761
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:09,300
Speaker 0: if all the things that you have to control and interact with on a daily basis can be very Improved by being controlled by a computer and not having to be controlled by your hands and your brain constantly

762
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think there's a whole topic there and there's a separate topic in the middle of.

763
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:26,700
Speaker 1: right now most Internet of Things things Don't actually do much and are more trouble than they're worth it's and their automation is counterbalanced by their ridiculous configuration Problems bad UX and in many cases poor failure.

764
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,820
Speaker 0: This is why I'm saying we all of those Internet of Things things should not have their own computer.

765
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,466
Speaker 0: They should not be a computer again.

766
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:37,240
Speaker 0: I simply be i/o devices controlled by the computer you already have again.

767
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,926
Speaker 1: However, I don't think that is the question.

768
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,978
Speaker 1: Anyone's asking nor is that the interesting question and they're just.

769
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:42,219
Speaker 0: it's.

770
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:51,947
Speaker 0: By designating them as things Semantically when they're just more computers I think you sort of create Confusion right where there is none.

771
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:58,148
Speaker 0: if you just say like when people talk about the cloud if they just instead of saying the cloud Just say someone else's computer.

772
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,579
Speaker 0: It really simplifies the discussion, right?

773
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:12,760
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, there's a separate problem of like people who know technology on a broad and reasonably deep scale Versus people who have a shallow knowledge versus people who don't know anything.

774
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:25,066
Speaker 1: all three groups use very different nomenclature and more importantly the Implications of a lot of these words mean a lot of different things like normal people hear cloud and have a lot of really wrong Apprehensions about what that means.

775
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:25,549
Speaker 0: why I'm saying?

776
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,060
Speaker 0: people say Internet of Things and they have a lot of wrong ideas.

777
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:35,480
Speaker 0: but I'm saying if you ignore if you Internet of Things means instead of your toaster being connected to a computer your toaster is a computer.

778
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:42,783
Speaker 1: But I would say though that you tell that you ignore the people who don't understand that and we trust that the listener is Intelligent out there.

779
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:47,196
Speaker 1: and we talk about the perspective of if computers control everything in my house.

780
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:48,159
Speaker 1: What the fuck happens.

781
00:45:49,522 --> 00:45:51,190
Speaker 1: Anyway, cuz that's an interesting question right?

782
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,300
Speaker 0: next one top X software thing.

783
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,029
Speaker 0: You can learn to make money but be bored.

784
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,300
Speaker 0: fix protocol like board game protocol database.

785
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:03,852
Speaker 0: put of your mind in doing so.

786
00:46:05,021 --> 00:46:08,056
Speaker 1: Fix protocol, you'll make a shit ton of money and you will hate it.

787
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:08,900
Speaker 1: It's so boring.

788
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,479
Speaker 0: You want to make a lot of money?

789
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,799
Speaker 0: You want to basically find a job that pays a lot?

790
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,244
Speaker 1: Enterprise Java development.

791
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:23,924
Speaker 0: if you're good programmer job searches find a job that has a high salary and they're looking and they're only willing to Hire someone who knows them.

792
00:46:23,944 --> 00:46:36,520
Speaker 0: a specific proprietary thing is it's not like top X. There's like a zillion of these things out there right each industry It is how many industries are there has some really specific thing that they use?

793
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:37,625
Speaker 0: Right, like?

794
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,971
Speaker 0: I'm sure it gets really like.

795
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,538
Speaker 0: I'm sure like, you know, how many?

796
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:46,250
Speaker 0: applications are specific to like the pharmaceutical industry or the Manufacturing industry.

797
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,059
Speaker 1: Well, there's the rub.

798
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:52,359
Speaker 0: I know any industry you can think of has some specific piece of software that they use that you've never fucking heard of.

799
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,964
Speaker 0: if you Are just a programmer You've got to learn.

800
00:46:55,024 --> 00:47:00,429
Speaker 0: if you become a master of any one of those you will have a job in that industry for as long That thing.

801
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,531
Speaker 1: if you're just a programmer You've got to be very good to get a high-paying job.

802
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:12,500
Speaker 1: if you are an okay programmer I'm very good or yeah, I'd say so or even a mediocre programmer.

803
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:16,314
Speaker 1: But you also have expert domain knowledge.

804
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,800
Speaker 1: in a non computer field.

805
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:22,979
Speaker 1: You will make as much money if not more money than the very good programmer anyway.

806
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:29,600
Speaker 1: So either be very very good at one thing like programming or be good at one thing and passively good.

807
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,812
Speaker 0: I don't understand how many tweets we have here.

808
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,280
Speaker 0: if we want to do them all we had to go faster.

809
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:34,239
Speaker 1: All right, keep going.

810
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:35,314
Speaker 1: We can always just stop.

811
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:36,041
Speaker 0: no We had.

812
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:41,687
Speaker 0: it's not fair because there's like a lot of the tweets at the top like the same people because they tweeted in groups And I'm going in order of time.

813
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:42,150
Speaker 1: All right.

814
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:42,974
Speaker 1: All right, we'll speed it up.

815
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,240
Speaker 0: set up 2017.

816
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,907
Speaker 0: What your geek nights pipeline looks now.

817
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,512
Speaker 0: open audition push record.

818
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:53,451
Speaker 1: Yeah, we plan 15 seconds into the future at most on gig night.

819
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:55,560
Speaker 0: open audition push record talk go home.

820
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,559
Speaker 1: I know sometimes the day we're gonna do a show on G chat One of us will mess with the other one to say what are we doing the show on?

821
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,209
Speaker 0: Next one a review of rim.

822
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:04,954
Speaker 0: So no speaker.

823
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,040
Speaker 0: I won that in a contest.

824
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:09,177
Speaker 0: I gave one away to a co-worker because I didn't need it and I gave one to.

825
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:09,599
Speaker 0: really what?

826
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,443
Speaker 1: Exceeded expectations.

827
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:17,862
Speaker 0: It's a speaker that you connect to wirelessly, but it needs to connect via Ethernet like to the internet Can't?

828
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:22,320
Speaker 0: you can't just use it like on the beach or anything and then it plays music and it works real.

829
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,550
Speaker 1: Well, and the speaker quality is really.

830
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:33,580
Speaker 1: it only plays music though So it doesn't do any of the Alexa things of the Google But I prefer that as opposed to the Alexa thing that's listening to every word I say right and sending it to I assume the government.

831
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:34,764
Speaker 0: It's good.

832
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:37,160
Speaker 0: If you have a small room and you don't have a sound system.

833
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,466
Speaker 0: The thing is I have a hat.

834
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:41,680
Speaker 0: my apartment has two rooms and like three or four sound systems.

835
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:43,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, no use for this thing.

836
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,080
Speaker 1: But I did not have a sound system in the living room and it is like perfect for playing music while we're cooking.

837
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:48,645
Speaker 0: How to computer?

838
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:49,046
Speaker 0: good.

839
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:52,337
Speaker 0: You should just do what Scott do because I'm the best at computer.

840
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:54,284
Speaker 1: Uh Use computers.

841
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,833
Speaker 1: Yeah and use can actually try.

842
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:59,060
Speaker 1: when something breaks learn it like figure out what happened.

843
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:11,600
Speaker 0: My number one recommendation is when you when you're doing things on your computer Do not customize the computer or the software don't change the settings leave everything as default and instead change yourself.

844
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:13,667
Speaker 0: Say alright, these are the settings.

845
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,671
Speaker 0: This is how this works.

846
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:15,855
Speaker 0: These are the keyboard shortcuts.

847
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,120
Speaker 0: Don't change them, right?

848
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:23,078
Speaker 0: Don't go changing your bash shell to some other shell say like Z shell or something it right say.

849
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,819
Speaker 0: All right This is the shell I have.

850
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:26,687
Speaker 0: What can I learn?

851
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:27,911
Speaker 0: How can I better myself?

852
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,718
Speaker 0: What reflex can I build?

853
00:49:29,778 --> 00:49:30,260
Speaker 0: what you know?

854
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:38,114
Speaker 0: I do to change me to make me better at this rather than trying to make the computer easier And that's how you get better a computer.

855
00:49:38,214 --> 00:49:38,738
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

856
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:46,546
Speaker 1: I mean, it's hard because the way I actually am good at computers was computers used to be shitting hard to use and I wanted To play games.

857
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:53,500
Speaker 1: so I had to learn a bunch of stuff I hated just to make the games work and that by default made me go to computers.

858
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,220
Speaker 1: So try to do things with computers anyway.

859
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,767
Speaker 0: Tech of Formula E racing.

860
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:00,148
Speaker 0: I don't know.

861
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,457
Speaker 0: It's a battery-controlled battery-powered f1 car.

862
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,400
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it.

863
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,019
Speaker 1: Wait, so anyone any showed any suggestion like that that the answer is always the same.

864
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:13,040
Speaker 1: We don't actually know anything about that and we very rarely are willing to do any amount of research for geek night.

865
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,380
Speaker 0: So if we did that show it would literally be us reading the Formula E like Wikipedia page out loud.

866
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,184
Speaker 0: And that's not.

867
00:50:19,204 --> 00:50:24,046
Speaker 0: that show would only be interesting shows if we got into Formula E Or if we had a guest.

868
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:25,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, that news which we're lazy.

869
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:26,978
Speaker 1: We haven't gotten guests in a while.

870
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:30,572
Speaker 0: Enterprise level software development slash management.

871
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:31,957
Speaker 0: What the hell does enterprise even mean?

872
00:50:31,977 --> 00:50:32,599
Speaker 0: software is soft.

873
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:34,284
Speaker 1: no, I got enter.

874
00:50:34,304 --> 00:50:48,534
Speaker 1: so I would say the definition of enterprise software is Very complex software aimed at achieving very complex like user experiences while simultaneously having extremely niche audiences and Necessity.

875
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:49,720
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

876
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,489
Speaker 0: So what even counts as an enterprise is like a?

877
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:54,604
Speaker 0: well I mean, obviously there's no like big does a company have to be before it's.

878
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:59,210
Speaker 1: obviously there's no Specific line because that would be stupid and that's a stupid art.

879
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,709
Speaker 0: That's what I'm pointing out is that it's stupid.

880
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:17,902
Speaker 1: But at the same time the way enterprise software beyond a certain point on the sliding scale There's a point beyond which the complexity coupled with the small number of potential customers or users Coupled with the need for that thing because it's a very important niche.

881
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:28,170
Speaker 1: That's what makes something enterprise software and I Could probably talk for a few hours about that because I've been a product manager of enterprise software for like a decade.

882
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,955
Speaker 0: Anyway, adopt.

883
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:30,757
Speaker 1: There's a whole show there.

884
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:32,582
Speaker 0: That's a good idea of ipv6.

885
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,284
Speaker 0: Where is it at?

886
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:35,550
Speaker 0: Why hasn't it taken off more by now?

887
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:37,063
Speaker 0: What would be the next major turning point?

888
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:37,849
Speaker 0: didn't we do this already?

889
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,870
Speaker 1: I'm so long ago that stuff's changed.

890
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,078
Speaker 1: but so when we're at our IT is the quick version.

891
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:47,517
Speaker 1: ipv6 was like a coming thing and I got space on the six mode to Do a project to like learn.

892
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:51,050
Speaker 1: our ipv6 works like back before and you know what happened to that class.

893
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:53,429
Speaker 1: I got bored and I withdrew because fuck it.

894
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,723
Speaker 1: I didn't care and I just died in that space eventually expired.

895
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:02,745
Speaker 1: and the reality is Ipv6 does not affect normal people at all and it never will it.

896
00:52:03,427 --> 00:52:07,785
Speaker 0: I cannot imagine We've used NAT so much that ipv6 isn't gonna come.

897
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:11,178
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's just that Normal people in your house.

898
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:13,729
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter how IPs are assigned.

899
00:52:14,574 --> 00:52:15,430
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's true.

900
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:20,407
Speaker 0: If your ISP just switched to ipv6 and it rolled out you wouldn't even know all the technology that you have supports it.

901
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,180
Speaker 0: windows supports It max supports that.

902
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,989
Speaker 0: your router supports it.

903
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:27,489
Speaker 0: It's a new enough router which it probably is because even in beacon we had routers that supported it.

904
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:35,341
Speaker 0: But more your ISP just switched you to ipv6 and all the websites in the world switched to ipv6 and everything You wouldn't even fucking know now.

905
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:39,066
Speaker 1: That's partly because there are some.

906
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:43,092
Speaker 1: We could do a show on that maybe someday anyway but the world.

907
00:52:43,112 --> 00:53:02,830
Speaker 1: so the problem is I would have to do a little more research because the state of The back plane of the internet and like the way IP addresses are used in the way routers like the way routing tables are structured has actually changed a lot in the last decade or so and I'll be honest my Personal knowledge of that off the top of my head is out of date.

908
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:04,536
Speaker 1: So I'd have to do a little bit of research.

909
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:08,350
Speaker 1: college was a long time ago and the protocols I know are literally obsolete.

910
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:11,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, the next one the fixed protocol.

911
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,023
Speaker 0: we did that already.

912
00:53:12,043 --> 00:53:14,110
Speaker 1: I could do a whole show on the fixed.

913
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:15,919
Speaker 0: Actually wrote it correctly though.

914
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,930
Speaker 0: Ah, what is wrong with century link?

915
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,250
Speaker 0: I assume that's someone's ISP century link and why do they have outages every goddamn week?

916
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,333
Speaker 1: I've never heard of century.

917
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:26,523
Speaker 0: I assume it's someone's ISP cuz your ISP sucks home and business.

918
00:53:26,683 --> 00:53:27,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, why?

919
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:27,667
Speaker 0: where?

920
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,650
Speaker 1: where are they?

921
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,171
Speaker 1: I don't know.

922
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:30,115
Speaker 1: I can't figure this out.

923
00:53:30,175 --> 00:53:33,810
Speaker 0: Why 50% of your IT outages are sysadmins making mistakes.

924
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,574
Speaker 0: That's incorrect.

925
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:37,450
Speaker 0: a hundred percent of your IT outages are sysadmins making mistakes.

926
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,522
Speaker 1: No, ninety nine ninety eight percent.

927
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:43,099
Speaker 1: the other two percent are legit Coordinated attacks from the outside.

928
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,173
Speaker 0: the point is if you set your shit up You should you can.

929
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:50,506
Speaker 0: it's possible to set shit up to be absolutely impossible to take down.

930
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:51,910
Speaker 0: You just cost more money.

931
00:53:52,251 --> 00:54:05,807
Speaker 0: So if it goes down and you didn't it's either because a it wasn't worth Keeping that thing up in the face of attack because it wasn't that big a deal like the nice website is not really protected From a lot of things because it's not worth spending the money to protect.

932
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:06,230
Speaker 0: it goes.

933
00:54:07,052 --> 00:54:12,570
Speaker 1: If the website goes down at midnight we'll fix it like in the morning, I don't need to be woken up.

934
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like cuz I don't care.

935
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:22,689
Speaker 0: but if you have something that you actually need to keep up all the time it is possible to spend enough money and Build a system that basically is gonna be up all the time.

936
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,688
Speaker 0: Now the other reality is that it comes that when's the last time Google search went down?

937
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:27,754
Speaker 1: wait We can.

938
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:32,441
Speaker 1: I think we could do a real Monday show on uptime Like as a general like uptime itself.

939
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,190
Speaker 1: I got actually I feel a show there.

940
00:54:34,551 --> 00:54:35,494
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're modern.

941
00:54:35,514 --> 00:54:36,898
Speaker 0: tech would be without caffeine.

942
00:54:36,918 --> 00:54:37,560
Speaker 0: It'd be just fine.

943
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,403
Speaker 0: I don't drink caffeine.

944
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:40,650
Speaker 1: Uh, I drink caffeine.

945
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:42,637
Speaker 1: I feel like tech would be fine.

946
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:46,330
Speaker 1: But caffeine is just one of the many tools I have in my tool chest.

947
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:57,488
Speaker 0: I think that the the culture of It's possible the culture of Silicon Valley startup work crazy hours Might be diminished somewhat because those people wouldn't be able to work.

948
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:57,910
Speaker 0: those crazy.

949
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,361
Speaker 1: Oh, those people would just use cocaine or something possibly.

950
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:06,570
Speaker 1: I also feel like The like glorification of caffeine in nerd spaces.

951
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:08,893
Speaker 1: I've really cuz I've.

952
00:55:08,913 --> 00:55:12,382
Speaker 1: this has been going on since like Mountain Dew since before we were alive.

953
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:17,945
Speaker 1: before there were energy drinks in office culture But it really picked up in like nerd tech culture.

954
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:27,549
Speaker 1: I Honestly feel like the reason that happened in nerd tech culture specifically is because nerds are too afraid to do real drugs But they wanted to have a little bit of edge.

955
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:31,510
Speaker 1: So they talk about like how badass they are drinking the caffeine to stay up all night.

956
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,011
Speaker 0: I don't know.

957
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,495
Speaker 1: I feel like that's where that came from.

958
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:37,787
Speaker 0: Anyway, building HVAC and why power losses result in so much heat.

959
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,539
Speaker 1: Ah I could talk about building HVAC.

960
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:41,001
Speaker 1: That's it.

961
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:41,544
Speaker 1: That's a show.

962
00:55:41,564 --> 00:55:42,590
Speaker 0: I actually know a lot about it.

963
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,640
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about HVAC.

964
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,649
Speaker 0: I know how air conditioner works.

965
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:46,676
Speaker 1: What kind of air conditioner?

966
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:47,822
Speaker 0: the kind you put in your window?

967
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,310
Speaker 1: What's the difference between one that has one?

968
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:53,750
Speaker 1: So the kind you put in your window, what about the ones that sit in the room and have tubes coming out of them?

969
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:54,773
Speaker 1: How are they different?

970
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:55,598
Speaker 0: Isn't that the same thing?

971
00:55:55,678 --> 00:55:56,986
Speaker 0: only instead of sticking out the window?

972
00:55:57,006 --> 00:55:57,690
Speaker 0: It just has a tube.

973
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:59,746
Speaker 1: What if there's one tube versus two tubes?

974
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:00,250
Speaker 1: What's different?

975
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,075
Speaker 1: Why is there one tube versus two?

976
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:04,344
Speaker 0: If there's two tubes, one's in and one's out.

977
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:05,950
Speaker 1: So how does a one tube one work?

978
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,543
Speaker 0: It just instead of having it in tube, it just is in on the front.

979
00:56:10,844 --> 00:56:11,587
Speaker 0: It's in the room.

980
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:13,081
Speaker 1: All right And why is that different?

981
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:13,690
Speaker 1: Why does that matter?

982
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,858
Speaker 0: I don't know because you want to use tubes instead of vents.

983
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:17,867
Speaker 1: I could do a show on this.

984
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:18,470
Speaker 1: That's another one too.

985
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:19,293
Speaker 0: I'm not.

986
00:56:19,314 --> 00:56:20,902
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about air conditioning.

987
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:22,330
Speaker 0: I'd end up reading the Wikipedia page about it.

988
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,859
Speaker 1: All right, let's see HVAC and uptime.

989
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,986
Speaker 0: We're not talking about this anymore.

990
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:28,260
Speaker 0: We're moving on SSO, I assume that means single sign-on.

991
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,366
Speaker 0: I'm like.

992
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:31,537
Speaker 1: so my god I've been dealing with single sign-on.

993
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,130
Speaker 0: You have you basically have one system.

994
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:40,514
Speaker 0: Just that does logging in and the logging out and then all the other systems instead of having their own logins and logouts talk to That system.

995
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,110
Speaker 0: that's how you can log in with Google on a different site.

996
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:43,772
Speaker 0: That isn't Google.

997
00:56:44,013 --> 00:56:47,064
Speaker 1: Single sign-on is actually a pretty complex topic.

998
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:54,879
Speaker 0: That uses OAuth when it's on the web but if you're doing it like locally you might use something like Active Directory or LDAP.

999
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:59,581
Speaker 1: So Single sign-on is complicated because actually it's been changing.

1000
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:06,162
Speaker 1: It's been changing a lot lately Especially with like websites and web applications.

1001
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:15,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the on the high level like yeah It's really simple like you use credentials from one side and you trust those credentials to then let someone access another side.

1002
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:24,400
Speaker 1: but the details of how you do that in a secure manner is Actually really complicated and it's a combination of front-end development, back-end development, APIs.

1003
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:29,060
Speaker 1: That's probably a whole show, but I don't know enough depth about it.

1004
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,163
Speaker 0: SSL.

1005
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:33,188
Speaker 0: They're like SSO and the next tweet was SSL.

1006
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,555
Speaker 0: I think we did one on SSL.

1007
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:36,216
Speaker 0: We may have.

1008
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,925
Speaker 0: The thing with SSL Is that like it's hard to.

1009
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:43,000
Speaker 0: actually it's such a mess that it's hard to learn it for reals.

1010
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,326
Speaker 1: SSL certificates July 27th of 2009.

1011
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:49,820
Speaker 1: Right, but it's basically you're just gonna read instructions on how to set it up.

1012
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,567
Speaker 1: We might have had a bad opinion back then.

1013
00:57:51,587 --> 00:57:54,280
Speaker 1: Tonight on Geek Nights we talk about the SSL certificate racket.

1014
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:57,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a racket where the people selling the certs.

1015
00:57:57,529 --> 00:57:59,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, the racket is by the way gone.

1016
00:57:59,636 --> 00:58:02,643
Speaker 0: You can now use encrypt Encrypt Anywhere.

1017
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:03,204
Speaker 0: What's it called?

1018
00:58:03,445 --> 00:58:03,967
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1019
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,030
Speaker 0: Let's Encrypt.

1020
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:05,713
Speaker 0: That's the site.

1021
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:11,733
Speaker 1: I feel like because of really Shitty use of those certificates that increasingly people are gonna distrust them.

1022
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,540
Speaker 0: You think Let's Encrypt is gonna get distrusted?

1023
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,668
Speaker 1: I think Let's Encrypt is gonna get distrusted.

1024
00:58:15,768 --> 00:58:17,315
Speaker 0: I think Let's Encrypt is actually legit.

1025
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:18,440
Speaker 1: Oh, I think they're legit.

1026
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:22,071
Speaker 1: I think that people that there's going to be a tipping point the problem with SSL certificates.

1027
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,335
Speaker 0: Chrome and trust them.

1028
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:24,840
Speaker 0: So does Starbucks and iE.

1029
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,027
Speaker 1: Just I'm leery.

1030
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:27,790
Speaker 1: I have opinions.

1031
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:28,814
Speaker 1: We could do a show.

1032
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:30,260
Speaker 0: The racket has been busted.

1033
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,974
Speaker 1: We could do an updated SSL show because 2009 was a long time ago.

1034
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:35,300
Speaker 0: IT heuristics.

1035
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,740
Speaker 0: Why you know before everyone else does what the problem is based entirely on your monitoring.

1036
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,010
Speaker 1: Do we ever do a show on like monitoring?

1037
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,553
Speaker 0: I think we have.

1038
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:45,940
Speaker 1: I think we talked about SNMP.

1039
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,041
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1040
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:48,224
Speaker 0: Ad-hoc networks.

1041
00:58:48,285 --> 00:58:50,450
Speaker 0: I took ad-hoc networking class in college.

1042
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:54,080
Speaker 0: Ad-hoc networking never really took off because it's such a pain in the ass.

1043
00:58:54,781 --> 00:59:04,940
Speaker 1: It's the best use case for ad-hoc networking would be at a convention But no one's ever made it work because you need all the devices to play games and like play ball.

1044
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:11,420
Speaker 0: Pretty much the most you're gonna get is like the little airdrop on your iPhone and during a disaster and same problem.

1045
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,275
Speaker 1: It's just a. it's a really complicated problem.

1046
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:21,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, Decentralized networks and how you can prepare for providing a network that's really difficult to take down for protests and the like.

1047
00:59:21,563 --> 00:59:23,619
Speaker 1: That's basically the same question question.

1048
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:28,301
Speaker 1: So the pirate boxes that we remember we talked about a long long time ago We used to.

1049
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:31,320
Speaker 1: if you watch our old panel videos you see us like you can make mesh networks.

1050
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:34,240
Speaker 0: The problem is it's the physicality of it is so difficult.

1051
00:59:34,662 --> 00:59:38,400
Speaker 1: All right modern pirate boxes are way better and they have a lot of embedded software.

1052
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:41,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you're not gonna make a mesh network that has a wide radius.

1053
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:54,839
Speaker 1: But you can spin up a localized Wi-Fi and if you overpower it You'll probably be able to do okay to basically have like a 4chan equivalent That's local right there for like organizing within the radius of that thing.

1054
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:58,540
Speaker 0: There's a show modern signal jamming solutions.

1055
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,560
Speaker 0: I don't know if you're talking about how to signal jam or how to avoid signal jamming, but I know nothing about it.

1056
01:00:03,121 --> 01:00:06,711
Speaker 0: I know get a better and more powerful radio antenna than the other guy.

1057
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:15,357
Speaker 1: I know about that from classes I took at RIT and that knowledge is literally 100% obsolete in the modern era.

1058
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:15,577
Speaker 0: All right.

1059
01:00:15,617 --> 01:00:17,159
Speaker 0: The next one is CRISPR.

1060
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,839
Speaker 0: CRISPR is CRISPR could change fucking everything and that is that that DNA thing.

1061
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:25,056
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I don't know anything about it other than that.

1062
01:00:25,076 --> 01:00:25,500
Speaker 0: It's a DNA.

1063
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:26,504
Speaker 1: So here's the show we could.

1064
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:30,785
Speaker 0: if we're gonna do a show on that I thought for first I was like are they talking about The DNA thing?

1065
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,460
Speaker 0: are they talking about some startup called CRISPR?

1066
01:00:33,102 --> 01:00:35,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I feel like there's no E in between the P.

1067
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,456
Speaker 1: I feel like we could do a show on that but it would be almost like a tech transfer.

1068
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:40,380
Speaker 0: I know nothing about it.

1069
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,052
Speaker 1: so no, no, we're what we talk about.

1070
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:50,180
Speaker 1: is the like our opinions on the implications of increasingly directed like genetic manipulation of humans?

1071
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:51,324
Speaker 0: Do it?

1072
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:55,540
Speaker 0: I feel like yeah, but did I point out haven't you watched Gundam new types?

1073
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also haven't you read the Prince of Nothing perhaps?

1074
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,012
Speaker 1: Novel genetic experimentation on all of our babies at the same time is not the best idea.

1075
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:16,220
Speaker 1: Listen, uh, while I You need to keep pure my natural stuff and just to regress to the me Nothing fandom is probably greater than my Gundam fandom.

1076
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:20,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, I believe the real world is closer to Gundam that it is to Prince of Nothing I do.

1077
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:25,460
Speaker 1: but remember also the fundamental problem of Gundam especially Gundam seed where that was kind of a big part of the plot.

1078
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:38,000
Speaker 1: is that the consequence of increased genetic manipulation was better individuals who are just better in literally every way coupled with Decreased fertility and long-term consequences that might end their race.

1079
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,740
Speaker 0: Anyway, we don't need more fertility because if we're living in space stations, we need less people up there.

1080
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we might.

1081
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:52,757
Speaker 1: the problem is that we don't have a pure understanding and Some traits that are beneficial might be intrinsically linked to traits that are less desirable.

1082
01:01:52,777 --> 01:02:00,759
Speaker 1: election pressure on there yeah, but I'm saying it's a very complex thing and we are not smart enough to grasp it and I feel like we'd end up Doing what the Incroy did?

1083
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,651
Speaker 0: Wells where does the water come from and how do they run dry?

1084
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:07,360
Speaker 0: poisoned wells differences between modern and medieval wells?

1085
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,603
Speaker 0: Hashtag will it end?

1086
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:13,475
Speaker 0: well, this is because I wrote in the original tweet our well has run dry.

1087
01:02:13,776 --> 01:02:14,819
Speaker 0: they're commenting on that.

1088
01:02:15,842 --> 01:02:20,420
Speaker 1: I know a little more about wells than I should because we have a friend who literally digs wells for a living.

1089
01:02:20,681 --> 01:02:22,829
Speaker 0: Yep, we could get him on the show.

1090
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:23,792
Speaker 0: He's got her too.

1091
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:25,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically a family-run business, right?

1092
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,420
Speaker 0: There's two people that we know that are awesome nerds in California who have a well digging business.

1093
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,269
Speaker 0: They know everything there is to know about wells.

1094
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:35,380
Speaker 0: We could get them on to talk about wells.

1095
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:37,407
Speaker 0: Is that science in tech?

1096
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,833
Speaker 1: I know I know.

1097
01:02:38,873 --> 01:02:40,820
Speaker 1: I know that I know what an artesian well is.

1098
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:43,770
Speaker 1: I remember that from like seventh grade physical science.

1099
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,634
Speaker 1: I Just don't know a ton about wells in detail.

1100
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:52,255
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, uh predict the future on tech 2017 to 2019. didn't we do this already?

1101
01:02:54,362 --> 01:02:54,987
Speaker 1: Not for 2019.

1102
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,075
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1103
01:02:56,135 --> 01:02:56,699
Speaker 0: Let's do it right now.

1104
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,327
Speaker 1: Well, you let's each make one production for something in tech.

1105
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:01,815
Speaker 1: That'll be in 2019 incremental improvements.

1106
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:04,182
Speaker 0: VR won't take off Nothing.

1107
01:03:04,202 --> 01:03:08,660
Speaker 0: that's a. I won't take off none of the things that are hyped now or they're all garbage.

1108
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:10,697
Speaker 0: we'll just get incrementally better.

1109
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:20,766
Speaker 0: and I do think that I don't know about Internet of Things, but the definitely be more computerization of you know Things that are not currently computer-controlled.

1110
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:37,980
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna see legit murders and big robberies enabled by Internet of Things security issues in 20 by 2019. and I think I Think AI will like really fuck up gaming and start to win all games.

1111
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:38,703
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I don't.

1112
01:03:38,783 --> 01:03:39,687
Speaker 0: I mean I don't mean that like.

1113
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:49,000
Speaker 0: I'm like people think about the AI like in terms of like You know sci-fi AI or the Amazon Alexa AI that kind of stuff like no one wants to like.

1114
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:57,080
Speaker 0: I don't think people really want to interact with Cortana or you know fucking Siri or whatever that kind of AI I do if it's smart enough as bullshit.

1115
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:01,239
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to talk to my fucking computer I would be.

1116
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:10,925
Speaker 0: But machine learning in terms of solving the problems it's good at solving, you know The statistical learning which I don't.

1117
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:16,020
Speaker 0: I don't consider that to be AI because not thinking it's just statistical really highly advanced statistical models.

1118
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:16,662
Speaker 1: I have opinions.

1119
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:19,654
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into now because we're running out of time making decisions.

1120
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:21,220
Speaker 1: I just read my problem.

1121
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:25,140
Speaker 1: I just read like three dense textbooks on machine learning and AI and I have opinions.

1122
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:36,740
Speaker 0: But that is going to solve some problems and and also create, you know better solutions to things and Increase efficiencies in many areas that will change society.

1123
01:04:37,322 --> 01:04:45,344
Speaker 1: I think specifically the kind these the types the list of the types of problems that machine learning solutions Can solve.

1124
01:04:45,365 --> 01:04:51,985
Speaker 1: real expand will expand to a dramatic degree and fuck some stuff You think a computer can do.

1125
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:57,060
Speaker 1: it's gonna be able to do like I think any video game will have perfect a eyes by 2019.

1126
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,365
Speaker 0: just maybe all right.

1127
01:04:58,746 --> 01:05:02,258
Speaker 0: the Russian hacking scandal election related or otherwise.

1128
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:02,700
Speaker 0: what's real?

1129
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,263
Speaker 0: What's not?

1130
01:05:03,344 --> 01:05:05,359
Speaker 0: who worldwide might actually be at risk?

1131
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,339
Speaker 0: I don't have enough information about it.

1132
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,660
Speaker 0: If I did I would be like making some money getting paid off by journalists to give them my good info.

1133
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,869
Speaker 1: I could probably give a really good summary.

1134
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:16,740
Speaker 0: I get a lot of yes, but I know a lot of facts.

1135
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:21,219
Speaker 1: I know a lot of facts because I read about this a lot, but there's not too many facts to know.

1136
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,946
Speaker 1: There's more than you think.

1137
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:24,656
Speaker 1: there's a lot of interesting information out there.

1138
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:25,220
Speaker 1: That's legit.

1139
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:27,166
Speaker 1: You just don't read those kinds.

1140
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:27,367
Speaker 1: like you.

1141
01:05:27,387 --> 01:05:29,175
Speaker 1: don't read all the Washington Post articles about it.

1142
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:31,906
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I got a lot of opinions on that.

1143
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:32,729
Speaker 1: I do show on that.

1144
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,476
Speaker 0: tweet this article.

1145
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:35,380
Speaker 0: It's a link to an article.

1146
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:36,636
Speaker 0: I'm pulling up the article.

1147
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,333
Speaker 0: Ideal OS rebooting the desktop operating experience.

1148
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,036
Speaker 0: desktops are dead.

1149
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:43,084
Speaker 1: next Desktops are not dead.

1150
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:44,628
Speaker 1: desktops have become a professional tool.

1151
01:05:44,688 --> 01:05:54,194
Speaker 1: a desktop computer or a desktop operating system in 2017 is the equivalent of the toolbox that an artisan carries with them.

1152
01:05:54,635 --> 01:05:57,353
Speaker 1: normal people don't carry toolboxes everywhere But artisans do.

1153
01:05:57,373 --> 01:05:59,424
Speaker 0: yeah How does AI even work?

1154
01:05:59,565 --> 01:06:01,229
Speaker 1: also Linux desktop like fucking.

1155
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,174
Speaker 1: just burn it all and start from scratch.

1156
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:05,200
Speaker 1: had Windows desktop is actually pretty fine.

1157
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,855
Speaker 0: How does AI even work in a set of instructions ever be truly alive?

1158
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:10,000
Speaker 0: our meat brains alive?

1159
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,376
Speaker 0: We're just a combination of senses solipsism.

1160
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:17,094
Speaker 1: next question Yeah, but there's no difference between meat brains and computer brains in the long run.

1161
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:18,017
Speaker 1: They're just technically.

1162
01:06:18,358 --> 01:06:19,945
Speaker 0: wait wait I got a few more.

1163
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:24,950
Speaker 0: This is someone who's submitted a bunch apparently at Debugging device drivers.

1164
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:26,177
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about that.

1165
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:30,300
Speaker 0: I guess a lot of times you're bringing out the oscilloscope to see what your hardware is doing.

1166
01:06:30,842 --> 01:06:40,237
Speaker 1: So in terms of the consumer side of that the last time I had to debug device drivers Was when I had some firewire shenanigans for some firewire chipset.

1167
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:40,960
Speaker 1: shit wasn't working.

1168
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,740
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know if they're asking about debugging it from a user perspective Like you're trying to set up your drive or you're developing a driver for a piece of hardware you have and you it's messed up.

1169
01:06:48,760 --> 01:07:00,470
Speaker 1: So on the consumer side, you know how I solved that I said fuck it I disabled the chipset that I couldn't get to work and I just bought a PCI Express card that Google said would work with the Device I had and that was how I debugged it.

1170
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:05,240
Speaker 0: Yeah debugging distributed systems It's hard because things are on different computers.

1171
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:06,646
Speaker 1: Uh, you know what that turns into.

1172
01:07:06,706 --> 01:07:10,100
Speaker 1: we could do a show on debugging like how you actually figure out the root of a problem.

1173
01:07:10,522 --> 01:07:13,460
Speaker 0: I feel like that might be a good start one and work the other end process of animation.

1174
01:07:13,884 --> 01:07:22,149
Speaker 1: I feel like solve every problem I feel like but like I feel like we could do a few case studies and Like give some examples of like the kinds of tools we use anyway.

1175
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:24,836
Speaker 0: general fun uses for tech skills outside the workplace.

1176
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:25,297
Speaker 0: games.

1177
01:07:25,538 --> 01:07:29,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Video games setting up a home lab.

1178
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,235
Speaker 0: I don't know what you mean by that.

1179
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:31,380
Speaker 1: I don't do science.

1180
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:32,163
Speaker 1: Why?

1181
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:36,342
Speaker 0: why star Nick's directory structures are exactly the layout They are.

1182
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:45,542
Speaker 0: cuz some dude had an old computer and he had a directory structure And then they had to add a hard drive to it because they fucking ran out of space and they mounted that hard drive on Usr.

1183
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:50,260
Speaker 0: so now there's bin and use our bin because one hard drive ran out of space and then they had another fucking hard.

1184
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,845
Speaker 0: Cuz that one ran out of space.

1185
01:07:52,026 --> 01:08:03,499
Speaker 0: so they made it var and then because the everyone copied that computer They had the same fucking directory structure Even though they didn't made it more complicated and everyone copied everyone else and all the software is written and coded to these.

1186
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:11,360
Speaker 1: The Unix file system is literally people doing what people before them did because they assume that that's a standard for some good reason.

1187
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:21,992
Speaker 0: now It is and there are Linux distributions that fix it and give you like that directory structures that make perfect sense and use English words like slash software slash home directory slash, you know, whatever.

1188
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:26,578
Speaker 0: but No one uses that shit and you're gonna have a lot of annoyances if you try to use it.

1189
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:34,066
Speaker 1: But at the same time I have annoyances using it because a lot of software doesn't play nice in that space Like especially enterprise software.

1190
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:38,578
Speaker 1: usually just install that in like opt because it's monolithic and it needs its own shit.

1191
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:45,060
Speaker 0: all together All right phone app updates your go-to Twitter verse tweet bot and bullshit likes in timeline.

1192
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:48,010
Speaker 1: So I guess I don't know what the good.

1193
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:48,492
Speaker 1: what a good.

1194
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:49,676
Speaker 1: third-party Twitter app.

1195
01:08:49,736 --> 01:08:50,840
Speaker 0: I use tweet bot is great.

1196
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,368
Speaker 0: It is another time on the debt.

1197
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:53,091
Speaker 0: It's not free though.

1198
01:08:53,192 --> 01:08:54,620
Speaker 0: People always want something that's free, right?

1199
01:08:54,660 --> 01:09:00,960
Speaker 0: It's like dude, you're using your Twitter app more than anything, right and you're complaining about things like ads and likes in your timeline.

1200
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:01,926
Speaker 0: They don't belong there.

1201
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:04,020
Speaker 0: It's like just pay for the fucking third-party app.

1202
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,051
Speaker 0: It's like three dollars, even if it's ten dollars fifty dollars.

1203
01:09:07,432 --> 01:09:09,700
Speaker 0: you're using this every goddamn day multiple times a day.

1204
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,645
Speaker 0: It gets no ads.

1205
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:11,671
Speaker 0: No, not no bullshit.

1206
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:12,939
Speaker 0: Your timeline is perfect.

1207
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:14,125
Speaker 0: It was even any of the bullshit.

1208
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:17,740
Speaker 0: do not use the actual official Twitter app and you had no fucking problems.

1209
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,987
Speaker 0: I use tweet deck on the desktop.

1210
01:09:19,028 --> 01:09:20,939
Speaker 0: No problems and that's free.

1211
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:33,569
Speaker 1: But I guess phone app updates update every app all the time like yep and If an app asks for new permissions decide right then and there if you care about the app enough to let it know that thing Or just delete the app.

1212
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:34,316
Speaker 1: Yep, one of the two.

1213
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,731
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like don't be afraid to fucking pay for apps.

1214
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,560
Speaker 0: the pay for apps are a lot of times better.

1215
01:09:39,962 --> 01:09:40,524
Speaker 1: Why don't you stop?

1216
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:41,247
Speaker 1: we got over an hour.

1217
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:41,890
