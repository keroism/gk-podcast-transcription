1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,432
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 12th, 2011.

2
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:18,680
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights Tonight who framed Roger rabbit.

3
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,067
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:36,114
Speaker 0: So a little context if I may this episode was actually recorded quite some time ago and we kind of kept it in the hopper until we had an occasion to use it and that occasion has Come upon us.

5
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:43,269
Speaker 0: as by the time you're listening to this Scott And I are probably on our ways to magfest 9 and thus we wouldn't be around to do a show.

6
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:48,410
Speaker 0: So some of the news is a little out of date and we may or may not have used one of these things of the day.

7
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,650
Speaker 0: Again, I can't recall but it's a good show and we talk about Roger rabbit with a guest.

8
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:06,180
Speaker 0: No, there's a show that we watch a long time ago that I'd forgotten about until randomly a little while ago.

9
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:07,779
Speaker 1: I did not forget about it.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,312
Speaker 0: Well, I forgot about it in the way you forget about old anime.

11
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,482
Speaker 0: you watch it and then you just don't like it doesn't come To mind.

12
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,291
Speaker 0: it's not like I'd be walking down the street and suddenly.

13
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,140
Speaker 0: Oh shit mahout sky time.

14
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:23,943
Speaker 1: It's not a show that really anyone talks about but it was you know, it's in that same category as like, you know El Hazzard.

15
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:24,445
Speaker 1: Yeah.

16
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:27,577
Speaker 0: Well, it was just I remembered being really cute and I remember the crew.

17
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,400
Speaker 0: we all watched it.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,420
Speaker 1: It's actually similar to El Hazzard also structurally that there's no AV and a TV series.

19
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:33,485
Speaker 0: Is it similar?

20
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:36,360
Speaker 0: in the same way that the OAV is the only good part the TV series is?

21
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,359
Speaker 1: I don't remember the TV series cuz you know, I never watched it.

22
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, we're gonna rewatch this and we're it's gonna be a show.

23
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:53,680
Speaker 0: Yeah It's funny because I barely like I remembered the anime club fighting in the beginning and it was about magic and I remember this One scene where she's dumb and she makes this room like half on the roof on the ground.

24
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,240
Speaker 1: I remembered that aliens with the black ball that rolls down the street.

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's that, you know, of course there.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,366
Speaker 0: I mean there's the similar weird stuff in gatekeepers With the red hats.

27
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:18,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but once I saw that opener with the little dot That suddenly everything clicked together I was like, oh yeah this show and it says something, you know Sometimes I rewatch an anime and I'm not bored.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,551
Speaker 0: It's more like I remember what's happening and I'm like, ah, I got to go through all this shit again But some shows like ghost in the shell watching them again.

29
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,394
Speaker 0: It's like oh man.

30
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,337
Speaker 0: I remember this.

31
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,080
Speaker 0: This is awesome.

32
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,769
Speaker 0: The show gives me more the latter than the former.

33
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:32,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

34
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:33,595
Speaker 1: We'll see.

35
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,240
Speaker 1: I only watched one episode again.

36
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,309
Speaker 1: So I got five more OAV episodes.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:37,752
Speaker 1: I watched.

38
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:38,374
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna.

39
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,344
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna rewatch the TV I'm not.

40
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,449
Speaker 0: even I don't know if we ever did.

41
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:41,992
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

42
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:42,373
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:02:42,393 --> 00:02:43,780
Speaker 1: the TV's good bad different.

44
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:44,898
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever watched it.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
Speaker 0: Well as a warning Ella's are the TV and the second OAV not worth watching?

46
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:53,981
Speaker 0: Mmm, the TV show is basically the OAV done again, you know now that I think of it Like.

47
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,385
Speaker 1: I'm not even a hundred percent positive.

48
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,034
Speaker 1: There actually was a hosukai type TV.

49
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,539
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure there was.

50
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:01,690
Speaker 1: I got to actually go check.

51
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have to as well.

52
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:09,010
Speaker 1: I Couldn't really find any exciting news nothing.

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,475
Speaker 1: No, but I do.

54
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:11,900
Speaker 1: I will do geek bite instead.

55
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:20,565
Speaker 1: And the geek bite I will do is not actually a comic or an anime but is related and I watched the first episode of that Walking Dead TV.

56
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:23,033
Speaker 0: Ah, I also have seen the first episode.

57
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:28,389
Speaker 0: apparently my workers are watching it Like like they're watching it right along with the bittorrents.

58
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it wasn't departed way away from the comic.

59
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:48,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the first episode like as I don't really remember, you know the complete details of the early parts of the comic but the You know this first episode Definitely had the same tone and characterizations as the as the comic.

60
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it definitely felt like oh, yeah This is definitely Walking Dead zombie world, you know.

61
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:02,098
Speaker 1: Well, it felt it had that kind of gritty realism that most zombie things don't really and the characters act the way the characters act in Walking Dead and the zombies act the way they act in Walking Dead.

62
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,812
Speaker 1: and They also sort of it seemed to me like they muted the colors to.

63
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:12,100
Speaker 1: you know, it wasn't actually monochrome But the show definitely felt like it was sort of like they took half the color out.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,871
Speaker 1: You know a lot more like the comic which is monochrome.

65
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,394
Speaker 0: randomly over the weekend.

66
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,475
Speaker 0: I watched the machinist Just a movie that I hadn't watched.

67
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:20,920
Speaker 0: I was bored.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,579
Speaker 0: It's Dostoevsky retold.

69
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:28,233
Speaker 0: It's about a guy who hasn't slept in a year and is kind of going crazy.

70
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:34,947
Speaker 0: and people you go crazy after three days Yeah, and people are leaving post-it notes in his apartment and they Know they're not.

71
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:41,329
Speaker 1: he's just going crazy thinking this posted Clearly and it's basically Dostoevsky.

72
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:42,773
Speaker 0: It's like crime and punishment kind of thing.

73
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,920
Speaker 0: It's really good, but it did the same thing.

74
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,760
Speaker 0: It was black and white but not really like it was black and white but every now and then like things would be almost color.

75
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:55,680
Speaker 1: I mean the show wasn't actually black and white but at least it felt like there was some color that was removed.

76
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,249
Speaker 0: You sure you have you watch anything else.

77
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:58,255
Speaker 0: is your TVs fine?

78
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:01,700
Speaker 1: Yeah TV is just fine.

79
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:07,000
Speaker 1: But basically, yeah, I mean this wasn't a show where it's like, oh man, so I gotta watch every episode day comes out.

80
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,190
Speaker 1: It's so awesome.

81
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,012
Speaker 0: But I In the background, it's a show.

82
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,100
Speaker 1: This is not a bad.

83
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:16,660
Speaker 1: It is not one of those travesties where it's like, oh it ruins all the good from the original.

84
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,060
Speaker 1: you know the beginning of The Walking Dead is probably the best part of the comic and This show is also good in the same way for the same reasons.

85
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:32,359
Speaker 0: Well, like freaks and geeks or you know arrested development shows that I would never sit down and just watch but I'm hanging out Playing a game I could watch it like while I'm doing stuff.

86
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:37,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know this is a show where it's like if I you know, it'll go somewhere in the middle of the queue.

87
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,620
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm you know run out of like the best stuff to watch.

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,332
Speaker 0: It's like oh kind of thing I put on the TV when I'm I don't know mopping or doing all my grown-up stuff.

89
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:48,746
Speaker 1: if it turned bad in a later episode I would just well stop watching.

90
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,420
Speaker 0: well bad in the way that the comic gets kind of dumb later.

91
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:56,829
Speaker 1: Oh, well the comic gets dumb and then undumb and then you know It's a very switchy back and forth.

92
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:59,740
Speaker 1: you think the comic also wasn't helped by the changing of artists.

93
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,855
Speaker 1: You know, the original artist is much better than the artist they switched to.

94
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:07,880
Speaker 0: Sorry - though Apparently artist they say I mean the TV show is short and it's gonna end and they already signed on.

95
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,510
Speaker 0: They're going to make a sequel obviously a second season.

96
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:10,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, we'll see how it goes.

98
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:17,611
Speaker 0: It seems to be really popular I'm pretty sure all those actors and be big at the New York Comic Con.

99
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:24,140
Speaker 1: if you like a walking dead and you like a Zombie or both or you know, you should probably read the comic and watch this show.

100
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,511
Speaker 0: I'll say this they're pretty much equal on the enjoyment level of all the zombie things other than Of the living dead the original zombie thing.

101
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:42,672
Speaker 0: Well effectively the original zombie thing I don't you know, there's other zombie things that came before that but It's pretty much the best if you want realism and interesting characters.

102
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:43,996
Speaker 1: How about Dawn of the Dead?

103
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,188
Speaker 0: Dawn of the Dead was good It's right.

104
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:46,775
Speaker 0: It's up there.

105
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:51,319
Speaker 0: Close might be a tie but World War Z is nowhere near.

106
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:52,979
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway.

107
00:06:53,907 --> 00:07:01,040
Speaker 0: So our friend Mike tool, you know We write stuff for the anime news network among other awesome things and he does very amazing panels.

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,176
Speaker 0: Have you ever had an anime convention and you see Mike tool doing anything?

109
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:04,758
Speaker 0: Just go see it.

110
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,464
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what it is even if it doesn't look like.

111
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,006
Speaker 0: you'll like it.

112
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:13,043
Speaker 0: you'll like it trust us because if nothing else he'll just show you stuff that you Would never see.

113
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,709
Speaker 1: that's generally the trick is people don't?

114
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,930
Speaker 1: most people don't realize when you're deciding what panel to go to at a con Don't look at what the panels about right?

115
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,854
Speaker 1: Look at who's doing it.

116
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:23,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, Daryl Surratt It doesn't matter what he's talking about.

117
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,175
Speaker 1: It's gonna be hilarious or us or Mike tool or any of the other awesome people.

118
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:37,380
Speaker 0: Yeah Christian daily You know old RIT anime president, but speaking of old RIT anime Mike tool did a recent article that we're actually featured in a little bit.

119
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:43,270
Speaker 0: He emailed us and a bunch of other people we know some time ago and he was like Hey, you guys were big in anime clubs.

120
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,820
Speaker 0: Tell me a little bit about your old anime clubs.

121
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,960
Speaker 0: I'm doing an article on him and the current state of him and everything.

122
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,200
Speaker 1: So you said I'm like a fucking essay.

123
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,076
Speaker 1: I said him like a five-page and he was like I expected like a paragraph.

124
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:56,825
Speaker 1: you guys sent me an essay But it's like.

125
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:03,334
Speaker 1: dude, you should know if you ask us anything We're gonna you know, we're gonna give you every piece of information that we've got.

126
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,880
Speaker 1: We're not gonna hold anything back like rim.

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,649
Speaker 0: How long's your penis?

128
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:16,480
Speaker 1: Well If we measure it in Cartesian coordinates Let us go down and discuss every molecule from the base to the tip by number of zip codes.

129
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:24,180
Speaker 1: It will be point zero zero zero zero zero zero times ten to the six times ten to the negative.

130
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,533
Speaker 0: It's not as big as Gandalf's zip codes the solid nine inches.

131
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway.

132
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,100
Speaker 0: So he did this article on anime clubs and it's really good.

133
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:45,107
Speaker 0: he talks about the current state of them what they were in the past and if you don't if you're an anime fan and You're already on the right track.

134
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 0: like you're paying attention to directors and character designers And you're going to conventions and learning about anime and watching weird old stuff.

135
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,579
Speaker 0: You're on the right track.

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker 0: But the next step is to actually read articles about anime written by people who know what they're talking about.

137
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,468
Speaker 0: You know the books the articles the lectures.

138
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:02,711
Speaker 0: Fred showed all those people.

139
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,095
Speaker 0: That's the next step.

140
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:04,818
Speaker 0: So it's shot.

141
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:05,620
Speaker 0: I had his shot.

142
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,840
Speaker 0: I realized that I was hoping you would just be quiet.

143
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,946
Speaker 0: Let me continue on.

144
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:10,938
Speaker 0: then I was gonna edit it out later in post.

145
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,220
Speaker 0: but now.

146
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:16,600
Speaker 0: So this article is fascinating and as an aside Scott doesn't think you'd want to hear it?

147
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,385
Speaker 0: I think you would.

148
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:18,311
Speaker 0: we haven't done it a long time.

149
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,408
Speaker 0: Should we do a show on r.i.t Anime, we already did the show.

150
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,211
Speaker 0: I think we should do one.

151
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:23,337
Speaker 1: We already did the show.

152
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,040
Speaker 0: see listeners.

153
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,333
Speaker 1: We don't have a shortage of Wednesday show listeners.

154
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,800
Speaker 0: What do you want?

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,379
Speaker 0: They want whatever Scott doesn't want because I I am the candidate who is here for you.

156
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,440
Speaker 1: Whatever you I just gonna have to figure out all the shows that I want to do that You don't want to do and then ask the listeners and they'll be like we don't want to do that.

157
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,779
Speaker 1: About that we'll say zombies.

158
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,839
Speaker 0: Zombies are constitutionally banned.

159
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,813
Speaker 1: There's a constitution of geek names.

160
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:51,559
Speaker 0: There is now.

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,380
Speaker 0: But what this article really struck me when I read it and then when I thought about what I'd written.

162
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,165
Speaker 1: I haven't read it yet.

163
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:03,665
Speaker 0: So I got it and seeing other anime clubs Goddamn was the r.i.t.

164
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:04,628
Speaker 0: Anime Club awesome.

165
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:09,411
Speaker 0: Like I always thought in my head like yeah, that club was crazy Awesome, but it was my club.

166
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:10,900
Speaker 0: I have a very skewed opinion.

167
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:17,340
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ RIT anime is like the best anime club ever.

168
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,330
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a thing is like.

169
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,200
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still what it was, right?

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,971
Speaker 0: It's like the last I heard it was.

171
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,922
Speaker 0: we ran into the publicist I met.

172
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:34,014
Speaker 1: I met the librarian and it sounded like, you know, they lost their club space But he was still keeping the library strong as best he could but I'd still.

173
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:40,863
Speaker 1: I couldn't get any idea of like how many people Showing or if they were still doing as many less as bigly and awesome numbers I got.

174
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:44,836
Speaker 0: as an aside if you look in the comments on Mike's thing more people mention r.i.t.

175
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,920
Speaker 0: Anime than any other club.

176
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,125
Speaker 0: So, uh-huh.

177
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,434
Speaker 0: Well, you know, but and a lot of r.i.t.

178
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,699
Speaker 0: Anime people are out and about doing.

179
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:54,602
Speaker 0: you know big stuff running conventions and everything, but I Don't know.

180
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,291
Speaker 0: I feel like r.i.t.

181
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,377
Speaker 0: Anime is still pretty strong.

182
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:01,637
Speaker 0: less numbers I heard where they're still pushing 150 or so people in meeting give or take.

183
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,689
Speaker 0: Hmm I don't know how accurate that is.

184
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,273
Speaker 0: If any r.i.t.

185
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:09,177
Speaker 1: Anime people are listening You know, I know that we do have listeners at r.i.t.

186
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:09,780
Speaker 1: At least one.

187
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,251
Speaker 0: So if you're not going to the club go and go.

188
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,776
Speaker 1: not go into the club go spy Just go to it once and tell me what's going on.

189
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 1: or you know Tell the president to email us or some shit because I don't let's get them on this.

190
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,520
Speaker 1: Let's actually get the r.i.t.

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,384
Speaker 1: We should get the r.i.t.

192
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:24,570
Speaker 1: Anime club president on the show.

193
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,500
Speaker 1: then we could do a show about anime club.

194
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,077
Speaker 0: Actually, it would be a fun thing is try to get all the r.i.t.

195
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:31,244
Speaker 1: Presidents As many r.i.t.

196
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,970
Speaker 1: Anime club presidents as possible on the show.

197
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,874
Speaker 1: at one time we could.

198
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:34,636
Speaker 0: I could get six.

199
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:35,640
Speaker 1: we could probably get.

200
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:36,998
Speaker 1: Let's see you.

201
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:42,202
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson Lisa Christian daily Luke Technically.

202
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,767
Speaker 0: Mike Lynn was president for a little while.

203
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how are we gonna contact Mike Lynn?

204
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,545
Speaker 0: I I could get contact with.

205
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,190
Speaker 1: we could get Jason or Saudi.

206
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I guess Liz.

207
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if we can get Liz.

208
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,234
Speaker 0: I think we get Liz.

209
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,857
Speaker 1: Well, we know like Yeah, the other guy named Scott that we don't really know.

210
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:04,375
Speaker 0: I don't know him But the thing is Christian daily might be able to get him.

211
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:11,194
Speaker 1: and if he can't Yeah, plus I think I think I mean that tells you something about the r.i.t.

212
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:11,676
Speaker 1: Anime club.

213
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,020
Speaker 1: right how many people did we just name?

214
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:17,126
Speaker 1: like ten people and But you're only in college for four years.

215
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,015
Speaker 0: So somehow the Hall of Kings was remembered.

216
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:30,528
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, it's like There are kings from before we were even there and kings after we left and we still know them You know and they're all connected to each other.

217
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaker 1: That's that's you know, and some of these people had multi-year reigns.

218
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,926
Speaker 1: This was not like.

219
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,360
Speaker 1: everyone was in an in-and-out situation.

220
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:40,651
Speaker 1: Some of these people had very short reigns though as well.

221
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:47,999
Speaker 0: Yes, there was political drama There were there were kings and despots and revolutions and all king is dead and long live the king.

222
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:54,100
Speaker 0: But anyway check this article out king and if you're at a convention keep an eye out for Mike tool.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,582
Speaker 0: He's.

224
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:58,576
Speaker 0: he's on the good list in our opinion of anime and wearing MLS soccer trees.

225
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,746
Speaker 1: That's how you know, Mike tool is Yeah, really big.

226
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:05,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, like whoa, he's tall He could crush my head like a watermelon.

227
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,020
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day.

228
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:26,811
Speaker 0: So I like anime openers like there was a time before I had access to a lot of anime and before there was YouTube Or bit tauren or anything like that.

229
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:38,180
Speaker 0: I would go to sites and download Avi's or m pegs of the openers to anime that were not available in the u.s Yeah I mean there are still some shows where I've only ever seen the opener.

230
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,914
Speaker 1: I've never seen the show and it was like that weird fucked up Pokemon ish thing.

231
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,580
Speaker 0: Oh, right jeep baku.

232
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, what the fuck was that?

233
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:47,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

234
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,080
Speaker 1: We could find out what it is.

235
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,522
Speaker 0: I did.

236
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:59,640
Speaker 1: I actually I do know what this story was with that or like Aaron's about you that we found out later was actually Shitty fighting game that had a different name in the u.s Yeah, they actually had a used copy of the GameStop that we didn't buy.

237
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:06,118
Speaker 1: They see the shittiest fighting game in the world with the real the best opener and opening song in the world.

238
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,042
Speaker 0: that opener I was like.

239
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,849
Speaker 0: this anime is so of my.

240
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:11,840
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a fighting anime, but goddamn was that a good opener?

241
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:15,460
Speaker 0: I think the song was primarily what made it a good opener.

242
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of like most of what an opener is.

243
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,780
Speaker 0: is the song kind of like a tenshi muyo gxp?

244
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the best opener to the worst show.

245
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,150
Speaker 1: I mean if you took opener quality to show quality ratios Tenshi muyo gxp is the highest ever.

246
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,680
Speaker 0: I mean the only thing that might possibly beat it is noir.

247
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:37,815
Speaker 1: No, because noir is a much better show than tenshi muyo gxp.

248
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:38,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

249
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,060
Speaker 0: You're right.

250
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,772
Speaker 1: No opener is not as good as the tenshi muyo gxp opening.

251
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:42,174
Speaker 0: You're right.

252
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:49,508
Speaker 0: nuns with guns lava No blood, you know one woman with a pistol takes out like 80 guys Open field.

253
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:50,959
Speaker 0: that show wasn't stupid.

254
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,470
Speaker 0: But tenshi muyo the worst I'd say.

255
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,275
Speaker 1: noir is a good show.

256
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,100
Speaker 1: I'm just saying who is better?

257
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,480
Speaker 1: It's like comparing two poops, which is the least smelly poop, you know, what's great.

258
00:14:58,622 --> 00:14:59,900
Speaker 0: You know gxp was bad.

259
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:08,520
Speaker 0: But the worst part is not only was it bad But none of the characters that the fanboys even wanted to see her in that goddamn thing for like the first half.

260
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,790
Speaker 1: Is it better or worse than photon?

261
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:12,894
Speaker 0: I don't know.

262
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,960
Speaker 0: I put them in the same category of unwatchable.

263
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,023
Speaker 0: It's like the untouchables.

264
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,046
Speaker 1: They're basically the same.

265
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,369
Speaker 1: They're easily the same thing, right?

266
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,873
Speaker 0: They're yeah untouchable.

267
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:23,393
Speaker 1: I Don't know they might be unlookable.

268
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:27,057
Speaker 0: So anyway This is simply every.

269
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:34,645
Speaker 0: well You know We have those things we show at anime cons or whenever we need to like fill a room or kill some time of every robot Anime opener in contiguous order.

270
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,206
Speaker 1: I love that.

271
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,349
Speaker 1: We should watch this.

272
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,260
Speaker 0: is that for anime that aren't robot shows?

273
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,086
Speaker 0: But interestingly enough some of them are robot.

274
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,860
Speaker 0: It's really short and you'll see why because it's every anime opener ever.

275
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,816
Speaker 1: It is every anime opener ever.

276
00:15:48,896 --> 00:16:00,386
Speaker 0: It's great Just like it was good the part when it just starts panning up to someone's face and then into the sky Like that was the best part The part where people are running to the left.

277
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:04,860
Speaker 1: Yep, or the subtle one where the birds birds birds different birds more birds.

278
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,160
Speaker 0: Well, there's two different kinds of birds.

279
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,660
Speaker 0: There's like the one seagull flying out over the ocean and then there's the flock of birds.

280
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,516
Speaker 1: There's a drop of water drop of water drop water drop water drop.

281
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,487
Speaker 0: the teardrops go Sideways from a woman as she turns her head.

282
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, or the head turning head head turn to look at the camera.

283
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,644
Speaker 1: I don't look at the camera didn't?

284
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:26,860
Speaker 0: the subtlest one was the zoom in shakily on an action scene.

285
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,671
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good reason.

286
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,020
Speaker 0: not many old anime did that.

287
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,795
Speaker 1: Anyway, so check this out, right?

288
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:39,985
Speaker 1: some guy You know how some people would like take the shinning and then they would make it look like it was a feel-good movie Except between the hours of what?

289
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:40,506
Speaker 0: two and four.

290
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:45,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's Willis time really the most quotable episodes of The Simpsons ever, right?

291
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,324
Speaker 0: basically Also a movie.

292
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,079
Speaker 1: what these people did here or maybe one person did is they took?

293
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,743
Speaker 1: Akira the movie.

294
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,551
Speaker 1: All right, and they took some music.

295
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,677
Speaker 1: I'm not sure exactly what music it is.

296
00:16:58,837 --> 00:16:59,499
Speaker 1: It's very is it?

297
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,540
Speaker 1: yeah It's very familiar.

298
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,743
Speaker 1: It's not Final Fantasy music.

299
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,790
Speaker 1: yes, that's Lapta.

300
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:07,372
Speaker 1: does?

301
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,739
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a Final Fantasy song that's very similar.

302
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:17,400
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a little kind of similar But it's like the Lapta music and they took Akira and they put them together and it's Akira x Ghibli.

303
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:20,095
Speaker 1: So it looks like Akira was a Ghibli movie.

304
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:20,859
Speaker 0: You know what this gives me?

305
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,259
Speaker 0: Ghibli Ghibli.

306
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,822
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's it's pretty good and it serves many purposes like reminding you that Akira is amazing and lol Look at that.

307
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,580
Speaker 1: They made Akira look like Ghibli and if you've seen Akira, it's like double lol.

308
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:51,031
Speaker 1: You know what's actually going on in that scene versus what this sort of fake trailer would imply is going on in that scene Like Speaking of the Ghibli Ghiblis.

309
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:58,760
Speaker 0: before we get to the meta moment I just want to point out you should go on YouTube and watch all the cutscenes from poker night of the inventory.

310
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:02,828
Speaker 0: Yeah as a show it's basically like a half hour Animated show.

311
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:03,814
Speaker 1: think of it as an anime.

312
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,920
Speaker 1: don't think of it as a game, right?

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,451
Speaker 1: I bought the game because it was like five bucks, right?

314
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,315
Speaker 0: I watched it on YouTube.

315
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,280
Speaker 0: Does that mean I pirated it?

316
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,042
Speaker 1: I don't know.

317
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,011
Speaker 1: but basically right it's you play.

318
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,840
Speaker 1: all you do in this game is play poker.

319
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,106
Speaker 0: All you do in this game is watch the heavy.

320
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,012
Speaker 1: you play the tiny heavy.

321
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,485
Speaker 1: you play poker with strong bed the heavy Tycho from penny arcade.

322
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,253
Speaker 1: and this is it max from Sam and Max?

323
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:27,500
Speaker 0: I think you've never played a 7 max game.

324
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,447
Speaker 0: Have you no idea?

325
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,117
Speaker 0: actually he I think is the weakest link in this show.

326
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:38,340
Speaker 0: Yeah He only has one trick, but they use the shik a little too much.

327
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:44,100
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically you're playing poker with these four guys who are fictional characters and they're very funny.

328
00:18:44,362 --> 00:18:50,680
Speaker 1: They're very funny until they start repeating the same joke over and over again And then you're done and it's basically a single-player poker game that you you know.

329
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,260
Speaker 1: He just goes on forever with nothing else really going on.

330
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,106
Speaker 1: So you might as well.

331
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 1: the only reason to play it is for the joke.

332
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,039
Speaker 1: So watch all the jokes on YouTube and then you're done just when heavy keeps calling strong bad tiny heavy.

333
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,775
Speaker 0: There's something about that.

334
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:11,100
Speaker 1: So without any further ado the meta Moment, let's try not to forget any things.

335
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,617
Speaker 0: All right for anyone who hasn't paid attention the geek died store has one item for sale our original t-shirt.

Speaker 0: We've never been denied in like a decade panels at Otakon.

355
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:11,660
Speaker 0: every year since 2002.

356
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,767
Speaker 0: We've done one or more one year.

357
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:14,810
Speaker 0: We did like seven.

358
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:19,042
Speaker 1: we denied them last year just because they didn't get the schedule to us 2,000 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

359
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:19,424
Speaker 0: so they mine.

360
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:27,995
Speaker 1: they might Legitimately deny us because we denied them and they're like, oh those guys are now unreliable.

361
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,380
Speaker 1: So then we're gonna deny them.

362
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,766
Speaker 0: I just want to get it out here now.

363
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:31,067
Speaker 0: It'll be.

364
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:33,318
Speaker 0: it'll be very telling as to how they can do.

365
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:39,265
Speaker 1: if they want I don't care they can and if they don't then if they get the schedule out on time Then we'll go.

366
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,040
Speaker 0: thing is it wasn't even the panel schedule.

367
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,451
Speaker 0: It was our own staff schedule.

368
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,600
Speaker 0: was what we were waiting on.

369
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:54,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but basically I just get this out here now because we're gonna you know if we're gonna submit our panels to Otakon like we do every year and Our panels have never failed to fill the room.

370
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,535
Speaker 0: So we'll see if Otakon wants us to do panels or not.

371
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:01,828
Speaker 0: if we don't appear at Otakon It is not because we are not willing to do panels.

372
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:06,120
Speaker 1: No, it's you know, because something they did not, you know do enough.

373
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:10,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you have any strong feelings about that let appropriate people know I guess.

374
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,820
Speaker 1: and if you if you want to say well, why should they do anything for you?

375
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,368
Speaker 1: It's like well look at what Pax does for us.

376
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:20,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so everyone else, you know Anime Boston does more for us than anyone else.

377
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,019
Speaker 1: They do more for us than Pax.

378
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:24,568
Speaker 1: So Otakon is just us to step up.

379
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:36,400
Speaker 0: also as another kind of I'm curious listeners out there Let me know if you've been to like this comment whenever Katsucon happens again Because we stopped going to Katsucon when all the staff we knew quit and the con had a lot of trouble.

380
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,446
Speaker 1: We're also gonna Zenkai con.

381
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:37,868

Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

393
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:51,440
Speaker 0: if we missed it the staff would have said something like where are you guys?

394
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,982
Speaker 1: I think they just remember it's supposed to be in November But I guess that's.

395
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:58,879
Speaker 0: it has to be wrong if my phone starts ringing and someone's like guys your panels in like 20 minutes.

426
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:45,867
Speaker 0: It's pretty sure.

427
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,939
Speaker 1: one of the things of the day is a repeat thing of the day.

428
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,270
Speaker 0: We'll find out saying that but it is.

429
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,380

430
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,333

00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:54,998
Speaker 1: That's right.

432
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:56,865

436
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:07,899
Speaker 1: I think I didn't either.

437
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,253
Speaker 2: I Must have been maybe about seven or eight and I saw it on VHS at my aunt's house And I remember.

Speaker 2: you know It's.

439
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:25,170
Speaker 2: it's very strange thinking back on my first impressions the movie because I remember it being a lot scarier Because I mean I was like seven.

440
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:32,851
Speaker 2: I hadn't seen a ton of film noir Detective judge doom at the end and the dip scared Was awful.

441
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,780
Speaker 1: it was a little bit scary.

442
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:42,861
Speaker 2: It was this one part with a part where they're torturing the shoe with the dip and I was like, oh, this is awful It's like horrible acid shit, I hate it I hate.

443
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:50,588
Speaker 2: I was so scared of that when I was a little kid and then like once I became older I realized that it was all a joke like that.

444
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,700
Speaker 2: Yep was turpentine and that's what they used to clean the cells off.

445
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:00,487
Speaker 1: Clean the cells off with.

446
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:01,612
Speaker 1: but I'm like, why did?

447
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:03,440
Speaker 1: why would you clean off the cell?

448
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,696
Speaker 1: It's like you just drew the art on it and then they reuse them.

449
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:11,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's From old Disney stuff.

450
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:18,434
Speaker 2: If they wanted to save money Especially on low-budget productions, they would just keep using cells.

451
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:20,319
Speaker 1: and actually how much is the cell cost?

452
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,124
Speaker 2: I don't know, but they add up.

453
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,637
Speaker 2: think of how many frames makes your typical animated movie.

454
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:34,120
Speaker 1: and especially I mean I could understand Understand if you like, you know a race like the cell of the guy's really tiny and far away.

455
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,359
Speaker 1: But if it's like the cell of like he's right up.

456
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:42,767
Speaker 0: Wasn't it a lot like with old TV shows where they just thought they didn't think there was any value to the fact out Doctor who?

457
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,539
Speaker 2: and so there's all these lost episodes.

458
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,735
Speaker 1: I mean like live radio programs were not recorded in any way shape or form because They just broadcasted some guys with microphones.

459
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:52,338
Speaker 1: and then that was it.

460
00:25:52,740 --> 00:26:02,210
Speaker 2: well back then I think they didn't even anticipate that there would be a secondary market for Things on on tape or on on digital media.

461
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,015
Speaker 2: I mean there wasn't any digital media.

462
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:15,517
Speaker 2: and so they figured well we'll have prints of the film, but we don't actually need to go back and Reshoot the film or scan it in because you know that hadn't been invented yet.

463
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,687
Speaker 2: They couldn't have known Cells would turn out to be used.

464
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:25,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even like, you know, regardless of you know, the technology that's available It's like, you know There was just no set.

465
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,403
Speaker 1: It's like they hadn't learned the lessons of any of the previous centuries.

466
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:29,730
Speaker 1: of that you must preserve.

467
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:36,000
Speaker 1: put effort into preserving the art or That's a relatively recent movement and also I see beams are pretty old.

468
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,800
Speaker 2: I think part of it is like television and animation and stuff.

469
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:50,880
Speaker 2: It wasn't necessarily viewed as a fine art but as cheap entertainment, so it it was more an assembly line production than actually.

470
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,914
Speaker 2: You know the feeling of a an artist before his canvas.

471
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:56,580
Speaker 0: I mean look at like old comic books.

472
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,083
Speaker 0: They they were.

473
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,392
Speaker 0: I mean they were fighting comic books.

474
00:26:58,412 --> 00:26:59,540
Speaker 0: They weren't gonna put him in the museum.

475
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:04,700
Speaker 1: At least nowadays we seem to have mostly at least not completely but mostly learn the lesson.

476
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,790
Speaker 1: You know people are already trying to save the video game.

477
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,966
Speaker 2: Well and and with the digital society Preservation is a lot easier.

478
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,149
Speaker 2: Whereas back.

479
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,494
Speaker 1: It's not as easy as you think.

480
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:30,049
Speaker 0: it seems easier in the short term But in the long term it is much more difficult Mental effort and expertise but it doesn't require as much physical space and investment like film You know unrolling it in those long tubes.

481
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,551
Speaker 2: Yeah.

482
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:32,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, sometimes let's talk about this movie.

483
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:58,489
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, okay, but part of the thing talking about Roger Rabbit is very difficult If you leave out talking about animation history because what the movie is I mean on the surface level it functions as a really fun Mystery movie like, you know is definitely in the style of old black and white film noir Alcoholic hero who's kind of down and out.

484
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,562
Speaker 0: and I have this with a lot like, you know project echo and a lot of things I've seen.

485
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:02,507
Speaker 0: I thought like.

486
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,579
Speaker 0: as a kid I didn't quite get that they were comedies.

487
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:09,460
Speaker 0: They had funny moments, but I took him kind of straight up at face value and Roger Rabbit was the same way.

488
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,384
Speaker 0: I remember just getting into it as a mystery movie and it didn't really dawn on me that this was Partly a comedy.

489
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:19,840
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't completely understand it, you know, and I was very young.

490
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,760
Speaker 0: I didn't get any of those jokes about Jack Daniels.

491
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:22,647
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, there was.

492
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,420
Speaker 1: so there's so many stuff in there.

493
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,604
Speaker 1: That reminds me a lot of the same stuff that Powerpuff Girls used to do where you would tell dirty jokes But kids wouldn't get them.

494
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:33,700
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like all the all the more adult stuff.

495
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:36,881
Speaker 1: It's like it's just right in there and so obvious It's.

496
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:42,380
Speaker 2: it's called dual address and I learned about this in one of my classes when we were talking about Aladdin.

497
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:58,960
Speaker 2: But dual address is when you have a thing that speaks to both children and adults But on different levels like when mojo Jojo was in jail and this big really big guy standing next to prison rape always the your go-to example.

498
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,285
Speaker 2: What's the one?

499
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,329
Speaker 2: Liberty Meadows?

500
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:15,074
Speaker 2: it's like that guy, you know And luckily he ended up going into independent comics so he could draw the big-titted women He wanted without having to worry about newspaper censors.

501
00:29:15,094 --> 00:29:16,119
Speaker 1: He draws a fine.

502
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,833
Speaker 2: He's really really good as

503
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,465
Speaker 1: opposed to some of those fantasy artists Just

504
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,799
Speaker 0: the woman straddling a story.

505
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:30,666
Speaker 2: Anyway, like Frank Cho back when he was doing newspaper comics He'd always try to slip things in.

506
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:42,880
Speaker 2: you know that were this strip was supposedly family-friendly, but sometimes it would get a little secretly raunchy, you know, but With with Roger Rabbit, it's funny.

507
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:53,620
Speaker 2: Like I said, the dip was just one thing that I didn't understand because it was animation lingo And I thought it was just scary like some sort of scary acid.

508
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,360
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I thought too, and I'm freaked out by acid scenes.

509
00:29:57,501 --> 00:30:00,594
Speaker 2: Anyway, I like good they killed us the poor shoe.

510
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:01,538
Speaker 0: poor shoe didn't?

511
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,740
Speaker 1: he was All right, we got to do a photoshop for that scene where it's crevo shoe that goes in the dip.

512
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,511
Speaker 0: I'd feel too bad.

513
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:10,400
Speaker 0: They're so rare.

514
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,139
Speaker 1: Over and over again you get infinite crevo shoes.

515
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:20,923
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna assume we don't really need to worry about spoilers because the movie came out in 1988.

516
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously, if you haven't watched it like what the hell?

517
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,380
Speaker 0: I if you have not seen this movie God and watch it right now and then come back and listen to the rest of this.

518
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,153
Speaker 0: Definitely you're about the 37 ish minute mark.

519
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:30,796
Speaker 0: Yeah.

520
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:37,720
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Some of the things that I always thought were really weird when I was a little kid and I mean, they're still really weird.

521
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:45,068
Speaker 2: But the fact that the femme fatale is like married to Roger It's just kind of inexplicable.

522
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:49,045
Speaker 2: but like, you know you expect You know, mrs.

523
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,855
Speaker 2: Rabbit to be a rabbit and she's not a rabbit.

524
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:56,970
Speaker 2: She's a very Alluring cartoon songstress.

525
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,924
Speaker 0: I do love that scene where he's sitting there and he's all like Rabbit whatever.

526
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,694
Speaker 0: then she comes out and he just kind of jaw drops.

527
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:12,652
Speaker 2: Yeah But Patty cake scene Play in patty cake and they're actually playing.

528
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:15,240
Speaker 0: I like how they animate the patty cake with the pictures.

529
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,855
Speaker 0: I wonder if that was very much intentional.

530
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:21,709
Speaker 0: I'm sure Come on you well well except for what was that scene?

531
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:22,030
Speaker 0: Emily?

532
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,940
Speaker 0: you were telling us about where he was looking at the wrong place.

533
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,030
Speaker 2: That was funny.

534
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:33,020
Speaker 2: that um Animation aside there's this book by Richard Williams called the animators survival kit.

535
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,634
Speaker 2: And if you want to get into animation at all, that's like your primer.

536
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,180
Speaker 2: That's the number one textbook.

537
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,942
Speaker 2: you should get it.

538
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:46,442
Speaker 2: it covers all the basics and he also has some really funny anecdotes because Richard Williams was the animation director on Roger rabbit.

539
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:51,474
Speaker 2: and there's this one scene where the the actor who played.

540
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:52,777
Speaker 2: what's the main character's name?

541
00:31:52,837 --> 00:32:16,328
Speaker 2: I forget but he was very good at maintaining the imagined eye contact with the cartoon because what they do is they'd film the actors and then This Print out every frame of the movie and then the animators would animate over it and then they'd photograph it like a background With a cell overlay like an animated film.

542
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,658
Speaker 0: What's interesting is how like it really holds up.

543
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:26,400
Speaker 1: Yeah In some ways like it's like whoa, that's you know, that's pretty good skills even for today, right?

544
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,332
Speaker 1: Like in the scene we're like like Jessica.

545
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:35,539
Speaker 1: I was pulling on his tie You know, yeah, it's pretty good Little mechanical gadgets and stuff like.

546
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:37,762
Speaker 1: Like.

547
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:43,240
Speaker 1: there was the scene where all the weasels bust into his office and this is his guns that are just comically floating around.

548
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:43,603
Speaker 1: It's like.

549
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,439
Speaker 1: did you like, you know take a sleep?

550
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:49,748
Speaker 1: It was not as good as I mean.

551
00:32:49,769 --> 00:33:01,659
Speaker 1: overall the movie looks better than a lot of CG movies And I mean and while there were plenty of other movies before and since that have done the animation live-action combination It's like nobody's really done the same.

552
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:03,706
Speaker 1: You know kind no one's done it.

553
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,673
Speaker 0: Well cool world was like another attempt.

554
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:06,637
Speaker 0: That doesn't really hold up.

555
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,927
Speaker 2: No, no I've seen clips of cool world.

556
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,698
Speaker 2: I didn't actually see it because my parents saw it and they were like It's okay.

557
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:16,543
Speaker 0: But as a kid, I kind of want to watch it again because Brad Pitt's a really good actor It's.

558
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,218
Speaker 0: I imagine he's really good in it.

559
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:21,938
Speaker 2: Ralph Bakshi for me is really hot and cold like some of back.

560
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:26,479
Speaker 2: She's stuff I like and some of it is just like really I don't know.

561
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,005
Speaker 2: Smutty for the sake of being smutty I don't know.

562
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,192
Speaker 2: Sometimes back.

563
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:35,844
Speaker 2: She's stuff is kind of Lassie Nowadays, right?

564
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,600
Speaker 1: I'm seeing a trend of like this sort of opposite, right?

565
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:45,240
Speaker 1: Like I saw this trailer when I went to see Tron for this like Disney's Mars needs moms and it was like God.

566
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,953
Speaker 1: It was like real people but in a whole CG animated world.

567
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:52,767
Speaker 1: No, I guess that backwards people It looks like real motion capture.

568
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:54,996
Speaker 2: I can't believe you thought those were real people.

569
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:55,999
Speaker 2: I know they're creepy.

570
00:33:56,622 --> 00:34:03,779
Speaker 1: It looked like real people like at least real faces were used, you know for the Maybe you've made it past the uncanny valley and the rest of us have it.

571
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,660
Speaker 1: But it said it was from the directors or the people who made Polar Express.

572
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,335
Speaker 1: It wasn't Polar Express the same thing.

573
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:24,210
Speaker 2: where it was Polar Express was like all animation and weird-looking It is Tom Hanks Mars needs moms is the exact same process the exact same Producers and actually strange as it is.

574
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,299
Speaker 2: I believe it's the mekis, right?

575
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:27,641
Speaker 2: Who did it?

576
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:30,110
Speaker 2: it wasn't he involved with Roger Rabbit?

577
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:30,371
Speaker 2: Yeah.

578
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,300
Speaker 0: He was the director of the live-action part.

579
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:44,652
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he's still around making you know live-action animation kind of Combinations, but they're not as cool and they're really creepy and strange.

580
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's the scene that we were talking about.

581
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,465
Speaker 2: Yeah, so anyway The the lead actor.

582
00:34:51,806 --> 00:35:04,313
Speaker 2: he was supposed to be making eye contact with Roger Rabbit who was shorter than he was but he he screwed up and they didn't catch it until they had sent the Footage over to the animation department.

583
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,320
Speaker 2: They're like damn.

584
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:06,185
Speaker 2: This is gonna.

585
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:11,605
Speaker 2: Roger has to be up in the air if we're gonna have Eye contact in this scene.

586
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:16,180
Speaker 2: So they like stretched him out against the wall like on his tippy toes for no reason.

587
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,200
Speaker 2: They're like, well, he's neurotic it might work.

588
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Speaker 2: And so there's this one scene where Rogers just like inching up the wall and you're like, what is he doing?

589
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,952
Speaker 2: But it was because they had a had a mistake.

590
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:40,219
Speaker 0: They had to cover up so various little things But you don't notice it unless you know about him, you know, so they got Bob Hoskins to play Eddie Valiant But apparently, you know, the number one choice was Harrison Ford really just couldn't afford it.

591
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,015
Speaker 0: Well, actually I think Bill Murray too, but he didn't respond.

592
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:51,266
Speaker 0: I Think the casting worked out really well, I think I mean Eddie Valiant was a good character Yeah, though being an adult.

593
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:57,049
Speaker 0: I did not notice how much they hammer down the point that he is an alcoholic He is drinking.

594
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,306
Speaker 1: I didn't notice that at all until the most recent viewing.

595
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:10,526
Speaker 1: I didn't notice that and it wasn't until two viewings ago after learning about it in college that I realized that it was about, you know, the you know, the All the cloverly thing.

596
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:13,780
Speaker 1: Yeah the conspiracy to get rid of all the trains and the buses, right?

597
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,289
Speaker 1: Because that's something that really happened, right?

598
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:17,353
Speaker 1: I didn't know about that.

599
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,480
Speaker 1: They bought all the streetcar.

600
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,924
Speaker 1: That's the reason that we don't have trolleys, you know, except for tourist reasons in this country anymore is because you know GM whoever.

601
00:36:25,944 --> 00:36:26,999
Speaker 1: they bought all of them.

602
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:36,426
Speaker 1: They shut them down They replaced them with buses and they purposefully made bus schedules shitty with shitty routes so that everyone would buy a car And that's why the United States is full of cars.

603
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:46,917
Speaker 0: What's funny is think about the nice subtle social commentary of the crazy guy at the end Kind of avoiding spoilers, I guess who's like imagine it's a road with people driving a freeway.

604
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,120
Speaker 0: I'll call it a freeway.

605
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:50,587
Speaker 2: Well, the funniest value is like you're crazy.

606
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:55,504
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, there's multiple scenes where they show him using the streetcar kids sitting on the back Of it.

607
00:36:55,584 --> 00:37:03,220
Speaker 0: Yeah and all that kind of stuff to show you like, you know, they Also notice how he gets a cigarette from that like 13 year old kid.

608
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:10,896
Speaker 2: Also, it's kind of funny too because you know The evil guy is trying to make freeways and you realize it's set in LA.

609
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:18,020
Speaker 2: so Everybody in LA hates the freeways because they're they're insane.

610
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:22,538
Speaker 1: I mean Los Angeles, but everyone there is but everyone there drives.

611
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:26,560
Speaker 1: and yeah A lot of LA people comes in New York insist on driving even if the subways.

612
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,183
Speaker 1: Well, there's.

613
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:29,454
Speaker 2: there's no alternatives in LA.

614
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:32,273
Speaker 2: They don't have a Bus subway system.

615
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,191
Speaker 2: They got rid of it thing Exactly.

616
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,957
Speaker 2: and that's what the subplot of this movie is about.

617
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:48,324
Speaker 2: It's about animation history It's a film noir and it's also social commentary about the history And I I like.

618
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:57,547
Speaker 2: I like some of the Film noir tropes like some of the the lines where this is like Eddie Is that a rabbit in your pocket?

619
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,735
Speaker 2: or are you just happy to see me instead of?

620
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,160
Speaker 2: is that a gun in your pocket?

621
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:08,598
Speaker 0: One of my favorite scenes is just that little shave and a haircut Do and they can't not do it.

622
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:14,397
Speaker 0: It was really fun to watch was the Angry Video Game Nerd Cinematica review of Roger Rabbit.

623
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:15,260
Speaker 0: That's what reminded me.

624
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,127
Speaker 2: I didn't see that.

625
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:22,570
Speaker 1: I only saw his review of the game because I was oh my god I actually played the game before I ever saw the movie.

626
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,796
Speaker 2: Did you call the phone number?

627
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:27,316
Speaker 0: No Well, the phone number now goes to a sex line.

628
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:30,720
Speaker 1: No kidding I played the game with like a feck, you know, and it just went today.

629
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,674
Speaker 0: I tried to play the game legit as a result.

630
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:33,439
Speaker 0: I never beat it.

631
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:36,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just played it with it with the fact that I happen to have you know.

632
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,389
Speaker 0: Also, it was weird that as a kid.

633
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:45,600
Speaker 0: I remembered like really not Understanding how they got Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and Daffy Duck.

634
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,829
Speaker 1: I didn't understand how they did that either when I was a kid.

635
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:48,391
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid.

636
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,897
Speaker 0: I was like so did it like?

637
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:50,760
Speaker 0: who made this movie?

638
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,889
Speaker 2: So what's the story behind that?

639
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,857
Speaker 2: I actually don't know that aspect.

640
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,543
Speaker 2: how they got Amazed me.

641
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,588
Speaker 0: I don't know.

642
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:03,020
Speaker 0: I'm like reading through IMDb in the Wikipedia.

643
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:05,669
Speaker 1: So you still don't know you didn't?

644
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:07,600
Speaker 1: you just tried to mention it without looking it up before.

645
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,420
Speaker 0: I mean, I thought it was awesome like as a kid.

646
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,366
Speaker 0: It really stood out.

647
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:12,520
Speaker 0: that like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.

648
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:15,560
Speaker 1: It makes me wonder like how come people can't figure this shit out?

649
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:25,900
Speaker 0: Well, the best I can see is that you know They got Spielberg to do all this stuff and they basically they went into this movie thinking All right, this is our chance to make a super blockbuster.

650
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:27,946
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't a super block.

651
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,392
Speaker 0: Well, they wanted it to be.

652
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,200
Speaker 2: did they have to pay for the rights?

653
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,505
Speaker 2: So did they get permission?

654
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:39,396
Speaker 2: I mean, I understand that there must have been you know Some sort of legal powwow going on between the companies.

655
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:41,102
Speaker 0: all the legal stuff I can find.

656
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:45,938
Speaker 0: talk about the sequel that didn't happen and not paying the guy who wrote the book.

657
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,559
Speaker 2: Yeah I was gonna say did you know it was based on a book?

658
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, Gary K Wolf right never heard of.

659
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:53,833
Speaker 1: so the book came first, yep.

660
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,338
Speaker 1: Wow, what's the book?

661
00:39:55,378 --> 00:39:56,020
Speaker 1: the same story?

662
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,824
Speaker 2: No, it's actually really different.

663
00:39:57,884 --> 00:39:58,686
Speaker 2: I haven't read it.

664
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,190
Speaker 2: But I mean it.

665
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,637
Speaker 2: it plays out like a mystery.

666
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:12,209
Speaker 2: It's you know 1940s 1930s era and Other than that, I really don't know.

667
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,282
Speaker 2: apparently it's a very strange book There.

668
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:25,226
Speaker 2: but one point though Mickey Mouse kind of a dick, oh they're optics when The worst one is Tweety.

669
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:29,440
Speaker 2: and Tweety I hate in the cartoons too, but Tweety when he's like

670
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:43,440
Speaker 1: You know people you don't think about it too much when you're watching a lot of the old You know cartoons because some of them right give you a reason for someone to get the shit kicked out of them.

671
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,460
Speaker 1: Like the you know, Wile E. Coyote doesn't fall off the cliff until he's trying to eat the roadrunner.

672
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:50,289
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of like karmic bugs buddies.

673
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:53,880
Speaker 1: only, you know, most of the time is like Elmer Fudd tries to shoot him first.

674
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes he just finds sometimes tortures.

675
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:57,611
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

676
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:01,187
Speaker 1: He's just an asshole but like for no reason I don't know.

677
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,460
Speaker 2: most of the time with bugs It's like they cross him one time and then he spends the rest of the episode extracting his revenge, right?

678
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,589
Speaker 1: But I mean sometimes they don't even cross him at all.

679
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:12,558
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's just like oh you're singing opera.

680
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:16,700
Speaker 0: All right Torture you have to death the the opera singer.

681
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,949
Speaker 2: He hit him with the thing and and then bugs is always like.

682
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,700
Speaker 2: this means war and then that happens sometimes.

683
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,199
Speaker 0: Somebody should have just called the police and been like this guy hit me.

684
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:41,559
Speaker 2: There were a couple with the with the thugs weren't there.

685
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:43,540
Speaker 1: There was the one where he's hiding in the stove.

686
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,128
Speaker 0: He's done it, but I know he's done it.

687
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:48,780
Speaker 2: That's the other one and the the one where they're in the factory.

688
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:49,733
Speaker 2: Is that that one?

689
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,191
Speaker 1: Yeah There's one there in the house on the cliff and one there in the.

690
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:54,920
Speaker 1: they're in a factory or something.

691
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,414
Speaker 2: You know, which one I want to find again is the one where?

692
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,940
Speaker 2: There's the dog who falls in love with the lawn ornament dog and then she gets turned into a bomb.

693
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,486
Speaker 0: You don't remember that one.

694
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:10,819
Speaker 2: It was one of those wartime cartoons and they used to play it on the cartoon.

695
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:37,099
Speaker 2: now Vaguely Show the assembly line making a bomb and this lawn ornament dog gets melted down to be a missile anyway, so Roger rabbit like the end scenes are when the animators talent really shines through Where you've got so many different kinds of characters from all from the golden era of a lot

696
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:37,300
Speaker 0: of them.

697
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,257
Speaker 0: I didn't even recognize some of them like.

698
00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:42,584
Speaker 0: I saw some Looking stuff.

699
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:43,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw some stuff.

700
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,217
Speaker 1: I didn't recognize like a weird cow, but there was some stuff I totally recognized like the totally hot harp.

701
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:56,120
Speaker 2: I was like He was like, yeah, it's the harp but we're like you got a thing for that heart who doesn't have a thing for the heart.

702
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:59,267
Speaker 1: Hey guys, that's who That's right.

703
00:42:59,388 --> 00:42:59,651
Speaker 2: Yep.

704
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:00,500
Speaker 2: That's that harp.

705
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,075
Speaker 0: Anyway, so currently they sell Charles Fleischer who did the voice of Roger rabbit.

706
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:08,500
Speaker 0: for many of the scenes He would just dress up in a rabbit costume.

707
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:12,831
Speaker 0: Just kind of bothering people.

708
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:14,636
Speaker 1: and you hear my joke about the heart playing with it.

709
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:15,779
Speaker 0: I'd love to see a video of that.

710
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:27,495
Speaker 2: Tell us watching the heart play with and they had like the Some really early stuff like the the trees flowers in the trees.

711
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:28,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never seen them.

712
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:30,043
Speaker 2: I've seen.

713
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:32,655
Speaker 2: I actually may not have seen it either.

714
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,808
Speaker 2: I Know I've seen tons of clips of it.

715
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,919
Speaker 2: So I recognized it, but I'm not sure if I've seen the whole thing.

716
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:54,745
Speaker 1: but yeah, it's like there's this whole big parade of like hundred probably cartoon characters and Just because they're not really in it that much and I think that's part of the reason why you know It was allowed right?

717
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,900
Speaker 1: Yeah to be in there is because like there they weren't like playing major roles.

718
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:00,559
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, you could have even almost called it fair use.

719
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,146
Speaker 1: They were in there for such a small.

720
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:05,339
Speaker 0: It was definitely homage and not anything more direct.

721
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,363
Speaker 2: Yeah Well, it's like.

722
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:19,480
Speaker 2: none of the main characters were established cartoon characters, but they were very much based in The tradition of these cartoon characters like, you know, Roger rabbit has a lot of what's his name woody the woodpecker or whatever.

723
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:28,351
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of annoying Madcap adventures sort of personality A little bit of bugs, but he doesn't have.

724
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:29,895
Speaker 2: he's a lot more wacky.

725
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:33,674
Speaker 2: He doesn't have that kind of sardonic goofiness about him.

726
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,496
Speaker 0: but There I mean it was a solid plot.

727
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:39,120
Speaker 0: It's a great movie.

728
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,171
Speaker 0: I love the opening cartoon and how it segues right into the.

729
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,420
Speaker 2: oh, yeah, and people don't realize.

730
00:44:45,022 --> 00:44:50,340
Speaker 2: One cool thing about the opening cartoon that actually killed a lot of the budget for the movie

731
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:51,105
Speaker 1: Is

732
00:44:54,646 --> 00:45:08,460
Speaker 2: If you actually look at it, it's like It's a nod to the old cartoons But it's got a lot of polish on it that an old Warner Brothers cartoon wouldn't have like those reflections in the floor and there's crazy like.

733
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,778
Speaker 0: Either loved it that they got to work on something so awesome or hated it because they had to draw like.

734
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:29,331
Speaker 1: that is like I think animators like it when they're given free rein to do Like a lot of animation in my days from many countries.

735
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:36,659
Speaker 1: and it's like, you know in terms of the stuff that is done by hand It's like I guess Akira is better than that, but not much else.

736
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:38,405
Speaker 1: Just the quality

737
00:45:38,425 --> 00:46:04,515
Speaker 2: just really showcases the potential of animation for crazy exaggeration like, you know, there's just a lot of You know crazy for shortening and squashing and stretching and all these dynamic effects which so just by showing you and reminding you this is what animation can do and then Putting these characters in the real world where these things don't necessarily apply.

738
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,020
Speaker 2: It kind of highlights the differences.

739
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:07,785
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't even know this.

740
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:08,468
Speaker 0: Mel Blanc.

741
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:08,969
Speaker 0: Actually.

742
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:10,434
Speaker 0: This was the last film he worked on.

743
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:15,838
Speaker 0: he did the voices of all his characters No kidding in the movie And then he died the next year.

744
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,485
Speaker 0: He didn't do Daffy Duck.

745
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,392
Speaker 0: Apparently that was too physically exerting to do.

746
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:20,493
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, which makes sense.

748
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:29,944
Speaker 2: I like yeah, but there's like those scenes like there was Daffy Duck and Donald Duck playing the piano back to back.

749
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:40,380
Speaker 2: that scene is brilliant and they're like bitching at each other and the Daffy's like I. I can't understand what this guy's saying, you know There's a lot of weird little scenes.

750
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,266
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

751
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:45,430
Speaker 0: I'd kind of Suddenly remembered when we watch it again like all these littlest odds were cartoon characters.

752
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:48,150
Speaker 0: They're just doing stuff in the background stuff in the background, right?

753
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:55,350
Speaker 2: And like, you know, you'll walk outside the studio and then Dumbo flies across and the best thing is he works for peanuts.

754
00:46:57,772 --> 00:46:59,349
Speaker 2: But this is pretty good.

755
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:00,700
Speaker 2: I I really do.

756
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:08,729
Speaker 2: it's not my favorite movie But I really do like that movie and it's one of those films that I get really nostalgic about kind of like.

757
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,230
Speaker 1: I think it.

758
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,568
Speaker 1: You know, I think it's sort of been kind of forgotten.

759
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:11,970
Speaker 1: ish Like.

760
00:47:11,991 --> 00:47:15,530
Speaker 1: it hasn't been completely forgotten, but it's not something that people think about often.

761
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:17,337
Speaker 1: You know, is it like?

762
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:20,850
Speaker 1: it was popular at the time popular enough to get a Nintendo game even.

763
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,650
Speaker 0: But it's the highest grossing animated film ever in the world.

764
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:34,677
Speaker 1: Yeah But then you know It's sort of faded Afterwards and it never really came back up or was reminded of or had any you know, big Merchandising or any of these.

765
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:36,063
Speaker 0: there was a lot of talk.

766
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:43,090
Speaker 1: They tried to make sequels and they all fell through Things like you know, like Aladdin we mentioned earlier right like Aladdin had a TV series at one point.

767
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,830
Speaker 0: I like three direct-to-TV DVD

768
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:49,033
Speaker 2: movies do like Like

769
00:47:49,053 --> 00:48:01,995
Speaker 1: a lot of these a lot of these other animated properties have these long tails and even you know Pretty much any huge movie sort of has a long tail to it either in the form of sequels or books or merchants or saw You know something right.

770
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:05,550
Speaker 1: these big successful properties have long tails, but Roger Rabbit had no long tail.

771
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,312
Speaker 1: Rabbit and the end Done.

772
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:10,895
Speaker 2: He's a rabbit.

773
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:11,778
Speaker 2: He has a short tail.

774
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:18,350
Speaker 1: All right, but you know, so because of that, you know I mean people remember it exists, but I mean it was from the late 80s.

775
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:26,528
Speaker 1: So a lot of people who are way younger than us never even saw it ever Right, man, even though it exists at all Yeah, and then even people, you know, if they didn't see it then they might.

776
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:32,010
Speaker 1: you might say Oh, yeah, that was that thing that was animated and also live-action and that's all they remember.

777
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:44,970
Speaker 2: Well at the same time maybe it's just the crowd I run with but I think that one people who have an interest in Like I don't know cinema history like the the famous movies over time.

778
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:53,170
Speaker 2: That's one that's remembered kind of like Star Wars is remembered for for both technical expertise and that it did something different.

779
00:48:53,832 --> 00:49:06,188
Speaker 2: I mean other movies had combined live-action and animation before but not nearly to the effect you know to the with the quality that Roger Rabbit was able to achieve.

780
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,930
Speaker 2: and Also, I think it's partly because I hang around with animators and they're always like gushing about Roger Rabbit.

781
00:49:12,192 --> 00:49:18,641
Speaker 1: So not not everybody's forgotten this film Yeah, but it's not something that your people talk about just in normal.

782
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:22,637
Speaker 0: and though I think it's having a comeback just because after I Saw the Cinemasker thing.

783
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:23,945
Speaker 0: I was like, oh I should watch this.

784
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:24,529
Speaker 0: I didn't have it.

785
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:29,910
Speaker 0: So, of course BitTorrent because it's not in the Netflix streaming and there were a ton of people seeding it.

786
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:33,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if it was due to that or just people are always seeding it.

787
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:35,229
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know.

788
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:47,894
Speaker 2: I think a lot of stuff from the 80s and early 90s is starting to come back on a nostalgia wave, you know You know, we went through.

789
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:54,080
Speaker 1: he met Ninja Turtles and Voltron rice and I were coming up to the later and soon the 90s stuff Will be come back again.

790
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:56,797
Speaker 1: Yeah Ninja Turtles is actually.

791
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:59,090
Speaker 2: I wonder if they'll have Captain Planet.

792
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:03,974
Speaker 1: That's already Really.

793
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,750
Speaker 2: that's what I remembered from my my little day.

794
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,365
Speaker 0: Well, there's the new My Little Pony's show that apparently supposedly really good.

795
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:11,650
Speaker 2: I saw part of it.

796
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,290
Speaker 2: It really reminds me of those old cartoon cartoons.

797
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:22,190
Speaker 1: It definitely does because like it's done by Craig McCracken's wife who worked on Powerpuff Girls and some other shows make sense.

798
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:24,650
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a Cartoon Network kind of thing.

799
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:28,621
Speaker 2: You know the the character designs just the general dynamic of the show.

800
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:31,709
Speaker 2: it feels like those 90s cartoons is very fun.

801
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:37,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, see if you haven't seen it You should probably go see Roger Rabbit.

802
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:41,406
Speaker 0: If you've decided to keep listening to the show and haven't seen it yet go see it.

803
00:50:41,627 --> 00:50:42,450
Speaker 0: there are worse movies.

804
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,314
Speaker 0: You could say definitely a lot worse movies.

805
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:45,817
Speaker 1: You could sing be fun.

806
00:50:46,117 --> 00:50:56,610
