1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,201
Speaker 0: It's Monday February 27th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:17,819
Speaker 0: Tonight with our new dynamic range compressor, we talk about Listile.

3
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,349
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,012
Speaker 0: So sitting here in front of me is a shiny metal blue new piece of equipment that I've been fiddling with for the last several hours.

5
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,589
Speaker 1: And he'll probably continue to fiddle with it forever and ever and ever unless I stop him.

6
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,770
Speaker 1: And if he ever stops, all I have to do is get him another box with some lights on it and some knobblies.

7
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:39,408
Speaker 0: It's got lights, and I can fiddle with it.

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:53,510
Speaker 1: I'm telling you, if they just made boxes with like a bunch of different colored LEDs and like knobs that you turned that modified the illumination of those LEDs, RIM would sit there forever just playing with those knobs.

9
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,710
Speaker 0: Well, see actually these LEDs actually do do something.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:10,270
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a compressor, and it gives me all the levels and tells me how much it's compressing the audio, and for the next two weeks at least, to vary slightly so from episode to episode as I tune.

11
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,277
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm using one of the preset values on this thing now, and I did a rudimentary leveling before I did it all.

12
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,709
Speaker 0: Scott was actually yelling at me for taking too long to do it.

13
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,350
Speaker 0: But I'll fill some more later.

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,270
Speaker 1: If anyone can tell the difference in a double-blind hearing test, I'll give you money.

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,018
Speaker 0: Well, they'll be able to tell some obvious differences.

16
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,270
Speaker 0: Like if one of us is a lot louder than the other person or anything.

17
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:38,810
Speaker 1: I meant between, like, you know, not between now and before, but between like today and tomorrow and the next day and the next day.

18
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:48,169
Speaker 0: I can think of one thing that'll probably change significantly, and that's gonna be the amount of noise, which will take me a while to hammer out.

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,829
Speaker 0: Because, I mean, we've asked so many times for audio, for feedback on the audio, how good it is.

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,270
Speaker 0: Only one person has ever actually given us any useful feedback when they said that it sounds like ass in their car.

21
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,029
Speaker 1: It sounds like ass in my car, too.

22
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,869
Speaker 0: Yep, so we discovered that it does indeed sound like ass in a car, and we knew exactly why, and that's why I got this shiny piece of equipment in front of me.

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:09,690
Speaker 0: Mmm.

24
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:15,510
Speaker 0: So, I won't talk about it anymore until eventually I do that show I keep talking about on how we do the podcast.

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,629
Speaker 1: But now I have to suffer him sitting in here going, "Ah, ah, ah,

26
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:20,709
Speaker 1: ah!".

27
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, for the last hour.

28
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,759
Speaker 1: While twiddling with knobs.

29
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,450
Speaker 0: I didn't have any good source of audio.

30
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,570
Speaker 0: I basically need a recording of myself yelling to make this easier.

31
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,730
Speaker 0: So I would sit here, and I yell into the microphone watching levels, fiddle with the knob, and then yell again.

32
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,850
Speaker 0: And Scott in the other room had to listen to that.

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,729
Speaker 1: We should have a betting pool of when he'll stop fiddling with the knobs.

34
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:45,810
Speaker 0: I'll bet on myself that within two weeks, I'll be done fiddling.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,350
Speaker 1: Then I'll just get you, and I'll just move one of the knobs, and then you'll sit there for another two weeks.

36
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see, the knobs all have numbers on them, so I could just move it back.

37
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:59,953
Speaker 1: Some of them are sort of gradual with, you know, not very... You know what?

38
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,629
Speaker 0: I'll make a mark on it with a sharpie.

39
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,789
Speaker 1: I'll erase it and move it up.

40
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,109
Speaker 0: You can't erase a sharpie mark.

41
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,129
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you can.

42
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's... you gonna get some butane?

43
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,422
Speaker 1: I've done it.

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,356
Speaker 1: Before.

45
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:26,169
Speaker 0: All right, so anyway, in the news, our good friends Diebold, you know, the people who made the cheating, broken, fake voting machines that barely work and are crappy, and Scott and I could have made a better voting machine in our spare time.

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:33,290
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, there's one thing that Diebold does very well, and that is make boxes and things that are hard to open.

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,609
Speaker 1: You know, like a box that you put an ATM machine in, or a box you put your money in.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,250
Speaker 0: I mean, the lock boxes they make, you're not gonna get into them easy, and if you do, it's tamper-evident.

49
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,089
Speaker 0: They do a good job at that.

50
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,659
Speaker 1: Yep, they make big, heavy, metal boxes with latches and locks and keys and fireproof and...

51
00:03:52,351 --> 00:04:03,790
Speaker 0: I think the problem is that they hired all these coders to write the stuff for their voting machines, but the people in charge of the companies are thinking of these things like they're still just a big, solid, lock box kind of deal.

52
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:11,279
Speaker 1: Well, they made the box really well, but they need a little voting machine to go in the box, and they hired someone to write software for a voting machine.

53
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,103
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know about you, but I can get CS1 students to write a voting program that works.

54
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,269
Speaker 1: You have two buttons.

55
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,060
Speaker 1: If you click one, one number goes up.

56
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,789
Speaker 1: If you click the other one, the other number goes up.

57
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,210
Speaker 1: And you store those numbers in memory, and then when someone types the secret code or pushes the third button, the numbers appear.

58
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,011
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what?

59
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:35,170
Speaker 0: Also, to add the paper trail, just everything cats out to, you know, a little printer somewhere, a little serial printer.

60
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:35,792
Speaker 1: Yep.

61
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,458
Speaker 0: Just with that long ribbon of paper.

62
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,422
Speaker 1: Like a little receipt printer.

63
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,105
Speaker 0: Something like that.

64
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,390
Speaker 1: And then someone reloads the paper.

65
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,863
Speaker 0: See, I'm not even CS.

66
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:42,309
Speaker 0: I'm IT.

67
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:49,370
Speaker 0: I learned in school, when I went to RIT, the language that IT people use for most of their classes was Visual Fucking Basic.

68
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,330
Speaker 0: And I could have written- Which is pretty useless.

69
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I could have written a better voting machine than D-Bolton.

70
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,430
Speaker 1: Oh, in Visual Basic, you can write a voting machine program in five minutes.

71
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,270
Speaker 1: In fact, I can teach someone who doesn't- who never programmed a computer in their lives.

72
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,838
Speaker 1: You had to have used a computer in your life, because I can't teach how to use the mouse and keyboard, but- Well, he could, but he wouldn't.

73
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,149
Speaker 0: He'd just get too pissed at you.

74
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:15,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you knew how to use a mouse and a keyboard, I could teach you to write a voting machine program in five minutes with Visual Basic.

75
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,830
Speaker 0: So we're not going to get into the whole thing about what D-Bolton did and why they're evil, but everyone knows that they're pretty much a bad company.

76
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,730
Speaker 0: There's a chance that they might have tried to rig elections, whatever.

77
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,809
Speaker 0: But the point is, our government has been kind of standing by them and using them.

78
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,329
Speaker 0: Well, a while ago, a guy named Stefan Heller, who worked for them, or worked for some- His name's Heller.

79
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,470
Speaker 0: Huh, yeah, Heller.

80
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,395
Speaker 1: That can't be bad.

81
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,722
Speaker 1: His name be- I mean, it can't be good.

82
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,365
Speaker 1: His name begins with

83
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:39,607
Speaker 1: "hell.".

84
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:41,002
Speaker 1: It's like, "bad

85
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:41,328
Speaker 1: guy.".

86
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,249
Speaker 0: That wasn't funny.

87
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,990
Speaker 1: It's like the mark of a bad guy when his name has something bad in it.

88
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,847
Speaker 1: Like, if his name was, like, Joe Satanor, it's like,

89
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,369
Speaker 1: "alright.".

90
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,655
Speaker 0: Alright, tell you what.

91
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:59,610
Speaker 0: If anyone out there listening is named Joe Satanor, I'd like you to come in and talk to us, 'cause I bet you're not a bad guy.

92
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,548
Speaker 1: Joey Jojo Shevadoo.

93
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:03,328
Speaker 0: Alright.

95
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:04,910
Speaker 1: It's a waste name, I have a hood.

96
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,630
Speaker 0: This guy, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story, because you can read the link I put on the website.

97
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:26,810
Speaker 0: And if you're not going to the website, and you haven't been to our website, I'll point out that we have links to everything we talk about, so if we talk about something and you don't know what the hell it is, or it's just we talk about it in too vague or too whatever, there's a link there that'll explain it in great detail.

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're one of those people who found us on iTunes or something, and you subscribe and you never go to the website, go there.

99
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:33,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's stuff.

100
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,168
Speaker 1: FrontRowCrew.com.

101
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:37,889
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,990
Speaker 1: You can throw a www at the beginning, that's probably a good idea.

103
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,790
Speaker 1: I don't know.

104
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,610
Speaker 1: It's not necessary, but it's good.

105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,370
Speaker 0: It's unnecessary for now, 'cause we only have one server, but someday.

106
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

107
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,989
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm gonna skip all the long story, you know, reading the article to you.

108
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:08,150
Speaker 0: But basically this dude found some documents within Diebold that basically explained that they knew their voting machines were crappy, that they weren't certified, that it was illegal to use 'em, but they were gonna use 'em anyway, and all sorts of just damning, incriminating evidence.

109
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,989
Speaker 1: Alright, now here's the thing.

110
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,690
Speaker 1: When you're a company and you do so-- alright, so you're a company.

111
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,208
Speaker 1: You decide to do something bad.

112
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,930
Speaker 1: Why do you write down that you did a bad thing on any document ever?

113
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, alright, Scott, pretend you're my secretary and I'm the high-ranking CEO.

114
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:21,550
Speaker 0: Okay.

115
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,130
Speaker 0: Uh, secretary, I'd like to take a dictation.

116
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:23,790
Speaker 0: Okay.

117
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:24,349
Speaker 0: Alright, begin.

118
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:27,164
Speaker 0: I am an evil fuck and I just stole $10,000 from the company.

119
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:29,530
Speaker 0: I then killed a baby.

120
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,670
Speaker 0: Alright, that sounds good.

121
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,290
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, print that and hide it somewhere.

122
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,250
Speaker 0: I mean, what the hell are they thinking?

123
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,187
Speaker 1: I don't know.

124
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,026
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

125
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,090
Speaker 1: I never understood this-- this, like, they had to destroy documents.

126
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,810
Speaker 1: Why did they create documents?

127
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,630
Speaker 1: Well, I mean-- And if you create a document and you did something bad, you don't write it in the document.

128
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,810
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it may be you're forced to write certain documents for accounting or something.

129
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,449
Speaker 1: Write down that you did a good thing.

130
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,368
Speaker 1: Write down that you did what you're supposed to do.

131
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:57,569
Speaker 1: Just lie.

132
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,410
Speaker 1: Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.

133
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,369
Speaker 0: Well, I guess there is precedent for this.

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:10,750
Speaker 0: I'm gonna godwin our own podcast, but if you go back to the Nazis, they wrote down the names of everyone they killed and had these nice little organized "here's everything evil we did" in order.

135
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,309
Speaker 0: Serialized, even.

136
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Nazis didn't exp-- you know, they weren't-- They didn't expect to lose.

137
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, the Nazis, they were in charge of everything that they were doing.

138
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,130
Speaker 1: There wasn't anyone really above them.

139
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,550
Speaker 1: There was no, like, world leader.

140
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,570
Speaker 1: They were expecting to become the world leader.

141
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:27,866
Speaker 1: Yeah.

142
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,649
Speaker 1: They were number two, pretty much.

143
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,350
Speaker 1: You know, well, actually, they were number one on their own, but everyone else together beat them out.

144
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:34,830
Speaker 1: Yeah.

145
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,409
Speaker 1: Kind of like the US is number one in terms of any country, but all of Europe can kick our ass together.

146
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

147
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,550
Speaker 1: So, um, you know, they didn't have-- they didn't answer to anyone.

148
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,850
Speaker 1: They weren't in fear of being caught.

149
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,750
Speaker 1: They were already shooting people.

150
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,010
Speaker 0: I got this question for you.

151
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,290
Speaker 0: If anyone who works at Diebold listens to Geek Nights.

152
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:53,448
Speaker 1: Hahaha.

153
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:53,999
Speaker 1: Lol.

154
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:54,579
Speaker 0: Yeah.

155
00:08:56,031 --> 00:09:00,630
Speaker 0: Um, you're not the Nazis, and there are people who can just come in and read all your stuff.

156
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,090
Speaker 1: And put you all in jail.

157
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but here's the problem.

158
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,489
Speaker 0: Here's why this is news, and here's why we're talking about it.

159
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,370
Speaker 0: It's not that he found these documents.

160
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:11,470
Speaker 0: I just find that amusing.

161
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,290
Speaker 0: They are now pressing charges against the dude who found these documents and gave them to the public and gave them to the police.

162
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,830
Speaker 0: Because he got them in a way that might have been illegal.

163
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,870
Speaker 1: But isn't there the whistleblower action?

164
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,323
Speaker 1: Yeah.

165
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,090
Speaker 0: Now, it's complicated because there are a whole bunch of laws to protect what are called whistleblowers.

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,990
Speaker 0: Now, these are people-- these laws were written basically for-- say you work in a factory.

167
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,768
Speaker 0: You're an auto worker.

168
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,850
Speaker 0: And there's a machine that just isn't-- like, it isn't safe and it cuts people's hands off.

169
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,730
Speaker 1: And they tell-- Wouldn't there be a lot of workers' comp cases real quick?

170
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, but say they hush it up.

171
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,510
Speaker 0: Or say, like, they know it's a dangerous situation and they just don't say anything about it.

172
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,188
Speaker 1: And no one gets hurt.

173
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:49,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

174
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,090
Speaker 0: Because if someone got hurt, obviously everyone would know about it.

175
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,310
Speaker 0: But say it's illegal.

176
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,370
Speaker 0: Like, it's an illegal machine.

177
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,430
Speaker 0: And it's obviously illegal.

178
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,130
Speaker 0: It doesn't meet OSHA.

179
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,189
Speaker 0: It's a dangerous piece of shit.

180
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:08,206
Speaker 0: And you go to the feds or whoever, whatever, you know, OSHA, let's say, and you tell them, "Hey, Ford or GM or whatever company I work for is doing something dangerous and evil right

181
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:08,487
Speaker 0: there.".

182
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,670
Speaker 0: Now, these laws protect you from being fired or otherwise harassed by the company you're blowing the whistle on.

183
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,469
Speaker 0: Hence, a whistleblower law.

184
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,810
Speaker 1: You know, if I did that, I probably wouldn't want to work for that company anymore.

185
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,784
Speaker 1: Or I'd quit and then blow the whistle and quit.

186
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,910
Speaker 0: But let's say the company, like, blacklists you for other companies.

187
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,930
Speaker 0: Or they do some sort of, you know, they try to kill your family, I guess.

188
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,324
Speaker 0: I don't know.

189
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:31,768
Speaker 0: Anything they try to do to you.

190
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:35,010
Speaker 0: Or say they try to sue you for defamation or something.

191
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,149
Speaker 0: These whistleblower laws can help protect you.

192
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,650
Speaker 0: Now, it's a gray area with this guy because he got the documents in an illegal way, technically.

193
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:54,889
Speaker 0: But he had the documents, and even though he wasn't allowed to disclose them, he decided to for the greater good because the documents document an evil that was done.

194
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,104
Speaker 1: Does he have good lawyers?

195
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:57,490
Speaker 1: He better.

196
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,610
Speaker 0: All I know is that we'll follow up on this because on April 24th, which isn't that far away, he's going to have the first hearing.

197
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,546
Speaker 1: Now, if he gets-- I'm sure that there are plenty of lawyers who are awesome who are going to go, "We'll help you for free because

198
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:10,646
Speaker 1: fair.".

199
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:12,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope so.

200
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:25,050
Speaker 0: Though the thing is, Diebold got screwed over the documents he released, and worst case scenario, say they throw the book at him as hard as they can, he's only up for three years, eight months at most.

201
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,374
Speaker 0: So, I mean, that would suck.

202
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:33,801
Speaker 0: I'm not going to pretend that a few years in prison is some trifle or something just to be laughed at, but it's not being shot.

203
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,290
Speaker 0: It's not being thrown in jail forever.

204
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:48,650
Speaker 0: If that's the worst Diebold can do to him, and he basically shed light on this huge, horrible conspiracy/evil, I have a lot of respect for this dude, and if he goes to jail, I'll be kind of mad.

205
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, that always sucks.

206
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,749
Speaker 1: Try to do good, and you get the stick, and the guy's doing bad, they go, "Wee hee

207
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:56,890
Speaker 1: hee!".

208
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,014
Speaker 0: See, that's the world today.

209
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:01,630
Speaker 0: There's a stick just waiting to fall on us anytime we try to do anything.

210
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:05,430
Speaker 0: The man's standing there with the stick, and he's keeping us off his lawn.

211
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,350
Speaker 1: We gotta set fire to his lawn.

212
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:22,690
Speaker 1: A few weeks ago, maybe days ago, I don't know, I wasn't paying attention, but this link appeared to something called origami, which is usually the art of folding paper into cool shapes.

213
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,910
Speaker 0: The thing that we're going to talk about, I'd heard of, but I didn't connect that it was called origami.

214
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:35,416
Speaker 0: I just knew that something like this was coming out, so Scott asked me right before the show, "Hey, want to do the origami

215
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:35,737
Speaker 0: thing?".

216
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:36,962
Speaker 0: and I asked, "What?

217
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:38,428
Speaker 0: What the hell are you talking

218
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:38,649
Speaker 0: about?".

219
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:48,510
Speaker 1: So it was this website that was really sort of vague about what it was referring to, but somehow, people seemed to get the idea that it was about something really important.

220
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,306
Speaker 1: I have the idea that people from origami, or working with origami...

221
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,670
Speaker 0: Wow, we're really dancing around actually saying what it is.

222
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, we are.

223
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:03,129
Speaker 1: That's because I'm trying to give people the feeling of what it was like to see it come out, because they were really dancing around what it was.

224
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, because once I saw a picture of it, the moment I saw a picture and it all clicked together, I thought, "Wow, that's actually kind of

225
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:10,126
Speaker 0: cool.".

226
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,297
Speaker 1: So, basically, it came out onto the net.

227
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:19,784
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure, on purpose, they marketed it in an underground fashion on purpose.

228
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:28,189
Speaker 1: So it looked like bloggers were discovering it, but really, the people were promoting it.

229
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,709
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was pretty much first, it was origami, ooh.

230
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,250
Speaker 1: Then it was, it's Microsoft.

231
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,176
Speaker 0: Gabbo!

232
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:36,783
Speaker 0: Gabbo!

233
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:37,228
Speaker 0: Gabbo!

234
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,620
Speaker 1: Ooh, so now everyone's like, "Microsoft?

235
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,543
Speaker 1: Origami?

236
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,908
Speaker 1: Hmm, what could it

237
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,088
Speaker 1: be?".

238
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,689
Speaker 0: They've got a patent on paper, I'm telling you.

239
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, so people knew that Microsoft was going to compete with the iPod.

240
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:54,864
Speaker 1: They were like, "Okay, maybe that's what this

241
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:55,085
Speaker 1: is.".

242
00:13:56,492 --> 00:14:02,570
Speaker 1: And now, what it's looking like right now is, number one, Microsoft is going to do something tomorrow.

243
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,094
Speaker 1: For sure.

244
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,930
Speaker 1: They're making some sort of announcement.

245
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,791
Speaker 0: All right.

246
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:09,790
Speaker 0: Well, I guess they're at least going to continue being a monopoly.

247
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,094
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

248
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:14,630
Speaker 1: If you didn't know, Apple is also making an announcement tomorrow.

249
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,393
Speaker 1: Ooh.

250
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:19,689
Speaker 0: See, I'm more interested in the Apple one.

251
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:26,109
Speaker 0: Even though, I mean, you know, for all the You Heroes, me and Scott arguing, I'm real cynical about gadgets that come out.

252
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,468
Speaker 0: Like, I see the new iPod or whatever, and I think, "Wow, that's cool, but screw that, I don't want

253
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:31,549
Speaker 0: it.".

254
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,210
Speaker 0: But I still think it's cool, so don't get me wrong.

255
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,729
Speaker 0: I'm excited about what Apple's going to announce, but I'm probably not going to buy whatever it is.

256
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,301
Speaker 1: Anyway, so everyone is like,

257
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:40,442
Speaker 1: "Ooh.".

258
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:49,170
Speaker 1: But the latest thing going around the net, and I haven't read enough to be 100% sure, is there's this device.

259
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:54,570
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's bigger than a PSP, but it didn't seem too thick.

260
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,750
Speaker 1: And the whole thing is like a screen, but there's like a few buttons on the side.

261
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,750
Speaker 1: And I think it's a touchscreen.

262
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:06,849
Speaker 1: And it's a Microsoft device, and it seems to, it's not running Windows CE.

263
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,089
Speaker 1: If it's running Windows CE, it's running like a really, really powerful Windows CE.

264
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,529
Speaker 1: Like, holy crap.

265
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,426
Speaker 1: Because apparently it can do MP3s, and play freaking Halo, and be a PDA, and play videos.

266
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,550
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be freaking everything.

267
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,038
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's basically a handheld device.

268
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,230
Speaker 0: that's kind of between a PSP and a small laptop.

269
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:35,650
Speaker 1: It's like between a PSP and a tablet PC.

270
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,665
Speaker 1: Think of a tablet PC only weak, but not like the OQO.

271
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,549
Speaker 1: Bigger than that, and not as sucky.

272
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:48,890
Speaker 0: Now the main thing that got me was that the price point looks like it's going to be significantly under $1,000.

273
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,910
Speaker 1: Significantly under $1,000.

274
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,018
Speaker 0: Like they said, $600 to $800 I saw on one site.

275
00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:01,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you've seen the Nokia something 700 or whatever, it's like this Linux tablet thing that's meant for your living room.

276
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,930
Speaker 1: Like you can browse the web on it, and you can IM on it, and it has a touchscreen, and Nokia makes it.

277
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,010
Speaker 1: The people who make those cellphones.

278
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, we kind of want one to be like a semi-remote control, but that's us.

279
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:18,930
Speaker 1: Well actually, there's another device I forgot the name of, but I've seen it and used it, that's actually better.

280
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,029
Speaker 1: It's a living room Linux thing.

281
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,901
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know why it can't come to mind.

282
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,690
Speaker 1: I had like a little postcard with an ad board.

283
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've brought it up like three or four times in the past when I'd complain about the wireless keyboard downstairs, and you'd say, "Oh, let's just get a

284
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:31,988
Speaker 0: blah.".

285
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the problem is that thing's overpriced.

286
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,431
Speaker 1: If it was like $500, I would get it, but it's like $800.

287
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:42,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, now this thing is $600 to $800, but it has many more functions other than just that.

288
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could like replace, it's just, I don't know, we'll see what happens.

289
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,948
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it's going to be loaded with mad DRM's.

290
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we'll see if it's loaded with mad crackzzz too.

291
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:14,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, so keep your eyes wide open for something called Origami from Microsoft, because it might be something that, you know, pushes out the PSP and the iPod a little bit, and possibly even like start pushing on things like trios and, you know, sidekicks and whatnot.

292
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:21,010
Speaker 0: I mean, it definitely completes, it competes with the PSP, I'm pretty sure, because the PSP is not a gaming system anymore.

293
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,709
Speaker 0: It's basically an MP3 player and a movie watcher.

294
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,210
Speaker 1: Don't forget ROM player.

295
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:25,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, ROM player.

296
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,410
Speaker 1: Number one function, it's a ROM player.

297
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,770
Speaker 0: Now, yeah, ROM player, I mean, I'm really thinking of getting a PSP once they get cheaper, because I want a ROM player that's portable.

298
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,530
Speaker 1: I think that by the time the PSP is cheap enough to be a ROM player.

299
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,429
Speaker 0: There'll be a ROM player.

300
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:39,910
Speaker 1: The DS will be a ROM player.

301
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,870
Speaker 1: Or you can just buy a ROM player, like a bootleg Chinese thing full of ROMs.

302
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, that should exist, and if it doesn't, it will soon.

303
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:49,288
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it does.

304
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,410
Speaker 1: If it doesn't, let's make it and import it illegally.

305
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,259
Speaker 0: So, things of the day.

306
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,159
Speaker 0: Now, this isn't the newest thing, because I saw it earlier, but I know that it happened recently, so it can't have been on the internet that long.

307
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,540
Speaker 0: But, Biscuit City.

308
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,120
Speaker 0: Someone in London, I think it was a Chinese guy, made a small city, little model of a city, almost entirely out of biscuits.

309
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,520
Speaker 0: And by biscuits, I used the British, so really, you know, like little crackers and cookie type things.

310
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,799
Speaker 1: All different kinds.

311
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,799
Speaker 1: As opposed to gingerbread and frosting.

312
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:28,659
Speaker 1: And candy.

313
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,679
Speaker 0: So he basically made a Biscuit City.

314
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:35,020
Speaker 0: I saw some jelly beans in there, I think he used them as water, because they were blue or whatever.

315
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,260
Speaker 0: But, it's kind of cool.

316
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:43,099
Speaker 0: And the coolest thing was, a bunch of people then came in and were allowed to eat the city, since it was entirely edible, being biscuit.

317
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,791
Speaker 1: Wouldn't you want to keep the city?

318
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:45,074
Speaker 1: I mean...

319
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,774
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's made of biscuit.

320
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:47,220
Speaker 0: It would rot.

321
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:50,179
Speaker 1: But usually when you make a gingerbread house, you don't eat it.

322
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,320
Speaker 0: Ah, I eat gingerbread houses.

323
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,498
Speaker 1: I mean, you make a little one and you eat it, but usually people make them and then they...

324
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:57,648
Speaker 0: That's stupid!

325
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,900
Speaker 0: Then why make a gingerbread house?

326
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:04,680
Speaker 1: I remember in elementary school, we would make gingerbread houses, and then we never ate them.

327
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,960
Speaker 1: They always went somewhere, they sat around the room and then they did something with them.

328
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd make one and sit around the room for like a week, and then I'd eat it.

329
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,260
Speaker 1: I don't remember ever eating the gingerbread houses.

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,820
Speaker 1: Although, while we made the gingerbread houses, I partook of much gingerbread... Well, graham crackers and frosting.

331
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,640
Speaker 1: Because it was weird, they always called them gingerbread houses, but you never made them out of gingerbread.

332
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:26,239
Speaker 0: I did.

333
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,279
Speaker 1: You made them out of graham crackers and frosting.

334
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,840
Speaker 0: Though the funniest thing is, I don't know why the article went into this much detail.

336
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:37,620
Speaker 0: But then it talked about how they're providing tea to anyone who wants to eat the biscuit city.

337
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,877
Speaker 0: But they said, and they said specifically in the article, "But we don't know what kind of tea they're going to

338
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:44,239
Speaker 0: offer.".

339
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,639
Speaker 0: Like, that's a big deal.

340
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,545
Speaker 1: It's British.

341
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:48,600
Speaker 1: What do you expect?

342
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,640
Speaker 1: In Britain, the tea is important.

343
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,820
Speaker 1: So, um, I don't know how many of you out there are super smart scientists.

344
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:00,078
Speaker 0: Well, we know at least three of you are.

345
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:04,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think they're quantum physicists-ists.

346
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:11,660
Speaker 0: No, but quantum theory at least is, I mean, I'm not going to claim that I'm an expert by any stretch, but I know a decent bit about it.

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,480
Speaker 0: I know more about it than I do about viruses.

348
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,519
Speaker 1: I think there was this great quote I heard once.

349
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:19,300
Speaker 0: Anyone who claims to understand quantum physics doesn't.

350
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,340
Speaker 1: It was something along those lines.

351
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:28,700
Speaker 1: Like, you know, it was pretty much like no one who claims to understand quantum physics does.

352
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,060
Speaker 1: And, you know, anyone who does doesn't claim.

353
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,140
Speaker 1: It was some paradoxical two-sentence thing that pretty much amounted to no one freaking understands quantum physics.

354
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it really doesn't make a lot of sense.

355
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,482
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:46,660
Speaker 1: So, um, there is one thing about quantum physics that's pretty much like the fundamental experiment.

357
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,180
Speaker 1: The same way that, like, you know, the apple falling in Isaac Newton's head is the fundamental experiment of gravity.

358
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:05,540
Speaker 1: And Galileo throwing a bowling ball and, like, a pebble out the window of his tower is the fundamental- It's the diffraction grating experiment that shows that electrons behave in strange ways.

359
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

360
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:22,899
Speaker 1: So I found, by random chance, not minutes ago, this CG video, it's completely computer-generated, of this crazy CG scientist explaining to you this experiment with a very good and graphical demonstration of it.

361
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,016
Speaker 1: So, if, you know, what happens often is people will say, "Ooh, this is something quantum!

362
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:29,819
Speaker 1: Bleh!".

363
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,620
Speaker 1: And they just tell you something's quantum and you believe it because you don't understand it for crap.

364
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:39,880
Speaker 1: If you watch this, maybe you'll have a better idea of what quantum physics is about.

365
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:46,977
Speaker 1: And when people start talking about quantum crap, if they're just making, you know, bullshit up, you'll be like, "Hey, you're just making bullshit

366
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:47,137
Speaker 1: up.".

367
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,886
Speaker 0: Because quantum theory is mostly math.

368
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:55,637
Speaker 0: A lot of people like to say things like, "Oh, I understand the theory of quantum blah blah blah.

369
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:56,659
Speaker 0: I just don't know the

370
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,020
Speaker 0: math.".

371
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,814
Speaker 0: Or, "I like all the theory of physics, but I don't like the

372
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:00,136
Speaker 0: math.".

373
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:01,989
Speaker 0: It is the math.

374
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:03,279
Speaker 0: The math is all that matters.

375
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,268
Speaker 1: Well, it's really that a lot of quantum physics you can't really do.

376
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,520
Speaker 1: You just work with numbers and then stuff seems to work out in the numbers and then somehow it matches something.

377
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,300
Speaker 0: And then other people can do, but the do is very not... You'd think it'd be interesting to watch, like, a video of scientists doing, like, you know, particle accelerators slam two things together and look at what comes out.

378
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,081
Speaker 0: No.

379
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:27,607
Speaker 0: No, it's not interesting.

380
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:31,240
Speaker 0: I did a tour of a particle accelerator at a university a long time ago in high school.

381
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:37,600
Speaker 0: It was cool when they talked about it, but then they showed it to us and the guy went, "Click," and we heard a noise.

382
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,488
Speaker 0: And then he said, "That was it.

383
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,357
Speaker 0: Now we spend the next eight hours analyzing the data.

384
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:47,059
Speaker 0: Are there any

385
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:47,340
Speaker 0: questions?".

386
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:49,281
Speaker 1: Yup.

387
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,166
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how it goes.

388
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:55,697
Speaker 1: So here's a video with a crazy scientist and at least the CG guy will entertain you.

389
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:56,860
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

390
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,353
Speaker 0: So, moving on to the main bit.

391
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:00,460
Speaker 0: ListAll.

392
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,573
Speaker 1: Alright, so, this is a thing called ListAll.

393
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,376
Speaker 1: L-I-S-T-A-L.

394
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,968
Speaker 0: Not L-I-S-T-A-L-L.

395
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,880
Speaker 0: That will get you a whole bunch of spam crap.

396
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, www.listall.com.

397
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:23,920
Speaker 1: I want to talk about it because I've been using it for a long time and there are not many things that I end up using for quite as long as I use ListAll, so I figure it's worth talking about.

398
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,382
Speaker 0: I'd say so.

399
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:29,050
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't use it, but I've watched you use it and it's at least interesting.

400
00:23:29,752 --> 00:23:33,100
Speaker 0: And depending on how it goes, I may eventually jump on board.

401
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm going to tell you about all these new features that are reasons that you want to use it.

402
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,200
Speaker 0: So how new are these features?

403
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,625
Speaker 1: This is what this episode is going to be.

404
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:43,060
Speaker 1: If I can convince Rim to use ListAll, that it's somehow useful to him.

405
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:51,353
Speaker 0: Basically, if he is not successful in convincing me to use it, that does not mean that you shouldn't.

406
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:55,120
Speaker 0: Because it is hard as hell to convince me to do just about anything.

407
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, because remember, Rim just doesn't care.

408
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still working on that song.

409
00:23:59,247 --> 00:23:59,790
Speaker 0: There's going to be the.

410
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,800
Speaker 0: Rim Doesn't Give a Shit song any week now.

411
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,700
Speaker 1: And if anyone can send us a Rim Doesn't Give a Shit song before we make one, we'll compensate you.

412
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:08,678
Speaker 0: I won't give a shit.

413
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,849
Speaker 1: So, anyway, you know, nowadays there's all kinds of websites that do all sorts of things.

414
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:23,340
Speaker 1: You know, Flickr does your photos, and Gmail does your mail, and, you know, the bloglines does your feed reading.

415
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,847
Speaker 1: ListAll manages your stuff.

416
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,440
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of people like to make databases of, like, their stuff.

417
00:24:30,982 --> 00:24:36,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, our friend Scott Johnson, way back, always made a database of all the comics he had, and all the comics he needed.

418
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,558
Speaker 0: That way, he could just have a little list when he went to conventions, and go through the backorder bins like "blup, blup, blup, blup, blup, I need this

419
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:42,799
Speaker 0: one.".

420
00:24:43,301 --> 00:24:45,380
Speaker 1: Yep, and then he would check things off and whatever.

421
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,920
Speaker 0: Well, more manga than comics, but yeah, it doesn't matter.

422
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, ListAll can't help you with your comic books, but it can help you with your DVDs.

423
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:58,076
Speaker 1: That's a problem, because it doesn't do VHS, and it doesn't do anything else.

424
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:58,820
Speaker 1: It does DVDs.

425
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,362
Speaker 1: Your books.

426
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:05,200
Speaker 1: This is anything with an ISBN number that is, you know, pretty much anywhere.

427
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:06,679
Speaker 1: It's books, books, books.

428
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:07,923
Speaker 1: Music.

429
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:11,540
Speaker 1: Pretty much music really only encompasses CDs.

430
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:13,940
Speaker 0: Great, because we own so many CDs.

431
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,490
Speaker 1: I actually don't use the music portion.

432
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,980
Speaker 1: I have exactly one thing in the music portion.

433
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:25,298
Speaker 0: Thing is, we don't need a music portion, because I have ID3s and a giant file system full of MP3s.

434
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,220
Speaker 1: And the last thing it lets you keep track of is your video games, which is very, very useful.

435
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,833
Speaker 1: So, what ListAll does is you go into it, and you just enter into it, "I own this DVD.

436
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:39,855
Speaker 1: I own that DVD.

437
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:40,837
Speaker 1: I own that DVD.

438
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:41,839
Speaker 1: I own this DVD.

439
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaker 1: I own this

440
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,380
Speaker 1: book.".

441
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:49,520
Speaker 1: And you can enter things in by ISBN number, by Amazon ID, after you make an account, of course.

442
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,159
Speaker 0: I'll bet if you had a barcode scanner, it'd make it real easy.

443
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,920
Speaker 1: Maybe if the barcodes read out the ISBN numbers instead of some SKUs.

444
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, even SKUs can usually be used to correlate in some way.

445
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,740
Speaker 1: It's actually sort of tedious to enter in all the stuff, you know, into ListAll in the first place.

446
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:14,360
Speaker 1: Like, it took me a couple hours to enter in all the books I had in my room, you know?

447
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,560
Speaker 1: And then, like, I had to keep-- and then, like, I would try to enter in all the DVDs I had, but I had to keep going downstairs to look at them, because I forgot what I had.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
Speaker 1: But anyway, eventually, you put-- let's say-- let's just concentrate on the books, because that's what I use the most of.

449
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,851
Speaker 1: It's the same for DVDs, music, and games.

450
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:30,660
Speaker 1: You know, there's really no difference.

451
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,173
Speaker 1: There's just the four-- there's just four categories.

452
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,240
Speaker 1: they separate your stuff into.

453
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:42,140
Speaker 1: So in ListAll, you enter in every book you own, and you have a list of every book you own with a nice little picture and everything.

454
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,275
Speaker 1: And it tells you who the author is.

455
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,300
Speaker 1: Then, you can rate everything you own on a scale of zero-- which means you didn't rate it yet-- to ten stars.

456
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,240
Speaker 1: So now, not only do you have a list of everything you own, you have a list of everything you own with a ranking.

457
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:04,939
Speaker 1: So then you can sort it, showing, like, put my favorite stuff on top, or show me the crap that I own so I know what to get rid of.

458
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,759
Speaker 1: You know, all that sort of thing.

459
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,740
Speaker 1: Then, you can tag stuff.

460
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,966
Speaker 1: So, manga are books.

461
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:15,280
Speaker 1: I mostly use-- you track, like, manga and trade paperbacks.

462
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,120
Speaker 1: You can't use it for comic books, because they don't have ISBN numbers.

463
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:22,680
Speaker 1: But you can use it for the, you know, collections of comic books and trades, because those are books.

464
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:27,619
Speaker 1: And you tag it, so I tag all my manga with a manga tag.

465
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:32,798
Speaker 1: So, then, whenever I want to see a list of all my manga, I just say, "Show me all my

466
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,139
Speaker 1: manga!".

467
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:34,899
Speaker 1: And it makes a list of my manga.

468
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,477
Speaker 1: And you can sort things by the date you added, so, "Show me my recent

469
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:39,698
Speaker 1: stuff."

470
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,532
Speaker 1: Or, "Show me my favorite

471
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:41,835
Speaker 1: manga.".

472
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,280
Speaker 1: Now, this is sort of useful.

473
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:49,480
Speaker 1: And, you know, I guess some people would be happy with just that.

474
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:51,699
Speaker 1: But that's not quite enough.

475
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,080
Speaker 1: So the next thing Listal does is it lets you have a wanted list.

476
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:59,598
Speaker 1: You go in and you say, "I don't own that, but I want

477
00:27:59,618 --> 00:27:59,658
Speaker 1: it.".

478
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,694
Speaker 1: You say, "I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want

479
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:01,774
Speaker 1: it.".

480
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:07,120
Speaker 1: So now, for DVDs, books, music, and games, you have an owned list and a wanted list.

481
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,840
Speaker 1: And, in the wanted list, you can also rate things on a scale of 1 to 10 stars and tag things and the whole shebang.

482
00:28:15,622 --> 00:28:16,398
Speaker 1: It's just a separate list.

483
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:29,799
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to mention, you can also, in addition to ranking things from 1 to 10 stars, you can say, you know, for books, you can say, "I read the book, I didn't read the book, or I'm currently reading the

484
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:29,940
Speaker 1: book.".

485
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,739
Speaker 1: It's sort of useful.

486
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,406
Speaker 0: Nah.

487
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,235
Speaker 1: That's why you can say, "Show me my unread

488
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:35,577
Speaker 1: books."

489
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,158
Speaker 1: And you get a list of the books you haven't read yet, and you're like, "Oh, okay, which one am I gonna read

490
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:40,419
Speaker 1: first?".

491
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,938
Speaker 0: I'll admit, that is more efficient than my current method of, "There's a pile of books next to my bed, and I'm reading the one on

492
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:46,239
Speaker 0: top.".

493
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:46,879
Speaker 1: Yeah.

494
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:50,500
Speaker 1: So, here's, I'm gonna get to the useful stuff now.

495
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Speaker 1: So, currently ListAll is a database, DVDs, books, music, and games.

496
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:02,200
Speaker 0: Alright, so, so far, in the tally of RIM, uh, it's very interesting, I think it's cool, I think anyone who uses it is pretty cool, but I don't see any reason for me to use it yet.

497
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:02,900
Speaker 1: Okay, ready?

498
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:03,519
Speaker 1: Alright.

499
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,079
Speaker 1: Let's start getting into the good stuff.

500
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:06,258
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

501
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,567
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:12,319
Speaker 1: ListAll, you can, alright, so my account name is A-P-R-E-C-H-E.

503
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:14,538
Speaker 0: Any of you- And how do you say that?

504
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:15,559
Speaker 1: No one knows.

505
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,955
Speaker 1: You can go to A-P-R-E-C-H-E dot.

506
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:19,800
Speaker 1: ListAll dot com.

507
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:20,719
Speaker 1: Go there right now.

508
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,220
Speaker 1: I know you're near a computer, probably.

509
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:22,776
Speaker 1: I don't know.

510
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:23,555
Speaker 1: You might be.

511
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,619
Speaker 1: And you'll see my stuff.

512
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,260
Speaker 1: So now, other people can look at my wanted list, and they can look at the stuff I own, and they can see what I think about it.

513
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,200
Speaker 0: Alright, point the first.

514
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,460
Speaker 0: What if you have a lot of porno or something horrible that you want to put in there, but you don't want other people to see it?

515
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,460
Speaker 0: Can you make something private?

516
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,740
Speaker 1: You know, I've never even thought about that, but you might be able to, and if not, uh, I'll go ask about that.

517
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:48,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just curious.

518
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:50,359
Speaker 0: It's not a make-or-breaker on this.

519
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, um, if you have a bunch of porno, you should be showing off that collection, yo.

520
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:56,160
Speaker 0: Like our friend Dave.

521
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, you- You got- Alright, should we tell the porno story or save that for a story day?

522
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,340
Speaker 1: We can tell it after I'm done talking about ListAll.

523
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,479
Speaker 0: Eh, let's save it for another day.

524
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:06,659
Speaker 1: Do whatever you want.

525
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:06,978
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can show it to your friends.

527
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,600
Speaker 1: That's useful.

528
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:14,080
Speaker 1: Now, what if your friends join ListAll?

529
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,392
Speaker 1: Well, now you have a whole 'nother?

530
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:17,759
Speaker 1: load of stuff coming in on you.

531
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:26,840
Speaker 1: You can use ListAll to keep track of what you've loaned to your other ListAll friends and what you've borrowed from your other ListAll friends.

532
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:35,220
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa, alright, I gotta say, the meter was zero, it's at one now, toward me using this.

533
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,340
Speaker 0: Because I can't describe to you the hundreds and hundreds of dollars of books I've lost 'cause I freaking lent it to someone and I forget I even owned it.

534
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,186
Speaker 1: You can also go and look at your friends and say, "Hey, he's got that book that I wanna borrow.

535
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,229
Speaker 1: Request that I can borrow it from

536
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:49,389
Speaker 1: him.".

537
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,168
Speaker 1: And I can say, "Oh, but someone else is currently borrowing it from them.

538
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:02,895
Speaker 1: And three other people requested to borrow it from them.

539
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,358
Speaker 1: I guess I'm low on the list

540
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:04,819
Speaker 1: waiting.".

541
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,980
Speaker 0: I guess I'd better buy it and then lend it to other people.

542
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,180
Speaker 1: You know, but you put it in your wanted list and maybe someone will notice and buy it for you on your birthday.

543
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:20,080
Speaker 1: So it's really, if all you and all your friends use ListAll and recognize each other as friends, now you're getting into the good stuff.

544
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:21,420
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's a question.

545
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:23,406
Speaker 0: I use Netflix.

546
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:26,200
Speaker 0: I mean, we both use Netflix, but I own the account.

547
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,760
Speaker 0: And I'm the one who sets up the list and I see all our friends.

548
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:38,760
Speaker 0: And by the way, anyone who wants to be a Netflix friend with Geek Nights, our house, just send us an email and I'll set all that up offline.

549
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,560
Speaker 0: Because actually a lot of our friends who are doing this with us are seeing awesome movies because we see 'em.

550
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,620
Speaker 0: But anyway, Netflix has two things going for it.

551
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,240
Speaker 0: It has the first thing kind of like just now where it'll show you what all your friends are watching, you can see all your friends have all rated things.

552
00:31:53,101 --> 00:32:01,440
Speaker 0: More importantly, based on what I've seen and what I claim to like, and based on the data it has, it recommends other things that I might like.

553
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,288
Speaker 1: Alright, alright, there is something like that.

554
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:06,980
Speaker 1: It's not quite as automatic and awesome as Netflix.

555
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,459
Speaker 1: They might be working on something quite like that, but here's what you can do.

556
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,151
Speaker 1: If you don't have an item, there are plenty of items.

557
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:17,740
Speaker 1: This thing pretty much categorizes everything from Amazon.

558
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,448
Speaker 1: It gets most of its data from Amazon.

559
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,240
Speaker 1: So that's pretty much a whole shit ton of data.

560
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,561
Speaker 1: Now if you don't have something in your collection or your wanted list, you can't rate it on a scale of 1 to 10.

561
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:33,739
Speaker 1: But you can tag it, or at least you can look at the other things people have tagged it as.

562
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,806
Speaker 1: And you can recommend it to a friend.

563
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:43,446
Speaker 1: So you can say, you can go looking around for books that you neither own nor want and say, "Oh, Joe might like this.

564
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:47,078
Speaker 1: Let me recommend this book that I just found to Joey Jojo

565
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,439
Speaker 1: Shavadou.".

566
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:53,880
Speaker 0: Alright, that's kind of cool, because actually I've recommended a movie called City of God to almost everyone on my list and they've all loved it.

567
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:02,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, so even if you don't own it or want it, you can go in and recommend it and, you know, send it to people and say, "Hey, you might like

568
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:02,324
Speaker 1: this.".

569
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,120
Speaker 1: You can also review and comment on just about anything.

570
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:15,984
Speaker 1: So if you see a book and you want to say something about it, in addition to tagging it and recommending it to people or not recommending it to people, you can write a little review of it.

571
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:22,219
Speaker 1: So if something sucks, there really is no option to do an anti-recommendation or a warning, "Don't read

572
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:22,420
Speaker 1: this.".

573
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:23,399
Speaker 0: They should add that.

574
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can do a review saying this and you can rate it in the review.

575
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,921
Speaker 0: You know what?

576
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:34,440
Speaker 0: That's another plus one for me using this, because I'm going to say that I own the Penny Arcade Card Game and then say exactly...

577
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,989
Speaker 1: The Penny Arcade Card Game isn't in here.

578
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:37,620
Speaker 1: It's not a book, DVD, music, or game.

579
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,640
Speaker 0: But it has an SKU and a serial number.

580
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,979
Speaker 1: It doesn't have an ISBN number.

581
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,560
Speaker 1: It only does DVDs, books, music, and games.

582
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,580
Speaker 0: It's got to do more.

583
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,715
Speaker 1: I've asked for VHS, I've asked for comic books, I've asked for board games.

584
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:50,940
Speaker 1: I can't get those.

585
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,020
Speaker 0: I really want board games and... I want games in general.

586
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, games is only video games, but it pretty much covers... I haven't been able to not find... Okay, no.

587
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:02,848
Speaker 1: Actually, it doesn't have old, old video games.

588
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:07,739
Speaker 1: It has Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy DS...

589
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,460
Speaker 0: Anything I could have bought on Amazon at some point.

590
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:14,940
Speaker 0: You could never buy old NES games on Amazon back in the day, because it didn't exist.

591
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,520
Speaker 1: Anything that Amazon has ever sold, I think, is in there.

592
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,699
Speaker 1: So you got your... I think it has... It doesn't have Super Nintendo, I don't think.

593
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,940
Speaker 1: I think it has N64, PlayStation, and that stuff, and newer.

594
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:25,831
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

595
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:27,458
Speaker 1: That's what's in there.

596
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:33,938
Speaker 1: So, yeah, and there's really no way to add in your own stuff, because that would just screw everything up.

597
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:35,739
Speaker 1: So, whatever.

598
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Speaker 1: You also can't add, like, vinyl records and cassette tapes and VHS, which is... and 8-tracks, which is something that I kind of wanted.

599
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,850
Speaker 1: I also have a problem.

600
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:44,719
Speaker 1: I have a book with no...

601
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,040
Speaker 0: What about my gramophone?

602
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a book with no ISBN number on it, and I can't add it to my own list.

603
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,956
Speaker 1: What book?

604
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,190
Speaker 1: It's a really old book.

605
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,059
Speaker 1: I bought it at a used bookstore.

606
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,230
Speaker 0: Huh, I got some old books.

607
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,299
Speaker 0: I'll have to see if they're in there.

608
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:00,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, this book is real old, like, real tattered and everything.

609
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,180
Speaker 1: So... But, okay, now, you can review anything and rank anything, and you can even invite friends to join ListAll.

610
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,020
Speaker 1: You can just go into ListAll and type in email addresses, and it'll send, you know, things to people.

611
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,898
Speaker 1: Now, here's... there's two more features of ListAll that are new.

612
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,500
Speaker 1: The thing they just added, at least as far as I know, is the Groups feature.

613
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:29,420
Speaker 1: I am in the Comics and Manga group, so anyone who enjoys Comics and Manga, whether they're your friend or not, can join any group they want.

614
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:37,079
Speaker 1: So you join the Comics and Manga group, and the Comics and Manga group, it says who started it, when it was started, how many members there are, et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:45,400
Speaker 1: And there's a forum for each group, so you can talk to other people on ListAll who are in the same group, in a little forum, which is a pretty good forum.

616
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:51,540
Speaker 1: And, you can recommend things to the group, and get recommendations from the group.

617
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:02,680
Speaker 1: So, you join groups based on what your general interests are, and then all the people on ListAll who are in those groups are all recommending things to you, and you're recommending things to them.

618
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,919
Speaker 1: So, if your friends aren't really recommending a whole lot, you know, you all join the same group, and then, "Oh, look at all this stuff in here that other people say is

619
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:11,199
Speaker 1: good.".

620
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:11,935
Speaker 0: Aha!

621
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,125
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, let's look at the Comics and Manga

622
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:14,306
Speaker 1: group.".

623
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:18,700
Speaker 1: Let's see, Watchmen is recommended, Lupin III is recommended.

624
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:27,560
Speaker 1: Let's see, I re- I'm already- I already have or have read one, two, three, four out of the seven recommendations in here.

625
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,520
Speaker 1: There just aren't a lot of people in the group, that's why there aren't.

626
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, though I gotta say, that was the one thing that made me realize that Netflix's recommending thing was so good, was simply that I put- I started rating movies that I'd watched, and every time I refreshed the page, it recommended basically five movies that I'd already seen and loved, and every time I rated those and refreshed the page, it showed me five more movies that I'd already seen and loved.

627
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:58,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's part of what this does, but I think the other thing is, like, here, look, there's a French film group, it only has one guy in it.

628
00:36:59,124 --> 00:36:59,560
Speaker 0: Oh, great.

629
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,840
Speaker 1: But he's recommending three movies here, only one of which I've ever heard of, I've actually seen and heard of.

630
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:05,859
Speaker 0: What, Amélie?

631
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:06,248
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:14,740
Speaker 1: But he's got two other ones here, A Very Long Engagement and La Burge Espagnole, the Spanish apartment.

633
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

634
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,302
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll go see those.

635
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:27,779
Speaker 1: if this guy recommends them, you know, and if I really like French movies and I start to get a lot of them, I'll join the French film group and there's discussions in there and whatever- Discussions, there's one guy.

636
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,139
Speaker 1: Well, you know, eventually there'll be more guys.

637
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,859
Speaker 0: No, just one guy talking to himself.

638
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,700
Speaker 1: The second biggest group is the anime fans group, actually.

639
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:37,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, didn't see that coming.

640
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, were they all recommending anime DVDs to each other?

641
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,793
Speaker 1: Hey, someone-

642
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:53,640
Speaker 0: No, honestly, that's a point against for me, I mean, well, not a point against, really, but while I'd love to do something like that, I could really own, I don't own much anime because Netflix, I hate to keep bringing up Netflix, it's just so similar, killed it for me.

643
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:56,438
Speaker 0: I used to buy a lot of anime because I wanted to see it.

644
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,080
Speaker 0: Now, if I want to see an anime, I rent it because that cost me almost nothing.

645
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:01,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,979
Speaker 0: And I buy, like, the fewest of few anime DVDs now.

647
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:25,400
Speaker 1: See, but it's not so much about, you know, part of it is keeping track of the collection of stuff you have, which is, you know, that's pretty much the primary function, but now it seems like, really, those tabs are on the left, and the friends and groups tabs are on the right, so it seems now like it has these two functions that are sorta tied together and sorta not.

648
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:50,080
Speaker 1: Like, your collection is sorta like, now, instead of being a program where you keep track of your collection and that's what it does, and you share your collection with other people, now it's a program where you make groups and you recommend things to each other and you have a forum and you discuss things, and then your profile just happens to include your entire collection of stuff and your ratings of it and everything.

649
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,500
Speaker 0: Huh.

650
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:54,900
Speaker 1: You know, it's just like you have this giant profile that happens to be full of your entire collection.

651
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:59,280
Speaker 1: The last thing they actually added recently was mail.

652
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,080
Speaker 1: You can just send messages to people in the system willy-nilly.

653
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:03,819
Speaker 0: Eh, that's alright.

654
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

655
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,900
Speaker 0: I have so many systems like that already.

656
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:16,200
Speaker 0: I mean, every now and then I log, 'cause I don't actually log into my Delicious often, I just post to it, and I looked in there the other day, and a whole bunch of people have sent me links that I never even noticed.

657
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,860
Speaker 1: Mhm.

658
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:22,460
Speaker 0: Or, I'll log into, like, Orkut, and a million people have tried to say something to me, and I just haven't looked there.

659
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:23,298
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,337
Speaker 1: The thing is, Lestalle isn't really, you know, 100% perfect.

661
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,740
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things they could add to it, like VHS, you know, I already talked about all of that.

662
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,972
Speaker 1: And they could add some sort of automatic recommendation system, like, "Oh, you seem to match up with those people, huh?

663
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:40,758
Speaker 1: Maybe you should, you know, get on with

664
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,019
Speaker 1: that.".

665
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,640
Speaker 1: But, you know.

666
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Speaker 0: See, that'd be tough for me, because while I like a lot of things, I don't purchase a lot of things.

667
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,580
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you purchase a lot of things, 'cause you can go and rate and review things that you haven't purchased.

668
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess not a lot.

669
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,680
Speaker 1: You can go in and say what you want, whether you've purchased it or not, you know?

670
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,619
Speaker 1: So, even if you don't have a lot of stuff, it can also look at, "Oh, he liked all this

671
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:02,860
Speaker 1: stuff.".

672
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,719
Speaker 1: And you can go and review and talk.

673
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:06,359
Speaker 1: And share.

674
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,639
Speaker 1: And keep track of borrowed goods.

675
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, the keeping track of borrowed goods, especially books, is very much a point four.

676
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:14,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

677
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,940
Speaker 1: The only prob- the one problem I have with Lestalle, and I don't think there's any way to really fix this, is I have to do it.

678
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:26,720
Speaker 1: Like, whenever I buy books or video games or something, I come home, I have to remember to go to Lestalle and type it all in.

679
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,999
Speaker 0: Now, it seems like this- like, the initial pain would just be, "Alright, I'm on Lestalle, I have to go through everything I own and type it

680
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 0: in.".

681
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,421
Speaker 1: Yeah.

682
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:41,340
Speaker 1: Once everything you own is in, you know, you buy a few things at a time, and it's pretty pleasurable to add, like, you know, you go to the bookstore, you buy three books, you add 'em in.

683
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,208
Speaker 1: One, two, three.

684
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:42,819
Speaker 1: That's fun.

685
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Speaker 1: Adding in the hundred books you already own that aren't in there, that's the painful part at the beginning.

686
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:54,235
Speaker 1: You know, but as long as you have, like, a numpad, and you type those ISBNs pretty quick, you know, you- ISBN, enter.

687
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:55,158
Speaker 1: ISBN, enter.

688
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,200
Speaker 1: ISBN, enter.

689
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,672
Speaker 1: Then- then, you know, eventually it's over and you go,

690
00:40:59,476 --> 00:40:59,556
Speaker 1: "Ahh."

691
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:01,120
Speaker 1: And you're all good.

692
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,849
Speaker 1: You can also make- I think there are some other features I don't use so often.

693
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,400
Speaker 1: Like, you can make, uh, special lists of stuff.

694
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:19,240
Speaker 1: Like, I could make a list, like, you know, um, "Awesome Metroid Games" or something, and I just make a custom list and I give it a name.

695
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,039
Speaker 1: You just make lists of things.

696
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:21,677
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

697
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,976
Speaker 1: You know, "Things I got this

698
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:24,258
Speaker 1: week.".

699
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,013
Speaker 1: "Things I'm going to buy next

700
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:26,275
Speaker 1: week.".

701
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:28,451
Speaker 1: "Things I want you to buy me for my

702
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:28,915
Speaker 1: birthday.".

703
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:31,074
Speaker 1: Uh, "Things Rym doesn't

704
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:31,398
Speaker 1: like."

705
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,680
Speaker 1: Things Rym doesn't care about.

706
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 1: I just make a list of, you know, games, books, movies, and music that Rym doesn't like.

707
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:47,460
Speaker 1: You just make a list, and then people can look at the lists and share them with each other, and, you know, you can rate the things in the lists, and... You can pretty much do anything.

708
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,619
Speaker 1: Except, uh, VHS tapes.

709
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:51,864
Speaker 0: Well, is that all your pitch?

710
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:56,980
Speaker 0: 'Cause then, like, uh, the Phoenix Wright judge, I will consider all the evidence and pass my judgment.

711
00:41:57,565 --> 00:41:58,096
Speaker 0: Mm-mm-mm-mm.

712
00:41:58,468 --> 00:41:58,680
Speaker 0: Alright.

713
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,280
Speaker 0: I'd slam the table, but I got the amplification really up, so that would just make a loud annoying noise into the microphone.

715
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:13,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is for all you other people out there, if you have a lot of stuff, or you want to keep track of your stuff, and... Especially, come and join me, I think I'm one of the most active Listala users, I mean...

716
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,416
Speaker 0: You might be.

717
00:42:14,962 --> 00:42:17,048
Speaker 0: I have, like... You gave a good sales pitch for it.

718
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,200
Speaker 0: I mean, it's free, but you sold it to me.

719
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,393
Speaker 1: I got 55 video games in there, one music, 205 books, and 42 DVDs.

720
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,659
Speaker 0: Not too shabby.

721
00:42:29,304 --> 00:42:30,219
Speaker 1: And, of course, one book.

722
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,039
Speaker 1: I actually have more books that are at my house, my parents' house, that aren't in there.

723
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,260
Speaker 1: Oh!

724
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,440
Speaker 0: Oh, God, I just remembered the hundreds of books that are in boxes in Arizona that I gotta get out here somehow.

725
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, there you go, even though you're not buying any, you can just add all those in there.

726
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:48,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to having those shipped out here, and how much money that's gonna cost.

727
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,108
Speaker 1: There's one more thing it actually does.

728
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,531
Speaker 1: If you click on the main page for, like... I'm gonna click on the main page for books, right?

729
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:55,960
Speaker 1: The book home page, right?

730
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:56,400
Speaker 1: Alright.

731
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:59,690
Speaker 1: It says on the left are the custom lists.

732
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,780
Speaker 1: Of course, I don't have any custom lists, I never made any, so there's nothing there.

733
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,584
Speaker 1: Then it says "My Tags".

734
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:09,240
Speaker 1: So, the tags is when you make your own categories for books, right?

735
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,540
Speaker 1: So, the categories that I've made are there in alphabetical order, and next to each one is a parenthesis with the number of things in that category.

736
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,360
Speaker 1: Alright.

737
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:29,260
Speaker 1: Under that, it says "My Authors", and based on the number of things I own from each author, their name is bolder and closer to the beginning of the box.

738
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:35,260
Speaker 0: Weren't you the one who just recently, you were reading a bunch of comics that you thought were all great, and then you noticed that they're all by the same guy?

739
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mean the guy who's the fourth on my list here, Brian K. Vaughan?

740
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:52,520
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, so what can happen with this is, let's say you're the kind of, like, before I started listening to these Comic Guys podcasts, I didn't pay attention to who wrote or drew comic books or anything, I didn't care.

741
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,840
Speaker 1: You know, and maybe you read manga or you read books or you buy DVDs, you know?

742
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never really paid attention to any of that myself.

743
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you don't pay attention to who directs them or who acts in them or anything like that, right?

744
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:09,527
Speaker 1: Well, if you just add in your collection, look at here.

745
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:10,790
Speaker 1: DVD directors.

746
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,097
Speaker 1: Mitsuo Fukuda is my number one director.

747
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:15,280
Speaker 1: Let's see what he directs.

748
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,429
Speaker 1: Oh, he directed the ten Gundam Seed DVDs that I got.

749
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,653
Speaker 1: Alright, let's see.

750
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:25,228
Speaker 1: Noboro Mitsuo, oh, he directed Initial D. Alright, because those are the DVDs I have the most of.

751
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,800
Speaker 1: Oh, apparently someone different directed the first season of Initial D as opposed to the second.

752
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:31,619
Speaker 0: You know, that explains a bit.

753
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:32,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

754
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:34,225
Speaker 1: John Walker the 18th.

755
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,668
Speaker 1: Oh, he directed Transformers.

756
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:38,032
Speaker 1: Alright, so you get the idea here.

757
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:42,140
Speaker 1: You know, you add in your collection and then, boop, oh, those are the directors I like.

758
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,940
Speaker 1: And then you can go search for those directors, see what else they directed, add that stuff to your wanted list, et cetera, et cetera.

759
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,752
Speaker 1: You know, like, I don't know actors and actresses either, but, oh, here they are.

760
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,417
Speaker 1: Oh, Donnie Yen.

761
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:54,300
Speaker 1: I know him.

762
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:55,473
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

763
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:56,480
Speaker 1: You know, he's in there.

764
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,500
Speaker 0: Maybe if you, uh, do this more and more, you'll be able to pass that Anime World Order test that I failed so miserably at Katsu-kan.

765
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

766
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,344
Speaker 1: It's the same with music, too.

767
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:09,700
Speaker 1: Like, you add your albums and it tells you what artists, you know, you can see which artist, visibly, you got more of.

768
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,418
Speaker 1: And video games, it does it for systems, which isn't so useful.

769
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,980
Speaker 0: Not even- Huh, we have mostly GameCube and DS games.

770
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,729
Speaker 1: Actually, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, GameCube and DS are equally bold.

771
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:26,200
Speaker 1: Then PC is slightly less bold, PlayStation is slightly less bold, and the original Game Boy is tiny.

772
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:27,082
Speaker 0: All right.

773
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:30,868
Speaker 0: So, all that considered, I will pass my judgment.

774
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,760
Speaker 0: There are many points for, and I am one tiny step away from jumping into this with both feet.

775
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,143
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

776
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:39,926
Speaker 0: I think it's really cool.

777
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,800
Speaker 0: The only thing is that it doesn't have board games.

778
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

779
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,520
Speaker 0: Like, if it had board games, if when I asked about board games, you would have said, "Yeah, it has board games," I would have been making an account right now while I'm talking.

780
00:45:51,942 --> 00:45:52,007
Speaker 1: Yep.

781
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:57,620
Speaker 0: But I'm real close, and if there's ever a hint that board games are coming, I think I'm going to be a list dollar.

782
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just, you know, I keep going into their forum and pushing, like, "Hey, you guys need to add other stuff besides these four things,".

783
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:06,379
Speaker 1: and I don't know.

784
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,020
Speaker 1: They seem like they just want to keep it simple, which is understandable from a design perspective.

785
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,832
Speaker 0: Well, I also wonder, what's their privacy agreement?

786
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:15,800
Speaker 0: Do they sell the data to marketers or anything?

787
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,520
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there's just some guy making a thing.

788
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,840
Speaker 0: But does he have a policy?

789
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,880
Speaker 0: Hmm, let me- Does he have a written privacy policy?

790
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:23,002
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

791
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:35,860
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't care if some secret government agency or some horrible marketing company knows that I like Harris Greenwood, and I tend to watch a lot of shoujo crap anime, but I'd like to know that they know.

792
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,799
Speaker 1: Um, it doesn't actually say anywhere, but it does say this.

793
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:44,726
Speaker 1: Um, "Lestalle was created by Tom Maschord.

794
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:49,417
Speaker 1: He's been involved in a number of web projects, most notably Dark Galaxy, an online

795
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:49,718
Speaker 1: game.".

796
00:46:49,878 --> 00:46:50,540
Speaker 1: Alright, whatever.

797
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:59,738
Speaker 1: "Over the last few years, he was fascinated with the development of so many different social websites like Flickr, Friendster, and Delicious, he decided to just create one centered around media

798
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:00,259
Speaker 1: collections.".

799
00:47:01,421 --> 00:47:02,787
Speaker 1: That's it, it's just some guy made it.

800
00:47:03,189 --> 00:47:10,780
Speaker 0: It's not anything corporate, or there's no one- No, no, it's not anything corporate, but there's nothing prohibiting him from just selling all the data to people willy-nilly.

801
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:14,400
Speaker 1: Let me see if there's a EULA when you click the sign up button.

802
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,784
Speaker 1: Okay, wow, wow, wow, wow.

803
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:24,140
Speaker 1: No, there really is nothing, no agreement whatsoever when you join Lestalle at all.

804
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:31,380
Speaker 1: I just typed in, like, FUBAR and some crummy password, and in two seconds I had an account and I was logged in, and he didn't even have to do a confirmation email.

805
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,483
Speaker 1: Great.

806
00:47:32,503 --> 00:47:32,886
Speaker 1: Or anything.

807
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:34,460
Speaker 1: It's that easy.

808
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:36,384
Speaker 0: Um, alright.

809
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:42,631
Speaker 0: The only thing I wonder about is what he does with the data, or if he's ever gonna- I don't think he does anything with the data, I think it just-.

810
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:50,259
Speaker 1: Well, also, we didn't, you know, explicitly give him permission to do it, either.

811
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:55,563
Speaker 0: Hmm, that's fine.

812
00:47:55,603 --> 00:47:56,245
Speaker 0: What do I care?

813
00:47:56,326 --> 00:48:07,220
Speaker 0: if someone knows- Oh yeah, I'm not saying I care, it's not even a strike against, but if I were him, and he's really just a cool hobbyist, he should put something up.

814
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,420
Speaker 0: He should put some sort of "I'm not gonna use your data for this" or something.

815
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,546
Speaker 1: I think he's just never come up.

816
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:16,800
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll go say something in the forum, I'm sure he'll take care of that right away.

817
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,560
Speaker 0: Let's find out, maybe we'll interview him on the show.

818
00:48:18,942 --> 00:48:19,049
Speaker 1: Maybe.

819
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:20,096
Speaker 0: I'd like to.

820
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,606
Speaker 1: Yeah.

821
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:26,300
Speaker 0: Alright, we thought we were gonna also talk about Delicious today, but we've already done a whole show on Lestalle.

822
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,519
Speaker 1: Did we really do a whole show?

823
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, we pretty much did.

824
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:28,785
Speaker 0: Wow.

825
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:33,000
Speaker 0: We've been going long for the last week, so this episode's actually back to the normal length for now.

826
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,820
Speaker 1: Going long is good because then, um, we don't have to come up with more crap.

827
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,169
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

828
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,760
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

835

Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
