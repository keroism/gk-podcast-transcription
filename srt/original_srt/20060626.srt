1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,807
Speaker 0: It's Monday June 26th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:18,568
Speaker 0: tonight We cop out and just do a tech news roundup which means we didn't have a good topic for today.

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,987
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,297
Speaker 1: So my car needs an oil change.

5
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,863
Speaker 1: well it needed an oil change.

6
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:27,469
Speaker 0: It's needed one for a while hasn't it?

7
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,817
Speaker 1: yeah I just whenever I need an oil change.

8
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:32,305
Speaker 1: I just I never get it when I need to.

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,229
Speaker 1: it's always way late.

10
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:35,720
Speaker 0: See I used to not have to worry because I commuted.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,203
Speaker 0: I don't know.

12
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,750
Speaker 0: eight miles every day

13
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:59,704
Speaker 1: That's one of the things I like about the car I got is that any oil change place will tell you 3,000 miles, but the car dealer when I went to Look test drive the car He said 7,000 miles, and then if you look in the actual book from the car It says something like the normal maintenance schedule is 7,000 in the like.

14
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,990
Speaker 1: the better maintenance schedule is 5,000.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,913
Speaker 1: So I went 6,000.

16
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:07,008
Speaker 0: that's pretty good alright, so you did the one thing that wasn't listed anywhere.

17
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:15,215
Speaker 1: yep exactly but Yeah, usually I go get oil changes at valvoline And I had.

18
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:26,010
Speaker 1: you know the problem is the closest valvoline is a little out of the way And I didn't have time to go to it over the weekend, so I went after work today And they didn't have filters for my car air filters.

19
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,607
Speaker 0: You know I remember Ken used to run into that oil filter not air filter because he had an intrigue.

20
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:35,710
Speaker 0: Which take to take a bit at a big oil pan took a weird filter and all sorts of fun stuff.

21
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:42,869
Speaker 1: So I saw this other place on the road that said oil change car wash, and it looked pretty nice You know, but it was sort of generic.

22
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:49,108
Speaker 1: I went there anyway, and the people were nice and the place was nice, but they kind of sucked.

23
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,162
Speaker 0: yeah I probably I could have warned you.

24
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:56,170
Speaker 0: I've never been to that place But just looking at it gave me the vibe of no one goes there for an oil change.

25
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:59,322
Speaker 1: Actually, it was real crowded like there were a lot of people there.

26
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:00,165
Speaker 0: That's weird.

27
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:08,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, but It just took forever to change my goddamn oil and They didn't do Like.

28
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,425
Speaker 1: they didn't even show me the dipstick after they changed the oil.

29
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:15,747
Speaker 1: I had to ask Valvoline just comes and shows it to you whether you ask or not and most people go.

30
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,330
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

31
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,335
Speaker 1: you know.

32
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:21,778
Speaker 1: and So I was like you're gonna show me the dipstick.

33
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,420
Speaker 1: so I know that you put oil in my car before I give you money maybe.

34
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 1: and Then they got like some sort of green you know oil on my windshield and shit.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,266
Speaker 1: It just wasn't good.

36
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:33,730
Speaker 1: They sucked.

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:35,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, meanwhile I go to.

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:51,129
Speaker 0: I don't go to Valvoline anymore either but I found this place in the Bronx right near one of the hospitals I work at and Not only are they cheaper than Valvoline by like eight or nine bucks and not only are they fast and awesome and real quick and All that but I get a discount because I work at the hospital.

39
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:55,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, there really just isn't a place anywhere near me to go.

40
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,424
Speaker 1: do that like nowhere.

41
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:57,066
Speaker 0: Well.

42
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:58,530
Speaker 0: You could drive up to the Valvoline.

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the closest place, and I went there, and they didn't.

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,790
Speaker 0: you know there's a Valvoline right across the river in Newberg, right?

45
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,441
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not on my way home.

46
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,229
Speaker 1: That's out of my way.

47
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:10,290
Speaker 0: It's a lot closer than driving up Route 9 in rush hour traffic.

48
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but it also costs an extra dollar to go over there.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,234
Speaker 0: Oh, no a dolly whatever we like to do What are you said?

50
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:20,342
Speaker 0: if something costs less than five dollars?

51
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:20,904
Speaker 0: It's free.

52
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:25,443
Speaker 0: No you always talking Oh, it's less than if it's below certain amounts of money.

53
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:26,790
Speaker 0: You decide whatever it doesn't matter.

54
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:31,507
Speaker 1: It's effectively free not if it's nothing not if there's a Valvoline on this side of the river.

55
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:32,470
Speaker 1: than zero dollars.

56
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,623
Speaker 0: I submit that the gas you use driving up Route 9.

57
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:42,390
Speaker 1: It's not that far up Route 9 No, it's not that far distance wise but the traffic and the lights under there really wasn't traffic and lights today.

58
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:44,005
Speaker 0: Oh, that's kind of went whoosh.

59
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:46,227
Speaker 0: Usually there are especially at rush hour.

60
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:49,385
Speaker 0: I tried to drive up that road before back when I used to live in Poughkeepsie.

61
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,370
Speaker 1: not enough problem.

62
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:58,654
Speaker 0: It took me usually about an hour to drive to Poughkeepsie from where I work going up Route 9 Five minutes to get to the Valvoline On the exit.

63
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,500
Speaker 0: usually that roads just back backed up.

64
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:02,266
Speaker 1: No, no problems.

65
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:02,628
Speaker 1: Yeah.

66
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,774
Speaker 0: Well usually Anyway, you got a news.

67
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:07,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's some news.

68
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:09,184
Speaker 1: is that dig upgraded today.

69
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:09,706
Speaker 1: Finally.

70
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:11,150
Speaker 0: All I got to say is whoopty shit.

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,375
Speaker 0: It looks the same it acts the same.

72
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,380
Speaker 0: I all I'd all.

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,317
Speaker 0: the only reason I noticed cuz my RSS broke Yeah, and I just deleted it.

74
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:18,524
Speaker 0: I didn't bother re-adding it.

75
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,457
Speaker 1: Well what they've done That's good that you might not notice.

76
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,850
Speaker 1: this is really two changes that are well three changes.

77
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,070
Speaker 1: The first change is kind of silly and meaningless.

78
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:34,430
Speaker 1: Is that if something gets dug a shit ton that it gets this little like green sort of star near it.

79
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:36,329
Speaker 1: So it's like this is a crazy story.

80
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,285
Speaker 1: That's big deal.

81
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,104
Speaker 1: Secondly the the big thing is that they've added more sections.

82
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:52,970
Speaker 1: dig used to be just tech news now It's tech science world and business videos entertainment and gaming and then there are subcategories as well.

83
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:58,590
Speaker 1: And if you log in you can change your preferences so that you get rid of certain categories.

84
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:06,665
Speaker 1: For example, I got rid of the science health category is 99% of that category is just Randy bullshit And I'm tired of looking at it.

85
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:11,442
Speaker 1: It's just people saying oh my god, this causes cancer when it doesn't.

86
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:12,205
Speaker 1: or oh my god.

87
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:13,690
Speaker 1: Here's an amazing panacea.

88
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,229
Speaker 1: No, it's not And I'm like get the hell out of my face.

89
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:32,552
Speaker 0: I guess I just I don't like dig that much and I only ever go there If I'm either really idle and I have nothing in the world to do which isn't really an occurrence anymore Or I'm desperate for news and I couldn't find anything on any of the other sites I go to.

90
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:35,019
Speaker 0: I go to dig is the last resort.

91
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,343
Speaker 0: I'll find something here.

92
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,590
Speaker 0: I just I don't like the comments.

93
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:43,548
Speaker 0: I don't like the community and the stories 99% of them that are worth reading appear on Fark and slash dot.

94
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:48,261
Speaker 1: anyway Yeah, you know Fark slash dot all that stuff appears everywhere.

95
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,549
Speaker 1: eventually, you know, it's just dig is like the.

96
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,998
Speaker 1: It goes there first there's greater quantity.

97
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,088
Speaker 0: I would submit that it probably goes to Fark right about the same time.

98
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:57,710
Speaker 0: It goes to dig.

99
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:02,789
Speaker 1: maybe You know, but the I don't read the comments on dig at all.

100
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,630
Speaker 0: So there's a thing I go to such for the comments.

101
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,810
Speaker 0: I go to slash dot for the comments now go to Fark for the comments And I just go to get links to the actual story, which I then read.

102
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:13,268
Speaker 0: I usually read the comments first and then I read the story.

103
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:21,706
Speaker 1: Yes very most of the comments on dig are becoming more and more Fark like or Or they're meta comments saying don't dig this dig this.

104
00:06:21,907 --> 00:06:32,681
Speaker 0: Oh my god Something like that is definitely not becoming Fark like because surprisingly Many of the posts on Fark are very informative about the article in question Not quite so much as slash dot.

105
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,030
Speaker 0: but it's that it's sad.

106
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,010
Speaker 0: It's really weird to me that Fark intellectually definitely seems a step up from dig.

107
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,058
Speaker 1: Well dig has the comments.

108
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,990
Speaker 1: are you know now that this moderation, you know There are comments in there that are informative about the topic.

109
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,850
Speaker 1: The problem is there's also a lot of people who don't know what they're taught.

110
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,990
Speaker 1: This is generally the same problem with dig comments.

111
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:59,769
Speaker 1: The same problem with dig is that if there's an article but you know Even though if it's false of a if it's popular it gets dug up.

112
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:05,248
Speaker 1: So even if someone says something that's factually incorrect in the dig comments it goes up.

113
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,014
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

114
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:11,527
Speaker 0: Remember when we were at a penguin and we met what's-his-name from slash dot?

115
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,115
Speaker 0: Yep, and Actually, we we had.

116
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:21,122
Speaker 0: we talked to him for a while because the panel was basically him and us and some quiet nerds who were real shy and they didn't really talk.

117
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:22,549
Speaker 0: so basically just us talking to the dude.

118
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,584
Speaker 0: and at one point we asked him how come there isn't a moderation tag for like?

119
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:37,450
Speaker 0: this is false or this is untrue or The information this post is bullshit and his reason was perhaps the the least expected reason he could have ever given for that.

120
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,649
Speaker 1: It's because he couldn't find a single word for it.

121
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:44,744
Speaker 0: I mean I said why don't you use factually hyphen incorrect?

122
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,009
Speaker 0: and he balked at it.

123
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:52,150
Speaker 1: Notice how all the moderation things on slash dot are insightful interesting in form.

124
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,549
Speaker 1: They're all I words except for troll and flame bait and flame bait and underrated overrated funny and funny.

125
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:01,920
Speaker 1: Other than almost half of all the good ones begin with.

126
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,970
Speaker 1: I all the ones you all the ones you want funny is good.

127
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:05,993
Speaker 1: No, not that good.

128
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:06,736
Speaker 0: I go for funny.

129
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:08,984
Speaker 1: I don't go for funny, but he wouldn't.

130
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:10,690
Speaker 0: he knows he needs that tag.

131
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,490
Speaker 0: He's wanted that tag for years.

132
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:18,627
Speaker 0: He can't come up with a one word that means that concept other than like now because anything else he would.

133
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:28,935
Speaker 1: there are words like false or incorrect or lying or anything like that, but the problem is all those words have other connotations and the Tag won't.

134
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,963
Speaker 1: the moderation won't be used properly.

135
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:36,546
Speaker 0: if he uses those words I say you should just bit the bullet and said factually - incorrect.

136
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:37,409
Speaker 1: That's what I say.

137
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:52,781
Speaker 1: But that's the one thing that's wrong with dig is that you know most the Chaff gets weeded out for the most part and the good stuff goes up for the most part and the duplicates get weeded out Almost a hundred percent, but there's stuff that's just wrong.

138
00:08:52,801 --> 00:09:10,757
Speaker 0: and because the masses are not experts Shit, that's false goes up and actually the moderation system makes this worse even in the comments because I've noticed whenever there's a terribly Stupid Randy on dig like oh lol apple seeds cure cancer lol one.

139
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,745
Speaker 0: yeah exactly now in Articles like that I've seen that the people on dig who post and say this is crap.

140
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,710
Speaker 0: This is a stupid fake story.

141
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 0: Those people get dug down because they're you know, they're they're raining on the parade on FARC.

142
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:28,730
Speaker 0: Nothing can get run down.

143
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:34,936
Speaker 0: So whenever an article is crap all the people who say it's crap and are right are right there in your face And you realize right away.

144
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:35,921
Speaker 0: You can just skip the article.

145
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:36,564
Speaker 1: Yep.

146
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:37,750
Speaker 0: You don't get that in dig.

147
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:48,630
Speaker 1: Nope, but see on dig if I'm smart, so first of all Before I had to deal with all those stories But I was smart enough to say this is obviously a fake story and it's lying.

148
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,876
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna ignore it now.

149
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:52,710
Speaker 1: I don't see those stories cuz I got rid of that subcategory.

150
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,730
Speaker 0: I don't see it anymore, which is great Yeah, but you should have still gone in and railed against him and dug down all the people who said good things.

151
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:01,315
Speaker 1: It's not worth my time It's really not.

152
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,910
Speaker 0: honestly, I got the same thing going with slash dot now as much as I love it.

153
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've had God how five ten fifty twenty.

154
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,330
Speaker 0: I had almost 40 moderator points on slash dot in the past three weeks.

155
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:16,047
Speaker 1: There's the other thing they added to dig which is which is actually I think the best part is undig.

156
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:19,749
Speaker 1: before you can make Friends, but now it's actually useful.

157
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:27,726
Speaker 1: You make friends with people and people make friends with you and now on the left side of the screen It will give you your friends activity in the last 48 hours.

158
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:47,090
Speaker 1: It'll give you the number of stories dug by your friends the number of stories that your friends dug that you also dug The number of stories your friends dug that aren't yet on the front page that are upcoming stories The number of stories your friends commented on and the number of stories your friends submitted.

159
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:54,767
Speaker 1: Then you can click on any one of those things to see which stories your friends dug Which stories your friends and you agreed on etc, etc?

160
00:10:55,715 --> 00:11:03,010
Speaker 1: Huh, so that way, you know If you make a network of friends who all use dig you can just completely ignore the stories on dig itself.

161
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:12,096
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like a delicious but with the popular element more powered up and easier to use and with only guys That's right.

162
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:17,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, the statistics show that 94% of dig users are male.

163
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,313
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yep.

164
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:27,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta find me some dig ladies That 6% is out there.

165
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:27,616
Speaker 0: No.

166
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:28,158
Speaker 0: No, you know what?

167
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:31,428
Speaker 0: 94% are males 6% are males who lie about their gender.

168
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,376
Speaker 0: damn it Dig is really kind.

169
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:35,059
Speaker 0: All right.

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,722
Speaker 0: I won't get into that.

171
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,008
Speaker 0: We're this isn't a show about dig.

172
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,438
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so talk about another thing.

173
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,205
Speaker 0: I don't like live journal.

174
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:47,390
Speaker 0: I don't like life really Well, I like the idea of live journal because live journal was a blog before blogs really totally all real.

175
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:49,860
Speaker 1: All live journal really is is blogging software.

176
00:11:49,880 --> 00:12:01,556
Speaker 0: It's no different than say WordPress or My space or other than the fact that it's old and it had a large active and very Inward looking community.

177
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:02,400
Speaker 1: Yep.

178
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:10,870
Speaker 1: It's it's simply a blog software But the way it's designed is that all the bloggers are sort of linked into this giant blob called live journal.

179
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:17,330
Speaker 0: You know as opposed to your nose blob, I learned something interesting, you know, live journal has live journal syndication, right?

180
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,233
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

181
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,750
Speaker 0: It's basically like RSS but only for in live journal.

182
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:33,999
Speaker 0: Yep, more people use that then use RSS Probably like I mean Otakon is in a live journal syndication and an RSS feed and I've heard numerous people note that it seems like Many more people use the live journal syndication.

183
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,562
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

184
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,350
Speaker 1: Why do you just keep stepping on your chair?

185
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,390
Speaker 1: What you were like tapping your foot on your chair and make it squeak while you talked like that.

186
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,589
Speaker 0: Yes, it doesn't get picked up by the microphone and I always fiddle around with my feet.

187
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,180
Speaker 1: It's annoying cuz it was making the squeaking.

188
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:52,215
Speaker 0: you want to talk about annoying things Mr.

189
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,970
Speaker 0: Breathes into the microphone constantly.

190
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:06,570
Speaker 0: Anyway live journal that that den of iniquity that seething pit from which no traveler returns Has one more reason to be hated and despised.

191
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:12,830
Speaker 0: Now a little while ago They added a thing where there's an ad supported live journal thing.

192
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,990
Speaker 0: I don't know all the details but they ran ads in live journal.

193
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:22,507
Speaker 0: It just so happens that some of the ads they ran were put in by evil people.

194
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,753
Speaker 0: they were filled with Malware.

195
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:33,126
Speaker 0: if you were running Internet Explorer and Windows you got spyware Just by visiting live journal or using live journal.

196
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:34,112
Speaker 1: awesome It's.

197
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:44,530
Speaker 0: this specific one seemed to only attack Non United States live journal users in a in an attempt to get around some of the checking that live journal does.

198
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:49,427
Speaker 0: But there's really no technological reason why they couldn't have just attacked live journal users in the u.s..

199
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,590
Speaker 1: Wow That's kind of weird and crazy.

200
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:59,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually live journal does do a lot of testing on their ads But they obviously one didn't do enough.

201
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:07,912
Speaker 1: and two they must have accepted ads from shady people Because obviously they're needing some money because myspace and others are probably kicking their ass Now.

202
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:13,375
Speaker 0: slash shot even got hit by this once a long long time ago, but in this day and age There's no excuse.

203
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,852
Speaker 0: mm-hmm if you I mean you can't you're gonna Do ads.

204
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:22,350
Speaker 1: you do ads for a reputable source like Google or Yahoo or you know a real ad company?

205
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,054
Speaker 1: You don't do those shady ad companies.

206
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, even like ad click isn't that shady?

207
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,846
Speaker 0: yep good God I?

208
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,110
Speaker 1: Mean some of them will make pop-ups or something.

209
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:38,507
Speaker 1: But you know or pop behinds or poker ads or porn ads but the spyware ones.

210
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:39,410
Speaker 1: That's the shadiest.

211
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:43,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still not too up on this whole ad concept.

212
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:47,070
Speaker 0: I mean I haven't seen an ad on the internet in what like five years.

213
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,861
Speaker 1: This is big white area at the top of the new dig.

214
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:50,985
Speaker 1: I wonder what goes there.

215
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:52,130
Speaker 0: I don't know.

216
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:52,632
Speaker 0: I don't know.

217
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,324
Speaker 0: They must have just left that white there some sort of artistic.

218
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,610
Speaker 1: I don't know why they did that.

219
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,510
Speaker 1: It's kind of strange.

220
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:05,068
Speaker 0: Yeah all of you out there right now one if you don't have Firefox to get Firefox then go get the Firefox ad block extension.

221
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,304
Speaker 0: then Either right click on every ad you see and make it go away or run the filter.

222
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:12,230
Speaker 1: G filter set G updater.

223
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:16,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah One of them requires more effort however.

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,030
Speaker 0: one of them prevents you from playing Kingdom of Loathing in its full glory.

225
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:30,479
Speaker 1: Only accidentally you can fix that all right now.

226
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:37,124
Speaker 0: I like birds and This video is just amazing and hilarious.

227
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,227
Speaker 1: and birdie?

228
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:44,730
Speaker 0: now There's this flock of starlings in this video and a lot of starling.

229
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,070
Speaker 0: It's a lot of birds like they could blot out the Sun handily a hagilian birds.

230
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:54,025
Speaker 0: And there's this tiny tree Hitchcock's the birds this tiny little tree.

231
00:15:54,486 --> 00:16:03,098
Speaker 0: and these birds are Circling and circling and circling and then they all try it again into this tiny tree to the point that it Bends over to the point where it's gonna break.

232
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,190
Speaker 0: then suddenly the tree snapped back and they all fly away.

233
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:07,397
Speaker 1: I think it's.

234
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,490
Speaker 1: they leave the tree, and then it snaps back.

235
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:20,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know exactly what prompts them to leave the tree But the thing is they circle they land on the tree it bends it snaps up They fly away, and they keep doing this over and over and ever.

236
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,710
Speaker 0: they just really want to get into this tree.

237
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,328
Speaker 1: I think they want to break the tree.

238
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,269
Speaker 0: Honestly my best guess is that the birds are really enjoying what's going on, and they're doing it for fun.

239
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:34,466
Speaker 1: Maybe or maybe they're just birds doing their mindless bird shit now.

240
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:35,590
Speaker 0: There's a lot of smart birds.

241
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:37,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like owls.

242
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:38,886
Speaker 0: Oh really.

243
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, really But it's just.

244
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:47,837
Speaker 0: this is a really interesting video to watch because honestly when I used to live in New Baltimore We had there wasn't starlings.

245
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:51,830
Speaker 0: we had birds would do this our backyard instead of having we had a normal fence.

246
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,646
Speaker 0: But instead of having a privacy fence or anything we had huge hedges that surrounded the entire backyard.

247
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:58,729
Speaker 0: They were very tall.

248
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:09,128
Speaker 0: Every evening in the summer just millions of birds would descend upon them and then squawk around and fly around and fight and make a god-awful racket all evening long.

249
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:11,666
Speaker 0: It's like that times a million.

250
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:22,829
Speaker 1: I Just think it's cool that so there's so many little tiny birds that it causes a tree to bend over More than like I could pull it if I wanted.

251
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:30,925
Speaker 0: I just wonder if the birds realize like if they figured out What was going on in any dimness because starlings aren't the smartest of birds.

252
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:32,590
Speaker 1: They're pretty much just fire.

253
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,569
Speaker 1: What do they eat just like bugs and twigs?

254
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:46,110
Speaker 0: now the best part of this is while we were looking at this and then we learned something about demoic acid poisoning and We learned and Alex actually looked this up over the weekend.

255
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,742
Speaker 0: I don't remember all the details, but you know Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right mm-hmm.

256
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:52,893
Speaker 0: That's based on a true story Mm-hmm.

257
00:17:53,034 --> 00:18:06,088
Speaker 0: I didn't know that but apparently this flock of sea birds was Poisoned by this diatom poison that's in algae or something and they went nuts and they came to shore and just attacked people until they all died.

258
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,977
Speaker 0: Whoa, and it was this crazy thing.

259
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:16,810
Speaker 0: if any of you out there want to dig up the article again post it in the forums We'll have a good look, but yeah Alfred Hitchcock's the birds was based on a real-life event.

260
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,084
Speaker 1: Did not know that?

261
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,159
Speaker 0: yeah none of us did.

262
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:22,537
Speaker 0: and Watch the video cuz it's really cool.

263
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,043
Speaker 1: and watch the movie cuz it's pretty good.

264
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:33,669
Speaker 0: and actually the guy's blog I linked to this is his second video of birds flocking and someone suggested in his comments Why don't you make a separate blog just for bird flocking videos?

265
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,340
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, you'll be the most popular thing on the internets.

00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:45,088
Speaker 0: What if that girl who's afraid of pickles?

288
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,370
Speaker 1: That's that's the worst you can do in the u.s.. And I'm surprised she didn't sue cuz that was obviously fake.

289
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,822
Speaker 1: That's why you know it's like.

290
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:52,750
Speaker 1: you can only do that in the u.s.

291
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,430
Speaker 1: If it's fake, and if you know it's designed to make you feel sympathetic towards the person in Japan.

292
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:04,006
Speaker 1: You know if you're afraid of pickles They'll dump you in a pickle vat and then they'll all the whole country will laugh at you.

293
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,215
Speaker 0: so uh Describe what happens.

294
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,420
Speaker 0: cuz I'll do the lead-off.

295
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,268
Speaker 0: you know guy walks up, and he has to pay.

296
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:13,349
Speaker 1: well first They actually see the reason that you had a better experience watching it.

297
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:18,170
Speaker 1: This is I fast-forwarded over the beginning part that explained what they were gonna do in Japanese.

298
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,064
Speaker 1: Yes, but they also had pictures.

299
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:20,649
Speaker 1: gets a video.

300
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:24,150
Speaker 0: See I didn't know what was going on so I know that's why it was funnier for you.

301
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,974
Speaker 1: I did that on purpose.

302
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:28,950
Speaker 0: all I saw was a dude and he has to pee and he goes to the porta potty and he opens It.

303
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:41,376
Speaker 0: he goes in he closes it and he squats down over the thing and then there starts a 10-second countdown and Once it hits like five seconds these lights start counting down next to him and It gets to.

304
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:51,945
Speaker 0: it's like red red red red And just as the green one turns on he looks at it And he has this look like I wonder what that light is and then suddenly the

305
00:20:52,025 --> 00:21:10,343
Speaker 1: roof of the porta potty Opens up the sunlight shines in and a lift brings the toilet him The roll of toilet paper on a stand and anything else in the porta potty Straight out to the roof of the porta potty and he's standing up there Squatting on the squat toilet for all to see.

306
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:11,710
Speaker 0: he has no idea what to do.

307
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:19,459
Speaker 1: He's the most stunned human being I've ever seen and I'm not gonna spoil the rest of this video But it gets better than that.

308
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,223
Speaker 0: they do one.

309
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:21,630
Speaker 0: they do it to a lot of people.

310
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,489
Speaker 0: They do it to a lot of people in all these different places, but then they go one step further.

311
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:30,603
Speaker 1: They hurt people in the one in the one step further.

312
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,029
Speaker 0: yeah the one dude falls off.

313
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,222
Speaker 1: Watch this whole video.

314
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:37,330
Speaker 0: This is fantastic.

315
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:45,949
Speaker 1: I recommend also for added humor like Try to skip around that way that you don't see the explanations of what they're about to do before they do it.

316
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:51,870
Speaker 1: That way you get the effect of oh my god look what just happened in addition to the oh my god.

317
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,587
Speaker 1: They actually did what they said they were just gonna do.

318
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,286
Speaker 0: Hey All right, so we wanted to do it.

319
00:21:59,307 --> 00:21:59,850
Speaker 0: he sucked today.

320
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:01,354
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah We were gonna talk about.

321
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:09,290
Speaker 0: we were gonna do the next part three of how computers work which was flip-flops and neither one of us Really wanted to talk in excruciating detail about flip-flops.

322
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:13,305
Speaker 1: Blame that on the summer the weekend come on.

323
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:14,510
Speaker 1: It's a four day a week show.

324
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:15,774
Speaker 1: You can't you know?

325
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,018
Speaker 1: yell at us for anything.

326
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:17,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus.

327
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,430
Speaker 0: We had a quite a mentally exhausting weekend.

328
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,123
Speaker 0: We played a pile of board games.

329
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:24,430
Speaker 1: good for tomorrow.

330
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:28,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I will say I got a gloat a little bit at the Mars meeting.

331
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:30,257
Speaker 0: We went to where we play the board games.

332
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,686
Speaker 0: I went undefeated in one every single game.

333
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:33,690
Speaker 0: We played all three of them.

334
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:37,770
Speaker 0: Yep, not just one, but one like other than anyone three games.

335
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:43,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, Attica was close, but I I had more points than all of you combined in that stupid Timbuktu game guys.

336
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,566
Speaker 1: See if it's him like to be.

337
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:45,534
Speaker 0: yeah But that was honest.

338
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:48,387
Speaker 1: if I would have knew what I was doing in the first round it would have been close.

339
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:53,078
Speaker 1: Yep But I Did every other round just fine.

340
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that'll be a story for tomorrow.

341
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:58,178
Speaker 0: That's quite hilarious Yep, anyway in addition to that.

342
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,101
Speaker 0: You know it's summer.

343
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,084
Speaker 0: It's hot as hell.

344
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:11,009
Speaker 0: It still hasn't really rained here Mm-hmm so we're going to do what we always do when we can't come up with a topic to do on a Monday Tech news roundup you can just call this twit nights.

345
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:26,305
Speaker 1: But before we do a tech news roundup I I wanted to talk about you know my new switch to Ubuntu Ubuntu and Some other things related to that and it really it can't give a whole show to that.

346
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,193
Speaker 1: cuz then rim is just gonna sit there Not talking.

347
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:34,669
Speaker 0: the only option we had was that I could talk about my Mac experience But I want to do a whole show on that like a month from now.

348
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, when it's not so close to the Mac sucks experience show.

349
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:43,637
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I want to talk about the non Podcasting aspect of Mac which I really like.

350
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,585
Speaker 0: yeah, I just don't like the podcasting.

351
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:49,495
Speaker 1: okay, so I'm my Ubuntu.

352
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,017
Speaker 1: one thing.

353
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:54,175
Speaker 1: I just did the other day Ubuntu as I set up XGL.

354
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:59,410
Speaker 1: now if you don't know X X is the X windowing system.

355
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,990
Speaker 1: This is what makes the graphics and the gooeys and the clicking and the mouse and the windows on Linux.

356
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:15,363
Speaker 1: You don't need to know more than that unless you're not yeah You have Linux which is just the lowest part of the operating system And you know you get a command line on a black screen with white text.

357
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:19,496
Speaker 0: X is old as hell and Incredibly difficult to understand.

358
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:24,770
Speaker 1: yeah X is the thing that makes the gooeys appear and makes it look like a usable computer.

359
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:29,670
Speaker 1: It's so archaic, but now there's X org, and I'm not gonna explain anymore.

360
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,070
Speaker 1: But it's not as bad as it was and it's getting better and all the time.

361
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,614
Speaker 0: Yeah What no nice little hint.

362
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:39,650
Speaker 0: if you ever make sure if you ever make a new Linux box or anything that you're using X org.

363
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:46,109
Speaker 0: If you're using Ubuntu You know that you're using X org, but if you're a red hat, dude.

364
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:47,576
Speaker 1: Well red hat.

365
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,324
Speaker 1: I think pretty much everything uses X org.

366
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,228
Speaker 1: now X for 86?

367
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:53,179
Speaker 1: honestly No except for old shit red hat.

368
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:56,712
Speaker 0: Enterprise 3 uses X free 86.

369
00:24:56,712 --> 00:25:01,010
Speaker 0: Uh the most updated one because that's what I had to use when I worked at IBM.

370
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:04,981
Speaker 0: Uh unless Red Hat Enterprise 4 uses something else.

371
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:06,746
Speaker 0: I don't know it was painful.

372
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:10,717
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, so There's a thing called X GL.

373
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:12,122
Speaker 1: It's actually made by Novell.

374
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:13,226
Speaker 1: I think it's kind of weird.

375
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,210
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't like Novell.

376
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Novell's not so bad.

377
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:16,098
Speaker 0: Well.

378
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,543
Speaker 0: I don't like Novell NetWare.

379
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,170
Speaker 1: No no Novell NetWare is bad.

380
00:25:19,271 --> 00:25:25,640
Speaker 1: the company is a little different, but What it does is it takes X. it does the same thing X does.

381
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,675
Speaker 1: it's actually an add-on to X and it makes X go With OpenGL.

382
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:34,209
Speaker 1: so your video card is doing all the work of X instead of your CPU.

383
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:41,730
Speaker 1: That's good because you have this GPU in your computer might as well use it, and you know save some CPU cycles for other stuff.

384
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:49,234
Speaker 1: As a result there's mad eye candy mad eye candy I gotta say.

385
00:25:49,636 --> 00:25:55,378
Speaker 0: Scott's XGL, which I looked at for like a second is At least as shiny as what my Mac can do.

386
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,406
Speaker 1: hell it kicks the shit out of that Mac in terms of eye candy Except for the front row.

387
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:02,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, the real pretty.

388
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,121
Speaker 0: not so useful, but real pretty.

389
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:04,984
Speaker 1: the front row.

390
00:26:05,004 --> 00:26:06,670
Speaker 1: I think is more useful than it is pretty.

391
00:26:07,752 --> 00:26:09,561
Speaker 0: We have some trouble with it though the only.

392
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,309
Speaker 1: we have a little bit of trouble, but not much.

393
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:12,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, that might just be.

394
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:15,786
Speaker 1: a problem I have with the front row is that it's not responsive enough.

395
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:17,886
Speaker 1: like I push the button I have to wait for it to show up.

396
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:21,210
Speaker 1: If it showed up as soon as I push the button then it would be perfect.

397
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:23,964
Speaker 0: I also want to be able to customize it and add more stuff to it.

398
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:25,270
Speaker 1: That would also be cool.

399
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe maybe we can and we just don't know how.

400
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,402
Speaker 0: yeah, we have.

401
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:34,080
Speaker 0: we're not saying you can we just haven't tried yet Yep, but anyway There we're talking I can't like.

402
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,159
Speaker 1: when you move windows around in XGL they wobble and you can modify the amount of wobbling.

403
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:49,039
Speaker 1: and if you resize windows they wobble and icons kind of Animate and when things fold up they kind of go whoosh.

404
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,528
Speaker 1: and when applications close they fade to the.

405
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,316
Speaker 1: they kind of go whoosh Into the background.

406
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,470
Speaker 0: important thing is the cube the cube.

407
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,250
Speaker 1: So when you normally on a Linux computer a bunch of desktops and they're virtual desktop.

408
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,562
Speaker 1: So you're looking at your screen and you got like two windows open.

409
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:09,570
Speaker 1: you go to virtual desktop number two There's no windows on virtual desktop - then you go back to virtual desktop one.

410
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,574
Speaker 1: There's your two windows.

411
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,964
Speaker 1: you go back to virtual desktop - empty now.

412
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:20,410
Speaker 0: I have often been a person I usually turn off a lot of eye candy because anything I like eye candy as long as it doesn't in any way delay what?

413
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,106
Speaker 0: I'm doing so when I switch desktops, I want it to be just an instantaneous switch.

414
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:29,366
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Except I'd rather have the cube than that because even though it slows me down.

415
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:30,190
Speaker 0: It just looks too cool.

416
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:37,509
Speaker 1: so instead of having a You know just desktops that change there's a spinning cube.

417
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:46,754
Speaker 1: So when you change desktops this cube actually spins around and all the four sides of the cube have your four Desktops on them.

418
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:50,046
Speaker 0: if you have more desktops, it's just a different three-dimensional figure.

419
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:51,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it is.

420
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,123
Speaker 1: I haven't actually tried to make more desktops yet though.

421
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:54,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should try that.

422
00:27:54,251 --> 00:28:03,488
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try that after the show and on the top and bottom of the cube you can put a picture whatever picture you want and It does all sorts of crazy wicked cool shit.

423
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:07,910
Speaker 1: It holy crap and it's not even that hard to make it work in Ubuntu.

424
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:13,324
Speaker 1: I'll link to the guide that says how to make it work in Ubuntu.

425
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,869
Speaker 1: You just add some.

426
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:16,759
Speaker 1: Are we gonna do that?

427
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,749
Speaker 1: every time we say Ubuntu?

428
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:23,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's I think a shtick that just kind of came about and neither one of us said anything about it until just now.

429
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:26,083
Speaker 0: Alright, it's like when our Gilbert Gottfried was on pen show.

430
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:34,638
Speaker 0: great anyway I'm gonna make a Gilbert Gottfried Joe.

431
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:37,590
Speaker 0: No, I think we're getting anything else to say about that.

432
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:44,950
Speaker 1: It's really cool and really easy to set up and you should switch to Ubuntu just to you just so you can use.

433
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:56,286
Speaker 0: it's weird because I'm 50/50 between going to Ubuntu or Going with Gentoo, I think one thing's for certain that whatever distro you choose it will end in two.

434
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:59,060
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, I'm not going to Red Hat.

435
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:07,672
Speaker 1: In fact, it'll end in mmm - It'll be either J and - or Ubuntu.

436
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:13,562
Speaker 0: so since Scott did a quick semi personal tech bit My quick semi personal tech bit is that we are in fact keeping the Mac.

437
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:14,666
Speaker 0: We are not returning it.

438
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,586
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess yeah today tomorrow's last day, isn't it?

439
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:21,446
Speaker 0: Yeah I would have to drive to white planes and return the Mac tomorrow.

440
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,843
Speaker 0: I'm not doing that We're keeping it.

441
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,222
Speaker 1: We're probably just gonna use it as plugged into the TV because it works.

442
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:27,828
Speaker 1: real nice is that function it does.

443
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:28,852
Speaker 0: it is also The.

444
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:33,010
Speaker 0: I'm gonna sync my iPod up to that because I don't want to deal with Banshee and all that.

445
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:44,030
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's a. it's really nice for the downstairs computer and it's going to be our Podcasting on the road box once we find a program to replace garage bad or make boot camp work with Ubuntu.

446
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,282
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is is that?

447
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:54,300
Speaker 1: You know downstairs we had a giant computer Well normal-sized computer and a DVD player and a VCR.

448
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,170
Speaker 1: this little tiny Mac mini replaced all those and it's quieter and quieter.

449
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,932
Speaker 0: It's silent.

450
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:06,613
Speaker 1: This Mac is quieter than our DVD player was and it's a better DVD player than our DVD player and It's a better.

451
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:06,894
Speaker 1: it's.

452
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,070
Speaker 1: it's kind of a better living room PC than our living room PC at least power wise though

453
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:33,829
Speaker 0: I do have some fondness from the DVD player for the DVD player because our first DVD player was an apex That I bought for like $30 and then hacked the firmware to make it region-free Even though we only ever put one non region one disc in it ever and then about seven months later it started overheating and then it died and it.

454
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:39,190
Speaker 0: It was only through the goodness of our friend Yuko's heart that she came forth and bought us a DVD play.

455
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,650
Speaker 1: I think she found one out of like a tag sale for 20 bucks or something.

456
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:48,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, but still it was much nicer than the apex that we had to pull the case off of to make work And it lasted us until now.

457
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:49,721
Speaker 1: so and it still works.

458
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,990
Speaker 1: So if anyone if she wants it back she can have it.

459
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:54,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, otherwise, we'll use it as a prize.

460
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,269
Speaker 1: No You win a DVD player.

461
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:00,209
Speaker 0: It works real great unless you have Netflix.

462
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't read scratch DVDs.

463
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:09,506
Speaker 0: so well, yeah granted I don't fault it too badly for that because some of those Netflix's were real shade.

464
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:10,430
Speaker 1: They were real shady.

465
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:12,055
Speaker 1: We'll see if the Mac has trouble.

466
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:17,312
Speaker 0: but yeah also in general we're techies and we're real up on Windows and we're real up on Linux.

467
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:21,655
Speaker 0: it's good to have a house Mac because that's the thing We really weren't so up on.

468
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:25,530
Speaker 0: and as you can tell we don't know a lot about him other than the BSD nous underneath.

469
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm learning about him real quick.

470
00:31:28,141 --> 00:31:28,382
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:28,824
Speaker 0: We might.

472
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:32,380
Speaker 1: I'm learning that there's a lot of things You can't do without shitty ass shareware.

473
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, be the open source Mac shit.

474
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:39,930
Speaker 0: I got a big talk about the developer culture around OS X and how it's ten years behind the times.

475
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,724
Speaker 1: I mean like there are two nice emulators for NES and SNES games on the Mac.

476
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:55,418
Speaker 1: I don't have any illegal ROMs though, but Yeah, no illegal ROMs here.

477
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:02,130
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and In order to get joysticks to work with these emulators.

478
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,260
Speaker 1: I needed this shareware program called emulator enhancer.

479
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:06,325
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

480
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,240
Speaker 1: not one SNES goddamn one?

481
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,989
Speaker 0: Windows the evil Empire's operating system.

482
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:19,207
Speaker 0: since Windows 3 1 1. if you plug a joystick in there's a widget that just makes the Joystick work in any program.

483
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:22,280
Speaker 1: Yep, - that's a direct actually DirectX thing.

484
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,965
Speaker 1: But yeah go on but -.

485
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:29,200
Speaker 0: ms-dos every program that needed a joystick could just use the joystick on its own.

486
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:34,260
Speaker 0: Three share where has not existed in viable form in almost a decade?

487
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:39,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, it's been over a decade since share where was a viable method of distributing software?

488
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,444
Speaker 0: Shareware is dead.

489
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,432
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as shareware anymore.

490
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,620
Speaker 0: Why are Mac developers making shareware?

491
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,867
Speaker 1: Everything is either closed source freeware or open source.

492
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:55,872
Speaker 0: where or proprietary don't use or pirate way of you punk kids Shareware because there was a time when there was freeware.

493
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,100
Speaker 0: shareware pay where they're all these words?

494
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:01,816
Speaker 0: Shareware was a very specific class of software postcard way.

495
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:12,470
Speaker 0: Yep where you would make a program and either Cripple it after a certain amount of time Cripple it from the start or it would just be the full version.

496
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:19,657
Speaker 0: but it would nag you and it would nag you to Send 10 bucks to rim who wrote this program and then they'll send you the code to unlock it.

497
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,540
Speaker 1: and all Unlocking it would do is make it stop nagging you.

498
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:27,660
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many how many years people used winzip without ever paying for it.

499
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,556
Speaker 1: But every time you had to unzip a file you would have to click.

500
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:36,360
Speaker 1: Yes I agree that you can keep nagging me and it would tell you how many times it nagged you.

501
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:39,431
Speaker 1: Now like a thousand times you've unzipped something.

502
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:45,511
Speaker 0: the open-source software movement made shareware Obsolete because now if people really like things they just donate money.

503
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:48,119
Speaker 0: I mean Scott and I both donated money to open SSH.

504
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,251
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I use SSH every goddamn day.

505
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:52,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, they deserve my money.

506
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:56,530
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, well, we should do our tech news roundup.

507
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:57,092
Speaker 0: Yes.

508
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:57,735
Speaker 0: All right.

509
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,063
Speaker 0: Let's start with WinFS.

510
00:34:00,424 --> 00:34:03,056
Speaker 1: Okay now win FS has a dumb idea.

511
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:06,812
Speaker 0: Well it From an overview it was a good idea.

512
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:11,527
Speaker 0: Let's make an awesome Metadata file system kind of thing for Windows.

513
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,192
Speaker 0: Let's make it awesome.

514
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:15,860
Speaker 0: Let's make it the be-all-end-all of file systems.

515
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,594
Speaker 1: How it riser for is to win.

516
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:20,228
Speaker 0: Yeah Now it wouldn't.

517
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,920
Speaker 0: Microsoft said we're gonna make win FS.

518
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,108
Speaker 0: Microsoft said that about Windows.

519
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:25,529
Speaker 0: what like 98?

520
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:27,315
Speaker 1: No, they said that.

521
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,739
Speaker 1: they said it about Vista.

522
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:32,014
Speaker 0: Well, they said even before they kept saying they were gonna make like.

523
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:36,612
Speaker 1: well, they they had the idea Brewing but for Vista they said we're gonna make win FS.

524
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,820
Speaker 1: and then they said alright, we're gonna make it but not in Vista.

525
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,342
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what?

526
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,045
Speaker 0: I was confused with.

527
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:43,380
Speaker 0: and there's NTFS and then there was the next iteration of NTFS.

528
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,571
Speaker 1: No, that's that's not.

529
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:45,500
Speaker 0: no there was slightly different.

530
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:59,467
Speaker 0: But originally they didn't call it win FS but Microsoft said when they were they were gonna change NTFS and make it add all these things to it and then one by one those features kind of disappeared and And I don't remember that there.

531
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:03,362
Speaker 0: I'll show you an article later about it because I remember I was pissed off Mm-hmm.

532
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:12,403
Speaker 0: Anyway, when FS was gonna be this awesome file system that Microsoft was touting as this is going to be the big thing This is going to be what you will buy Vista for pretty much.

533
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:23,880
Speaker 1: the idea of win FS is that you would have this database of meta information that would Make it real easy to find your documents Even though you you wouldn't have to know where stuff was stored on your drive anymore.

534
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,420
Speaker 1: So gone would be the days of where did I put that file?

535
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:31,700
Speaker 1: C colon backslash documents and settings backslash desktop backslash.

536
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:35,693
Speaker 0: No to to not to pop to people who know how to use computers.

537
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:37,158
Speaker 0: those days have never existed.

538
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:37,880
Speaker 1: That's correct.

539
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,340
Speaker 1: But anyway, but it's all the idiots those days are pretty much constant.

540
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,520
Speaker 1: So the idea this is people would have to browse anymore.

541
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,447
Speaker 1: You would just type in like, you know, it would.

542
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:51,599
Speaker 1: it would be Google desktop, but built into the OS which means, you know No performance hit or anything.

543
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:59,744
Speaker 1: Well, there would be a performance it because it's a big heavy thing you're using but you know It wouldn't be Like a tacked on deal.

544
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:05,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, they they kept reducing the scope of it and now it's completely dead.

545
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:13,553
Speaker 0: It just kind of dwindled away to nothing and now it might Kind of exist a little in a completely different form.

546
00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:15,419
Speaker 0: that is useless and basically a different thing.

547
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,416
Speaker 1: It's like Microsoft said they were gonna do something and they tried and tried and tried.

548
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,140
Speaker 1: they couldn't cut it.

549
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:20,889
Speaker 1: So they pushed it.

550
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,632
Speaker 1: they couldn't cut it So they pushed it back and then now they can't cut it at all.

551
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:26,540
Speaker 1: It's completely useless and crap.

552
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:30,380
Speaker 0: So we'll see what Vista has to offer.

553
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:37,085
Speaker 1: See, I'm really of the camp that if you want to do something like this it should be actually the way Mac does.

554
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:37,326
Speaker 1: it is.

555
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:47,740
Speaker 1: they have that little Sherlock tool or A tool on Linux like s locate where if you want a database if you want meta information on your files You don't put that in the file system.

556
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,940
Speaker 1: the file system should just be a way to arrange data on your hard drive and So the operating system understands it.

557
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,453
Speaker 1: That's what the file system is is efficient and as fast as possible.

558
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:01,962
Speaker 0: if you put all that metadata in a file system That's great.

559
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:07,120
Speaker 0: Then if you take the file off of that computer onto a computer with a different file system, it's all gone.

560
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:11,657
Speaker 1: Well, no, you could say yeah, but the well a different file system.

561
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:12,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all gone.

562
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that yeah, I'm definitely a fan of putting metadata in files or putting metadata in databases.

563
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:35,699
Speaker 1: You know if I want metadata on my music files, I should use iTunes or Banshee or so or Mmdb or whatever it's called and you know You make a database of all that has links to all your files and then has meta information on all your files in it.

564
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,047
Speaker 0: Well, you know what Microsoft.

565
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:40,094
Speaker 0: that's where you have to do now because there's no more WinFS.

566
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:40,957
Speaker 1: That's right.

567
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,844
Speaker 1: I want next That's a good question.

568
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:45,129
Speaker 0: All right, fine Bill Gates.

569
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,960
Speaker 1: Okay, Bill Gates is the richest guy in the world.

570
00:37:48,462 --> 00:37:50,213
Speaker 0: Now who was the second richest guy in the world?

571
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:51,260
Speaker 1: I think it's Warren Buffett.

572
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,219
Speaker 1: I don't know what he does though, even though I know his name.

573
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,360
Speaker 0: Well, he's given most of his money to Bill Gates.

574
00:37:55,902 --> 00:38:01,320
Speaker 1: See the thing is Bill Gates has a lot of money and you know not being a complete evil fuck.

575
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:13,252
Speaker 1: he wants to give most of it away and he decided that curing diseases and Getting rid of things like malaria is the best way he can spend his money And I wouldn't attribute much evil to him at all.

576
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,117
Speaker 0: It's mostly balmer.

577
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,839
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but the point is is that that's hard to argue with that one.

578
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:23,340
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of like, you know anything else that you could pick to spend money to fight against.

579
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:25,366
Speaker 1: Someone might disagree with you.

580
00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:33,835
Speaker 1: You know, if you tried to spend money to fight against the evil Communist regimes then the commies would disagree with you.

581
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:34,780
Speaker 1: All right food.

582
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:36,479
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

583
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,499
Speaker 0: Invest in not letting people starve to death.

584
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:42,590
Speaker 0: No one's gonna disagree with that.

585
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:48,495
Speaker 1: there are people Fucking up because in a you're fucking up economic things.

586
00:38:48,998 --> 00:38:54,944
Speaker 1: be People who are argue with your Franken food and Example for yours.

587
00:38:55,184 --> 00:39:05,843
Speaker 1: There are people who are very much against the curing of diseases, but those are so few I submit that and none of them are large governments that are all Christian scientists.

588
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:12,300
Speaker 0: there are large governments that are very much opposed to research into AIDS because AIDS is God's punishment.

589
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he's not actually doing AIDS at least not right.

590
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,822
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

591
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:20,655
Speaker 1: I haven't seen anything that specifically said he was doing AIDS.

592
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:26,180
Speaker 1: for most of what I seen He's doing the old-world diseases that are still hanging around.

593
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:31,220
Speaker 1: Oh, so, you know malaria typhus mostly African diseases is what he seems to be concentrating on.

594
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,626
Speaker 1: Of course AIDS is a big one there too.

595
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:32,947
Speaker 0: Now.

596
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:36,300
Speaker 0: I wonder if any of this money is gonna go toward the reinstatement of DDT spray.

597
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:37,063
Speaker 1: I don't know.

598
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:45,473
Speaker 1: but the point is is that you know, Bill Gates in a couple years is gonna quit Microsoft Almost completely and spend all his time giving away his money.

599
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:55,020
Speaker 1: And what he said is that you know He could just give away his money pretty easily But he would feel bad if he gave the money to someone who used it poorly, you know.

600
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,284
Speaker 1: Like if he gave his money to someone who then used it to buy mansions and yachts Then he would be upset.

601
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:04,892
Speaker 1: So he set up the get Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

602
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:08,403
Speaker 1: Linda's his wife to give the money away Responsibly.

603
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:11,532
Speaker 1: that way, you know, he can spend me.

604
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:14,299
Speaker 1: he doesn't give money away to fuck tires by accident.

605
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,500
Speaker 1: and Warren Buffett is another incredibly rich guy who also wants to give away his money responsibly.

606
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:23,260
Speaker 1: But it's too hard for him to do that on his own.

607
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:30,000
Speaker 1: So he's just gonna give most of his money to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that way that it's given away responsibly.

608
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:39,970
Speaker 0: Yep, I gotta say I very much like this whole thing because it really harkens back to the that You know the old robber barons and the super-rich people all through the history.

609
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,480
Speaker 0: and now they'd always do great philanthropic things too.

610
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,456
Speaker 0: You know, let's make Rockefeller Center or something like that.

611
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:48,185
Speaker 1: Yep It's they actually.

612
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,220
Speaker 1: some other podcast mentioned those guys all in the same breath, you know.

613
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I'd like to see people who have that sort of wealth at least trying to do good with it.

614
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:16,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always said that you know if I had you know, let's see what if I had like a you know a house Ferrari all the computers I needed and enough money to live the rest of my life with interest and all that good stuff That every other penny I got I would either give I would give away either to family friends or charity.

615
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:19,440
Speaker 1: Because you know, there's only so much money that I need more money.

616
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:27,167
Speaker 1: I've already got everything, you know, if I've got a home theater a Ferrari not a mansion, but I don't need more Only a boat but that's it.

617
00:41:27,649 --> 00:41:29,314
Speaker 1: That's the end any more than that.

618
00:41:29,414 --> 00:41:34,248
Speaker 1: I could buy all that with a few million dollars Billion dollars, I wouldn't know what the fuck to do with it.

619
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:36,856
Speaker 0: Don't you buy a personal ball washer?

620
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,779
Speaker 0: That's right.

621
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,971
Speaker 1: No, just one the Ferrari.

622
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:42,292
Speaker 1: it's all.

623
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:44,159
Speaker 1: you need one car Ferrari the end.

624
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:50,578
Speaker 1: But you know, I might buy things like an f1 team, but even that is only 200 million dollars.

625
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,625
Speaker 1: So what the fuck am I gonna do?

626
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:53,949
Speaker 1: the billion dollars?

627
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,294
Speaker 1: I buy a business.

628
00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:57,000
Speaker 0: I would do you know what I would do?

629
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:05,060
Speaker 0: I'd go around the world looking for people who seem as cool as the front row And then get them all live together in a giant place.

630
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:08,755
Speaker 1: Not only that but even that is only a hundred million dollars at most.

631
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:13,620
Speaker 0: if you do it crazily I could live the life of hedonism bot until I died of a ripe old age.

632
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:18,780
Speaker 1: You couldn't spend a billion dollars if you were hedonism, but I bet I could spend a billion dollars.

633
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,314
Speaker 1: Hedonism bot could not spend a billion dollars on hedonism.

634
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,952
Speaker 1: I guarantee it Unless you got a billion.

635
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:28,462
Speaker 1: one dollar whores What?

636
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:29,927
Speaker 0: or one ten dollar hooker?

637
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,780
Speaker 1: about ten dollar ten cent or ten billion ten cent whores?

638
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:45,640
Speaker 1: If it weren't so late I'd pull up that bender quote, I know right Anyway, but yeah, I like you know, you got to realize that if you giving away a little bit of money It's real easy to give it away.

639
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,020
Speaker 1: You just toss the United Way bin give it to your favorite local charity.

640
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:50,868
Speaker 1: Even a church will probably do something.

641
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:51,511
Speaker 1: Okay with it.

642
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,535
Speaker 1: Most of the time except for a Catholic Church They'll just buy gold with it.

643
00:42:56,221 --> 00:42:58,432
Speaker 0: But no, no, cuz they sell it to the gnomes of Zurich.

644
00:42:58,693 --> 00:42:59,779
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, you know.

645
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:05,160
Speaker 1: But even the Salvation Army will probably do something good, but they give up not the Salvation Army.

646
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,060
Speaker 1: Well, they might know, you know, they will buy one Bible to give to you know, someone instead of giving them food.

647
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:12,306
Speaker 1: But they'll also buy a food.

648
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,960
Speaker 0: No, they buy like a hundred Bibles for every one food.

649
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:18,440
Speaker 0: I did if you'd said anything about the Salvation Army would let it slide.

650
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:20,280
Speaker 0: The Salvation Army is a terrible.

651
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,559
Speaker 1: Well, if you think about it if you give them a dollar and they buy ten Bibles for every one food It's like giving them ten cents.

652
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:32,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're not getting your money's worth, but at least you're getting something now cuz I have other reasons to dislike them.

653
00:43:32,642 --> 00:43:37,530
Speaker 1: yeah, but there are worse places to give it like The revive Hitler fund exactly.

654
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,394
Speaker 0: It's always a bad place.

655
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:39,620
Speaker 1: revive Hitler fund is bad.

656
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:44,910
Speaker 1: What are those guys from that South Park episode?

657
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,518
Speaker 1: Oh NAMBLA don't give it to NAMBLA.

658
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:55,740
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, there are worse places you could give it but there are also many better places you can give it.

659
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

660
00:43:57,405 --> 00:44:09,400
Speaker 0: I got a quick aside news and we're gonna talk about this much more on Wednesday But I figured since I was interrupted right now about this and we seem to have a streak of people Talking to us while we're doing the show so we get semi live updates here.

661
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:16,838
Speaker 0: Jim Vowles of Otacon would like to remind all of you who are thinking of attending Otacon that you should pre-register now.

662
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:22,100
Speaker 0: So you get the $10 discount that ends on the 4th of July.

663
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:28,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're going to Otacon get your pre-registration in it'll save you ten bucks.

664
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:30,049
Speaker 1: We should probably just say that on Wednesday.

665
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I figured I'd say it right now, okay?

666
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,360
Speaker 0: It'll explain why Scott talked a whole bunch of time, and I didn't make fun of him or anything for a couple minutes.

667
00:44:39,283 --> 00:44:44,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you have a shit ton of money to give away It's not as easy as just dumping it in a charity bin somewhere.

668
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:46,850
Speaker 1: You've got to make sure you don't give it to a fucktard.

669
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,938
Speaker 1: and at least Bill Gates is smart enough to realize that.

670
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:55,901
Speaker 1: yeah And so is Warren Buffett who is even cooler in my eyes because he realized it and he realized he didn't want to deal with It.

671
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:59,180
Speaker 1: so he does have someone else do all the work, and now he gets all the credit.

672
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:12,676
Speaker 0: All right, we got another quickie here Belgium the government of Belgium the country from which a good portion of my blood is from Originally like little tiny thing that's in between France and Germany in the north that Hitler ran through.

673
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:13,338
Speaker 1: yeah that thing.

674
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:13,840
Speaker 0: yeah.

675
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:21,940
Speaker 0: the country that has the French half and the Flemish half and The Flemish half don't like the French half, but they all speak English, so it doesn't matter.

676
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:24,508
Speaker 0: Anyway, I like Belgium.

677
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,143
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guys who fucked up Africa Yeah, I mean the.

678
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:41,752
Speaker 0: if you rank the colonial powers in terms of how horrible they were to the native people The French were probably the best in terms of treating them, and then you know under them It's like the British and and the Spanish were pretty much.

679
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,984
Speaker 0: most people think Spanish are at the bottom because they were Other than the Portuguese.

680
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:49,560
Speaker 0: the Portuguese and the Spanish were just horrible horrible conquistador type people.

681
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:57,018
Speaker 0: But they got nothing on the Belgians, but you read up on some of the things Belgium did to their colony people.

682
00:45:57,078 --> 00:46:00,479
Speaker 0: yeah Anyway, Belgium has gone open source.

683
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,187
Speaker 1: Well, they're not going open source.

684
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:06,500
Speaker 1: It's for any of their document formats used in government.

685
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,646
Speaker 1: They're going to use an open document format.

686
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,033
Speaker 1: Yeah, specifically the open document format.

687
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,885
Speaker 0: It's a big step I Think in general.

688
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:15,053
Speaker 0: It's a big step toward.

689
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:18,490
Speaker 1: You know open source I think a lot of technology a lot of non tech.

690
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,057
Speaker 1: people don't really understand this problem.

691
00:46:20,097 --> 00:46:20,800
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

692
00:46:21,284 --> 00:46:22,957
Speaker 1: Let's say the government decides.

693
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:31,850
Speaker 1: Let's say you have a government of a country and that government uses Microsoft Word documents for all government computer documents.

694
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:40,491
Speaker 1: now government things is supposed to be public things like laws things like Forms to fill out all these things that must be public.

695
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:43,200
Speaker 1: so anyone supposed to be able to get them for free.

696
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:44,386
Speaker 1: Cuz it's your government.

697
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,794
Speaker 1: your taxes paid for it already.

698
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:50,152
Speaker 1: It's free for you If it's in Microsoft Word document format.

699
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:54,868
Speaker 1: in order for you to do anything with it You need Microsoft Word which costs money.

700
00:46:54,888 --> 00:46:58,780
Speaker 1: This is like if a government decides to use Microsoft Word.

701
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:02,852
Speaker 1: They're basically saying if you want access to your government.

702
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:05,300
Speaker 1: You have to pay this company money.

703
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:11,740
Speaker 1: I mean imagine if the government highways said only Ford cars can drive here.

704
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:15,600
Speaker 1: That's what it's like if the government uses Microsoft Word documents.

705
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:19,497
Speaker 1: Yep, it's the same as if they made highways were only Ford cars could drive.

706
00:47:19,517 --> 00:47:24,060
Speaker 0: in fact I ran into this problem directly a little while ago my friend Katsu.

707
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:30,744
Speaker 0: I wanted to give his resume to my company and my company would only accept it in Microsoft doc format.

708
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:38,163
Speaker 0: none of us have Microsoft Office, so he made an open office which wasn't fully Compatible.

709
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:41,839
Speaker 0: I'd open it in Word at work and twiddle with it to make it look right.

710
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:48,453
Speaker 1: yeah I only have word on my work computer and I you know the only times I really use it are for work.

711
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:49,296
Speaker 1: shit because no one.

712
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,439
Speaker 1: they use stupid office.

713
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:57,559
Speaker 1: and Also if I need to convert something to a format for cousin it for an idiot who doesn't use another open format.

714
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:08,414
Speaker 1: now With an open format like open document format or some XML for which is an XML format But any other open format like text or anything open generally means XML.

715
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,740
Speaker 0: Yes, ml does not necessarily mean open.

716
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:13,353
Speaker 1: No, well open doesn't always mean XML.

717
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, but these days it seems to Concerning document formats.

718
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:22,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, they seem to be using XML mostly but That means that you know.

719
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:27,660
Speaker 1: sure open office is the program that is mostly associated with the open document format.

720
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:36,760
Speaker 1: But because it's an open format, which means everyone in the world knows how these files work Anyone can write a program that can read these files.

721
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:46,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know if Microsoft Office reads them, but I think Abby word reads them and You can just read it with just about all kinds of different free software.

722
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:51,400
Speaker 0: So in fact it because it's so documented you could just write something to read them.

723
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 1: So if the government uses open document format then you can drive any car you want on the road.

724
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:02,538
Speaker 1: You could drive an expensive car like my you know, Microsoft Office maybe with a plug-in.

725
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:03,100
Speaker 1: I don't know.

726
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:06,054
Speaker 1: I don't even know if that works cuz I don't use Microsoft Office.

727
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:09,691
Speaker 1: or you can use Open office, which is free.

728
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:11,460
Speaker 1: You can use Abby word, which is free.

729
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,677
Speaker 1: You can use all sorts of things and they're all free.

730
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:14,757
Speaker 1: now.

731
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:23,832
Speaker 0: One of the reasons Microsoft is so against this and it's something I've run into a lot just in the work I've done is that the main reason cut the primary reasons.

732
00:49:23,892 --> 00:49:29,608
Speaker 0: companies can't just move all of their Menial computer users to a lockdown.

733
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:40,059
Speaker 0: Linux is that one they need to interface with other companies and the primary ways Small and medium-sized companies interface with other small medium-sized companies is through Microsoft Word.

734
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:48,919
Speaker 1: Yes They have to excel they use off access they have Microsoft Exchange servers with Microsoft Outlook and they email each other Microsoft documents.

735
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:56,559
Speaker 1: and because they've been doing this so long they have all these existing documents that they still need access to.

736
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:06,819
Speaker 1: and if Even if you start a new company Even if you decided to use open office and open document formats the other companies don't see you need office to communicate with them.

737
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,239
Speaker 1: So you would really need to get all the companies to switch.

738
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:20,467
Speaker 1: But if the government switched then everyone would need open office or something to commute to Interact with the government which every company has to do.

739
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:47,340
Speaker 1: also if people did that then they might be able to phase over to an open document format convert their word documents over time and eventually give Microsoft the boot because office is really their biggest moneymaker still right now and Open document format could kick its ass, especially if more governments adopted and mandated Which is what they should do being good open governments and not evil Tyrannical governments.

740
00:50:50,342 --> 00:51:06,040
Speaker 1: So, I hope that people who didn't understand this issue now have a clear understanding of why any good open democratic Government and not a communist dictatorship needs to use open document formats to not be tyrannical.

741
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:11,240
Speaker 0: All right, and on that note, I think that should wrap up our tech news roundup.
