1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,980
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 14th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,160
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about our experience at UberCon.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,958
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,320
Speaker 0: So, today, in lieu of doing our normal bit of having news and all that sort of thing, we're just going to cover our experiences at UberCon.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,380
Speaker 1: Expect this to happen for many, many weeks to come as we go to many, many cons, and thus devote entire shows to them.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,459
Speaker 0: Yes, and not all cons get a whole show, but, UberCon, one day of UberCon was enough to give us an entire show.

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,720
Speaker 1: Mostly because we did some awesome things there.

8
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:44,964
Speaker 0: Yep.

9
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:48,320
Speaker 0: So UberCon, for those of you who may not know, is a gaming convention primarily.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,120
Speaker 1: It happens, I think, two times a year?

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,720
Speaker 0: Yep, twice a year, usually in the wintery time.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,540
Speaker 0: It's in North Jersey, near the Meadowlands, and it's about an hour, hour and a half drive for us, so we just went for the day of Saturday.

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,660
Speaker 0: We didn't want to get a hotel room, we didn't want a pre-reg or anything.

14
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:04,289
Speaker 1: It was much cheaper that way.

15
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:10,280
Speaker 1: I mean, it was still forty bucks for a day, which is quite a bit considering some cons are forty dollars for all the three days.

16
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:12,679
Speaker 1: But, it was worth it.

17
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,420
Speaker 1: Well, gaming cons- Especially since we didn't pay for hotels or anything.

18
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:21,520
Speaker 0: In general, gaming cons tend to be more expensive than any other type of con, just because they actually provide a lot more to you.

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,280
Speaker 0: There's not so much of that people milling around doing nothing.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,920
Speaker 0: Everyone there wants to be doing something, or they get pissed.

21
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:28,060
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, that's true.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,780
Speaker 0: You also gotta buy a lot more equipment.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,060
Speaker 0: A lot more stuff, all that sort of thing.

24
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:33,579
Speaker 1: You know, like games.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,580
Speaker 1: And there's a lot more insurance because games and things get broken and all kinds of crap.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,032
Speaker 0: Yep.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,000
Speaker 1: So, whatever.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,420
Speaker 0: So we drove down there, we registered, and registration was probably the most painless registration I've ever had of any con ever.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,420
Speaker 0: We just walked in, I didn't have to do anything.

30
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,616
Speaker 0: I said my name, they said, "Oh, you've been here

31
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:53,020
Speaker 0: before."

32
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,980
Speaker 0: And they just took my money and gave me another badge.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,820
Speaker 1: The best part was I hadn't been there before, so I had to fill a little piece of paper.

35
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,920
Speaker 1: And then they took my money and gave me a badge.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,519
Speaker 1: Actually, they almost forgot to take my money, but I reminded them.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,120
Speaker 1: But, yeah, apparently the guy who is a, I forgot his name.

38
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's the head of Stonekeep.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, Stonekeep, I think, registration, Convention Registration Solutions or something.

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're basically a little company that makes registration stuff for conventions.

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,119
Speaker 1: Well, they made a registration solution.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, they provide registration services.

43
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:32,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they have a system of taking names and money and printing out these awesome real cards for conventions.

44
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:36,239
Speaker 1: And if you won't have a convention, you can hire them to do it for you.

45
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,620
Speaker 0: And he seems to do a very good job.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,400
Speaker 0: I mean, I know Otacon considered using them in the past and turned them down, and I really don't know why, but I'm real impressed with the way they do their business.

47
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:50,160
Speaker 1: I really like the cards, the quality of the cards and the quality of the computer setup.

48
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,649
Speaker 1: Yep.

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,239
Speaker 1: The remembering of previous conventions, I think that's all really, really cool, and that's the way it should be.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,187
Speaker 0: Plus, the guy who was running all this was sitting around, and we ended up having food with him for dinner, and he's a really cool dude.

51
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,660
Speaker 0: I can't believe I forgot his name.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, he went to RIT also.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, like before we were even born.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, he went to RIT in 1982, and we were born in 1982, and we went to RIT in 2000.

55
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,920
Speaker 0: He's describing buildings as new that we thought of as the old crap buildings they were going to get rid of.

56
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he was in Computer Science House like the second or third year of it.

57
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,959
Speaker 0: Yep, it was fun.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,140
Speaker 0: I can't believe I forgot his name, but I don't feel bad because I forgot the names of most of the people I met at this con.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,140
Speaker 0: And I only remember the two I'm going to mention because I have their business cards in front of me.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should have taken his business card.

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,768
Speaker 1: I'm sure he can find it at his website.

62
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,920
Speaker 1: I think it was at stonekeep.com or something like that.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll find him.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,500
Speaker 1: If it's not stonekeep.com and there's something bad at stonekeep.com, don't blame me.

65
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:53,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we go in then, and I guess I knew what to expect because I've been to gaming cons before, but I think Scott and our friend Peter came with us.

66
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,980
Speaker 0: We were a little bit underwhelmed at first.

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Speaker 1: Well, I knew what was going to go on there, but it was much smaller than I thought it would be.

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,478
Speaker 0: Just a few rooms.

69
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:15,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I figured there would be a lot more... I mean, the gaming library, like the pile of board games, was about the size I expected, but the number of tables and space was a lot less than I thought.

70
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:23,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the main reason for that was simply that this con moved hotels, and this hotel wasn't as good as the previous hotel, in my opinion.

71
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, this hotel, I mean, it looked like they had panels in the pool.

72
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really did have panels in the pool.

73
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,340
Speaker 1: So that's not good at all.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,940
Speaker 0: They used pretty much every room they could use, and every game we played, it was just a cacophony constantly.

75
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:43,480
Speaker 0: We failed at learning to play a game, a first for us, because of that, which we'll get into later.

76
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the first thing we did was we were supposed to be a burning wheel demo at 10, and that's what we really wanted to do, was try out this burning wheel RPG system.

77
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:00,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've mentioned a lot, but it's something that I demoed the combat for last year at UberCon with the same dude, Luke Crane, and I thought it was awesome.

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,198
Speaker 0: And this year, since I was bringing two of my friends with me, I figured, "Alright, let's do it with YouTube so you can see how awesome it was, and I won't just feel like I'm

79
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:08,499
Speaker 0: crazy.".

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,289
Speaker 1: Yep, so it was supposed to be at 10, I go at 10, and the guy said, he was doing it for two other guys, and he said, "Come back at

81
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,421
Speaker 1: 10.30.".

82
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,160
Speaker 1: So we hung out around, you know, looking around the con, which took about five minutes.

83
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, we ran across many scary people.

84
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,700
Speaker 1: That's what gaming cons have, scary people.

85
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I'm really used to anime cons, and I forget, but in an anime con, I'd say the ratio of cool people to normal people to scary people is heavily weighted toward cool and normal people.

86
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,560
Speaker 1: I'd say for every 10 people at an anime con, you'll have one or two cool people.

87
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,839
Speaker 0: By cool, we mean, like, you know, someone you go, "Oh, that's that guy," something like that.

88
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:53,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe five or six, you know, normal people, and then, like, one or two schlubby, nasty people.

89
00:05:54,062 --> 00:06:02,858
Speaker 0: There were quite a number of quite large individuals with quite odiferous zones of control wandering about like blimps.

90
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,940
Speaker 1: I'd say the con, the gaming con is pretty much half disgusting people, half not disgusting people.

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,616
Speaker 1: And cool people, a handful.

92
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:21,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we ran across, like, there was a lot of cool things, like, I forget his name, but one of the writers who kind of took over the work of Lovecraft after he died.

93
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,091
Speaker 1: He was a guest of the con, I think.

94
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:23,695
Speaker 1: He's C.J.

95
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:24,400
Speaker 1: Henderson, I think.

96
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was his name.

97
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,755
Speaker 0: Cool dude, he was like, "Hey, check out my books,

98
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:28,876
Speaker 0: woo.".

99
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:33,100
Speaker 0: And then we ran into this thing called Scared on Staten Island.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,339
Speaker 1: Now, at first I thought it might be like, "Ooh, you go there and, you know, you have fun in some old building or

101
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:40,620
Speaker 1: something.".

102
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had this video and it showed people, like, wandering around with little electronic devices, looking for things.

103
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaker 0: It looked like some sort of cool LARP-type infiltration thing.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought

105
00:06:48,981 --> 00:07:02,839
Speaker 1: it was maybe like a LARP, like, that involved some sort of ghosts, and, like, you would carry these devices around, and then they set up things in the building on Staten Island to make them go off, to make you think there are ghosts there, and then you're supposed to do stuff based on that.

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we stood there watching the video to see what it was all about, and you know what?

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,180
Speaker 0: Just for Andy, it's just frickin', they think there's ghosts and they're hunting them, they're like paranormal investigator bullshit.

108
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,500
Speaker 1: You know, it didn't even seem like the people selling it actually thought there were ghosts.

109
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:21,299
Speaker 1: It just seemed like they wanted you to think there were ghosts, and they were selling some amusement thing.

110
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:26,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, they talked a lot about the equipment they used to detect ghosts, and oh my god.

111
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just a bunch of bullshit trying to take money from people, you know.

112
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:36,340
Speaker 0: I mean, I won't blame UberCon, because I guess anyone who pays them money will get some space there.

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like they paid a lot of money and they weren't getting a lot of attention, so I think that worked out well.

114
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:41,376
Speaker 0: Yes.

115
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:49,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you see anything called Scared on Staten Island or Scared Anywhere, and it looks like that, don't do it.

116
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:50,660
Speaker 1: It's just a waste of your money.

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,320
Speaker 1: So, then we did the Burning Wheel demo.

118
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was awesome.

119
00:07:58,523 --> 00:07:59,080
Speaker 1: Very awesome.

120
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:07,300
Speaker 0: Now we're gonna do a whole show separate on Burning Wheel at some point, because there's just too much to say about it, and we'd really like to get the creator of it on the show.

121
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,579
Speaker 1: And we'd like to get our books.

122
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,740
Speaker 0: Yes, we actually, we all ordered the books for Burning Wheel the day after we got back from the con.

123
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,700
Speaker 0: We didn't order them that night for reasons that we'll get into at the end of this show.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,980
Speaker 1: So we're gonna avoid talking about the system itself, and we'll just talk about the game we actually played, and what happened in those games.

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,478
Speaker 1: So, the demo was three characters, which just fit us like, whoa.

126
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a conniving little scrawny thief guy, Scott.

127
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,568
Speaker 1: It wasn't a scrawny thief guy, it was a- Two little knives!

128
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,019
Speaker 0: You could maybe poke me a little bit.

129
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,836
Speaker 1: It was a wicked knife criminal, like, guy.

130
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, some criminal.

131
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,700
Speaker 1: On his path, like, if he got levels, I guess, whatever it is, he would have become like a mafia something.

132
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:56,140
Speaker 0: I was a froofy elf trying to get back the sword of his father.

134
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:57,039
Speaker 1: Froofy elf.

135
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,380
Speaker 0: And our friend Pete was a freaking dwarf with a big sword who also wanted the other sword.

136
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:05,120
Speaker 1: It's the same as always.

137
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:10,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and basically, Luke Crane, the guy who made Burning Wheel, was running these demos.

138
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he's the guy who made it.

139
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, he is.

140
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:17,740
Speaker 0: And he set up this demo, basically, just to kinda show off how the system works.

141
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,480
Speaker 0: And it was set up so that there was conflict in the party right away.

142
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:32,780
Speaker 0: All three of us had goals, only one of us was gonna get our goal, and it showed us the various systems within the game that allow conflict between characters or role players to be resolved.

143
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,639
Speaker 0: And it worked really well.

144
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,304
Speaker 1: All too well.

145
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:41,319
Speaker 1: I guess that's what happens when something is, you know, set up.

146
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,020
Speaker 0: Well, I think one thing that really helped it is that Luke is one hell of a dungeon master, and he really gets into it.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:59,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, he definitely does get all over it, but at the same time, it makes it seem like being the GM in a Burning Wheel game is either a whole lot of work, or like you kinda have to get into it, or else it, you know.

148
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:04,679
Speaker 0: Well, it depends a lot on what you're doing, 'cause I could see a game of Burning Wheel where you don't even need a GM.

149
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:15,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like at one hand you can go with a lazy GM, but on the other hand, the GM needs to be awesome and know everything about the game in order, you know, it's kind of a weird, you know, I don't know.

150
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, part of that might be the fact that we don't know the system yet.

151
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:18,478
Speaker 1: Yeah.

152
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,340
Speaker 0: So we definitely relied on him to tell us when to pick up dice.

153
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,885
Speaker 1: Well, we know it, we just don't know all the details.

154
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:27,260
Speaker 1: We know the very general, we know enough to play if the GM can handle everything else for us.

155
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 0: But we don't know, like, alright, when is this skill applicable, how many dice do I pick up and throw against this, how many successes do I need, blah blah blah.

156
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,600
Speaker 1: It seemed like when this skill is applicable is sort of subjective to me.

157
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I saw a lot of times, I mean, here's an example of something that happened.

158
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:54,140
Speaker 0: Most role-playing game systems seem to be set up where the only game mechanic that is used to resolve conflicts other than role-playing is combat, fighting with people.

159
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,859
Speaker 0: Imagine if there were a combat-like system for characters arguing with each other.

160
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,500
Speaker 1: So you can resolve conflicts non-violently with dice and role-playing combined.

161
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,858
Speaker 0: It, we'll explain that in greater detail, but it basically- In some other show, yeah.

162
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:18,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, the main thing this seems to do is that, one, I tend to play, I'm very charismatic, I role-play really well, I'm not trying to, you know, oh, but yeah.

163
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:25,420
Speaker 0: And I often would end up playing a character with a very low charisma, especially at cons or whatever.

164
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,080
Speaker 0: But I'd end up talking circles around someone else and playing a character that had a much higher charisma than my character actually had.

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,559
Speaker 0: This prevents all that bullshit, and you're, you can only do what your character can do.

166
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,201
Speaker 0: Yep.

167
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,330
Speaker 1: So, uh, what happened in the game first?

168
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:45,059
Speaker 1: I just, they were arguing about who should take the sword and I just went and took it.

169
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:45,609
Speaker 0: Yep.

170
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,499
Speaker 1: And then they tried to physically stop me.

171
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:48,540
Speaker 0: And he ran away.

172
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,640
Speaker 1: And I ran away, and then I couldn't run away all the way, and get it, escape.

173
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,859
Speaker 0: And then we had the argument, and this is when the dice came out.

174
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:05,280
Speaker 0: It was me, the elf, and Pete the dwarf, arguing within the confines of this game mechanic on who should actually, who is the rightful owner of the sword.

175
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:18,900
Speaker 0: And the way it works, basically, to simplify really, really, really broadly, is that you make a point, or a butler or whatever, and you have to role-play it a little bit, but if you make a point, no matter what you say, it only counts as a point action.

176
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,608
Speaker 0: Like, point, it's my fucking sword, you asshole.

177
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,260
Speaker 0: Or point, something cool that I say in a first-person role-playing way.

178
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,839
Speaker 0: Then I roll dice to see how effective that is.

179
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,548
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if you're gonna make a point, or you're gonna make a rebuttal, or you're gonna make a, you know, an instigate, or whatever you're gonna do, you have to actually role-play it.

180
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,239
Speaker 0: If you can't come up with it, you can't do it.

181
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:45,900
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it doesn't matter so much how well you do it verbally, because all that matters is how well your character would have been able to do it.

182
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,248
Speaker 1: And then, the other cool thing is, people can help you out.

183
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:56,227
Speaker 1: Like, when Rym and Pete were arguing, I didn't really want either of them to win, I wanted them to just kind of bring each other down.

184
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,517
Speaker 1: And, you know, like, they both hurt each other, and then I can kill whoever's left.

185
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:00,580
Speaker 1: Easily.

186
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,980
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, oh yeah, make both of you, make each other weaker, and then one guy will eventually lose, and I can pick off the weak guy, because I'm unharmed.

187
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,440
Speaker 1: But, so what I did is, when they were arguing, they would make points at each other, or whatever.

188
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,660
Speaker 0: And he'd help back and forth, like, he'd help Pete with a point, then he'd help me with a point, and we'd just whittle each other down that way.

189
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,920
Speaker 1: And so when you help someone, you give them a dice, and it's pretty cool.

190
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:32,600
Speaker 0: Now, the main thing, the main effect this seems to have on the game is that, whenever there's a conflict, it's broken down into incredibly abstract terms.

191
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:37,560
Speaker 0: I mean, probably more abstract than any system I've ever played before.

192
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:54,520
Speaker 0: Basically, if you have a conflict, character A wants X, character B wants Y, instead of having to, you know, dance around it within a system, you just, alright, open up the conflict rules, I want this, I want this, you resolve it so that now you know what the end result is.

193
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,953
Speaker 0: No matter what happens, this is the result.

194
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,620
Speaker 0: This is the person who will win the conflict.

195
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,719
Speaker 0: And then you can roleplay it all out from there.

196
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:08,039
Speaker 0: So you don't have to worry about technicalities, or, "Oh, if I just fail, I'll try again," like people tend to do in D&D.

197
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:09,540
Speaker 0: It's just resolved.

198
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,759
Speaker 0: Scott ran away from us, me and Pete, with the sword.

199
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:14,360
Speaker 0: And he got away.

200
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,840
Speaker 0: So we could chase him for, pretty much, over and over and over again, but he'd always get away, because we'd already resolved that, plot-wise, he'll get away.

201
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Speaker 0: So we have to try to resolve this in another manner.

202
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:28,060
Speaker 1: And then we already resolved that I would not escape.

203
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,900
Speaker 1: So we would roleplay me escaping a little bit.

204
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Speaker 1: And if we wanted to, we could roleplay me escaping a little bit more.

205
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,480
Speaker 1: But I would never escape all the way, because you already found out that I'm not going to escape all the way.

206
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:51,080
Speaker 0: So it seems to remove a lot of this meta-game kind of crap, and just forces you to play your character right there, deal with the conflict, and I really can't explain how beautiful it is, you just have to play it.

207
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like how on the character sheet it says your beliefs and your instincts.

208
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:57,059
Speaker 1: It's like, here's what you're going to do.

209
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,880
Speaker 1: There's no more having a problem where you don't know what your character wants, or having to think it up.

210
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,300
Speaker 1: It's right there on the paper.

211
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,092
Speaker 0: Yep.

212
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:18,440
Speaker 0: Now, the way combat and all these things seem to work is that you have a piece of paper, and they have a piece of paper, and you choose your actions, but you choose them simultaneously with the other person knowing.

213
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,420
Speaker 0: So you choose your action and the next two actions in the future.

214
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,918
Speaker 0: Then you both reveal your sheets and play it out.

215
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:28,800
Speaker 0: So it's real quick, it's real brutal.

216
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,880
Speaker 0: Two people fighting with a sword does not last long, because someone gets stabbed and bleeds right away.

217
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:34,897
Speaker 1: Stabbed in the face.

218
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 1: Alright, let's leave any further details for another show.

219
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll talk about this again at the end of this show, when we describe at least the game we played.

220
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,520
Speaker 0: Because we played a demo in the morning, and then at night we played a full-on, story-based game with a whole bunch of other people.

221
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:56,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, the demo was just for us to figure out how the system works and whether we liked it, and then the night time was actually a game of real.

222
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,119
Speaker 0: Night time is the night time.

223
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:07,736
Speaker 0: Ah, nice interruption.

224
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,260
Speaker 0: Let's do some things of the day and then get back to UberCon.

225
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,899
Speaker 1: So since it's, uh, it gets Tuesday, right?

226
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,100
Speaker 1: So there's games, but we're not going to do any video games, really.

227
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,260
Speaker 1: But I have a thing of the day related to video games.

228
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,499
Speaker 0: This is actually kind of cool.

229
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,879
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if you've played Kung Fu for the NES.

230
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:31,760
Speaker 1: It's a game where this guy just basically walks sideways, and when bad guys come up to him, you punch or kick them.

231
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,260
Speaker 0: It's one of the original, original Nintendo games.

232
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,180
Speaker 1: Original, original, it's real hard.

233
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,180
Speaker 0: Like before the MMC chips, Nintendo games.

234
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, this ran on the same chip that, like, baseball, and, um, ice hockey, and...

235
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,998
Speaker 0: Ice climbers.

236
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, Metroid.

237
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:48,600
Speaker 1: Well, not Metroid 1.

238
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,558
Speaker 0: No, Metroid was an MMC.

239
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like one of the first ones, though.

240
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,332
Speaker 0: Yes, I think it was the first one.

241
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:54,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway.

242
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:54,703
Speaker 0: Maybe.

243
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:56,259
Speaker 1: It's really old.

244
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,660
Speaker 1: And some guy took, uh, Kung Fu, and in Flash, he made Kung Fu the Remix.

245
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,839
Speaker 0: It's like an OC Remix, only it's an actual remix of a video game instead of video game music.

246
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,020
Speaker 1: So it plays just like Kung Fu, except the bad guy is a little different.

247
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,000
Speaker 1: And he added an awesome plot with some pixel art.

248
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,319
Speaker 1: And he added some new moves.

249
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,180
Speaker 1: So, like, after you beat level one, you get the Haruken, and you can use it.

250
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:22,339
Speaker 1: And it's pretty awesome.

251
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,299
Speaker 1: And, like, when you jump kick guys, their heads come off.

252
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:27,500
Speaker 1: And... yeah.

253
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,500
Speaker 1: It's a whole lot, it's a lot more fun than the original Kung Fu, I'd say.

254
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,260
Speaker 1: It's a little hard to control with the keyboard, but you can kind of customize the keys a little bit.

255
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,560
Speaker 1: The music, I love the music a lot, because it feels like old arcade game music, you know?

256
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,405
Speaker 1: That's all awesome.

257
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:43,840
Speaker 1: I like that kind of sounding stuff.

258
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,479
Speaker 1: But, uh, it's real, it's really, really hard.

259
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,216
Speaker 1: Like, even on easy mode, it's hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.

260
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:50,759
Speaker 1: I couldn't beat...

261
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,425
Speaker 0: Well, good.

262
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:53,300
Speaker 0: The original Kung Fu was hard, as well.

263
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,720
Speaker 1: It's harder than the original Kung Fu, even on easy mode.

264
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,232
Speaker 1: I couldn't beat more than level one.

265
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:57,980
Speaker 1: Level two, I died.

266
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:01,799
Speaker 1: So, um... have fun.

267
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,163
Speaker 0: Alright.

268
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:11,818
Speaker 0: So, I don't know how many of you have lived with cats before, but... Well, a lot of people, a lot of the front row crew types, always laugh, "Oh, Rim, he likes the cat

269
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:12,120
Speaker 0: girls.".

270
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:12,865
Speaker 0: But, honestly?

271
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,960
Speaker 0: I really don't like cats that much.

272
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,779
Speaker 1: You like the fox girls and whatever.

273
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

274
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,380
Speaker 0: But I really don't like cats that much.

275
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,540
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't dislike cats, but I always get the feeling that most cats are barely aware that I even exist.

276
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,860
Speaker 0: And this was fortified by having to live with some cats for a while when I was on co-op a long time ago.

277
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,700
Speaker 0: But, anyway... Do you know how cats seem to react to things in strange ways?

278
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,340
Speaker 0: Well, this is a video that basically proves to me that cats are automatons.

279
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:50,180
Speaker 0: Because if you put a piece of tape on a cat in different places, the cat will... you can control the cat with tape, basically.

280
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,139
Speaker 0: Just watch the video, you'll see what I mean.

281
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,080
Speaker 1: I think, basically, what the video teaches us is that cats move based on their feeling and not based on looking with their eyeballs.

282
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,060
Speaker 1: Like, if a cat feels a wall on its left, it'll go to the right.

283
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Speaker 1: So you put a piece of tape on the left side of the cat, it thinks it's touching something on the left, and it wants to get away from that, so it goes to the right.

284
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:14,654
Speaker 0: This did remind me of our friend James and Lisa.

285
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:15,880
Speaker 0: They had a cat named Lily.

286
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,537
Speaker 0: And they would stick a little hair clip to her tail, and that was the end of her.

287
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,240
Speaker 0: She couldn't walk.

288
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,060
Speaker 0: As far as she was concerned, that was the end of the world, and there was a lead weight tying her tail to the ground.

289
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, the cat would just slump on the ground and not move.

290
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch the video, you'll see what we mean.

291
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,160
Speaker 0: Freakin' cats.

292
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:32,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

293
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,979
Speaker 1: It's funny because it's Japanese, too.

294
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:51,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, strangely enough, a while ago when I emerged "Update New Year's Deep World," which meant I upgraded all the stuff on my Gentoo box, sound stopped working in Flash and Google Video, and it magically started working again.

295
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,820
Speaker 0: And I haven't done anything to my computer.

296
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,480
Speaker 1: I think you did something with some sort--there must be some sort of blocking going on with OSS also.

297
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's something, so I'm going to look at my AOS-- I don't think you can figure your DMX stuff properly.

298
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to look through my AOS stuff and try to figure that one out later.

299
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,159
Speaker 0: Or, you know what, I won't care because I'm buying a new computer in the next month.

300
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:08,766
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

301
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,640
Speaker 1: But anyway-- If you're a new Bunty, you won't have those problems, theoretically.

302
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, part of the reason I use Gentoo on this box is that this box is slow as shit anyway.

303
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,233
Speaker 1: Mm.

304
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,040
Speaker 0: Bunty is not any slower or faster than-- But anyway, so after the Burning Wheel demo, we went to a mall nearby to try to get some food.

305
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:32,080
Speaker 1: I got some food at this Italian place, got a chicken parm sandwich for five bucks.

306
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, now Pete and I did much better, because this is a--you know how almost every mall food court now is the same?

307
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,480
Speaker 0: They've got that Chinese place, and next to it, the Cajun food place that is the same food the Chinese food place has?

308
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,500
Speaker 1: Not every mall food court, but all mall food courts that have been invaded by that company are all the same.

309
00:20:51,781 --> 00:20:52,145
Speaker 0: Yep.

310
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,540
Speaker 0: Well, this is an old-school food court.

311
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,880
Speaker 1: It's not really old school, it just hasn't been invaded by that company.

312
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,060
Speaker 0: It's old school compared to this company, which seems to be spreading like wildfire.

313
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,503
Speaker 0: Mm.

314
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,479
Speaker 0: And they had this one little Greek diner-type place in it.

315
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,660
Speaker 0: And Pete and I went there, and we got gyros.

316
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,379
Speaker 0: And these were the best gyros we've ever had in our lives.

317
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,920
Speaker 0: He had a giant flank of meat, and he cut pieces off of it, put them over a fire, and then gave them to us.

318
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,005
Speaker 1: It's called shawarma.

319
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:21,580
Speaker 1: It's an Israel in every single block.

320
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:27,420
Speaker 1: And in Israel, it looked a lot better than his solid-colored piece of meat, let me tell you.

321
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, what do you want?

322
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:29,311
Speaker 0: We're not in Israel.

323
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:30,739
Speaker 0: You're lucky to see anything like that.

324
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:31,374
Speaker 1: I know.

325
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,859
Speaker 0: And you know that the Greeks probably call it something else.

326
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,311
Speaker 1: Well, it's, you know, it's a big leg of a lamb.

327
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,700
Speaker 1: It's a lamb on a stick that spins around vertically.

328
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,359
Speaker 0: The point is, we got good food.

329
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,200
Speaker 0: But at the mall, we ran into some scary UberCon types.

330
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,739
Speaker 1: It looked like this normal little girl, I guess.

331
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,040
Speaker 1: She looked like the kind of girl you see at an anime con.

332
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of cute.

333
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,430
Speaker 0: Definitely young.

334
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,519
Speaker 0: I mean, probably a decade younger than me.

335
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,920
Speaker 1: Probably high school looked like.

336
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

337
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:03,360
Speaker 0: And we just had a weird encounter with this girl.

338
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,513
Speaker 1: She just came up to us and was like, "Hi," and then started to talk.

339
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,040
Speaker 1: She said weird things.

340
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,020
Speaker 0: Well, she walked over to me and shook my hand and said she knew me from somewhere, and I didn't know her from anywhere.

341
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,799
Speaker 1: And she looked at us all weird, and then we escaped.

342
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,359
Speaker 0: The only thing was, the only reason I was confused by this is that she looks scarily similar to a girl I knew a long time ago.

343
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,080
Speaker 0: Like, creepily similar.

344
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,372
Speaker 0: So she was looking at me, and I was looking at her, and I thought, "There's no way.

345
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:30,216
Speaker 0: that's what's her name.

346
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:30,879
Speaker 0: There's no

347
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:31,160
Speaker 0: way.".

348
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,620
Speaker 0: And it wasn't, but it was just weird.

349
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,198
Speaker 1: That's good.

350
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,640
Speaker 0: Luckily, we were able to avoid any sort of contact with creepy people for the rest of this con.

351
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,880
Speaker 1: So also at the mall, I managed to get the Darth Vader that transforms into a--well, TIE fighter that transforms into a Darth Vader.

352
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one you couldn't find anywhere, but when you finally got it, discovered that it's actually really a crappy toy.

353
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,060
Speaker 0: It's not that crappy.

354
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,065
Speaker 0: It's crap.

355
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,020
Speaker 0: You broke it immediately.

356
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,036
Speaker 1: I fixed it.

357
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

358
00:22:55,902 --> 00:23:08,380
Speaker 0: It doesn't--alright, to tell you how shitty this toy that Scott bought and is talking up is, basically when it's transformed into Darth Vader, it looks like a robot with a tiny little Darth Vader head floating over it.

359
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,280
Speaker 1: You know, if something wasn't designed in the first place to be transformable, it's a miracle that it does that well at all.

360
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:15,212
Speaker 1: Nah, nah, nah.

361
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,572
Speaker 1: You know what?

362
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:17,222
Speaker 0: For, uh-- You know what?

363
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:18,187
Speaker 0: You know what?

364
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,500
Speaker 0: A turd is not designed to be an airplane.

365
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,039
Speaker 0: If I fashion a crude airplane out of a turd, it's still a turd.

366
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:26,719
Speaker 0: I just wanted to say turd a bunch of times.

367
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:27,958
Speaker 1: You're a turd.

368
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,089
Speaker 1: No, but it's much better.

369
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:31,819
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the best it can be.

370
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,580
Speaker 1: My gripe with these toys is that they made them with the shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty plastic.

371
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:38,560
Speaker 1: Like the shittiest plastic available.

372
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,320
Speaker 1: If it was made with better plastic, it'd be a better toy.

373
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,078
Speaker 1: Just, ding.

374
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:48,540
Speaker 0: I point out that at least in terms of the kind of toy it is, it's a step up from Darth Vader on a motorcycle.

375
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,381
Speaker 1: Yeah.

376
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:52,213
Speaker 1: Well, it's a TIE fighter that transforms into Darth Vader.

377
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,800
Speaker 1: It's Star Wars and Transformers.

378
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,928
Speaker 0: No, no, don't say that.

379
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,400
Speaker 0: It doesn't transform into a Darth Vader.

380
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,900
Speaker 0: It transforms into a big, blocky, robot-looking thing with a tiny Darth Vader head floating over it.

381
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,106
Speaker 1: Whatever.

382
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,260
Speaker 1: It has a red lightsaber.

383
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,472
Speaker 0: The head is floating.

384
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,700
Speaker 0: It's not even a-- It's just this floating Darth Vader head.

385
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,233
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like it floats to me, but-- It's like three sizes too small for the body.

386
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:12,300
Speaker 0: It's absurd.

387
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, also in the mall, we went to a GameStop, and we ended up walking out.

388
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:21,960
Speaker 0: They had something I wanted to buy, an Intellivision game collection for the GameCube.

389
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:23,019
Speaker 0: What did you look for online?

390
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:42,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I stood in line, and I ran into the problem that basically I've never successfully bought something at GameStop without having to stand in line behind some stupid kid and his mom selling back like a hundred games, and every GameStop employee there is helping this one kid who's gonna take forever instead of ringing me up and letting me get on with my life.

391
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like the game stores, especially the GameStops I guess, just don't process, you know, customers at the counter quickly.

392
00:24:50,843 --> 00:24:52,380
Speaker 1: It's like that's not their priority.

393
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,078
Speaker 0: Not even quickly?

394
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,479
Speaker 1: They're not even thinking about it.

395
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,680
Speaker 0: They don't even do it properly, let alone quickly.

396
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, okay, there are like three things you can do at a GameStop.

397
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Speaker 1: You can pre-order something, you can buy something that's on the shelf, or you can sell something back.

398
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,040
Speaker 1: I guess you can return something, which is different from selling something back.

399
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,759
Speaker 1: So four things you can do.

400
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,880
Speaker 1: The only transaction that is quick and easy is buying something.

401
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,400
Speaker 1: Pre-ordering takes forever, selling stuff back takes forever, and returning stuff takes forever.

402
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,220
Speaker 1: You need to streamline all four of those things so they all take barely any time.

403
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:34,960
Speaker 0: You know what, in the very least, if there's a kid selling back a hundred games and you've got two employees, how about employee number two takes care of that growing line of people who just wants to buy something?

404
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,680
Speaker 0: Instead of you both helping the kid, well, I get pissed off enough to drop my game on the floor and walk out.

405
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously, I mean...

406
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:49,460
Speaker 0: I've walked out of like three games, three of the last six times I've gone to a GameStop, I just walked out and didn't buy what I wanted just because I wasn't going to stand there for ten minutes.

407
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,100
Speaker 1: I just don't, it's like they're not, the employees there are just not thinking.

408
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,896
Speaker 1: They're just, that's what happens when you...

409
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,040
Speaker 0: Well, I've met very few intelligent GameStop employees.

410
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:02,200
Speaker 0: No offense to all of you out there, but goddamn.

411
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,400
Speaker 1: I've met very few intelligent employees in brick and mortar stores, period.

412
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:15,920
Speaker 0: I used to know a cool guy who worked at a Best Buy, but he knew all the Best Buy scams and didn't care, and he got me a lot of discounted stuff, so he was a cool guy.

413
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, enough about, they had every Resident Evil for the GameCube, even the rare ones, but they were thirty bucks, so whatever.

414
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they were cheaper than that, we would have picked them up.

415
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,211
Speaker 1: Yeah, I currently only have Resident Evil 1, so I need 0, 2, 3, 4, and Code Veronica.

416
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:38,660
Speaker 0: But thus refreshed, we headed back to the con, and they had an open gaming room where you could just check out a board game, go to a table, the table thing didn't frickin' work, oh my god.

417
00:26:38,981 --> 00:26:40,740
Speaker 0: We ended up stealing tables from people.

418
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,760
Speaker 1: This is a problem, is that you look around the room, and you have a board game, and you want to play it, and you need a table.

419
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,440
Speaker 1: So there's a room full of tables for this purpose.

420
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,780
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see, there are currently, let's say there are four tables that currently don't have anyone playing a game at them.

421
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,860
Speaker 0: Table number one has Fat Dude eating his Chinese food, taking up the whole table.

422
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,327
Speaker 1: So now we can't eat at that table.

423
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:00,096
Speaker 1: So now there are two tables playing the table.

424
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,260
Speaker 1: So there are two tables that are completely vacant.

425
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,720
Speaker 1: One of them, we go over to the table, and there's stuff on the table, and there's stuff in the chairs of the table.

426
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,680
Speaker 1: That makes it look like someone's there.

427
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Speaker 1: Now we don't want to be all breaking the table etiquette and kicking them out of their table.

428
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,200
Speaker 0: But at the same time, what if they're just leaving their stuff there like asshats, which it turned out they were.

429
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, um, what are we supposed to do?

430
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,720
Speaker 1: So there's no one around in the area that looks like they're claiming the stuff.

431
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,154
Speaker 1: So we can't say, "Excuse me, are you using this table?

432
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:30,058
Speaker 1: Can we play a game

433
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:30,259
Speaker 1: here?".

434
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:34,300
Speaker 1: And there's a schedule on the table of official events happening at the table.

435
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:38,659
Speaker 1: And they're not happening right now, or they're not happening soon, so we don't know.

436
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,948
Speaker 1: Is someone coming?

437
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:40,373
Speaker 1: Are they not?

438
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:40,939
Speaker 1: Who knows?

439
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,240
Speaker 1: So it was very difficult to sit at a table.

440
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,887
Speaker 1: So we ended up sitting at one, and then a guy came over, and he was like, you know, "Oh yeah, I have this table

441
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:51,128
Speaker 1: now.".

442
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:53,399
Speaker 1: But then he said, "You know what, I'm going to play the game we're playing with

443
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:53,539
Speaker 1: you."

444
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,820
Speaker 1: Which was Vegas Showdown.

445
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,839
Speaker 1: That was a good game.

446
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was actually really fun.

447
00:27:57,205 --> 00:28:00,580
Speaker 0: Scott had played it before, and he talked about it, and now I got to play it, and Pete got to play it.

448
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:01,830
Speaker 0: I won by a lot.

449
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:02,759
Speaker 0: I'm proud of that.

450
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,199
Speaker 1: Well, that's because I forgot two of the ways to score, which is filling up the hotel and filling up the, uh, museum.

451
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was also real canny with my money.

452
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:17,620
Speaker 0: It's weird, I'm really good at, the first time I play a game, I'll often win it, and then I'll lose for a long time.

453
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:22,717
Speaker 0: Because I'll come up with the, "Oh, that's the obvious stupid strategy that'll only work against people who've never played the game

454
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:22,978
Speaker 0: before.".

455
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,420
Speaker 0: And then after that, I have to come up with a real strategy.

456
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

457
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:30,040
Speaker 1: I mean, I messed up, because I knew how to play, because I'd played it once before.

458
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,980
Speaker 1: And I got, at every auction in the game, I bid for something, and I always got it real cheap, which was great.

459
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,120
Speaker 1: But that was because I thought I was buying the right things, which I was.

460
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,399
Speaker 0: You were buying all lounges.

461
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:49,099
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, because the last time I played a guy who won, he won because of the cards that said, you know, uh, you know, "Get bunches of

462
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:49,379
Speaker 1: stuff.".

463
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but you know what, there's also cards that say, "Get bunches of stuff if you have

464
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:53,657
Speaker 0: restaurants.".

465
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:54,360
Speaker 0: That's why I won.

466
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the thing was, is when I played with that other guy, we had like a six people game going on.

467
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Speaker 1: So a lot more cards came out, and so, you know, it was very different.

468
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,234
Speaker 0: Yeah.

469
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:14,280
Speaker 1: And also, there was a lot more outbidding people in that game, as opposed to this one, where a lot of times we just all bid on different stuff and got it for the small price.

470
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:14,800
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:15,904
Speaker 0: But we played that.

472
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:16,446
Speaker 0: That was fun.

473
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:17,209
Speaker 0: The guy was cool.

474
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,400
Speaker 0: And we'll get back to the guy later, because we actually went and played more games.

475
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a reason he had that table, is because he was using it to demo games from his company.

476
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, so after that game, we left to let him use the table to actually demo the games he wanted to demo.

477
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:32,379
Speaker 0: And we did something that we're very ashamed of.

478
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,460
Speaker 0: Well, first, we wanted to play the Doom game, you know, the Doom board game.

479
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,789
Speaker 1: Well, we wanted to at least see what it was like.

480
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,420
Speaker 1: I figured it was going to be like Zombies.

481
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,564
Speaker 0: Yep, I figured it was going to be something similar.

482
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:50,060
Speaker 0: So we check it out, we open it up, and it's a mess of pieces, and it's basically the same as HeroQuest or Necromunda.

483
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, only it's a lot more complicated than either one of those.

484
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it looked fun, but it wasn't really what we were looking to play at that juncture in our lives.

485
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,100
Speaker 1: And it was so incredibly complicated and large, we didn't have time for it.

486
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,278
Speaker 1: Especially since we had time to figure it out.

487
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,840
Speaker 0: Not in terms of rules, but in terms of stuff we had to set up physically.

488
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:18,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, at a game convention, I want to play new games, but at the same time, I only have so many hours there, especially since I'm only gaming for one day.

489
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:27,860
Speaker 1: So if it takes more than a few minutes to figure out how to play, that doubles the time it takes to play the game itself, and you end up losing a whole lot.

490
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:32,680
Speaker 1: So you want to find someone to teach you how to play, and that's really the best.

491
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:38,480
Speaker 0: It wasn't the kind of game we wanted to play, but we could have figured it out, so we just put it away, whatever.

492
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,217
Speaker 0: And then there's Goa.

493
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:45,140
Speaker 1: Goa was a game I had seen many people play, and many people spoke highly of.

494
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,880
Speaker 0: We wanted to play it for a long time, and there it was.

495
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,588
Speaker 1: So I figured that's the perfect game to try to play.

496
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,340
Speaker 1: It'll probably take just the right amount of time, and we'll be all good.

497
00:30:53,781 --> 00:31:00,520
Speaker 0: This was the first time in any of our lives that we have ever failed at learning to play a board game and given up in frustration.

498
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:03,460
Speaker 1: I think that part of it was the room was very loud.

499
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, the room was a cacophony.

500
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,047
Speaker 1: And part of it was that we didn't have a whole lot of time.

501
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:13,240
Speaker 1: We were sort of like rushing in, like trying to hurry up and play the game, because, you know, we're at a convention, we don't want to lose time.

502
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,220
Speaker 0: But don't let that dissuade you from the fact that Goa is an incredibly fucking complex game.

503
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:19,760
Speaker 1: Oh my god, is the game complex.

504
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,760
Speaker 0: Imagine, to sum up, me reading the rules.

505
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,740
Speaker 0: Alright, there are three kinds of turns, blah blah blah.

506
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:29,600
Speaker 0: On a turn you can take any of six actions.

507
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,560
Speaker 0: There is a whole page describing each of these actions.

508
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,389
Speaker 0: There are tigers and fucking fish.

509
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:36,060
Speaker 0: That's a whole separate game mechanic.

510
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
Speaker 0: There are these cards that do everything, and they have a million symbols on them.

511
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,820
Speaker 0: There's these other cards that do something else, but only when you do the first thing.

512
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,040
Speaker 1: That was really what screwed me up, is the cards.

513
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,006
Speaker 1: There are cards.

514
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:46,740
Speaker 1: There are many different decks of cards.

515
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,700
Speaker 1: Some of them are like different currencies.

516
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,280
Speaker 1: Like, they're not actually different money, but they're like colonists.

517
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,100
Speaker 1: So like, they'll be colonists cards of three and colonists cards of one.

518
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Speaker 1: So you can have a colonists card, you hold it, it's worth three colonists.

519
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,300
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of, it's like a currency, but the currency is called colonists.

520
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:03,900
Speaker 0: It was just, it was painful.

521
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

522
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:11,440
Speaker 1: There are cards, there's a deck of cards, and on the cards themselves are pictures of crazy stuff.

523
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 1: Like, tons and tons of symbols from all parts of the game board.

524
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:19,760
Speaker 1: And I couldn't decipher what these cards meant, and every single one of them was different.

525
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,259
Speaker 1: And I was just like, wow.

526
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,420
Speaker 0: Yup, so what we're breaking through, basically we're going through the rules in order, like step by step.

527
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,960
Speaker 0: And we were like, I'm reading the rules out loud, and they're moving stuff around, we're figuring it out.

528
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
Speaker 1: It didn't help that you never referred to the front page.

529
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:37,480
Speaker 1: You'd be like, yeah, move the colonists card.

530
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,420
Speaker 1: And we'd say, what are the colonists cards?

531
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:41,580
Speaker 1: And you'd say, the colonists cards.

532
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:45,940
Speaker 1: But you never looked at the beginning of the book to show us that's what a colonist card is.

533
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,402
Speaker 0: You know why?

534
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,960
Speaker 0: Because the page that described all that was open in front of both of you.

535
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was upside down and facing away from us.

536
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,940
Speaker 0: Oh no, it was upside down and away from you, not you.

537
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
Speaker 1: And when you were reading in the middle of the book, it was on the front page, and we had to turn your hands to go see it.

538
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,300
Speaker 0: I point out that by the time I got to the middle of the book, it didn't matter anymore.

539
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,460
Speaker 0: Well no, because we, when we found out- We'd already figured out what everything was at that point.

540
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,520
Speaker 1: Well, there was a point at which we figured out the progress board, whatever it's called.

541
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,165
Speaker 0: Well, that was way later.

542
00:33:12,185 --> 00:33:14,180
Speaker 0: Basically, we just worked through the game, bit by bit.

543
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,060
Speaker 0: We figured out how to figure out what to bid on, and then we figured out how this progress board thing worked.

544
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
Speaker 1: The progress board, I think, was cool, actually.

545
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:29,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we figured out how the turn order went, and we figured out what the six actions you could take were, and how they related.

546
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:30,299
Speaker 0: Alright, we're set.

547
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,109
Speaker 0: Then I turn the page, and there's a whole 'nother?

548
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:34,551
Speaker 0: section?

549
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:41,879
Speaker 0: to the book, dedicated, just as thick as the whole first section, dedicated solely to describing what each of the individual tiles did.

550
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,720
Speaker 0: And then there's this thing about tires and fishes, and- Expeditions or something?

551
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:50,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, and, oh my, we just gave up.

552
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:51,559
Speaker 0: We couldn't do it.

553
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:54,660
Speaker 0: We gave up, we put the game away, we were defeated by the board.

554
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:02,020
Speaker 1: I was still confused about the different, like, spice bags, and what was in open field, and what wasn't, and where you could put the spices, and where you couldn't, and what you did with them.

555
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Speaker 0: It didn't help that there's two kinds of rules in German board games, I found.

556
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:13,676
Speaker 0: There's the old school and the new school, and it seems that the new school rules are very concise, they use the same kind of language that RFCs use.

557
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,380
Speaker 0: You can do this, you may do this, you must do this, that sort of thing.

558
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,699
Speaker 0: In old school rules, it's basically just a paragraph and some examples, and then a paragraph and some examples.

559
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,739
Speaker 1: It says do this, do this, do this, do this, do this.

560
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,080
Speaker 0: And the rules are basically just a whole bunch of examples, and you're supposed to learn the game from these.

561
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:33,540
Speaker 0: And I don't like that way at all.

562
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:41,699
Speaker 1: I think that's just the people who wrote the rules have bad powers of explanation, so they need to say, you know, if it's like this, you do it like this, you know.

563
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,819
Speaker 1: You know, if it's like this, then you do something like this.

564
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,498
Speaker 0: 'Cause I like Entecker, but Entecker's written that way, too.

565
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:48,705
Speaker 1: Yeah.

566
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:53,260
Speaker 0: It's all the old, like, old style games are that way, it's weird.

567
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,060
Speaker 1: We should make, like, a hobby of rewriting game rules in awesome ways.

568
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,560
Speaker 0: I'll bet someone's already, we should look at the BoardGameGeek page on Noah.

569
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,039
Speaker 1: BoardGameGeek might have it, we should go check it out.

570
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:02,803
Speaker 0: Yeah.

571
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:06,880
Speaker 0: So, we'd failed, we gave up, and we had to give up the table we were at anyway.

572
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,640
Speaker 1: Don't let that make you think Goa's a bad game, 'cause I'm still pretty sure it's a very good game.

573
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:14,520
Speaker 1: It might not be the best game ever, but I think it's a good game.

574
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,080
Speaker 0: If we sit down in a quiet room and learn how to play the game, I think we're gonna have fun.

575
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:18,492
Speaker 0: Yep.

576
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,160
Speaker 0: So, then we look up and we see the guy we'd played Vegas Showdown with earlier sitting alone at his table.

577
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,367
Speaker 0: No one's come to demo his stuff.

578
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,380
Speaker 0: Or at least, no one's currently demoing.

579
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,720
Speaker 1: He didn't look like he was asking people to demo, he was just kinda sitting there.

580
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:37,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but his name is Alan Earnstein, and he's apparently the head of Hangman Games.

581
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,786
Speaker 0: I have his business card, I'm holding it.

582
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,580
Speaker 0: I'll link to it in the post about the episode.

583
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,419
Speaker 1: He seemed like a pretty cool gaming guy.

584
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,899
Speaker 0: Like, he makes games, and he had all these games he'd made there.

585
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,436
Speaker 0: So, we went over, we're like, "Hey, so show us what you

586
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:48,638
Speaker 0: got."

587
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,340
Speaker 0: And he pulled out this game, it was called, what, Gem Fair?

588
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:53,972
Speaker 0: Crystal Fair?

589
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:54,378
Speaker 1: Something like that.

590
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,371
Speaker 1: Something around that...

591
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's on his website.

592
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:57,621
Speaker 1: Yep.

593
00:35:57,964 --> 00:35:59,620
Speaker 1: Well, it's coming out April something, right?

594
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:05,100
Speaker 0: Yep, like the game hadn't come out yet, it's coming out real soon, and he had his demo copy.

595
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,224
Speaker 0: And we played it.

596
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,440
Speaker 0: And he basically ran us through the game.

597
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,880
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, it was an independent little game.

598
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,945
Speaker 0: Like, he just made this.

599
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,380
Speaker 0: You know, laminated pieces of whatever, and little jemmies.

600
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:28,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game was just little shields to hide what you've got, paper money, little glass jemmies that you can get for almost nothing at a game store.

601
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,379
Speaker 0: Like the counters you used in Magic back in the day.

602
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, for your life.

603
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,481
Speaker 0: What?

604
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,093
Speaker 0: No, you used a D20 for your life.

605
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:35,020
Speaker 0: You used those for tokens.

606
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:36,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

607
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

608
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,720
Speaker 1: You used them for whatever.

609
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,660
Speaker 1: Glass baubles that are generically used in all sorts of games.

610
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:41,995
Speaker 1: Yes.

611
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 1: And a card that had rows for each of the colors, and then numbers on the sides.

612
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,820
Speaker 0: And basically, it's a game of, you have gems, and they're secret.

613
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,820
Speaker 0: And everyone else has gems, and they're also secret.

614
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,099
Speaker 0: And different gems are worth different amount, and there are different numbers of different gems.

615
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:04,840
Speaker 0: And you take turns trading gems with people, semi-secretly, trying to get the most points at the end of the game.

616
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,219
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go in greater detail than that, 'cause...

617
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:08,049
Speaker 1: Yep.

618
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:08,531
Speaker 1: Yeah.

619
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,266
Speaker 1: It was just a surprisingly fun game.

620
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,840
Speaker 1: The only reason I lost is 'cause it took me two turns to actually figure out what was going on.

621
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,863
Speaker 1: Like, oh!

622
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:17,030
Speaker 1: 'Cause there were so many purple gems.

623
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,140
Speaker 1: You know, I figured, the purple gems aren't really worth anything.

624
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,363
Speaker 1: There's so many of them.

625
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:26,120
Speaker 1: No, you can score just as many points with the purple ones as you can with the ultra-rare white ones.

626
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,381
Speaker 0: Yep.

627
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:30,559
Speaker 0: By the end of the game, Pete had racked up all the purple points and just dominated us.

628
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,223
Speaker 1: Yeah.

629
00:37:32,444 --> 00:37:38,080
Speaker 1: So that was not, you know, the great... I should've realized it's not about which some colors are worth more.

630
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:46,260
Speaker 1: It's about, you know, you gotta hoard, you know, certain colors and get rid of other colors in order to get more of the same color.

631
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
Speaker 1: That way you can score points.

632
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,380
Speaker 0: It's mostly a statistics game, and a bluffing game.

633
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bluffing game, and it's sort of a stock market game, too.

634
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it kinda is.

635
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:58,140
Speaker 1: Imagine with more players, the stock market part would matter more.

636
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,940
Speaker 0: Now, we're not gonna go into more detail on that, but it's Hangman Games, and the guy Alan was really cool.

637
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,920
Speaker 0: We're gonna try to get him on the show for an interview sometime.

638
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,320
Speaker 0: Yep.

639
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:17,120
Speaker 0: And then we'll probably talk more about this, but if you've never experienced the indie kinda games that are, you know, they're kinda under the radar, check this guy's website out, 'cause the games he makes seem to be really high quality.

640
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,120
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go to his website sometime and see if any of his games are really, really awesome looking, and maybe I'll buy one.

641
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,319
Speaker 0: Hey, he lives in Maryland.

642
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:23,963
Speaker 0: Oh.

643
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,158
Speaker 0: We should tell him to come to Otacon with us.

644
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,360
Speaker 1: I don't think he's the big Otacon type.

645
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,139
Speaker 0: No, he definitely seems to be the gamer geek alone.

646
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,340
Speaker 1: Alright, so when we were done with that, we were just pretty much waiting for the Burning Wheel demo, and we were hungry.

647
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,740
Speaker 0: We were hungry, we were exhausted, and our ears were ringing from being in that loud room.

648
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:53,960
Speaker 1: So we went to the lobby, where it was nice and quiet, and there was free milk, and the registration guy was there, and some other ObraCon people, and a bunch of guys playing MAME and whatever emulated games on Linux.

649
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,019
Speaker 0: They were playing Bomberman at the time.

650
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, Super Bomberman it looked like.

651
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:00,440
Speaker 1: Or MAME Bomberman, I couldn't even tell.

652
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, they had a nice little MythTV Linux emulating going on.

653
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked to the guy who set that up, and we got some tips.

654
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,220
Speaker 1: We talked to some girl, I don't know what her name was, I forget.

655
00:39:12,441 --> 00:39:12,899
Speaker 0: What, the staffer?

656
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:13,599
Speaker 1: Yeah.

657
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:14,859
Speaker 0: Oh, I totally forgot her name.

658
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:15,474
Speaker 0: Yeah.

659
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,060
Speaker 0: I hope she got the piece of paper I wrote.

660
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, she seemed pretty cool and smart, and whatever.

661
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:24,099
Speaker 1: We tried to play the camel game with her through the desert, but we failed because the food showed up.

662
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:24,881
Speaker 0: Yep.

663
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:26,099
Speaker 0: Oh god, the food.

664
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:32,160
Speaker 0: So we wanted to get food, we didn't want to leave, so we go ask the hotel, and they said, "Yeah, there's a Chinese place and a pizza place," and they gave us both.

665
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,618
Speaker 1: We really wanted Chinese food.

666
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,012
Speaker 0: We're about to order it, and then this is how we met this girl, she comes over and she's like, "Don't order the

667
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:38,533
Speaker 0: Chinese.".

668
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:40,740
Speaker 0: I ordered it an hour ago and it hasn't come yet.

669
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,475
Speaker 1: And we're like, "Oh, we can't afford to wait an

670
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:42,717
Speaker 1: hour.".

671
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:43,323
Speaker 0: Yep.

672
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:45,020
Speaker 0: So we ordered Domino's Pizza.

673
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:53,459
Speaker 1: And we saw a Domino's guy come in and leave the hotel, and when he left, we asked him, you know, "Where do we tell you to deliver

674
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:53,599
Speaker 1: to?".

675
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,952
Speaker 1: And he just said, "Tell me to deliver to the lobby,".

676
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:56,918
Speaker 1: and he's like,

677
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:57,079
Speaker 1: "Okay.".

678
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:58,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

679
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:03,900
Speaker 0: So we order pizza, and it comes still before this poor girl has gotten her Chinese food.

680
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, like literally 10, 15 minutes after we order, the Domino's guy is back, and he's got our stuff.

681
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:10,400
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

682
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,319
Speaker 1: We shared it with the registration guy.

683
00:40:14,442 --> 00:40:19,340
Speaker 0: I forget how poor gamers are, because I guess I used to be real poor when I went to cons like that.

684
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:19,727
Speaker 0: Me too.

685
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,720
Speaker 0: Because later we bought two liters of Coke, and we were drinking one, and the other one was just sitting there unopened.

686
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,098
Speaker 0: And this gamer comes up and he's like, "Dude, I'll do anything if you'll give me some of that

687
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:30,420
Speaker 0: Coke.".

688
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,114
Speaker 0: And we're like, "Here you go, take the whole

689
00:40:32,134 --> 00:40:32,335
Speaker 0: thing.".

690
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:35,230
Speaker 0: And he didn't know what to do to that.

691
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:36,780
Speaker 0: He didn't know how to react.

692
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like, "I can't just take it from

693
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:40,200
Speaker 1: you.".

694
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,532
Speaker 1: And we're like, "It's a dollar, two liters of soda.

695
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:44,816
Speaker 1: None of us really want it.

696
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:45,559
Speaker 1: What the

697
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:45,820
Speaker 1: hell?".

698
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,287
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Let me give you

699
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:48,529
Speaker 1: something.".

700
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:49,836
Speaker 1: I'm like, "I don't know, do a

701
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:50,198
Speaker 1: dance.".

702
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:51,499
Speaker 1: I don't forget what we made him do.

703
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:54,199
Speaker 0: We made him say who shot first in Episode 4 of Star Wars.

704
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,620
Speaker 1: That's because he had a Han Solo shirt.

705
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:55,969
Speaker 0: Yeah.

706
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,220
Speaker 1: I noticed the Han Solo shirt and I was thinking of the same thing, but I figured that was real stupid.

707
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was real stupid, but I wasn't going to take his money.

708
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:03,740
Speaker 0: He's obviously a poor gamer.

709
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, so whatever.

710
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,040
Speaker 1: We fed a bunch of people and we made friends.

711
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,380
Speaker 1: I talked to this old guy who brought his 16-year-old son there about some stuff.

712
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:20,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's definitely cool because he doesn't seem to be in with the geek thing, but he understands his son is and he's letting his son do it all.

713
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, he figures it's better than doing drugs and all that stuff.

714
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,160
Speaker 0: He's right.

715
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,080
Speaker 1: He seemed like a smart dad.

716
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we told him about Otacon and there's a good bet this kid's going to Otacon now.

717
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:34,299
Speaker 1: I also asked him about comic books and it was pretty funny that I said, "Did you read Uncle Scrooge

718
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:34,620
Speaker 1: comics?".

719
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,126
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Oh

720
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:35,247
Speaker 1: yeah!".

721
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:39,739
Speaker 1: So now I really like asking people that just to see.

722
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,160
Speaker 0: Now I'll note that we mentioned that we were going to UberCon and we basically told you that if you want to see us there, you won't be able to miss us.

723
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,338
Speaker 0: We stand out.

724
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:49,878
Speaker 1: And no one came to see us.

725
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,499
Speaker 0: However, we do stand out and we have evidence of this now.

726
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,400
Speaker 0: While we were sitting in the lobby, we were just talking about other cons and stuff.

727
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:04,095
Speaker 0: One of the staffers of UberCon comes over to us and is like, "Hey, could you guys write down all that stuff you just said?

728
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:05,558
Speaker 0: You guys really sound like you know what you're talking

729
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:05,819
Speaker 0: about.".

730
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:07,348
Speaker 0: We're like, "Oh,

731
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:07,449
Speaker 0: okay.".

732
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:15,300
Speaker 1: Even though what we were talking about really had nothing to do with suggestions for UberCon, it was more like- I think we were talking about Yowie at that point.

733
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we were talking about other cons and stuff.

734
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:17,920
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

735
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:18,398
Speaker 0: Yeah.

736
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:20,080
Speaker 1: But, whatever.

737
00:42:20,745 --> 00:42:20,832
Speaker 0: Yeah.

738
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,040
Speaker 1: We wrote down that they should fix their table problem because that's the only problem they have.

739
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:28,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, we wrote down a very specific, detailed solution to that.

740
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,559
Speaker 0: We'll see if they implement it next year.

741
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,157
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

742
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,102
Speaker 0: Who knows?

743
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:34,514
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see if they'll want us to be staff or something.

744
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:35,780
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do Geek Nights there live.

745
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,468
Speaker 1: Maybe.

746
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:38,239
Speaker 0: I'd like to do some Geek Nights there.

747
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:38,978
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

748
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:44,819
Speaker 1: So, next, we finally made our way to the awaited Burning Wheel game.

749
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:49,160
Speaker 1: The name of the game, I think, was- Oh, I forget.

750
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:50,989
Speaker 0: Yes, Inheritance.

751
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,920
Speaker 0: It was a Viking funeral.

752
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,560
Speaker 0: So, the game started where- Well, first off, keep in mind, Scott, we probably shouldn't because this is a thing that he does often.

753
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,970
Speaker 0: And he's run the same game at many places.

754
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,839
Speaker 0: I don't think we want to spoil the plot.

755
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:05,479
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll tell the summary of the plot.

756
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll tell- Don't tell how it ends or all the secrets or anything.

757
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,000
Speaker 1: Well, it ends the way the players make it.

758
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but not the secrets, at least.

759
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,026
Speaker 1: Of course.

760
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:12,800
Speaker 1: We'll not reveal the secrets.

761
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:13,879
Speaker 0: Like the text of the will.

762
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:20,460
Speaker 1: So, the characters are the Grandpa Viking, who is dead and is going to Valhalla.

764
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Speaker 1: And you start the game at his funeral.

765
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,879
Speaker 0: There is- His son, Tyrvald.

766
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,772
Speaker 1: Uh, his other son, Kair, Kair, I think.

767
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:31,155
Speaker 1: We didn't have a PC for that.

768
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:32,900
Speaker 1: We didn't have a player for that character.

769
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,825
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, hold on.

770
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:35,980
Speaker 0: I've got my notes from the frickin' game.

771
00:43:36,544 --> 00:43:36,819
Speaker 1: Awesome.

772
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,700
Speaker 0: Oh, the notes from the frickin' game are from the perspective of my character.

773
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,142
Speaker 0: Great.

774
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,560
Speaker 1: There was Kair, who was the other son.

775
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was a berserk.

776
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:49,660
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know how much you guys want to hear about the details of the game in that regard.

777
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,099
Speaker 1: We're not going to give too many details.

778
00:43:51,701 --> 00:44:01,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically it was a bunch of Vikings, and the game started, and I guess the coolest part of this is that we ended up playing this with a really cool group of people.

779
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I got there, they were like these schlubby guys, and I was like, "Oh, they look like schlubby guys.

780
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:06,039
Speaker 1: Ehh.".

781
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:07,959
Speaker 1: But then they turned out to be cool guys, so.

782
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,467
Speaker 0: Like one guy who was sitting there was this really big guy.

783
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:12,713
Speaker 0: Not big like Phat, but big like Pete.

784
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:15,060
Speaker 0: Like a big, muscular kind of Viking-looking dude.

785
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,401
Speaker 1: Tall.

786
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,211
Speaker 1: He was pretty tall.

787
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:16,798
Speaker 1: He had a big beard.

788
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,408
Speaker 0: Booming voice and a beard.

789
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:20,680
Speaker 0: And he played Tyrvald, the Viking father.

790
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:23,360
Speaker 1: The new Viking father.

791
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:29,554
Speaker 0: And he was so in character that when, I mean the game got really heated, but heated in character.

792
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:30,497
Speaker 0: Not heated out of character.

793
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:31,840
Speaker 0: We're all laughing with each other afterwards.

794
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:40,620
Speaker 0: But like, it got to the point where one of the kids who was playing a Viking insulted this man in front of his host, like at his lodge.

795
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:43,680
Speaker 0: And he's yelling at the guy, and it was just amazing.

796
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:45,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was good stuff.

797
00:44:45,161 --> 00:44:46,880
Speaker 0: That guy was scary in character.

798
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:52,500
Speaker 1: The only disappointment I had in the game as my character was this like magic immortal dwarf guy or something.

799
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:56,372
Speaker 1: And I was the one who had the will, and I was all awesome.

800
00:44:56,954 --> 00:44:58,600
Speaker 1: But I had these magic runes.

801
00:44:59,362 --> 00:44:59,980
Speaker 0: Magic runes!

802
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,280
Speaker 1: And they had the power to change someone's belief.

803
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,480
Speaker 0: Like bind someone to their fate.

804
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:14,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was really cool, but I never got a chance to use them because I was going to use them at one point, but I ended up just winning the duel battle of fate or whatever.

805
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:15,688
Speaker 1: It's a duel of wits.

806
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,958
Speaker 1: So I didn't need to use it.

807
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,485
Speaker 0: I thought the way Scott handled his character was really good.

808
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:27,580
Speaker 0: I mean it was a powerful character who kind of never did anything directly, but he influenced other people and in the end got his will.

809
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:28,521
Speaker 1: Yup.

810
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:40,760
Speaker 1: I mean the only really direct way I would have done anything is with the magic runes, and that was like, it said on my paper like the magic runes will send a man to hell or something like that, so I really didn't want to use them.

811
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,040
Speaker 1: So I always tried to get my way by any other means possible first.

812
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,020
Speaker 0: I love when you smack the Christian priest down about his god.

813
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:49,648
Speaker 1: Yeah.

814
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:51,779
Speaker 1: There's a god now!

815
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:54,900
Speaker 0: That was classic.

816
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:55,552
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:45:55,781 --> 00:46:00,579
Speaker 0: But the basic plot, to sum up, was that, alright, the grandfather...

818
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,400
Speaker 1: The Christian priest was Pete.

819
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:07,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, Pete is quite the scientist, and he ended up playing the Christian missionary priest.

820
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:07,979
Speaker 1: Which is awesome.

821
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,180
Speaker 0: It was hilarious.

822
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:15,400
Speaker 0: But basically, the grandfather, the elder Viking, is dead, and it begins at the funeral.

823
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:24,760
Speaker 0: Now, the current father, Tyrvald, the cool guy who was playing him, is like the leader, he's not the king, but he's basically the leader of where we live.

824
00:46:25,642 --> 00:46:34,180
Speaker 0: His three sons, the first son was murdered by the third son ten years ago, so the third son, Einherjar, was banished forever.

825
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:34,571
Speaker 1: Einherjar.

826
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:41,840
Speaker 0: Now, he was supposed to be killed, because I played a priestess of Odin, Gethion, who wanted him dead.

827
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,779
Speaker 1: He was the priestess.

828
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played it, girl.

829
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:45,319
Speaker 0: Get over it.

830
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:46,199
Speaker 1: Whatever.

831
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:49,292
Speaker 0: Actually, my character was kind of cool, though.

832
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:50,180
Speaker 0: It wasn't what I expected.

833
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:50,587
Speaker 0: Yeah.

834
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:56,760
Speaker 0: But the son murdered his eldest brother, and the father, instead of killing him, had him exiled.

835
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:07,420
Speaker 0: So now the son, the prodigal son, has returned after the grandfather has died, kind of vying for the inheritance, kind of vying to get back into the family.

836
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:09,965
Speaker 0: And it was quite a heated scene.

837
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:15,860
Speaker 0: You kind of felt like you were really at this Viking funeral, and these large men are yelling at each other.

838
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,579
Speaker 0: It was just an amazing scene.

839
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:20,826
Speaker 1: I liked it a whole lot.

840
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:23,638
Speaker 1: It was the best roleplaying I've had in a long time.

841
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,060
Speaker 1: Because I haven't had a lot of roleplaying in a long time, but also because it was really awesome.

842
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,054
Speaker 0: Well, also, the way Burning Wheel seems to work is that it really enforces you to play.

843
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:34,760
Speaker 0: It really enforces playing in character.

844
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:49,240
Speaker 1: I think it's like the system itself, instead of... It seems like D&D and other systems, like, the purpose of them is to abstract the reality in which the roleplaying occurs.

845
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:59,640
Speaker 1: So the roleplaying is completely the burden of the players, and the system just helps you work out combat and what physically happens.

846
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:06,860
Speaker 1: But Burning Wheel, it does that in a fun way, but it also seems to be a roleplaying catalyst.

847
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:17,339
Speaker 1: Like, instead of, "You have to roleplay, and here's the system to figure out everything else," it's, "This system makes you roleplay, unless you're a complete

848
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:17,640
Speaker 1: doofus.".

849
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,601
Speaker 0: Yep.

850
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:24,300
Speaker 0: I mean, there was one kid who was a little kind of schlubby, definitely wasn't as smart as all the other kids we were playing with.

851
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:29,099
Speaker 0: And even he played his character really well, just because of the way the system forced him to.

852
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:29,602
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:29,964 --> 00:48:32,980
Speaker 1: I mean, he didn't have really the biggest part, but, you know, he did stuff.

854
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Speaker 0: And actually he was a primary mover of the plot, because he insulted Tyrvald in his hall, which led to a fight, and someone got stabbed.

855
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was in character, and it was according to... It's just great.

856
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:57,160
Speaker 0: I mean, it's interesting to watch a system that allows characters to be yelling at each other and arguing, and this conflict should just flare up, and then suddenly it comes to blows, and there's a flurry of blades, and now someone's on the ground stabbed.

857
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,280
Speaker 0: And it was so realistic.

858
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,630
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't really realistic.

859
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,739
Speaker 1: There was no stabbing and blood.

860
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:03,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

861
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:04,417
Speaker 1: For real.

862
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

863
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:06,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone was really bleeding.

864
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, we frickin' hung Pete at the end.

865
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:10,420
Speaker 0: He's not gonna be on the show anymore.

866
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,041
Speaker 1: Oh.

867
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:11,986
Speaker 1: Oh.

868
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,394
Speaker 1: Don't talk about that.

869
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:14,600
Speaker 1: We're gonna get in trouble.

870
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:16,464
Speaker 0: Yeah.

871
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:21,600
Speaker 0: But basically, I mean, in the game, the way your characters are set up is you'll have beliefs and instincts.

872
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:32,320
Speaker 0: But one of the beliefs of... Well, I don't think I'll say what the beliefs are, because I don't want to ruin this game for anyone who might play this demo with Luke Crane in the future.

873
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:39,198
Speaker 1: Let me say, an instinct of my character that's generic was, "I don't make an oath that I can't

874
00:49:39,238 --> 00:49:39,519
Speaker 1: fulfill.".

875
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,101
Speaker 0: Yes.

876
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:43,996
Speaker 0: Or the instinct of my character, one of them is, "In times of crisis, sacrifice to the

877
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:44,478
Speaker 0: norns.".

878
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that really helps you out.

879
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:50,692
Speaker 1: In D&D, you don't have that sort of information about your character.

880
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:54,439
Speaker 1: You have to come up with it, and you have to try to think, "What would my character

881
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:54,580
Speaker 1: do?".

882
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,964
Speaker 0: No, I like that.

883
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:56,828
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

884
00:49:56,968 --> 00:50:00,040
Speaker 0: But I know a lot of people, ahem Scott, ahem, have trouble with that.

885
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,200
Speaker 1: Well, no.

886
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:01,003
Speaker 1: See, I don't have trouble.

887
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:03,733
Speaker 1: The trouble isn't doing it.

888
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:05,720
Speaker 1: The trouble is coming up with it in the first place.

889
00:50:07,686 --> 00:50:08,799
Speaker 0: So you do have trouble with it.

890
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:12,055
Speaker 1: Well, it's not the same kind of trouble as you're implying.

891
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,060
Speaker 1: It's a different kind of trouble.

892
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,154
Speaker 1: The trouble isn't, you know, being the character that I know.

893
00:50:18,255 --> 00:50:19,780
Speaker 1: It's knowing the character in the first place.

894
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:29,960
Speaker 1: And if I come up with a character that, you know, I don't really think about a whole lot, and come up with these things, then I can't really do it, because there isn't a character to do.

895
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:34,370
Speaker 0: See, for me, it's more that, I mean, I come up with this stuff for my characters anyway.

896
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:38,320
Speaker 0: I write pages and pages and pages and pages of backstory like a frickin' gamer nerd nut.

897
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:48,280
Speaker 0: But what this game does is you have to codify your beliefs in very specific ways and put them on your character sheet, and you get in-game rewards for playing in character.

898
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:55,660
Speaker 1: I think what's really awesome, though, is that, Burning Wheel, you don't need to have pages and pages and pages and pages of backstory.

899
00:50:56,081 --> 00:51:05,739
Speaker 1: All you need is, like, maybe one paragraph and, like, a few sentences, and you've got just as full a character, you know, you might not have the history, of course, to go along with it.

900
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,840
Speaker 0: Well, you don't have as full a character in terms of backstory, but you have as full a character in terms of role-playing.

901
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,490
Speaker 1: In terms of role-playing, it's just 100%, it's full-on, you've got it.

902
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,800
Speaker 1: You don't have to do tons and tons of effort in coming up with all this other stuff.

903
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:25,480
Speaker 0: Now, of course, I'll point out that we've never played a traditional campaign of Burning Wheel at all, and all we've experienced are scenarios.

904
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,979
Speaker 0: In this, there was a scenario set up, and we were all given characters, we chose them, and then we played them.

905
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,296
Speaker 0: So, at the very least, this system allows for that really well, because it allows inter-player conflict.

906
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:39,680
Speaker 0: that's handled gracefully.

907
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,369
Speaker 0: D&D doesn't handle inter-player conflict at all.

908
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,320
Speaker 0: If two characters start fighting, it just doesn't work.

909
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:48,110
Speaker 1: It's just broken if characters in D&D are fighting each other.

910
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:50,580
Speaker 1: The system wasn't designed for that.

911
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:56,780
Speaker 0: In this game, at least in terms of the mentors we'd played, you're expected to fight, you're expected to hate each other, or at least have a disagreement.

912
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,162
Speaker 1: Yeah.

913
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:06,020
Speaker 1: So, I think what's... I can't say that Burning Wheel campaigns don't work, but I get the feeling that there's something missing.

914
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,159
Speaker 1: But I don't know, because I haven't read the book, so it's just a feeling that's based on nothing.

915
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:19,340
Speaker 0: I don't think it's so much that Burning Wheel can't do a campaign, I think it's more that Burning Wheel really shines when you play a one-off scenario from start to finish.

916
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:29,120
Speaker 1: I think when you play Burning Wheel, and you have a scenario that is set up already, but the players don't know the scenario, and they just pick characters and go with it.

917
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,360
Speaker 1: The GM tells them what's going on, because not a DM, it's a GM in Burning Wheel.

918
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:42,180
Speaker 1: And then you go at it in one shot, one night, or a few hours, and that is when it's super, super awesome, for guaranteed.

919
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:50,480
Speaker 1: And if you're going to do one-shot role-playing, Burning Wheel is definitely the way to go for the most awesome fun that I've ever had, at least.

920
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:50,941
Speaker 0: Yes.

921
00:52:51,342 --> 00:53:04,540
Speaker 0: So, when we do a whole show on this, and we actually interview Luke Crane and maybe some other people, hopefully we'll be able to shed some more light on more of these specific reasons why Burning Wheel is so awesome, and how it actually works with the dice pools and everything.

922
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:15,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, and hopefully in the future, when we actually get the books and run games ourselves, we'll talk about those in hopefully a way that is not painfully nerdy, but also entertaining and interesting.

923
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,684
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess, put it this way.

924
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:23,800
Speaker 0: Currently, Scott and I, we live here, and Pete lives nearby, but he lives far enough away where he can't just hang out every day.

925
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:28,260
Speaker 0: Now, we can't play D&D with the two of us, because that just wouldn't be fun.

926
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,735
Speaker 1: People do play one-on-one D&D, and there's a funny video on Google Video about it.

927
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:34,060
Speaker 1: you might have seen, but it's bad.

928
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:42,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've done it occasionally, but not as a campaign, more as a, "Alright, it's time to role-play out this thing that only my character's doing while everyone else is eating

929
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,320
Speaker 0: cheese.".

930
00:53:42,382 --> 00:53:42,859
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah.

931
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,037
Speaker 0: Or, "Everyone's out of town except the two of us, let's move the

932
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:46,299
Speaker 0: plot.".

933
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:54,740
Speaker 0: But I really think Scott and I could set up little scenarios and actually play them out in Burning Wheel, just the two of us, and I think it would be fun.

934
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:55,979
Speaker 1: Maybe we could.

935
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll talk about this a lot more.

936
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:01,953
Speaker 0: Burning Wheel has added a new element.

937
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:04,640
Speaker 0: It's revitalized my love of role-playing games.

938
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,433
Speaker 1: I think what you could actually do with Burning Wheel is you could be like, "Alright, let's say there's a...".

939
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:13,560
Speaker 1: I don't know, let me think of something really quick.

940
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:22,019
Speaker 1: "There's a merchant, and there's a thief, and the thief stole something from the merchant, and he's hidden it on his body, and...".

941
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:22,079
Speaker 1: Go.

942
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,940
Speaker 1: Want to use the thief, want to use the merchant.

943
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:25,033
Speaker 1: Yeah.

944
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:35,039
Speaker 1: That simple, and then you have two pieces of paper, and one has the beliefs of the merchant, which are, "That guy stole something from me, I want it back, goddamn this

945
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:35,280
Speaker 1: thief.".

946
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,878
Speaker 1: And the thief has beliefs, "I stole this, I want to keep it because I'm poor, this merchant's rich in

947
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:41,118
Speaker 1: greed.".

948
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:48,260
Speaker 1: And then you just go, and it'd be a duel of wits, and it'd be a great fun time, give you at least a half hour of entertainment.

949
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:55,800
Speaker 0: I mean, I wish you all could have seen this game, especially as it wound down, and the plot was revealed, and everything was resolved, and...

950
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,316
Speaker 1: People were screaming and yelling like it was like, "Oh my god,

951
00:54:59,396 --> 00:54:59,617
Speaker 1: woo!".

952
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,915
Speaker 0: Yep, and we got some really good in-character speeches at the end by everyone.

953
00:55:05,477 --> 00:55:06,320
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

954
00:55:06,828 --> 00:55:06,900
Speaker 1: Yep.

955
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,171
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd love to just tell the whole story of the game, because this would be a story.

956
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:15,720
Speaker 0: You could just take what we did, and write a short story, and it would be awesome.

957
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,200
Speaker 1: A very awesome short story.

958
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,304
Speaker 0: But we can't ruin it for you.

959
00:55:18,384 --> 00:55:22,479
Speaker 0: If you ever get the chance to play a Burning Wheel demo with Luke Crane, do it.

960
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, look for gaming conventions.

961
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,660
Speaker 1: I think he has his convention schedule on his website.

962
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,004
Speaker 0: Yes, he said he does.

963
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:32,740
Speaker 0: And of course, we'll ask him about that when we get him on the show, because he seemed very open to an interview.

964
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, he seems like, "Oh, I love podcasting,

965
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:35,338
Speaker 1: whatever.".

966
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:35,663
Speaker 1: Yep.

967
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,140
Speaker 1: And he was amazed that we do four shows a week, which everyone should be.

968
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we've gone for a long time, but that's good, because there's going to be no podcast on Thursday, I'm going out of town.

969
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:49,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now we're going to tell you about the non-gaming part of UberCon, getting home.

970
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:57,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, so as you might have noticed in the link, if you go to the website, that I mentioned a blizzard, and I mentioned New Jersey.

971
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,300
Speaker 1: Now, I knew there was going to be some blizzard-y snow, but I didn't care.

972
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't really consider the blizzard in our planning.

973
00:56:05,756 --> 00:56:06,380
Speaker 0: We just ignored it.

974
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,999
Speaker 1: I considered it, but I also ignored it.

975
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just ignored it.

976
00:56:08,805 --> 00:56:10,760
Speaker 0: I figured, whatever, worst case, we'll stay at the hotel.

977
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,888
Speaker 1: I didn't think it was going to be that big or that dangerous, and you know what?

978
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:18,760
Speaker 1: It really wasn't that big or that dangerous, you know?

979
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,792
Speaker 1: I mean, it wasn't like, I've had ice storms before, which are infinitely worse.

980
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,500
Speaker 1: I've had like three feet of snow, which is infinitely worse.

981
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,927
Speaker 1: This is pretty much a normal snowstorm, you know?

982
00:56:28,947 --> 00:56:34,360
Speaker 1: I mean, snow piles up, and it snows, and whatever.

983
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:43,440
Speaker 1: But we leave the con, we get in the car, we clean off the car, which kind of sucked, and we get in, and we start to drive really slowly onto the highway.

984
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:45,999
Speaker 1: And we got to the highway pretty easily, which was nice.

985
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,965
Speaker 1: Going north in the Garden State.

986
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:51,860
Speaker 1: Now, going north in the Garden State to our house, there's a trick.

987
00:56:52,381 --> 00:57:02,680
Speaker 1: If we keep going north in the Garden State and don't stop, eventually it becomes I-87 North, which is exactly where we want to be, because that takes us to 84 East, which takes us to our house.

988
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:03,441
Speaker 1: Okay?

989
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:08,313
Speaker 1: There is a way to get from the Garden State to 87 North.

990
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:11,600
Speaker 1: It's really the same road, but there's like this magic shortcut.

991
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,759
Speaker 1: I don't understand quite the geography of it.

992
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:16,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it involves 17.

993
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,892
Speaker 1: It involves like 17, 287, and I-80, and something else.

994
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:28,660
Speaker 0: I go that way often when I go to Philly or Horsham, but going to Philly or Horsham is completely different from going to Jersey, so I couldn't be of any assistance.

995
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:31,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've mastered this shortcut going south.

996
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:34,296
Speaker 1: Like, going south, I just take exit 14A on 87, and then BOOM!

997
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,897
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm on the Garden State much faster than just going south in 87 forever.

998
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,284
Speaker 1: But going north, I have a problem with it.

999
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:43,827
Speaker 1: So, I saw an exit.

1000
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:51,020
Speaker 1: First of all, we're going really slow on the highway, and the worst thing about it wasn't the cars driving shittily around me, because that was to be expected.

1001
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was one that spun out and almost hit us.

1002
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:53,800
Speaker 0: It was fantastic.

1003
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:58,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, and it wasn't, you know, any problem with my car, because my car was brand new and great.

1004
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:05,080
Speaker 1: Well, actually, there was a problem with my car is that it's so new and great that if you step a little bit on the gas, it accelerates a lot.

1005
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:17,760
Speaker 1: So, sometimes I would step on it a little bit too much from nothing, and it would go whoop, and then spin the tires a little bit, but it was never really trouble, because the anti-lock brakes were great, and, you know, the steering was great, and the big tires are great.

1006
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,428
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I see an exit for 17, and I'm like, "Aha!

1007
00:58:22,428 --> 00:58:24,612
Speaker 1: 17 is a road I know.

1008
00:58:24,953 --> 00:58:26,075
Speaker 1: That seems like the shortcut to

1009
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:26,295
Speaker 1: me.".

1010
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:29,080
Speaker 1: And I was close, real close, but not quite.

1011
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,082
Speaker 1: I got on 17 north.

1012
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:31,964
Speaker 1: North is good.

1013
00:58:32,244 --> 00:58:38,814
Speaker 1: North is good, because that's right where I want to go, but it wasn't getting there any faster, and we're still going really, really slowly.

1014
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:40,317
Speaker 1: We couldn't see the lanes.

1015
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:42,280
Speaker 1: The worst thing was I couldn't see the lanes.

1016
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:49,140
Speaker 0: Now, keep in mind, it's still snowing, and we've just been gaming for over 12 hours, and we're tired.

1017
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,739
Speaker 0: Real tired.

1018
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,720
Speaker 0: It's like one.

1019
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're going really slow.

1020
00:58:53,164 --> 00:58:56,772
Speaker 1: What should be a 90-minute trip eventually became a two-and-a-half-hour trip.

1021
00:58:57,914 --> 00:59:00,760
Speaker 1: So, now you know how long it took us to get home, and we did make it home.

1022
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:02,300
Speaker 0: Well, obviously.

1023
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:03,161
Speaker 1: Obviously.

1024
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:15,680
Speaker 1: But not being able to see the lanes was absolutely the worst thing there was, because I wanted to drive in the lane, and I wanted to drive in the tire tracks of the guy in front of me, and where there was the most traction.

1025
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,168
Speaker 1: But it was almost impossible to do all those things, especially in unplowed, unsalted, unsanded areas.

1026
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:24,013
Speaker 1: It was just, that was the hardest part of driving, was?

1027
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:25,796
Speaker 1: it didn't matter the cars around me.

1028
00:59:25,836 --> 00:59:27,038
Speaker 1: I didn't care about them so much.

1029
00:59:27,098 --> 00:59:28,400
Speaker 1: They weren't really bothering me.

1030
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,939
Speaker 1: It was keeping my car going where I wanted it to go, straight.

1031
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:41,600
Speaker 0: Now, independent of that, New Jersey has some issues when it comes to their roads, particularly the signage.

1032
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1033
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:45,748
Speaker 1: Okay, so we get off the Garden State, we're going north on 17.

1034
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:50,999
Speaker 1: Now, to get back on a highway, usually the signs, and they have little arrows saying, you know, "Here's how to get back to a

1035
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:51,300
Speaker 1: highway.".

1036
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,858
Speaker 0: So we're driving, and we see a sign, "Garden State, this

1037
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:54,200
Speaker 0: exit.".

1038
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,048
Speaker 1: I figured, alright, screw this 17 road, I'm getting back on the Garden State and going north.

1039
00:59:58,488 --> 01:00:01,675
Speaker 1: So a little green sign says, "Garden State, this

1040
01:00:01,755 --> 01:00:02,035
Speaker 1: away.".

1041
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:04,300
Speaker 1: So I made a right turn, and I went that way.

1042
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,765
Speaker 1: Then there was a, I could either go straight or right.

1043
01:00:07,046 --> 01:00:12,120
Speaker 1: I didn't know, because there wasn't another sign to tell me the Garden State is straight, or the Garden State is right.

1044
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,760
Speaker 0: Yep, so assuming, you know, it didn't say, it would just keep going straight.

1045
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:22,800
Speaker 1: Yep, I went straight, we went right, we went around in circles twice, and we didn't find any more signs to tell us how to get back to the Garden State.

1046
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine this, we're going straight, we figure, alright, we're gonna hit the Garden State.

1047
01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:30,220
Speaker 0: Eventually, we get back, it takes us back to 17, and we pass the same goddamn exit.

1048
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:32,720
Speaker 0: It just took us in a circle.

1049
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,440
Speaker 1: We went in two circles, then we went into a parking lot to rest, and there were some high school kids fooling around.

1050
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,700
Speaker 1: Then we went to a gas station to rest some more.

1051
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,160
Speaker 0: In fact, didn't they write the word "vagina" on someone's car?

1052
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,788
Speaker 1: I think they did, and some girl got mad.

1053
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:44,451
Speaker 1: It was funny.

1054
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:45,095
Speaker 1: Whatever.

1055
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:46,120
Speaker 1: They could do what they want.

1056
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,900
Speaker 1: We rested at a gas station, which was a much needed relief, peeing and such.

1057
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,834
Speaker 1: Then we just kept going north on 17 until eventually we hit 87, thank God.

1058
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:02,440
Speaker 0: The moment, the second we passed into the borders of New York, the roads were suddenly great.

1059
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,260
Speaker 1: It could have had something to do with that fleet of plows that was coming from the New York Department of Transportation.

1060
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:07,798
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1061
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:11,059
Speaker 1: It was a little tough avoiding them with my car, but it worked out.

1062
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:14,106
Speaker 0: We're not really making fun of Jersey.

1063
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:18,340
Speaker 0: It's just the fact that we have trouble almost every time we drive in Jersey.

1064
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:20,359
Speaker 0: We don't have trouble anywhere else.

1065
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,956
Speaker 0: We drive halfway across the country to go to conventions.

1066
01:01:22,996 --> 01:01:23,560
Speaker 0: No issues.

1067
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:24,687
Speaker 0: Jersey?

1068
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:25,519
Speaker 0: God damn it.

1069
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,038
Speaker 0: If you're going north on a road, there'll be exits that don't exist if you're going south or vice versa.

1070
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:31,620
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1071
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,419
Speaker 1: There'll be ways to get off a highway, but then no way to get back on it.

1072
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:46,980
Speaker 1: It's really because the roads are divided, right, with those Jersey dividers, and they're real long and real fast, and it's real hard to figure out how to get to anywhere from them.

1073
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:56,080
Speaker 1: You know, it's like imagine if the highway had stores on the side of it, on both sides, and it's not easy to get to the other side.

1074
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:08,700
Speaker 1: They're very infrequent U-turns and very infrequent left turns, and anything that's off of those main highway divided roads is really, really tricky and scary.

1075
01:02:09,582 --> 01:02:11,360
Speaker 1: And you just don't know where the hell to go, ever.

1076
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:13,879
Speaker 0: Now, independent of that, it's dark and it's snowing.

1077
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:14,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

1078
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:15,819
Speaker 0: And we're tired.

1079
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,540
Speaker 1: Mmm, and hungry.

1080
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, real hungry, because, all right, we got Domino's Pizza, like we said, right?

1081
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:24,871
Speaker 0: I've determined that Domino's Pizza is not food.

1082
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:26,860
Speaker 0: I was not satisfied.

1083
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,280
Speaker 1: Well, Domino's Pizza might not be great, and it's not.

1084
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,400
Speaker 0: Well, that particular Domino's Pizza did not sit well with me.

1085
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,269
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't eat the meat pizza once I saw it.

1086
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:36,877
Speaker 1: I realized it wasn't going to be good.

1087
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:37,540
Speaker 1: I ate the pepperoni.

1088
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you were just as bad off as I was.

1089
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,329
Speaker 0: I was pretty bad off.

1090
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:41,460
Speaker 1: My stomach wasn't the happiest.

1091
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,160
Speaker 0: I was full of food, and my stomach was pissed off at me for some reason.

1092
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:49,640
Speaker 0: But I was still hungry, and I knew that I wasn't getting any nutrition from this pizza.

1093
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,459
Speaker 0: But I was so full, I couldn't eat any other food.

1094
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:59,860
Speaker 1: The thing is, Domino's Pizza might not be anything compared to any other pizza place.

1095
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,300
Speaker 1: But Domino's Pizza is closer to pizza than Taco Bell is to Mexican food.

1096
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I like Taco Bell.

1097
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,411
Speaker 1: I don't like Taco Bell at all.

1098
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:08,814
Speaker 0: It's poison.

1099
01:03:09,684 --> 01:03:10,579
Speaker 0: I eat White Castle.

1100
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:11,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's even worse.

1101
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:12,180
Speaker 1: The worst.

1102
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:12,842
Speaker 0: See, get this.

1103
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:17,460
Speaker 0: I like Taco Bell, even though I don't consider them tacos, but what they are, I like.

1104
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,880
Speaker 1: What they are is poison.

1105
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,119
Speaker 0: What they are isn't so bad.

1106
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:20,779
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

1107
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:22,397
Speaker 0: I'll eat Arby's.

1108
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,240
Speaker 1: I'll eat Arby's, but I think we already ate it, so I can't eat it again for a whole year.

1109
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,799
Speaker 0: And I freaking love White Castles and Hott & Now's.

1110
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:34,160
Speaker 0: Mainly because I grew up in Detroit, where we lived right near a White Castle.

1111
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,600
Speaker 1: No, not eating any of that shit.

1112
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:39,159
Speaker 0: But even the thought of a McDonald's or a Burger King just makes me nauseous.

1113
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:40,620
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't eat any of those.

1114
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,080
Speaker 0: Except McDonald's breakfast, which are freaking awesome.

1115
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,100
Speaker 1: I won't eat a McDonald's anything ever.

1116
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,160
Speaker 0: You make McDonald's eggs, so I don't know why you complain.

1117
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:49,540
Speaker 1: I don't make McDonald's eggs.

1118
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,500
Speaker 1: The milkshakes at McDonald's taste good, actually.

1119
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:53,226
Speaker 1: What?

1120
01:03:53,267 --> 01:03:53,799
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

1121
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do, but I know they're full of chemicals, so I always get real ice cream ones from diners and stuff.

1122
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,120
Speaker 1: Because they taste the same as the McDonald's ones.

1123
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,540
Speaker 0: Alright, so anyway, we've talked a long time, but that's okay.

1124
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,520
Speaker 0: Once again, no podcast on Thursday since Katsucon.

1125
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:09,875
Speaker 0: Unless Scott decides to do something on his own.

1126
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:10,439
Speaker 0: That's all him.

1127
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if you know how to use the mixer and everything.

1128
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:18,000
Speaker 1: It's plugged in, I just start talking, and I push the record button.

1129
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:22,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you could boot an OpEx on my computer and then record to an external hard drive somewhere.

1130
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:24,056
Speaker 1: Or I could just take the mixer into my room and...

1131
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if you know how to use the compressors.

1132
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:28,674
Speaker 0: Though, I ordered a compressor.

1133
01:04:28,774 --> 01:04:29,500
Speaker 0: Well, I'm ordering it.

1134
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,660
Speaker 0: I'll have ordered it probably by the time you listen to this episode.

1135
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,739
Speaker 1: I thought we ordered a disco ball.

1136
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:34,067
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

1137
01:04:34,452 --> 01:04:35,100
Speaker 0: A disco ball.

1138
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,220
Speaker 0: Don't ask, it's late.

1139
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:46,540
Speaker 0: Scott, we're either going to get a dynamic range compressor, like a valve compressor, to stick in to the line between the mixer and the computer for recording.

1140
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:50,240
Speaker 0: Or we're going to get a disco ball and hang it in our little studio here.

1141
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,800
Speaker 1: Both of them should increase the audio quality of the podcast significantly.

1142
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:59,280
Speaker 1: So it's really a matter of price/performance ratios and such.

1143
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the good disco ball is $10 more than the cheap compressor.

1144
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:04,073
Speaker 0: But I could get the $100 compressor.

1145
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:07,480
Speaker 0: But is that worth the difference in the disco ball?

1146
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:08,401
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1147
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:19,040
Speaker 1: I think the 24-inch double mirror disco ball with the colored stripes, as long as we get good, bright white LEDs to point at it, should be the best.

1148
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:20,600
Speaker 1: Even though it's a little more expensive.

1149
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, in sum, UberCon was awesome.

1150
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,748
Speaker 0: Burning Wheel is awesome.

1151
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,580
Speaker 0: Hangman Games are really cool.

1152
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:31,219
Speaker 0: All of you who didn't come to UberCon and see us suck.

1153
01:05:31,621 --> 01:05:35,360
Speaker 0: Though, to the people in Australia and the UK, I kind of understand.

1154
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:36,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

1155
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:39,540
Speaker 1: Oh, and Jersey sucks.

1156
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least North Jersey.

1157
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,460
Speaker 0: I like Wildwood a lot.

1158
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,840
Speaker 1: Well, it's not so much that the state itself sucks, it's the road suck.

1159
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:48,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1160
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,151
Speaker 0: We'll be at KatsuCon.

1161
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:53,160
Speaker 0: I'll mention that again, because I want to see people.

1162
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,780
Speaker 1: Well, you'll be at KatsuCon.

1163
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,759
Speaker 0: I'll be at KatsuCon.

1164
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,037
Speaker 1: I'll be at the New York Comic Con.

1165
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I may or may not be at the New York Comic Con.

1166
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,358
Speaker 1: Two weekends from now.

1167
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:04,040
Speaker 0: Now, Scott, if you want, there's another spot in our room at KatsuCon.

1168
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:05,199
Speaker 0: I burped.

1169
01:06:05,781 --> 01:06:07,499
Speaker 1: I don't really want to pay for that.

1170
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,620
Speaker 0: Eh, it'd be cheaper than what I'm paying, because it'd be one more person.

1171
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, no, because then it would make your price go down.

1172
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd also make your price go down.

1173
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:20,920
Speaker 1: Well, it'd make my price go up from zero to your new decreased price.

1174
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you'd get free transport, because I'm just driving to D.C.

1175
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:24,600
Speaker 0: Thursday after work.

1176
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:26,512
Speaker 1: No, I can't go Thursday.

1177
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:27,400
Speaker 1: That's too early.

1178
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:27,858
Speaker 1: What?

1179
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:28,578
Speaker 1: No.

1180
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:31,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, this was a long episode.

1181
01:06:31,693 --> 01:06:33,300
Speaker 0: I've said that a bunch of times, so we're done.

1182
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:33,883
Speaker 1: We're done.

1183
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:34,940
Speaker 1: Cheers.

1184
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:43,970
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1185
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,629
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

1192
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,430
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1193
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:17,330
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
