1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,348
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday June 30th.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,111
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:17,620
Speaker 0: I'm sky, and this is geek night tonight We talk a bit about the purchasing of laptops.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,948
Speaker 0: So last week something happened that sucked.

6
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,895
Speaker 0: it sucked a great deal, but I'm like it didn't suck.

7
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,560
Speaker 0: that bad for me.

8
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:40,318
Speaker 1: It's like lesser me.

9
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, mainly because I'm on the side of the house that faced this thing more so I had to deal with it.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:57,579
Speaker 0: But basically we did the show last Thursday, and we're all said I'm real tired, but it's okay I'm gonna go straight to bed, and then the next day We're gonna stay in the city late go see Satoshi khan and all that business which we'll talk about on a Wednesday night.

11
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:04,319
Speaker 0: And then just as I'm editing the show I hear a crash outside amidst a bunch of fireworks.

12
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:07,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was in the bathroom, and I heard fireworks go off And I'm like.

13
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,299
Speaker 1: some people think the fourth of July is a little early.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,100
Speaker 1: They couldn't keep it in their closet.

15
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:26,683
Speaker 1: You know granted when I was a kid, but I was blowing stuff up pretty much from the June In the middle of these fireworks I heard one that was much louder, and I thought it was much closer than the others and I was like huh That's strange.

16
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:30,900
Speaker 1: Did it like fail - you know the key went up in the air came down and then exploded.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,260
Speaker 0: What was up now meanwhile, but I didn't think anything more of it because I was in my room with the window open.

18
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,047
Speaker 0: I heard a very dear.

19
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:39,851
Speaker 0: I heard an explosion Followed by holy shit.

20
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,499
Speaker 0: what happened to that pole?

21
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:50,840
Speaker 0: ah And these guys cuz you know we have a car dealership across the street And there's these punk kids who work there overnight like they wash the cars and they work on them.

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,309
Speaker 0: And we figured out in the course of all this How they deal with their overnight job.

23
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:04,140
Speaker 0: because as we were walking over to inspect what befell We saw there's seven cases of corona that they were loading in obviously to replace their previous seven cases of corona.

24
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:09,520
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I'm sitting there and Scott walks in my room is like what was that noise?

25
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,960
Speaker 1: I didn't ask what that was that noise.

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,807
Speaker 1: I was in my room because I thought nothing of it.

27
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,959
Speaker 1: you came and told me what was going on anyway.

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,631
Speaker 0: So I hear holy shit look at that pole.

29
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:20,795
Speaker 0: It's gonna fall over.

30
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,020
Speaker 0: Oh, no what happened?

31
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,540
Speaker 0: I don't know when these guys are like what happened.

32
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:32,980
Speaker 0: I'm looking out the window and sure enough the pole the utility pole down the street is basically Held up by the other two poles adjacent to it.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:46,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, other people might you know live in places the world where they don't have telephone poles like see when I grew up basically, we live in New England, which is the oldest part of the United States and You know telephones are sort of invented.

34
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,593
Speaker 1: well at least they may.

35
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,459
Speaker 1: you know someone else might have invented them.

36
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:56,077
Speaker 1: besides What a telephone pole is I don't know some people they might only have underground telephone where they live.

37
00:02:56,297 --> 00:03:01,880
Speaker 0: granted where I grew up There were no the only telephone poles that weren't underground where the high-tension power lines yep.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,600
Speaker 1: But now we have pieces of wood that are all along the side of the street with wires going from one to the other.

39
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:17,473
Speaker 0: and actually I feel like I could do a short show about because a lot of you it's actually very regimented how Utility poles put together and the best way to explain it electricity at the top.

40
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,241
Speaker 0: the more dangerous something is the higher up It is.

41
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:25,520
Speaker 1: yes because that way the telephone guy doesn't have to get anywhere near the electricity because he'll die.

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,011
Speaker 1: But the electricity guy cuz he's so badass.

43
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:29,860
Speaker 1: You know he can go past the telephone.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,638
Speaker 0: He doesn't give a shit, but actually the details of how all that works is pretty fascinating.

45
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:35,444
Speaker 0: and also There's an unrelated issue.

46
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:39,477
Speaker 0: that it's kind of related because it's the reason the pole basically shattered.

47
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,737
Speaker 1: as opposed to Taking the car they use a certain kind of wood.

48
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,545
Speaker 0: well now It's more that the put.

49
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:48,077
Speaker 0: the average age of a utility pole in the United States is ludicrous.

50
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:51,231
Speaker 0: most of them were put up in The 70s and haven't been touched since.

51
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:52,819
Speaker 1: well cuz even works don't touch it.

52
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:57,865
Speaker 0: But the thing is they don't work anymore because they were designed to do power and Telephone.

53
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:05,152
Speaker 1: and now you look at a telephone pole And it left power on the one at the end of ours at the one at the end of our street Which is adjacent to the one that broke.

54
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,160
Speaker 1: God is ludicrous.

55
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,886
Speaker 0: We should take a picture of that thing and upload it.

56
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:11,400
Speaker 0: just you guys like it look at some sort of monster.

57
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:12,222
Speaker 1: It is.

58
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:17,640
Speaker 0: but basically you look and there's the three phase like power and then the little phone.

59
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:24,466
Speaker 0: And then there's a million gigantic data cables like dragging all these things down And amount these things.

60
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:34,360
Speaker 0: they use bolts and screws and they grow into the wood and as a result They've weakened the wood the telephone pole infrastructure in the United States is on the verge of collapse.

61
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:37,459
Speaker 1: How is that any different from any of the other infrastructure in the United States?

62
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,854
Speaker 0: Because a lot of the other infrastructures are still being maintained much more readily than these poles are I

63
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,539
Speaker 1: guess but not much

64
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:56,431
Speaker 0: Actually, no these I think that the telephone pole infrastructure in the US and as an extension the power distribution grid in the US Are the most critical infrastructural problems we have today.

65
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,996
Speaker 1: It's one of.

66
00:04:58,096 --> 00:04:59,099
Speaker 0: but what's worse than that?

67
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,648
Speaker 0: What's the worst set of infrastructure?

68
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:06,180
Speaker 0: a lesser maintained more poorly put together?

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,311
Speaker 0: More prone to failure more likely to fuck us?

70
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:10,094
Speaker 1: bridges.

71
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:11,580
Speaker 0: bridges are doing fine.

72
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only bridges that are all the bridges are old because they never knock them down and rebuild them So they're all busted.

73
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,082
Speaker 0: Oh, they're not.

74
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:25,390
Speaker 0: actually the only bridges that are having trouble are the white stone and the frogs neck because they're the same damn Bridge, it was a shitty design when they made it in the first place.

75
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker 1: They're like three or four bridges that are messed up.

76
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,690
Speaker 0: Which what bridges they're doing fine.

77
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,299
Speaker 1: It's like the shitty bridge up in Poughkeepsie.

78
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:33,430
Speaker 1: Which one you know?

79
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,620
Speaker 1: the one that goes across the the Hudson up in Poughkeepsie.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,884
Speaker 1: So I got like two lanes.

81
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,694
Speaker 0: you mean the mid Hudson bridge has four lanes.

82
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,480
Speaker 1: No, I'm pretty sure this is it.

83
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,908
Speaker 1: There's a really tiny scary one.

84
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,780
Speaker 1: No, there is doesn't have a dividing in the middle.

85
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:49,255
Speaker 0: Are you talking about the bridge way further north that you've never driven on?

86
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:50,580
Speaker 1: No, I've driven on this bridge.

87
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,594
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know what you're talking about them.

88
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:53,520
Speaker 0: anyway, it's fine.

89
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,260
Speaker 0: It's also in perfect working order and it's not that old.

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,935
Speaker 1: There's that bridge that collapsed out west a bit a while ago, which bridges?

91
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:00,758
Speaker 1: this you don't remember.

92
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:01,180
Speaker 1: There's a huge.

93
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,989
Speaker 1: You're saying the name of the bridge.

94
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,294
Speaker 1: yeah, this is it over.

95
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:11,942
Speaker 1: there was also a galloping gurney Decades ago.

96
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:13,807
Speaker 1: how many times millenniums got?

97
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:22,831
Speaker 0: how many colors that are not gray are in the video of the of that bridge - Dark brownish and sort of whitish.

98
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:36,416
Speaker 0: regardless as a as an IT Professional it is my opinion that the power distribution infrastructure in the United States and by extension the data Distribution infrastructure is the most prone to failure and most dangerous thing.

99
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:37,440
Speaker 0: We've got going right now.

100
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:49,568
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Basically, this thing's being held up and the poles and other side of it are kind of drooped in a little bit and you look And then right as we see oh, there's a car there.

101
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:50,993
Speaker 0: I hear the guys outside go.

102
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:51,474
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

103
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,116
Speaker 0: There's a car.

104
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:52,979
Speaker 0: it stuck to it.

105
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:58,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, some guy crashed his car in a telephone pole this punk kid and he wasn't drunk.

106
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,152
Speaker 0: I saw him do the sobriety test.

107
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:00,919
Speaker 0: He was just stupid.

108
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,726
Speaker 0: He ran into this thing.

109
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:05,737
Speaker 0: I didn't just run into this pole at the speed limits like 25 there.

110
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:13,840
Speaker 0: He ran into this pole fast enough to shatter it and to deploy his airbags and completely ruin his car.

111
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:18,408
Speaker 0: Yep, he was fine, though He was fine But the front of an end of his car was completely smashed.

112
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,516
Speaker 0: fluid was dripping out all over the place.

113
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,279
Speaker 0: car wouldn't start.

114
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:21,440
Speaker 0: it was.

115
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Speaker 1: Luckily, he crashed right on top of the drain in the streets.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,640
Speaker 1: All the fluid went down the drain instead of covering the street making it slippery for the next guy.

117
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,600
Speaker 0: So of course Scott and I walk out and we're standing there kind of sniggering.

118
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,407
Speaker 1: There's sort of rubber necking.

119
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,760
Speaker 1: only we don't have a car to rubberneck out because they're walking.

120
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,590
Speaker 0: Our conversation is along the lines of what a dumbass.

121
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,396
Speaker 0: Oh, man, here come his parents.

122
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,499
Speaker 0: They don't look happy.

123
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:44,529
Speaker 1: Oh, man, here come police.

124
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,486
Speaker 1: Oh, man, here come the fireman The fireman.

125
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:49,440
Speaker 0: but then part of the discussion was wait a minute.

126
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:52,993
Speaker 0: If then if that pole gives way the power line is gonna fall right on us.

127
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:53,956
Speaker 0: Let's stand somewhere else.

128
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:54,899
Speaker 1: We stood somewhere else.

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:02,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're like, ah, we kind of back away walk around and we're watching and one cop car shows up Yells at the kid another cop car shows up now.

130
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:11,960
Speaker 0: The the real problem here is that This is the only non freeway East-west road basically in Dutchess County.

131
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:13,362
Speaker 1: Yeah There's this.

132
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:18,843
Speaker 1: basically there's a lot of places people want to go that the only way they can get there is by driving on this Road past our house.

133
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:26,113
Speaker 0: There are only two roads that go east-west interstate 84 and Route 52 that goes past our house.

134
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,501
Speaker 1: It's also 90.

135
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,183
Speaker 0: Not really.

136
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,447
Speaker 0: that goes north-south Scott.

137
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:37,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can you can sort of you know, take 90, you know if you want to Parallel to 52 for quite a bit.

138
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:38,937
Speaker 1: Not really.

139
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:42,880
Speaker 1: Yeah You can say if you go on the prison road, you can take nine.

140
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:49,425
Speaker 0: Yes, you can go north not east or west on 90 but it's parallel to 52. actually No, it isn't.

141
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:55,918
Speaker 0: then you get on that other road 60 Whatever that goes at a looping angle around and then meets up with 52 it dead.

142
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,120
Speaker 1: But you you can take it as a detour.

143
00:08:58,542 --> 00:08:59,627
Speaker 0: Anyway, my statement.

144
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,482
Speaker 0: it's the only east-west roads in the area Sands.

145
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 0: because you said no if you go way out of your way, you can take that north-south road.

146
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:08,625
Speaker 1: No, it's a detour.

147
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,472
Speaker 0: So it's not a east-west road.

148
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,579
Speaker 1: You can use it to get farther westward.

149
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,020
Speaker 0: Yes, you can all right anyway, well no you have to use the other road.

150
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,390
Speaker 0: It doesn't go east at all or west.

151
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:19,499
Speaker 0: you have to get on that other road.

152
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:29,519
Speaker 0: Anyway, regardless there is no way like whenever there's an accident on i-84 Basically, it is impossible to go east or west in this area for like four hours.

153
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's not really a good situation.

154
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,200
Speaker 1: they're very few major roads.

155
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:45,777
Speaker 1: There's lots of side roads But the major roads are few in number and the reason there's extremely limited number of ways to get from any location to any other Given location is actually only one reason for this and the reason is nimby's and bananas.

156
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:46,320
Speaker 1: pretty much.

157
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,913
Speaker 0: We need to build more roads around here.

158
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:53,356
Speaker 0: We definitely do Someone's down houses down at which yes, we have to buy their houses knock them down.

159
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,260
Speaker 0: build another road.

160
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:54,785
Speaker 0: It will be.

161
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,019
Speaker 1: it's the only way we can do it.

162
00:09:56,321 --> 00:10:01,040
Speaker 0: Alright basically the end result of this and this this is a topic that has often angered me.

163
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:12,339
Speaker 0: It angers me less now that I don't drive to the Bronx every day But basically because one dumb kid drove stupidly and crashed on a road.

164
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:24,259
Speaker 0: The number of people that were inconvenienced and the thousands upon thousands was probably well over $10,000 in damages to the city of beacon and all these delays and all this craziness.

165
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,760
Speaker 0: and It's very difficult to get any of that money out of the kid who made a stupid mistake.

166
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he has to pay for you know a new car.

167
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,140
Speaker 1: Maybe his car insurance premiums.

168
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:35,780
Speaker 0: He's definitely gonna get a ticket.

169
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,620
Speaker 1: He's gonna get some sort of ticket and whatever but you can't sue him for the actual damage caused.

170
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,808
Speaker 1: I mean like let's say I crash my car.

171
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:46,940
Speaker 1: I mean the George Washington Bridge, right?

172
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,690
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know, there's the damage to my car.

173
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,640
Speaker 1: There's the damage to the guy I hit which they can make me pay for.

174
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,028
Speaker 1: Right, there's.

175
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:05,460
Speaker 1: maybe I'll damage the bridge a little bit Maybe I'll scrape it up Right, but think about the traffic that causes of all the time of all the people that is now lost because I screwed up.

176
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,511
Speaker 1: No one pays for that time.

177
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,180
Speaker 1: Those people are just fucked.

178
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 1: There should be a way to force that person to pay for that time.

179
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,248
Speaker 1: but no one could afford that time except Bill Gates.

180
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:19,545
Speaker 1: because think about that you're wasting an hour of the time of Thousands of people.

181
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,714
Speaker 1: an hour times thousands of people.

182
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,663
Speaker 1: that's millions of dollars I mean.

183
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:29,560
Speaker 0: and the worst thing is if it was the middle of the night It's like 1130. and yet the amount of traffic that got backed up by this thing right away.

184
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,878
Speaker 0: Well, when I'm ready, the only reason it was okay is because you could take it.

185
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,705
Speaker 0: The accident was in the perfect place.

186
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:39,080
Speaker 0: You could take the little detour around past our house to get around it.

187
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:41,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is when I woke up in the morning, right?

188
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,419
Speaker 1: They were stay had a new pole in the ground But they were still moving the wires from the old pole to the new pole.

189
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:57,520
Speaker 1: it was actually I was kind of envious of those guys because they got to wake up in the middle of the night which Sucks and then work on this pole pretty much non-stop until it was done, but it was a Friday.

190
00:11:57,601 --> 00:12:03,580
Speaker 1: So as soon as they finished it They got to go home and probably didn't have to work at all and they got paid mad overtime.

191
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:08,200
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh you asshole the part that sucks and the reason I say all this sucks is alright.

192
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:17,390
Speaker 0: So I'm we find I upload the show and I know the power is gonna have to go out while they fix this at some Point and it's balls hot out real hot.

193
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,565
Speaker 0: So I decide alright, I'm not gonna bother with the AC I'm gonna turn everything off.

194
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:24,740
Speaker 0: Leave my windows open leave the fan out as long as I can and go to sleep.

195
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:25,815
Speaker 0: So I lay in bed.

196
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,216
Speaker 0: Bang crash guy yelling bang crash guy yelling bang crash guy.

197
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:32,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have that problem.

198
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:37,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because my windows basically are facing directly at all the business.

199
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:38,659
Speaker 1: I had my windows closed to my AC on.

200
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,126
Speaker 0: yes I didn't do that.

201
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:40,770
Speaker 1: Why didn't you?

202
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:42,320
Speaker 0: because the power is gonna go out.

203
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:44,946
Speaker 1: Then you can get build up some AC.

204
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,491
Speaker 0: see but that wasn't gonna work.

205
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:47,273
Speaker 1: it worked for me.

206
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:48,457
Speaker 0: now, it's alright.

207
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,967
Speaker 0: anyway Some are damaged.

208
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,720
Speaker 0: I closed my windows and turn on the AC and I said as cold as I can.

209
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,270
Speaker 0: So the room gets through about 65 degrees.

210
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,499
Speaker 0: That's a little too cold because I figured that'll hold me over all night And that's fine.

211
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:08,119
Speaker 0: I was actually very comfortable all night Because even after the power went out The room stayed cool and it warmed up gradually and then I woke up and went to work and the power was still out.

212
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,747
Speaker 0: Problem is the power went out.

213
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,899
Speaker 0: my AC turns off which wakes me up.

214
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:19,513
Speaker 0: I'm ready to go back to sleep But then I hear the baby of Scott's UPS cuz he didn't turn it.

215
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:23,007
Speaker 0: also the one in the hallway and the one in the Hallway, cuz again Scott didn't turn it off.

216
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,389
Speaker 1: Why am I?

217
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,620
Speaker 1: the one has to throw the one in the hall next year bedroom?

218
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:26,745
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean anything.

219
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:27,750
Speaker 0: I just ignored it.

220
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took care of it.

221
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,268
Speaker 0: Say I woke it up all these times.

222
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,540
Speaker 0: then I had to go to work then I stayed out all night.

223
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:37,165
Speaker 0: I was so exhausted Friday night All right.

224
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:38,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I woke up.

225
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:52,291
Speaker 1: the only trouble it caused me because the power was on when I woke up but I think it killed the DNS server, which is sad because we had all these computer parts enough to technically build three or four computers and We only managed to build one computer and now it doesn't even work.

226
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,700
Speaker 1: We have all these computer parts and zero working computers.

227
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, what sucked was when I woke up the power was still out So I had to shave and shower in the morning without any lights.

228
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:02,264
Speaker 1: See I woke up.

229
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 1: the power was on but I had to get all these computers back in business as much as I could.

230
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,766
Speaker 0: Right bother.

231
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I did, you know check my emails.

232
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,367
Speaker 0: Don't just go to work and check it.

233
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:11,973
Speaker 0: use your phone or something.

234
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:12,475
Speaker 0: Good guy.

235
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:13,318
Speaker 1: My phone doesn't do that.

236
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:21,971
Speaker 1: Yeah And then when I tried to get out of the driveway, there was a lineup of cars taking the detour But I managed to squeeze out and go to the train.

237
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:24,785
Speaker 1: luckily very luckily But yeah, it was.

238
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:33,480
Speaker 1: the detour is pretty backed up because it was getting towards, you know Daytime rush hour about then and they were still working on the pole and the road was still completely closed.

239
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,751
Speaker 1: It was fixed when I got home though, and now all is well.

240
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,297
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's all we got.

241
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:43,133
Speaker 0: So, uh What do you have in tech news?

242
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:48,940
Speaker 1: so check this out, right There's a lot of places on the Internet's to legally purchase the digital music.

243
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,909
Speaker 1: Right, you got your iTunes with its drm's that were used.

244
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,333
Speaker 1: they sell you individual songs.

245
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,480
Speaker 1: You got your your Napster.

246
00:14:55,801 --> 00:15:04,750
Speaker 1: You know what bought the name Napster, but isn't really Napster is you know, Amazon mp3 store Which is actually not so bad, but the price is still too high for me.

247
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:06,837
Speaker 1: And now the Rhapsody.

248
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:07,640
Speaker 1: now the Rhapsody.

249
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,424
Speaker 1: I don't know.

250
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:09,812
Speaker 1: a lot of people know about the Rhapsody.

251
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,059
Speaker 1: I don't know how popular it is.

252
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:20,659
Speaker 1: It basically works it has DRM and it works with like a lot of these, you know Microsoft Kind of crappy mp3 players like the cheap ones you see in the store.

253
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:31,900
Speaker 1: But the way it works is you actually you pay a flat fee Monthly and you can download as much music as you want and this mad DRM on it.

254
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,260
Speaker 1: So you can only play it on, you know DRM players.

255
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,268
Speaker 1: But there's a hell of a lot of music in there.

256
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:45,373
Speaker 1: like holy shit, and these Rhapsody people they decided All right Here's what we're gonna do and do what everyone else is doing and take out our DRM.

257
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:48,068
Speaker 1: and when I read that headline Rhapsody Removes DRM.

258
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:53,218
Speaker 1: I'm like, I'm signing up I'm gonna sign up and download as much music as I want without DRM for a monthly fee.

259
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:56,219
Speaker 1: Holy shit Holy shit, and I read onwards.

260
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:58,726
Speaker 0: Because think about it for one the only.

261
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:02,740
Speaker 0: I mean we use the Roku for Netflix a whole bunch and it is super DRM.

262
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,540
Speaker 0: But I don't care because I want to watch a movie.

263
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:06,645
Speaker 0: I It's not like.

264
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,440
Speaker 0: they pretend that they're selling me a movie and then they charge me a bunch of money.

265
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,400
Speaker 0: They charge me almost nothing and I'm clearly renting the movie.

266
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,263
Speaker 0: So it works out.

267
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,792
Speaker 0: but music was tougher because with the DRM.

268
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,458
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's with music.

269
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,100
Speaker 1: with a movie.

270
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:21,900
Speaker 1: I'm fine having the movie, you know, not so portable with music.

271
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:27,960
Speaker 1: I need to be able to copy it all over the place I gotta be able to bring it on my laptop and my iPod and I need to be able to mix it into a movie.

272
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,857
Speaker 0: If I want to make a movie, I gotta be able to make excerpts of it for the show whenever it comes up.

273
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:44,207
Speaker 1: Yep anyway, so I go and I'm like, I'm totally gonna do this and I look and Disappointment, but of course, I guess it was expected They're keeping their subscription service.

274
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:57,238
Speaker 1: if with the DRM if you don't do the DRM They're selling the music individually by the song or by the album Just like everyone else is basically no different than the Amazon mp3 store.

275
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,638
Speaker 1: And if I'm gonna do one of these where you buy the music individually, I'm gonna do the Amazon mp3 store.

276
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,939
Speaker 1: Why should I bother with this Rhapsody?

277
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:19,077
Speaker 1: Bullshit thing when the Amazon mp3 store is the same and has you know more music that I want and also doesn't have DRM And works with Amazon which I use a lot anyway And I can actually get like 10% off if I sneak around at the Amazon affiliates program and shit.

278
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,605
Speaker 0: Ah the Amazon affiliates program Amazon associates, but so Really?

279
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,012
Speaker 1: What are they thinking?

280
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:28,736
Speaker 1: and how come?

281
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:29,460
Speaker 1: it's obvious?

282
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:42,763
Speaker 1: I mean if you made a subscription music service just like the Netflix of music where Oh Download as many know that everyone everyone in the universe would sign up everyone who makes Knows this.

283
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,189
Speaker 0: it's it's common knowledge.

284
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,936
Speaker 0: They know exactly what would work very well.

285
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:46,880
Speaker 0: It would make a ton of money.

286
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,603
Speaker 0: What would be perfect?

287
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,319
Speaker 0: the people that won't let it happen are the record labels and the artists?

288
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:55,130
Speaker 1: I think there's some artists who wouldn't mind.

289
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,411
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but by and large it's the And the record labels who the artists sign their rights away to.

290
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,900
Speaker 1: I think about this you sign into iTunes, right?

291
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,952
Speaker 1: And there's that front page that's like hot new music.

292
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,039
Speaker 1: check these people out, right?

293
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:08,607
Speaker 1: But it all costs money.

294
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,600
Speaker 1: so you don't really click on any of that shit, right?

295
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:12,892
Speaker 1: Imagine it was a subscription service.

296
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:14,020
Speaker 1: download all you want.

297
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:24,641
Speaker 1: I'll just try everything on the front page and then artists would be paying a hell of a lot of money to get them on The front page because pretty much everyone would download and listen to them and then their concerts to be sold out if they were any Good,

298
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,569
Speaker 0: but who doesn't make money off of this game?

299
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,879
Speaker 0: the record label and record label just needs to die.

300
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,685
Speaker 1: Yes, I think that's made clear.

301
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:33,313
Speaker 1: And actually I read this really great article today.

302
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,196
Speaker 1: I just remembered.

303
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:34,938
Speaker 1: I'm gonna link to it.

304
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:36,878
Speaker 1: basically the.

305
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:46,186
Speaker 1: What he says in this article right is that there's sort of this common perception right that you that Technology is moving so fast.

306
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,892
Speaker 1: The business can't keep up with it, right?

307
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:50,520
Speaker 1: He's like that's complete bullshit.

308
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,032
Speaker 1: That's like saying all these snails.

309
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:54,479
Speaker 1: They're going too fast for us.

310
00:18:55,043 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 1: Napster came around before the year 2000 not and music record companies still haven't changed now.

311
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,109
Speaker 0: 2000 doesn't seem that long ago.

312
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,580
Speaker 0: That was eight years ago.

313
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:20,809
Speaker 1: These people have had between five and fifteen years and actually deal with the Internet and all of the other Technological consequences was when Napster died.

314
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,077
Speaker 0: now when it started they have had eight years.

315
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:32,380
Speaker 1: the music companies TV Everyone who is getting all the businesses that are getting destroyed because technology has made them obsolete.

316
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:44,432
Speaker 1: These companies have had forever to do something about it to change in some way And not one has managed to do anything about it.

317
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:45,676
Speaker 1: Not one.

318
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:52,896
Speaker 1: the technology sure It's moving pretty fast compared, you know in a historical perspective, but it is not moving so fast.

319
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:54,160
Speaker 1: You can't adapt to it.

320
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,890
Speaker 1: That is a ludicrous ludicrous idea.

321
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,600
Speaker 1: Well, it has taken years for these things to happen.

322
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:03,822
Speaker 1: You know, even if it only took months months is plenty of time But years.

323
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:10,080
Speaker 1: you had eight years since the death of Napster to do something to fix music and they haven't done shit.

324
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,324
Speaker 1: They can't be blaming.

325
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:13,030
Speaker 1: the technology moves too fast.

326
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,920
Speaker 1: Their business is slower than a snail.

327
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,205
Speaker 1: Well is all their fault?

328
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,856
Speaker 0: speaking of come the one company that does get it.

329
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:24,996
Speaker 0: I Remember a while ago Netflix announced famously that they're just.

330
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,040
Speaker 0: they didn't really announce.

331
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,034
Speaker 0: They just kind of emailed all their subscribers and said hey less than 1% of you use profiles.

332
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:35,003
Speaker 0: So we're just gonna get rid of them and That's the end of that.

333
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:35,785
Speaker 0: and we're done.

334
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,949
Speaker 0: That's all we're saying about it.

335
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,360
Speaker 0: And of course the internet lost its shit about this.

336
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,307
Speaker 1: Well, let me for people who don't use Netflix.

337
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,210
Speaker 1: Let me explain right?

338
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 1: so Netflix is basically automatic DVD rental.

339
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,460
Speaker 1: They if you buy if you let's say you choose you want a two DVD plan, right?

340
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 1: So you go on the website you pick DVDs out and you put them in a queue.

341
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,210
Speaker 1: It's the order you want to get that.

342
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:55,239
Speaker 1: you want to watch the movies in.

343
00:20:55,661 --> 00:21:00,160
Speaker 1: They mail you the movies you mail them back when you're done and every time you mail one back They send you another one.

344
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:10,075
Speaker 1: So a two DVD plan means you will have two DVDs in your possession at once and when you mail one back you get one Back, you know the one thing when I first got onto Netflix and I noticed right away.

345
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,220
Speaker 0: Alright, I have three DVDs.

346
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:17,458
Speaker 0: I want to have a DVD dedicated to anime a DVD dedicated TV shows like Seinfeld and a DVD dedicated to movies.

347
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:19,304
Speaker 0: and Netflix said Oh, you can't do that.

348
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:27,198
Speaker 0: And I said hey, but then my friend Scott Johnson said, oh well You have to make a separate profile for each person and make up some people.

349
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,599
Speaker 0: So yes See the idea I made up anime McAnime and TV show McTV.

350
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,250
Speaker 1: Yes, see the idea behind the profiles feature right?

351
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:36,631
Speaker 1: is that?

352
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,935
Speaker 1: let's say you're a family.

353
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,880
Speaker 1: you have mommy daddy and two kids.

354
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:41,260
Speaker 1: You're a perfect American family.

355
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,943
Speaker 1: How nice.

356
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:53,620
Speaker 1: you would buy a four disc plan and each person would have their own Netflix account But you only pay for one plan and that way each person Manages their own cue for their one DVD separately.

357
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:56,920
Speaker 1: The thing is they didn't anticipate, you know.

358
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:08,760
Speaker 1: And they still apparently don't understand that if one person has more than one disc Even they want one account one login, but they want separate cues for each disc.

359
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,291
Speaker 1: It just makes sense.

360
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,480
Speaker 1: I don't want to have one.

361
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,920
Speaker 1: I mean if I have one cue right just one list and I put I want Seinfeld season four.

362
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,528
Speaker 1: That's like, you know, how many discs right?

363
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,960
Speaker 1: I don't want three discs of that at once.

364
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:24,456
Speaker 1: I had to watch one then watch the other then watch the.

365
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,260
Speaker 1: it doesn't help me.

366
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
Speaker 1: I need I might as well just get one disc at that point.

367
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,746
Speaker 1: I want three separate discs.

368
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:36,840
Speaker 1: that way I can have you know a movie a disc of Seinfeld and An anime, you know show at the same time.

369
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,670
Speaker 1: So that way I can watch some anime when I feel like it.

370
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,220
Speaker 1: when I send an anime back I get an anime bag.

371
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,020
Speaker 1: That's what I want.

372
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:55,060
Speaker 1: but the only way that's possible in Netflix is to make up fake people and pretend you're a Family with an anime watching kid a Seinfeld watching person and a movie watching person, but Netflix.

373
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,376
Speaker 0: What I thought was beautiful about this debacle was that they said and they kept saying less than 1% of our users use it.

374
00:23:03,422 --> 00:23:10,695
Speaker 0: I think it was noted on Fark and slash dot and dig that well I guess that entire 1% is everyone on Fark slash dot and dig.

375
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much Either either.

376
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:16,825
Speaker 1: Netflix has an extraordinary Number of customers.

377
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:24,520
Speaker 1: to end the vocal Netflix customers on the internet are only 1% of their total customer base Which is I guess could be possible.

378
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,579
Speaker 0: Well, we got lying.

379
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:36,709
Speaker 0: See the thing is we got the answer to this quite clearly because I got an email from Netflix today and it says and I quote We are keeping Netflix profiles.

380
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:38,595
Speaker 0: dear Brandon you've spoken we listened.

381
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:40,040
Speaker 0: we are keeping profiles.

382
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:43,614
Speaker 0: Thank you for all the calls and emails telling us how important profiles are.

383
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:45,923
Speaker 0: We are sorry for any inconvenience We have caused.

384
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,852
Speaker 0: we hope the next time you hear from us.

385
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:51,846
Speaker 0: We will delight and not disappoint you Your friends at Netflix.

386
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:52,990
Speaker 0: now one.

387
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,850
Speaker 0: this tells me that they were lying about the 1% because they wouldn't do this unless they had taken a hit and two.

388
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:10,093
Speaker 0: it proves that when Geeks can they vote with their wallets because I remember when they announced this I didn't notice until Scott Johnson said Oh my god, and then I looked and sure enough.

389
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,320
Speaker 0: They'd cut our way profiles.

390
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:18,120
Speaker 0: I called Netflix immediately and I when I picked up they didn't say, you know, huh Netflix, how can I help you?

391
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,460
Speaker 0: They said are you calling about profiles?

392
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:24,627
Speaker 0: And I said is there anything I can do to keep my profiles?

393
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:25,670
Speaker 0: and they said no.

394
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,562
Speaker 0: and I said the only reason I'm not Roku.

395
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:35,033
Speaker 0: what's the cheapest plan I can get and still use my Roku?

396
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:36,076
Speaker 0: I want that plan.

397
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:39,626
Speaker 0: and they said fine It's $8.99 one DVD unlimited.

398
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:40,509
Speaker 0: It'll be effective.

399
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,220
Speaker 1: even to fight with you retention didn't even come play into it.

400
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,649
Speaker 1: They just said let's get this over with.

401
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,460
Speaker 1: I got like a hundred calls about the profiles after you kids.

402
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:58,686
Speaker 0: Yep now and For what I gather pretty much everyone called and either canceled their Netflix or dropped to the cheapest plan They could be which was one.

403
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:02,984
Speaker 1: because if you only have one disc and one profile, then it's okay You don't have a problem.

404
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:06,180
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if I have two discs, I need two cues.

405
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:13,380
Speaker 0: I guess if you're unemployed or something Then you could deal with having like four DVDs in one cue because you don't care you're gonna watch them all immediately.

406
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:15,216
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Netflix.

407
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:25,480
Speaker 1: really though I mean the profiles are good because there are plenty of people who have a Household of multiple human beings and what they want one Netflix account one Netflix bill and multiple people to have one cue each.

408
00:25:25,947 --> 00:25:26,660
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

409
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:38,682
Speaker 1: However, there are also people out there who are a single human being yet They want multiple DVDs at a time and they need to add the feature where you can have multiple cues in one profile.

410
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:53,177
Speaker 0: the thing is I get the impression that what a lot of people do and I saw a lot of people saying this on The internet when other people complained and I'm going to paraphrase all of their responses into one made-up post that I'm going to quote now Thus constructing the perfect straw man to that argue against

411
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:53,760
Speaker 1: alrighty.

412
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:55,980
Speaker 0: I don't know why you people are so mad about this.

413
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,392
Speaker 0: I mean, seriously, I have four DVDs and you know what.

414
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:01,947
Speaker 0: every time I send a DVD back I just go to the queue and rearrange everything.

415
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,011
Speaker 0: so it works and you know what.

416
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:09,635
Speaker 0: the only reason I use I'm not quoting my Straw man anymore The only reason I use Netflix because I don't have to do that.

417
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,010
Speaker 0: if I had to do that I wouldn't be using Netflix.

418
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:13,039
Speaker 1: time is yeah.

419
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:17,238
Speaker 1: If I was doing that I just go to blockbuster and pick out a movie every time.

420
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:25,708
Speaker 0: in fact I would probably get the blockbuster plan because then I can just go to the blockbuster and get video games And get whatever thing I want.

421
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:28,780
Speaker 0: I only use Netflix because it requires zero effort.

422
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:40,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just want to set up these cues and then if I ever think of a movie or if I notice a movie I just add it to the queue not even think about it and just DVDs come in the mail without having to think and that Is why Netflix is great?

423
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:48,688
Speaker 1: So having one cue and having to constantly finagle the cue to get it in the right order because that's a really good word Multiple discs.

424
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:56,580
Speaker 1: That's one of my favorite words Defeats the purpose of having Netflix and there's no reason to pay for something like that because it'd be actually take less time.

425
00:26:56,661 --> 00:27:00,491
Speaker 1: Just go to blockbuster Like on the way home from work or something.

426
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,523
Speaker 0: But anyway Netflix Realize this.

427
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:08,769
Speaker 1: I still think if we're strong enough to get Netflix to bring back the feature We can force them to add the next fee.

428
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:09,935
Speaker 0: Well, well, here's the thing.

429
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:13,284
Speaker 0: Here's the rub Netflix fucked up.

430
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:24,460
Speaker 0: We had four DVDs come into this house and because we're busy all the time partly We used to use all those DVDs, but then you know, we started doing geek nights and we stopped watching movies.

431
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,978
Speaker 0: We kept all the DVDs.

432
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:33,300
Speaker 0: tonight Anime cue that I was using because I watch stuff on the train and the movie cue pretty much didn't get used anymore.

433
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:37,257
Speaker 0: but one of the cues Emily used one of the cues was like the Simpsons and whatever cue.

434
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:42,596
Speaker 0: but When Netflix fucked us and I dropped to one cue I noticed that wait a minute.

435
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:46,511
Speaker 0: every TV show I can watch free online now, except Seinfeld.

436
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:52,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got the Hulu.com action going on Is not bad as distasteful and corporate as it is.

437
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:56,300
Speaker 1: the ads are short and tasteful and the content is plentiful.

438
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,835
Speaker 0: So I use that for all the you know, old TV shows and new TV shows.

439
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,060
Speaker 0: I want to watch like The Daily Show.

440
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:06,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, I use South Park their website to watch South Park.

441
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:10,604
Speaker 1: I use College Humor YouTube Angry video game.

442
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:12,431
Speaker 1: nerd, you know, I'll see.

443
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:14,840
Speaker 1: ya get the the zero punctuation.

444
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,496
Speaker 1: There's plenty of videos on the Internet's to entertain now that we have a computer.

445
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:25,600
Speaker 0: basically the TV Netflix did is make me realize that I only need one or at most two cues.

446
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,159
Speaker 0: So they're not gonna get my business back.

447
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:30,793
Speaker 0: they basically just screwed themselves out of my money.

448
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:34,169
Speaker 0: and I think I'm not the only one because Like I was isn't a fast karate.

449
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:36,500
Speaker 0: and he was talking about how awesome his Roku is.

450
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,748
Speaker 0: and I think the Roku is the future.

451
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:46,460
Speaker 0: and I think Netflix kind of made a bad move here because a lot of people are Probably not going to get their cues back because they're gonna realize how little they use them.

452
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:47,323
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

453
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:47,946
Speaker 1: check this out.

454
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:49,171
Speaker 1: You're ready in a way.

455
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,778
Speaker 1: It's not a bad move for Netflix.

456
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,651
Speaker 0: And here's why Oh, yeah, they're all I agree with.

457
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:53,720
Speaker 0: I think I know what you're gonna say here.

458
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,376
Speaker 0: Let's see if I was gonna say the same thing.

459
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:03,717
Speaker 0: you were gonna say It's a lot cheaper to stream shitty movies to people than to mail good physical movies to people.

460
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:09,382
Speaker 1: and they're paying the same Subscription price And they're paying $100 for a box They're probably profiting.

461
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:14,015
Speaker 1: that box is maybe maybe like 25 bucks of electronics.

462
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:14,998
Speaker 1: Maybe at the most.

463
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,007
Speaker 0: Yeah Look at the movies in there.

464
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,233
Speaker 0: I mean, what did they just add in the last couple?

465
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,220
Speaker 1: all the troma films which suck.

466
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,268
Speaker 0: We actually watched Teenage Cat.

467
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:26,813
Speaker 1: No, I don't call that watching.

468
00:29:26,854 --> 00:29:27,696
Speaker 1: we skimmed.

469
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:28,740
Speaker 1: we we all right.

470
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,090
Speaker 1: Let me tell you land stat it to see what the deal was.

471
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,500
Speaker 0: teenage cat girls in heat was one of those movies.

472
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:37,415
Speaker 0: That was awesome in the kind of I remember the title like that.

473
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,580
Speaker 1: How can it not be infamous?

474
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,974
Speaker 0: We did I remember we were told it existed and did not believe that it was real.

475
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:49,036
Speaker 0: until we saw the DVD at video bar We laughed hysterically and decided that we weren't going to get it for obvious reasons.

476
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:51,466
Speaker 0: Yep, but now Netflix on demand.

477
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,655
Speaker 0: it cost us nothing but our time.

478
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:54,217
Speaker 1: Yep.

479
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:54,840
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

480
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:58,419
Speaker 0: I said a little while ago that my time is my most valuable commodity and what do I do?

481
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,640
Speaker 0: Piss it away on teenage cat girls in heat immediately.

482
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:04,181
Speaker 1: Well, we fast-forwarded through it So it.

483
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,811
Speaker 1: we didn't really waste that more time than it was worth that movie.

484
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:09,460
Speaker 0: not enough cat girls not enough.

485
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,706
Speaker 1: Well, there were no cat girls.

486
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,269
Speaker 1: They were cast.

487
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,448
Speaker 1: that turned into non cat girls Yes, which was disappointing.

488
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:17,034
Speaker 1: at least put some ears on them.

489
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:22,209
Speaker 1: or like a you know, leopard print You know loincloth, but to not enough heat.

490
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,100
Speaker 0: three mostly about these two really stupid guys.

491
00:30:27,121 --> 00:30:35,067
Speaker 1: It was one of those typical late-night not Cinemax cable movies where it's pretty much You know teenage boys watching go.

492
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:35,710
Speaker 1: Oh man.

493
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,840
Speaker 1: Oh man, there's gonna be action and there's never any action.

494
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:38,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

495
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:43,368
Speaker 1: You're better off watching our MD guys He's better off watching skin of X because there'll be some action.

496
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:46,457
Speaker 0: MD guys is the most dangerous, but he is not a doctor.

497
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:48,524
Speaker 1: No All right.

498
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,731
Speaker 0: All right, you know, I feel like I should talk about this.

499
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,280
Speaker 0: I'm gonna I'm not gonna actually talk about it.

500
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,327
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna bring it up.

501
00:30:55,092 --> 00:31:01,020
Speaker 0: all this business with Unlimited, you know flat top-level domains anyone can pay for a top-level domain.

502
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:15,020
Speaker 0: That is possibly the dumbest thing that I cannot express to you from a techno Technological standpoint as an IT professional Someone who has paid a lot of money to sit there and tell other people what I think about technology.

503
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,368
Speaker 0: It is such a bad idea.

504
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:20,053
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna say why.

505
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:22,140
Speaker 0: I just want to get my opinion out there and be done with it.

506
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:28,859
Speaker 0: And don't even get me started on internationalizing the domain names with like Russian and Cyrillic and Japanese characters.

507
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,377
Speaker 0: Ah Anyway things of the day.

508
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:44,639
Speaker 0: the the fact that this is on gizmodo is Pretty much entirely made up for by what it is.

509
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:50,606
Speaker 0: I really wouldn't link to gizmodo if it weren't totally awesome Because they're kind of just classless and I really don't enjoy them.

510
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:59,973
Speaker 0: But anyway Lego has a vault of almost every Lego product they've ever made Unopened and this video shows you all of it and the reason.

511
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:07,450
Speaker 0: you know the reasons they keep the vault, you know copyright and trademarks and patents and you know Also for museum purposes and archives and whatever.

512
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:16,844
Speaker 0: The coolest thing is that you'll watch this video and you're gonna see all these things things that you had played with in your youth or saw other kids play with.

513
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:21,257
Speaker 0: the nostalgia factor is Painful, it's super painful.

514
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:24,750
Speaker 1: Especially of course the guy goes right for the best possible sets.

515
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:32,250
Speaker 0: He's like the original yellow castle the better castle that came later the pirates the spacemen the monorail.

516
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:37,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you know you all wanted the monorail and none of your parents would buy it for you.

517
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,930
Speaker 0: Maybe there was that rich kid down the street who had the monorail, but he never let you play with it.

518
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the yellow castle as nostalgic and cool as it is.

519
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,007
Speaker 1: I much prefer the castle that comes after it the the black knight the castle that came before.

520
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:50,910
Speaker 1: that he shows.

521
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:52,409
Speaker 1: He shows it for like a second.

522
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:57,670
Speaker 1: I never had that castle, but I wanted it badly, but it was a hundred dollars which in those days was crazy.

523
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:00,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, the model Lego sets now are like more than a hundred hours.

524
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,150
Speaker 0: The monorail was a hundred and twenty dollars.

525
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,056
Speaker 0: I wanted it desperately.

526
00:33:05,176 --> 00:33:15,679
Speaker 0: It was on every Christmas list when I was a kid and my parents, you know Santa Claus never brought no the biggest Lego sets like I were like these $60 ones I never ever ever got.

527
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,250
Speaker 0: the biggest one ever got was at the end.

528
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:23,557
Speaker 0: But the last Lego I ever got with my own money my own money meaning my allowance I bought the space shuttle.

529
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:27,839
Speaker 1: yet in aggregate if you added my Legos together I could have had three of those giant castles.

530
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,950
Speaker 1: I would have traded all my Legos for three giant castles.

531
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:37,019
Speaker 0: You realize you guys are so lucky that our Legos are not here because gig knives would end and I would be playing with my Legos every other night.

532
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,109
Speaker 1: I guess you can make Lego videos.

533
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,664
Speaker 0: We just turned into the Lego show.

534
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:41,269
Speaker 1: I don't know.

535
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:43,175
Speaker 1: Is there a Lego podcast?

536
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:45,565
Speaker 0: it needs to be I really want to play with like someone.

537
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:46,128
Speaker 1: get on that.

538
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:50,950
Speaker 1: All right, so There have been audio files before.

539
00:33:52,611 --> 00:34:03,010
Speaker 1: I'm worried about what you're gonna bring up, you know people who say oh, yes, if you use this wooden volume knob It will cancel the evil vibrations your music will sound better.

540
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,502
Speaker 0: I remember reading a journal about some audio files and they were completely.

541
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:07,024
Speaker 0: they had this.

542
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,137
Speaker 0: it was like a blog and they were talking About ah this room.

543
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,744
Speaker 0: like we had this problem one day.

544
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:16,750
Speaker 0: the craziest thing and you know We we were doing audio tests and this one stereo sounded great.

545
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,109
Speaker 0: Then we went to get lunch and we came back and it sounded like shit.

546
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,056
Speaker 0: We couldn't figure out why and blah blah blah blah.

547
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:28,989
Speaker 0: and then we figured out that Joe had spilled a little bit of coffee on the Coffee table and that was ruining the sound and we got the coffee table out and replaced it with a different table.

548
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,976
Speaker 0: It sounded great again.

549
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,610
Speaker 0: So watch where you spill stuff.

550
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,121
Speaker 0: And I remember my brain wanted to jump out of my eyeballs and kill itself.

551
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:35,703
Speaker 1: Yes.

552
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:41,830
Speaker 1: So this is perhaps the worst audiophile offending product ever.

553
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,516
Speaker 0: Right, even what you're bringing up here.

554
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,425
Speaker 1: There is the $1,200 power cable.

555
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:49,050
Speaker 1: That was pretty offensive.

556
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:50,830
Speaker 1: Actually, I say this is equally offensive.

557
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:58,454
Speaker 1: Here we have the for all the five hundred and one dollar Ethernet cable.

558
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:00,119
Speaker 0: now, I'm probably.

559
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:04,190
Speaker 0: this is ripped off almost shamelessly from Lewis black, but it's digital.

560
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,296
Speaker 0: It's digital.

561
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:06,381
Speaker 0: It can't change.

562
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:07,588
Speaker 1: I can't have any effect.

563
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:22,459
Speaker 1: a $2.00 network cable That was like Lewis black but then Gilbert Godfrey stuck his way On Amazon, it's only four hundred and seventy-five dollars.

564
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,723
Speaker 0: Oh the Amazon discount.

565
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:24,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, how it's worth it.

566
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,030
Speaker 1: Yeah suddenly, right?

567
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:30,522
Speaker 1: It's just a network cable with some fancy stuff around it.

568
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,528
Speaker 0: It's cat four thousand e.

569
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:35,665
Speaker 1: yeah The reason this is a thing of the day, right?

570
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:42,072
Speaker 1: It's not because I want to you to buy this thing or not just to warn you not to buy because if you're a geek That's listener.

571
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,179

Speaker 1: I've got also a What's the word for making sterilization kits?

578
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:07,608

579
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:14,070
Speaker 1: All right So this is actually a Dean on a KDL one dedicated link cable.

580
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:17,058
Speaker 1: Do not buy any product by Dean on.

581
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,642
Speaker 1: I do not.

582
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:21,550
Speaker 1: if it says Dean on on it don't buy it now.

583
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:28,890
Speaker 1: The reason I'm linking to this as I was about to tell you I'm gonna tell you right now is because an Amazon.

584
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:44,357
Speaker 1: Amazon not only sells products at a good price They allow customers to review products And of course, you know, you might expect there to be stupid customer reviews of audio files saying Oh, I use this network cable on my audio equipment.

585
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:46,122
Speaker 1: Oh, it sounds so great.

586
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:46,623
Speaker 1: Now.

587
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:47,465
Speaker 1: This is totally worth the $500.

588
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:47,726
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

589
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:57,890
Speaker 1: You might be expecting to see Customer reviews from people like myself saying wow anyone who buys this is a complete idiot.

590
00:36:58,072 --> 00:36:59,970
Speaker 1: Why are you spending four hundred eighty dollars in something?

591
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,409
Speaker 1: That's no better than something for them like a piece of copper wire from home from Radio Shack.

592
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:06,777
Speaker 0: What Scott do we see?

593
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:08,545
Speaker 1: Let me let me read you once.

594
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:09,469
Speaker 0: What do you see?

595
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:22,207
Speaker 1: Let me read you the first sentence from the first customer review and This is from Michael McKinley on amazon.com rating one star disappointing quality.

596
00:37:22,227 --> 00:37:30,818
Speaker 1: a caution to people buying these if you do not follow the Directional markings on the cables your music will play backwards.

597
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,065
Speaker 1: Please check that before mentioning it in your views.

598
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,213
Speaker 1: I Disappointed.

599
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,038
Speaker 1: I consider myself an audiophile.

600
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,730
Speaker 1: I regularly spend over a thousand dollars in cables to get the ultimate sound.

601
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:48,790
Speaker 1: I keep my music listening room and a Faraday cage to prevent any interference that could alter my music listening experience.

602
00:37:49,152 --> 00:37:53,272
Speaker 1: Sending any signal down ordinary copper can degrade the signal considerably Well.

603
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:57,305
Speaker 1: ordinary listeners might not notice to somebody with even a rudimentary knowledge of sound.

604
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,670
Speaker 1: the artifacts are glaring.

605
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:07,090
Speaker 1: Denon should have used silver wiring hermetically sealed inside the rubber sheath to prevent any tarnishing of course Which has significantly higher conductivity than copper.

606
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:14,330
Speaker 1: Furthermore Denon needs to treat the wires they use in the cable with polarity inductor to ensure minimal phase variance.

607
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:19,689
Speaker 1: Leanless to say I return the cable and wrote an angry letter with the so-called engineers at Dena.

608
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:24,799
Speaker 1: Let me let me read one more Four stars.

609
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,669
Speaker 1: it gets me closer to the Lord.

610
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:34,469
Speaker 1: If I could use a Ross rusty box cutter to carve a new orifice in my body that's compatible with this link cable I would already be doing it.

611
00:38:34,951 --> 00:38:40,812
Speaker 1: I can just imagine the pre-musical goodness that would flow through this cable into the wound and fill me completely like white Holy light.

612
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:45,330
Speaker 1: holding this cable in my hands actually makes me feel that much closer to the Lord Jesus Christ.

613
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:51,130
Speaker 1: I only make 625 an hour at the jack-in-the-box, but I saved up for three months so I could have this cable.

614
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:52,498
Speaker 1: It sits in a shrine.

615
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:54,610
Speaker 1: I construct it next to my futon and mother's basement.

616
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,473
Speaker 1: I only give it four stars in my review because I can't find music that is worthy enough to flow through this utterly perfect Interconnect.

617
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:12,390
Speaker 0: the fact that he refers to mother as opposed to my mom They there are many many many more reviews in this hilarious style, thank you.

618
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:14,616
Speaker 0: Thank you internet.

619
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:19,348
Speaker 1: It's incredibly evil and scam artist product to use a Riley ism.

620
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:20,170
Speaker 0: Thank you internet.

621
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:20,653
Speaker 0: You've you.

622
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,969
Speaker 0: my faith in the internet is back.

623
00:39:23,632 --> 00:39:26,863
Speaker 0: You people make me proud to be an internet person.

624
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:27,786
Speaker 1: so go forth.

625
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:31,746
Speaker 1: Hey of course you know it's really sad if you look at the reviews.

626
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:36,710
Speaker 1: of course You can't really trust the reviews cuz a lot of them are just you know random like that four star one.

627
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:41,650
Speaker 1: But actually there are a hundred and four or five stars and sixty seven one star.

628
00:39:42,893 --> 00:39:43,522
Speaker 1: oh well.

629
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:55,929
Speaker 0: so I Bought a laptop recently and Scott owns a laptop that I bought about a year earlier And Alex just bought a new laptop and way too much money, but it's worth it.

630
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,335
Speaker 0: I don't think it was way too much money.

631
00:39:57,376 --> 00:39:57,818
Speaker 0: Well.

632
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,288
Speaker 1: It was it was the price that was demanded for the quality.

633
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:03,577
Speaker 1: Yes You get what you pay for.

634
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:11,188
Speaker 0: but we realize we should talk I'm not gonna talk really in the abstract a lot about the concept of a laptop.

635
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:11,409
Speaker 1: now.

636
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:17,029
Speaker 1: well You see what's been going on is actually we've reached a point where laptops are more popular than desktops.

637
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:20,418
Speaker 1: Laptop sales exceed desktop sales.

638
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:21,682
Speaker 1: that is the world we live in there.

639
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:30,043
Speaker 1: a lot of this is the world we live in and They seem to have a really hard time picking out a laptop.

640
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:31,710
Speaker 1: which ones are good which ones are bad?

641
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,114
Speaker 1: Which one should I buy?

642
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:39,313
Speaker 1: and a lot of people make you know not so good decisions and some people make good decisions But some people don't.

643
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,645
Speaker 1: and we often are asked which laptop should I buy?

644
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:44,190
Speaker 1: or here's a few laptops?

645
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,195
Speaker 1: Which one should I get?

646
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:47,170
Speaker 1: or I need a laptop for this other person?

647
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,133
Speaker 1: Which one should they get?

648
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:53,690
Speaker 0: and if you don't want the belabored answer we have a short easy set of questions.

649
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,659
Speaker 0: You can ask yourself, but then we'll talk in depth.

650
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,970
Speaker 1: Yes, so the first question you ask yourself.

651
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,659
Speaker 0: This is very simple this you need a computer.

652
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,109
Speaker 0: Yes now that might sound like a dumb question, but Seriously think about it.

653
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:12,970
Speaker 0: I've seen people who own laptops who do not use their computer let alone their laptop.

654
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,677
Speaker 0: Yep, so all right you've answered that question.

655
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:18,604
Speaker 0: then question number two is very very simple.

656
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:21,050
Speaker 1: Do you have money?

657
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:22,915
Speaker 1: Don't have money.

658
00:41:22,935 --> 00:41:26,329
Speaker 1: a laptop is probably something you shouldn't buy.

659
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:27,394
Speaker 0: well We'll get to that.

660
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:28,740
Speaker 0: you could buy the the cheapo.

661
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:31,114
Speaker 0: yeah That's.

662
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,141
Speaker 1: if you don't have maybe have no money But if it basically how much money do you have is?

663
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:36,728
Speaker 1: that is the real question you have to answer.

664
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:38,514
Speaker 0: well It's do you have money?

665
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:40,019
Speaker 0: are you willing to spend it?

666
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,409
Speaker 0: because if you have the money to spend just go buy a?

667
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:46,199
Speaker 0: Really good two to three thousand dollar laptop.

668
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,283
Speaker 0: It'll do everything you want.

669
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:48,690
Speaker 0: It'll be perfect in every way you're done.

670
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:56,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you don't care about spending more I mean even if you only need a thousand dollar laptop if you're stupid rich why not buy the $3,000 laptops,

671
00:41:56,754 --> 00:42:10,857
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what like the difference between a thousand dollar laptop and a two thousand dollar laptop Is that it'll be smaller lighter faster the battery will last a freaking lot longer It'll be supported better, and it'll just work.

672
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:18,786
Speaker 0: the difference between a $2,000 laptop and a $3,000 laptop Is that the battery will last about 45 minutes longer.

673
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,670
Speaker 0: It'll be a little bit lighter and a tiny bit smaller.

674
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:24,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, but really it's.

675
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,600
Speaker 1: it's the three thousand dollar laptops.

676
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:34,807
Speaker 1: even though the actual numerical increase is only marginal The actual life experience increase is like chocolate and shit.

677
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:36,615
Speaker 0: it is that Pretty much.

678
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:45,650
Speaker 0: if you're if you want a good laptop Spend the money and if you don't spend the money then you're not going to get what you could have gotten.

679
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,588
Speaker 0: You're not going to be satisfied, right?

680
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:51,210
Speaker 1: So the thing you have to ask yourself now is what are you gonna?

681
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,434
Speaker 1: Do with this laptop?

682
00:42:52,494 --> 00:43:01,754
Speaker 1: if you're just looking to you know browse the web on the go do a little word Processing a little email little forums right maybe a little flash games You know.

683
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:03,241
Speaker 1: then maybe you know you can look at.

684
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,050
Speaker 1: start looking at maybe the MacBook Air.

685
00:43:05,192 --> 00:43:09,622
Speaker 1: Maybe look at you know with some of the cheap $1,000 guys even the EPC but again the MacBook Air.

686
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:10,345
Speaker 0: do you have money?

687
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,450
Speaker 0: That's true.

688
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:14,738
Speaker 1: Now let's say maybe you actually want to do.

689
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:21,584
Speaker 1: you know real computing, but you don't want to really do like 3d games But you want to do real everyday computing a whole lot of it.

690
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:23,230
Speaker 1: You know it'll sit on your desk a lot.

691
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,516
Speaker 1: You know you this will be your primary computer.

692
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:30,936
Speaker 1: Well now you're starting to look at like you know Lenovo t-series You know.

693
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:40,670
Speaker 0: this is the other question you ask yourself Are you going to use this computer at the places you end up at or on the way to those places?

694
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:46,266
Speaker 0: Now if you answer yes to the first and yes to the second you still need a tiny expensive laptop.

695
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:59,207
Speaker 0: if you answer Yes to the first and no to the second meaning like you're a business traveler You have a computer used at home you travel to a destination You stay there for a week doing your business traveling whatever and you use the laptop in your hotel room.

696
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:00,090
Speaker 1: in other words when you're?

697
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:09,299
Speaker 1: Like say if you're a bit we're talking about here is the difference between this one person has a laptop right they get to a Hotel they open it they close it.

698
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:13,207
Speaker 1: they get to an office they open it they close it they get home They open it they close it.

699
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:21,310
Speaker 1: They're not like going into Starbucks and opening it all the time or they're not Opening it on a train and opening it on a plane and opening it all over the place.

700
00:44:21,872 --> 00:44:31,910
Speaker 1: See if you only open it when you're sitting down at a desk or a table you can probably get a nice 1415 even 17 inches if you need that say your graphic design.

701
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:36,390
Speaker 0: So you get one of those big honking fast machines or the battery only lasts about an hour.

702
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,461
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you'll be plugging it in all the time.

703
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:41,174
Speaker 1: if you're at an office or at your home You can plug the thing in.

704
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:44,690
Speaker 1: you don't need the battery life to be you know many many hours long.

705
00:44:45,011 --> 00:44:49,790
Speaker 1: You just want something that's a powerful computer that you can set up on a desk in different places.

706
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:56,690
Speaker 1: you can carry it with you in your luggage and It'll work, and it can be your primary computer, and you don't need another computer.

707
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:02,793
Speaker 1: But if you're opening this bitch in Starbucks if you're opening this bitch on the train you need a tiny bitch Cuz.

708
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,821
Speaker 1: you got to be out of that lap now, and you gotta have that.

709
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,689
Speaker 1: batteries gotta last like 10 hours.

710
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:09,857
Speaker 0: Now the thing is 10 hour battery right.

711
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:15,514
Speaker 0: if you want any amount of battery life you have to spend at least $2,000.

712
00:45:15,514 --> 00:45:20,770
Speaker 1: pretty much all the laptops that have good battery life right have one of two things or both.

713
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:23,462
Speaker 1: They have one an extended battery.

714
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:29,203
Speaker 1: for example on the Lenovo machines They have regular batteries, then they have the extended batteries, which are?

715
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:32,817
Speaker 1: they go in the regular battery slot But they're twice as large.

716
00:45:33,158 --> 00:45:34,021
Speaker 1: you have to buy that.

717
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,250
Speaker 1: when you buy the laptop you to get the extended battery.

718
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:42,730
Speaker 1: Two are the bay batteries is what my laptop has where yeah, but these are getting not as easy to use anymore.

719
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:47,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a little tricky with the bay batteries But some laptops offer the bay battery option.

720
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,889
Speaker 1: for the people who absolutely need that extra hour or two.

721
00:45:50,652 --> 00:46:03,418
Speaker 1: You can take the CD-ROM out and in the same slot where the CD-ROM usually goes You can slide a battery in there, and now you've got two batteries and when the bay battery runs out It'll start using the regular battery.

722
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:08,210
Speaker 1: so like my bay battery lasts like a couple hours It's actually starting to get a little hairy now.

723
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,561
Speaker 1: I've been sitting here doing the show And only when that runs out does the main battery ever get used.

724
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:20,410
Speaker 1: so most of the time I end up just using the bay Batteries filling it up using the bay battery filling it up and the main battery is like a rock.

725
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,057
Speaker 1: It's like hardly ever discharges.

726
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:33,790
Speaker 1: now the other thing you got to do when considering the size It's not just the battery life and the weight and how easy it is to carry on But the screen size and particularly the screen resolution are really important.

727
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:43,280
Speaker 0: You still have to watch out because some cheaper laptops that seem small and nice will have a decent size screen But they'll have a low resolution screen, which is almost useless.

728
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,561
Speaker 0: Yes.

729
00:46:43,682 --> 00:46:46,050
Speaker 1: I mean you can get a 15 inch laptop, right?

730
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:53,930
Speaker 1: But if the screen resolution is 1280 by 1024 You're not really any better off than say a 12 inch laptop.

731
00:46:54,030 --> 00:47:00,955
Speaker 1: But the screen resolution of 1280 by 1024 because even though things are bigger and maybe easier to see if you have a you know You're a problem seeing.

732
00:47:00,975 --> 00:47:06,798
Speaker 1: you're basically getting a bigger heavier laptop that uses more electricity But you don't have any more screen real estate.

733
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:09,950
Speaker 1: You can't fit more information on the screen at one time.

734
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:12,923
Speaker 1: So and it's it's not like a desktop computer.

735
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:14,550
Speaker 1: We can change the monitor out right.

736
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,042
Speaker 1: This is this is locked in.

737
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:16,828
Speaker 1: you can't change shit.

738
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,148
Speaker 1: So you better have it right the first time or else you're stuck with it until it breaks or you return it.

739
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:24,701
Speaker 0: now You know we say you got to think about what you're gonna use this laptop for.

740
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:30,110
Speaker 0: I mean the reason laptops are getting so popular Is that more and more we're getting detached from our storage?

741
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:36,230
Speaker 0: I mean as long as I have an internet connection I can do almost everything that I need to do with my computer.

742
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,129
Speaker 0: I don't need my data store except for like my media and that's pretty much it.

743
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:45,570
Speaker 0: Everything else is either online on a USB stick synced up whatever Google gears.

744
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,381
Speaker 0: there's a million ways to do it and that's why laptops are popular.

745
00:47:48,442 --> 00:47:50,189
Speaker 0: so think about what you do.

746
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:56,310
Speaker 0: and Also, there's actually this kind of sucks, but if you were the kind of person who needs the internet to do your stuff.

747
00:47:56,411 --> 00:48:04,275
Speaker 0: I mean I watch a lot of Media and I write things for my blog that never gets updated and I work on stuff I don't need my internet connection.

748
00:48:04,937 --> 00:48:10,629
Speaker 0: if you need an internet connection all the time that costs a lot of money And there's no easy cheap way to do it.

749
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,659
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean they make.

750
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:29,540
Speaker 1: you can buy these PCM say or USB things from Sprint or Verizon or whoever anyone and you pay this monthly fee I think $60 is the most expensive sprints actually pretty little cheaper and you plug it into your laptop And you can get internet of varying quality You know ranging from really damn good to kind

751
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:29,981
Speaker 0: of end.

752
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:32,530
Speaker 0: I'll tell you one thing though it mostly sucks.

753
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:38,798
Speaker 1: I mean it only really works if you're in a you know high coverage area like cities and such Work.

754
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:45,404
Speaker 0: if you think you're gonna if you ever think all right I'm gonna get a Verizon wireless card, and I'll use it when I'm traveling or commuting.

755
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:47,330
Speaker 0: those things generally don't work.

756
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,943
Speaker 0: Well when you're moving yeah, not at all.

757
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:51,068
Speaker 1: don't work on the train too.

758
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:57,154
Speaker 1: Well, it's like they cut in and out, but if you're sitting in it and say you know a park in the city And there's no Wi-Fi.

759
00:48:57,195 --> 00:48:58,159
Speaker 1: That's looking good.

760
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:00,550
Speaker 1: It'll totally rock the house, and it's wicked fast.

761
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:03,470
Speaker 1: It's like evdo pretty good, but it costs a lot.

762
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,862
Speaker 1: They actually make some laptops where you don't need the card.

763
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:13,550
Speaker 1: the card is built into the laptop And you just need to find some way to activate the service and those are actually pretty good.

764
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,061
Speaker 1: But you have to know that that's what you want going in.

765
00:49:16,343 --> 00:49:17,890
Speaker 1: you can't like decide on that later.

766
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:23,670
Speaker 0: So if you look at high-end pretty much the only decision you really have to make is do you want large?

767
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,588
Speaker 0: Powerful with a low battery life or small slightly less powerful and lasts forever?

768
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:35,475
Speaker 1: now There's one thing that's really popular on the high end these days, and that is the solid-state drive I was just about to bring up.

769
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:40,610
Speaker 0: if you're in the high-end market one of the biggest decisions you have to make is whether or Not you want to go solid-state.

770
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:52,484
Speaker 1: Yeah, see the advantage of the solid-state drives is number one you're gonna have longer battery life because they don't use as much electricity - you're gonna pay a lot of fucking money because they're really expensive.

771
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:56,143
Speaker 0: and three you're gonna have Relatively little storage on your laptop.

772
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:56,928
Speaker 0: these things aren't big.

773
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:03,821
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you know the biggest fanciest ones are 64 gigs which is pretty big But you're not putting your mp3 collection on there.

774
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:11,430
Speaker 1: basically if you get the solid-state drive You're looking for speed and battery life, but you're not gonna store stuff on there.

775
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,370
Speaker 1: You're mostly gonna put the operating system on there.

776
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:18,918
Speaker 0: It's like quietude and the fact that you can shake the thing around as much as you want while you're using it And it'll have no ill effects.

777
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:30,105
Speaker 1: yes with with a regular Mechanical magnetic hard drive if your laptop shakes or bumps you know it has to unseat the heads And you know that can cause trouble over time and the drive is probably gonna go bad.

778
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,670
Speaker 1: a solid-state drive Really doesn't go bad for a very long time.

779
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,447
Speaker 0: It will eventually but because it's basically flash so it will go bad.

780
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:39,636
Speaker 1: it is flash But it will go bad eventually.

781
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:43,230
Speaker 1: so but you're not gonna be storing mp3s on there so much.

782
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,053
Speaker 1: It's not gonna happen.

783
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:48,630
Speaker 1: so you need some sort of external drive or some sort of internet drive or something.

784
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:49,656
Speaker 0: But that's the thing I mean.

785
00:50:50,179 --> 00:51:00,210
Speaker 0: if you're someone who's using laptops on the go And you use it frequently then the little tiny hard drive solid-state is great But if you're one of those people who brings Everything you need with you like a business traveler.

786
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:14,543
Speaker 0: Then you probably want the laptop that has the 400 gigabyte hard drive And then you bring your one terabyte external hard drive and your carry-on and yep now There is the the Mac or PC decision to make which can be a little tricky.

787
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:15,666
Speaker 0: Here's my answer.

788
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:16,990
Speaker 0: Do you have money?

789
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:20,758
Speaker 0: And also are you going to be using the creative stuff?

790
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 0: because if you're not using the tools that work well on a Mac There is no reason to get a Mac laptop.

791
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,390
Speaker 0: They're more expensive than equivalent PC laptops.

792
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:38,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you're gonna be doing the basic stuff You know the web browsing the iTunes which is on PC all you know Windows also that sort of stuff, right?

793
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:43,020
Speaker 1: Why pay you know for the same amount of money?

794
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,983
Speaker 1: say a $1,500 MacBook costs a?

795
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:51,770
Speaker 1: $1,500 Lenovo something or Toshiba something will be faster and better.

796
00:51:52,472 --> 00:51:57,650
Speaker 1: So if you're doing the same stuff on either one you should get the PC laptop.

797
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:02,265
Speaker 1: You should not get the Mac unless the Mac does something you need that the PC doesn't do.

798
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:13,062
Speaker 1: so a graphic designer with an Apple laptop Makes total sense right because you're gonna be like turning that really nice screen around and showing people stuff at Presentations and all that kind of business right up.

799
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,950
Speaker 0: maybe developer not so much.

800
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:19,288
Speaker 1: No Linux, and here's the thing a lot of people talk about Linux on laptops.

801
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:23,963
Speaker 1: all right There are plenty of laptops out there that work fine with Linux.

802
00:52:24,024 --> 00:52:28,537
Speaker 1: the problem is that people buy laptops And then they try Linux later.

803
00:52:28,557 --> 00:52:40,010
Speaker 1: all right if you actually bother to look and figure out if your laptop works with Linux Before you buy it You'll find out there's actually a lot of them out there that work really great with Linux.

804
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,275
Speaker 1: You can just install Ubuntu on them.

805
00:52:41,295 --> 00:52:45,570
Speaker 1: in fact Dell sells laptops with Ubuntu on them that work perfectly.

806
00:52:45,853 --> 00:52:47,528
Speaker 1: There's plenty of other people that do it as well.

807
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,558
Speaker 1: Lenovo's pretty much work.

808
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,369
Speaker 1: Fujitsu's most of them work.

809
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,629
Speaker 1: There's you know I mean even ones that don't work that well as long as they.

810
00:52:56,669 --> 00:52:56,890
Speaker 1: you know.

811
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:02,410
Speaker 1: Maybe they might have a weird wireless card, but it'll mostly work on just about any modern laptop.

812
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:06,603
Speaker 1: So you know if someone's gonna start making the the Linux complaint?

813
00:53:06,944 --> 00:53:09,110
Speaker 1: really it takes like 10 minutes of researching.

814
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:15,175
Speaker 1: You know if Linux is gonna work on there or not in which parts of the laptop are gonna work or not cuz they're like On my laptop.

815
00:53:15,396 --> 00:53:17,550
Speaker 1: you know the fingerprint sensor doesn't work in Linux.

816
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:27,302
Speaker 0: That's about it now that I would go and set further and say this much like with the Mac if you don't have a need Or a good reason to run Linux on your laptop.

817
00:53:27,785 --> 00:53:28,710
Speaker 0: Don't bother.

818
00:53:29,212 --> 00:53:32,467
Speaker 0: Windows works just fine on the laptop and in fact in a lot of ways.

819
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:33,150
Speaker 0: It'll work better.

820
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,389
Speaker 0: You'll generally get better battery performance.

821
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,755
Speaker 0: No It depends on most laptops.

822
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:38,096
Speaker 0: you will.

823
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:46,702
Speaker 1: the windows power management is better than the Linux really depends in the drivers and the exact power Management hardware in the computer, and you know how well Linux.

824
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:48,970
Speaker 1: You know no deals with that particular hardware.

825
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:53,520
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm just saying that on average if you just buy a laptop You're probably better off just running windows.

826
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,702
Speaker 0: and I mean unless you can articulate to me What you need Linux for on the laptop don't bother because you will.

827
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:02,109
Speaker 0: I mean the webcam and sometimes the Bluetooth.

828
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:03,513
Speaker 0: a lot of little Things left some trouble with.

829
00:54:03,794 --> 00:54:07,227
Speaker 1: yeah like I have you know there's two buttons on my laptop next to the power button.

830
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:09,837
Speaker 1: those buttons don't Do anything in Linux at all.

831
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:14,756
Speaker 0: and also like I have the same fingerprint reader Scott does But because I just use Vista I can use it.

832
00:54:15,398 --> 00:54:16,241
Speaker 0: It's really great.

833
00:54:16,662 --> 00:54:17,143
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

834
00:54:17,224 --> 00:54:18,046
Speaker 0: It's really great.

835
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:18,628
Speaker 0: I love it.

836
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:23,280
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, is there any other laptop buying advice?

837
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:32,350
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess laptop accessories if let's for example all right one Bye, I don't care how little you spent on your laptop buy another charger.

838
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,959
Speaker 0: Yes, own two chargers for your laptop.

839
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:35,240
Speaker 0: Good.

840
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,986
Speaker 0: God is this the best purchase you will make?

841
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:37,990
Speaker 1: because check this out, right?

842
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:40,749
Speaker 1: I have a charger at home and a charger at work.

843
00:54:41,352 --> 00:54:46,530
Speaker 1: I don't have to carry this AC adapter from home to work back and forth.

844
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:48,309
Speaker 1: I just spent the money on another one.

845
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:51,930
Speaker 1: It was a little expensive because they rip you off on these things was like 40 bucks.

846
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:56,170
Speaker 1: But not having to carry that thing back and forth is so nice.

847
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,870
Speaker 1: I only that means I only have to carry a charger if I go on a trip or something.

848
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:04,523
Speaker 0: If I leave directly from home, I bring my home charger.

849
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:09,283
Speaker 0: if I take a plane that isn't from Stewart Airport I just leave from work to the airport.

850
00:55:09,343 --> 00:55:10,310
Speaker 0: I take my work charger.

851
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:19,545
Speaker 1: yeah, you'll always have you don't have to you know, remember to pack the charger cuz every you're leaving from you have one and It's generally a good idea to have one charger per place.

852
00:55:19,846 --> 00:55:20,730
Speaker 1: you you you live.

853
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,689
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess if you're a student you're pretty well.

854
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:27,778
Speaker 1: You're pretty much gonna have your dorm or your school or whatever You know or your home.

855
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,910
Speaker 1: if you're living at home in high schools, then you only do one.

856
00:55:30,311 --> 00:55:36,967
Speaker 1: But if you have two places that you are like most people home and work you want two chargers now, too And this is actually very very important.

857
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:45,064
Speaker 0: Get you need to get a bag or something to hold your laptop in and you have to actually get one that is for a Laptop or your laptop will break.

858
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:53,323
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean people get ones that are like not the exact right size for their laptop And then what happens is their laptop like shimmies around in there.

859
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,945
Speaker 1: That's no good.

860
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:59,690
Speaker 1: other people get once They're too small for their laptop and then they just return it cuz their laptop doesn't fit or they jam it in there.

861
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,615
Speaker 0: Then the screen cracks.

862
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:04,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't even seen too many people doing that pretty much I mean, I'm not gonna get it.

863
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:16,330
Speaker 0: There's a little to a separate show on good laptop bags But you need one that will at least absorb Shocks enough to where you won't break the laptop in the average carrying it around scenario.

864
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,114
Speaker 1: Yep Now the thing is you.

865
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:19,698
Speaker 1: there's two options actually.

866
00:56:19,718 --> 00:56:26,197
Speaker 1: you can either get a bag like a backpack or a messenger bag that has a laptop Compartment, which is what I got which is what rim has?

867
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,270
Speaker 1: I purchased a sleeve that is the correct size for my laptop.

868
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:38,347
Speaker 1: So the laptop has its own protective case and then I just put you know I it's a. put it around the laptop and zip it shut and then I just toss that in a bit.

869
00:56:38,388 --> 00:56:44,210
Speaker 1: whatever bag I'm feeling like and those are two perfectly good options depending on your particular situation.

870
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:50,012
Speaker 1: You know if you got multiple bags going on you might want to go with the sleeve But if you have a weird size laptop The sleeve is.

871
00:56:50,092 --> 00:56:54,067
Speaker 0: I stress this again never put your laptop in just a normal backpack.

872
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:54,790
Speaker 0: that actually puts.

873
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:59,910
Speaker 0: I mean depending on how you wear it, obviously, there's a lot of variables, but that puts a ton of wear and tear on your laptop.

874
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:07,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, also by the same token don't carry your laptop around on and not in sleep mode unless you have a solid-state drive.

875
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:08,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll overheat and shit.

876
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:12,561
Speaker 1: Also a lot of people they don't think about this.

877
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:16,337
Speaker 1: but unlike your normal computer, you know Your laptop is something hope.

878
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:18,929
Speaker 1: if you're carrying it around it's gonna get beat up.

879
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:24,429
Speaker 1: You know the screen will get must up and it will get dinged and you might drop it once, you know.

880
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:29,167
Speaker 1: So you really want to take a look at how durable the laptop is there.

881
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:33,542
Speaker 1: surprisingly There are a lot of very non durable laptops out there.

882
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:36,694
Speaker 1: They crack they break very easily They're very flimsy.

883
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:40,590
Speaker 1: the screen hinge very important piece is often really shitty.

884
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,830
Speaker 1: You know, I noticed this mostly on a lot of laptops you can buy like Best Buy or whatever.

885
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,549
Speaker 1: They're very very flimsy and shitty.

886
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:56,222
Speaker 1: Make sure that if you're gonna be moving the laptop around a lot you want to pay extra to get something really Sturdy like Panasonic's Toughbooks, which are freaking tough.

887
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:04,470
Speaker 0: There is something along those lines Yep, but I mean generally most very high-end laptops, especially these small ones tend to be pretty derp.

888
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:05,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

889
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,073
Speaker 1: It really does seem.

890
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:11,430
Speaker 1: like you know, the more expensive laptops are more durable like the more expensive laptops are clearly superior.

891
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:13,399
Speaker 1: I basically I mean look at Lenovo.

892
00:58:13,419 --> 00:58:19,489
Speaker 1: right Lenovo has the the idea pads Which are like the consumer line and they have the think pads, which is the business line.

893
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,503
Speaker 1: Think pads can take like a baseball bat idea pads.

894
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,450
Speaker 1: I could break them with like my pinky finger.

895
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:33,850
Speaker 1: They're just like flimsy cheap plastic pieces of shit where the think pads are made with like Nintendo plastic Which you can't break if you like, you know hit it with a sledgehammer.

896
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:40,050
Speaker 0: Now if you're gonna be traveling long distances a lot, I recommend buying another battery just to keep up with you.

897
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:43,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, the reason you want another battery is let's say I have 10 hours of battery life.

898
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:52,602
Speaker 1: well, if I think I'm gonna be on like, you know a Camping trip right where there's no electricity Well, I can charge up some extra batteries before I go.

899
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:58,207
Speaker 1: then when they batteries run out I just swap them and I'm all you know, I get another few hours in there.

900
00:58:58,227 --> 00:58:58,870
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

901
00:58:59,656 --> 00:59:12,830
Speaker 0: Of course if you're really gonna travel a lot I know Lenovo makes them and I'm sure other people do too you'd actually buy these big pads that you sit onto your laptop and just plug in to the power and They're basically just a gigantic external battery that lasts for fucking ever.

902
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:16,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, a docking station is also something to consider.

903
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:24,043
Speaker 1: if your laptop or you know a port replicator some people call it if your laptop I used one of these actually when I worked at the company that I quit before.

904
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:25,168
Speaker 1: I worked at my current company.

905
00:59:25,248 --> 00:59:31,589
Speaker 0: if it's if Your laptop is your primary PC like you use it at home But then you take it with you use it on the train then use it at work.

906
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:35,950
Speaker 0: You want to have a docking station at home and at work with a monitor and a real keyboard?

907
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,588
Speaker 0: You just kind of slide the laptop into it.

908
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,165
Speaker 1: Yeah So what I would do back in those days right is I had this laptop.

909
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:44,330
Speaker 1: I use it on the train Get to work at work.

910
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:52,376
Speaker 1: I would put it in his docking station and there was a monitor at work and there was a real mouse and a real keyboard At work, so at work.

911
00:59:52,436 --> 00:59:56,830
Speaker 1: I had the happy hacking keyboard my awesome keyboard instead of the cramped laptop keyboard.

912
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:02,230
Speaker 1: I had a real mouse on its own not the touchpad and the laptop monitor and a regular monitor.

913
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:08,250
Speaker 1: So it was two monitors at once and it was like, you know The laptop was really powerful and it was plugged into the walls.

914
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,642
Speaker 1: There's worry about the battery and it was like goddamn.

915
01:00:11,104 --> 01:00:14,687
Speaker 1: and then when I went home I would just take the laptop out of the docking station.

916
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:16,336
Speaker 1: and What do you know?

917
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:19,230
Speaker 1: It's just a laptop on its own, but it's the exact same computer.

918
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:21,530
Speaker 1: It's all the stuff I had at work and it was really great.

919
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:25,850
Speaker 1: And if you're in that kind of situation where your laptop is your primary computer.

920
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:30,610
Speaker 1: The port replicator is a good idea, especially if like a printer you can plug the printer into that thing.

921
01:00:31,032 --> 01:00:33,608
Speaker 1: You could plug scanners into it all kinds of good stuff.

922
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,837
Speaker 0: So, I don't know there's not much else to talk about.

923
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:37,780
Speaker 0: I mean everything else is just.

924
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,385
Speaker 0: they all support Wi-Fi.

925
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:41,711
Speaker 0: it works just fine They.

926
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:44,163
Speaker 0: you at least want to look at what connectors that has.

927
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,610
Speaker 0: I mean the laptops.

928
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:51,130
Speaker 0: I I mean my laptop has firewire and like to you actually I think has three USBs and a modem and an Ethernet.

929
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,130
Speaker 1: Then I want to look if you want to plug it in for like presentations.

930
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:59,610
Speaker 1: Most of them have VGA out but you might want to see if it has this video out or a DVI or something like that.

931
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:04,105
Speaker 1: You want to check if it has you know, microphone hole audio out that sort of thing.

932
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:10,930
Speaker 0: granted every laptop I've seen has a terrible audio and it just if you're gonna be like podcasting or something.

933
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,518
Speaker 0: You want to use your laptop for audio.

934
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:14,489
Speaker 0: buy an external USB?

935
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:18,730
Speaker 0: Non wall powered sound card and just use that for recording.

936
01:01:19,212 --> 01:01:19,855
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary.

937
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,984
Speaker 1: but a lot of laptops have actual dial-up modems in them.

938
01:01:22,024 --> 01:01:22,988
Speaker 1: Like mine has dial-up.

939
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:23,550
Speaker 0: So does mine.

940
01:01:23,771 --> 01:01:29,089
Speaker 0: I don't know why like who uses that stuff, you know what if we had a regular phone line I would totally have a dial-in.

941
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,485
Speaker 1: I guess the reason for that though, at least it makes a little bit of sense.

942
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:33,329
Speaker 0: shitty hotels, too.

943
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:38,490
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you could be traveling anywhere so you might be trapped traveling to someplace.

944
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,582
Speaker 1: You mean I never use a dial-up modem, but it's a laptop.

945
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,630
Speaker 1: I might travel somewhere where dial-up is the option.

946
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:47,463
Speaker 1: So rather than forcing me to carry a modem a dial-up in there.

947
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:51,035
Speaker 1: It doesn't take up much room on the laptop It's just a tiny telephone hole.

948
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,199
Speaker 1: Why not have it?

949
01:01:52,500 --> 01:02:01,490
Speaker 0: plus seriously if I if we had a phone line I would totally just set up a computer that if a computer called would answer and I could dial into my house.

950
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:03,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would do something like that.

951
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,126
Speaker 0: That'd be really useful.

952
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,750
Speaker 1: It'd be okay.

953
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:09,342
Speaker 1: But yeah Buying laptops is not really that hard.

954
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:10,488
Speaker 1: You just need to think about.

955
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:13,410
Speaker 1: you know It's much like it's no different than buying anything else.

956
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,888
Speaker 1: It's just we keep explaining this buying procedure because people don't seem to get it.

957
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:18,537
Speaker 0: Think about what you need.

958
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,990
Speaker 0: think about what you need how much you're willing to spend what?

959
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:23,055
Speaker 0: Opportunity cost you're willing to put forth?

960
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:27,870
Speaker 1: then do research to figure out which products will meet your needs within your price range.

961
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:29,275
Speaker 0: Nothing meets your needs.

962
01:02:29,576 --> 01:02:33,629
Speaker 0: compromise or don't buy something and then make a purchase.

963
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:44,290
Speaker 0: Now If you're looking for some specific advice, I know that Scott and I basically have two generations of the same laptop.

964
01:02:44,912 --> 01:02:46,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, take that as you will.

965
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:49,349
Speaker 1: the lifebook p-series is very nice.

966
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,299
Speaker 0: Yes Seven and I have the eight.

967
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,981
Speaker 1: if I were to buy a laptop today I would go with what Alex just got me Lenovo x300.

968
01:02:56,122 --> 01:02:58,390
Speaker 1: Yes is the hotness of all hotness.

969
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:03,530
Speaker 0: Honestly, if I were buying a laptop right now, it's also $2,500, but I'm glad I bought the laptop.

970
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:06,887
Speaker 0: I did because for what I use it for and for when I bought it, it was a good job.

971
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,790
Speaker 0: I had to sneeze right then awesome.

972
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:15,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, pray, you know the x300 wasn't around when you bought your laptop But now it is plus.

973
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:18,670
Speaker 0: I actually really like my laptop and it was about five hundred dollars less.

974
01:03:19,073 --> 01:03:21,130
Speaker 1: Well, you know you're manufacturing that happiness.

975
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:22,840
Speaker 0: No, actually, I'm not.

976
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,809
Speaker 0: I'm really I'm happy with it.

977
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:28,701
Speaker 0: No, okay Because the thing is you have your bay battery and your battery last for fucking ever.

978
01:03:29,202 --> 01:03:31,810
Speaker 0: my battery still lasts about nine hours.

979
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:34,014
Speaker 1: Very last a long day.

980
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:36,561
Speaker 0: It drops down to about six if I place it.

981
01:03:36,681 --> 01:03:38,105
Speaker 1: Oh my battery ran out.

982
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:39,088
Speaker 0: Oh did it?

983
01:03:39,268 --> 01:03:48,429
Speaker 0: Yeah So said yeah, plus the thing is my laptop is better than Scott's because the newer one but at the same time It's a lot more powerful.

984
01:03:49,152 --> 01:03:50,979
Speaker 0: But it's also stupidly light.

985
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,441
Speaker 0: like it's lighter than the MacBook Air which is actually surprisingly I think the batteries out of mine.

986
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:56,066
Speaker 1: It weighs nothing.

987
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:59,150
Speaker 1: Oh The weight is in the batteries.

988
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I take the battery out of mine, it basically does weigh nothing.

989
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:03,027
Speaker 0: Yeah.

990
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:04,941
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, there's two other things to consider.

991
01:04:04,961 --> 01:04:05,626
Speaker 1: Let me just throw these in.

992
01:04:05,646 --> 01:04:06,130
Speaker 1: it will be done.

993
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,903
Speaker 1: Right, some of the small laptops don't have CD-ROM drives.

994
01:04:09,923 --> 01:04:11,970
Speaker 1: For example the x300 which I just mentioned.

995
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:21,343
Speaker 1: Well, if you tell drives right right DVD CD whatever if you get the DVD CD drive in there You cannot get the bay battery.

996
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:22,510
Speaker 1: It's not an option on there.

997
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:28,409
Speaker 1: So but on my laptop I can swap out the optical drive and the bay battery all I want.

998
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,090
Speaker 0: now It looks like in a lot of like in new things.

999
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:36,350
Speaker 0: It seems like the way they're going is that when you buy the laptop you choose if you want the removable bay battery or the?

1000
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,070
Speaker 0: optical drive.

1001
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:38,273
Speaker 1: X300 does.

1002
01:04:38,293 --> 01:04:45,550
Speaker 0: yeah I've heard many rumors that the that the life books are gonna be updated in the future to have that capability.

1003
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:47,139
Speaker 0: But no swapping anymore.

1004
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the swapping.

1005
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:49,070
Speaker 0: I do too.

1006
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:58,469
Speaker 1: but if you plan on you know watching DVDs on your laptop your options are either like handbrake them on another computer or You know just get the optical drive.

1007
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:02,220
Speaker 1: Yeah the other thing is that you know you got an LCD.

1008
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,041
Speaker 1: when you're buying a laptop you're buying a computer and a And a keyboard and a mouse.

1009
01:05:08,062 --> 01:05:13,402
Speaker 1: so make sure you like the keyboard Make sure you like the monitor and make sure you like the mousing device.

1010
01:05:13,422 --> 01:05:15,108
Speaker 1: like there's gonna be a Lenovo x200 soon.

1011
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:17,241
Speaker 1: It's not gonna have a touchpad.

1012
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:18,430
Speaker 1: It's only gonna have the red nub.

1013
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:22,205
Speaker 0: You know what if you don't like bullshit the red nub is the worst possible thing.

1014
01:05:22,246 --> 01:05:29,190
Speaker 1: right nub is okay And I used to be a on the touchpad and yeah on the red nub But you get used to the touchpad eventually you don't need the nub anymore.

1015
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:30,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, the nub is just.

1016
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:30,970
Speaker 0: it's not as powerful.

1017
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:39,701
Speaker 0: The thing is I know why a lot of people are turned off by touchpads because by default on every freaking laptop in the world If you touch it it thing is what it says.

1018
01:05:39,862 --> 01:05:41,610
Speaker 0: Oh, he must have wanted to click on that.

1019
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to turn that shit off.

1020
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:46,770
Speaker 0: Yes, and some shittier laptops the drivers wouldn't let you do that easily.

1021
01:05:47,032 --> 01:05:48,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, modern ones you can just turn that off.

1022
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:51,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to like the nub and hate the touchpad But just use the touchpad.

1023
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,110
Speaker 1: enough that doesn't bother me anymore.

1024
01:05:53,352 --> 01:05:55,488
Speaker 1: And then you know the nub bothers me only a little bit.

1025
01:05:55,529 --> 01:05:56,873
Speaker 1: now You know make sure.

1026
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,438
Speaker 1: and also the screens.

1027
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:02,650
Speaker 1: some laptops have the matte screens and somehow the glossies know what that means.

1028
01:06:02,851 --> 01:06:05,550
Speaker 0: They're they're equally good for different purposes.

1029
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,192
Speaker 0: Yes, like.

1030
01:06:06,232 --> 01:06:11,508
Speaker 1: if you want like really bright image quality that sort of thing you probably want the glossy screen.

1031
01:06:11,548 --> 01:06:12,350
Speaker 1: It looks really good.

1032
01:06:12,411 --> 01:06:16,839
Speaker 1: It's a lot more impressive in the store But the glare is really crazy.

1033
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:19,808
Speaker 1: if you try to use it when like the Sun is shining you can't see shit.

1034
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:31,030
Speaker 1: the matte Screen which is sort of just like a normal LCD It's not as shiny It's not as impressive But it does the job and there's a lot less glare if the Sun

1035
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:36,730
Speaker 0: If the glare is coming from certain angles the gloss is better and from other angles the matte is better.

1036
01:06:36,931 --> 01:06:37,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, really fine.

1037
01:06:38,018 --> 01:06:39,750
Speaker 0: I mean it's easy to find examples of both.

1038
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,806
Speaker 0: Just go to the store and fiddle with them and decide which one you like.

1039
01:06:42,826 --> 01:06:43,610
Speaker 0: They're equally good.

1040
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:53,621
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of your preference and they're really the resolution and the size matter more than the glassy matte the glossy matte Yeah, I mean I'd recommend to if you have the choice.

1041
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:56,689
Speaker 0: a lot of people want XP for some stupid reason.

1042
01:06:56,709 --> 01:06:59,324
Speaker 0: if you're buying a New laptop just get Vista.

1043
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:00,170
Speaker 0: It works fine.

1044
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:03,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people like oh no Vista is the evils.

1045
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,947
Speaker 1: Well, this is not so great because it's not.

1046
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:11,990
Speaker 1: you know It didn't really make any improvements over XP and I guess that's a valid criticism, but really it works.

1047
01:07:12,231 --> 01:07:13,838
Speaker 1: I have it on my desktop computer.

1048
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:16,068
Speaker 1: There's only one problem I've had with it so far.

1049
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:19,182
Speaker 1: There's no reason to bother with XP.

1050
01:07:19,222 --> 01:07:20,690
Speaker 1: it's just more trouble than it's worth.
