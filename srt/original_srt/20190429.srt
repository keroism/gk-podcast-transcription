1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,499
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 29th 2019.

2
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:12,401
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:19,108
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight fishing with a pH Not the band.

4
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,168
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:31,642
Speaker 0: So I was randomly looking at my youtube channel because I was uploading a bunch more of the videos that are just the reviews of Board games.

6
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:42,280
Speaker 0: we do without like the rest of the episode around the zoom and watch that yeah They all get hundreds of views and I get a lot of like likes within board game geek because that's where I post them all.

7
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,445
Speaker 0: Okay, it's it.

8
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:49,998
Speaker 0: I think it's good because sometimes we have like a 10-minute review of a game That's at the end of a 50-minute episode of geek not it's mmm.

9
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,420
Speaker 0: So it actually is working out pretty well, and it does not take a lot of work.

10
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:59,726
Speaker 0: But when I was looking at my youtube channel I don't look at the analytics that often like once a month I check in on it And I notice I look at it.

11
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:03,020
Speaker 1: never I noticed that I had no idea if I had like a million subscribers.

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:18,378
Speaker 0: I'd only find out when like the silver thing showed up, but so I noticed that I had six thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine subscribers And I was like oh I should get a screenshot cuz that'll be funny, and then I got distracted.

13
00:01:18,418 --> 00:01:19,889
Speaker 0: I finished something I went shot.

14
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:20,576
Speaker 0: it went up.

15
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:24,492
Speaker 0: It's like 7020. now it's already passed and don't?

16
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,300
Speaker 0: I guess I could Photoshop it without.

17
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:30,680
Speaker 1: You could just use the ins the web inspector to change the number and then yeah.

18
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:35,560
Speaker 0: Or I could block enough people from my channel to get it back down to six thousand nine hundred ninety-nine.

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,968
Speaker 1: I could just take screenshots with the web inspector to act like I had a bajillion views And then try to get someone to give me money.

20
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,019
Speaker 1: no him become a. you know fake it till I make it.

21
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:48,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, like people who buy followers or whatever.

22
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:54,414
Speaker 0: the analytics on the channel are actually pretty interesting If you actually look at them because you do get a lot of dudes watching.

23
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:58,733
Speaker 0: yeah But you also the thing you get.

24
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,880
Speaker 0: that's real interesting.

25
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:01,984
Speaker 0: It's the like.

26
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:07,963
Speaker 0: you can find out what videos people are watching where they're like what fuck this and they unsubscribe As.

27
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:13,523
Speaker 0: and also you can find out like what video someone watching and they're like People.

28
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,580
Speaker 0: seemed we had a more people unsubscribe from a real harm.

29
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,880
Speaker 1: We need to figure out what videos are watched most by non white non straight non dudes.

30
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,312
Speaker 1: More videos like those we could.

31
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:25,418
Speaker 0: we could try stuff.

32
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:25,880
Speaker 0: we could do it.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,359
Speaker 1: We could treat ourselves like we're the gin the the machine learning thing.

34
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,645
Speaker 1: Right and just.

35
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:38,340
Speaker 1: we just choose right rather than most people who are like going towards following the money or following, right?

36
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,379
Speaker 1: We follow a different metric for for success.

37
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:45,440
Speaker 0: One thing I can say is that I'll see if it changed right now.

38
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,080
Speaker 0: But if we look at traffic sources most people watch our channel Because they're browsing YouTube and they just see one of our videos recommended and they click on it.

39
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,873
Speaker 0: That is like 90% of our views.

40
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:02,860
Speaker 0: And then the rest are YouTube searches and the YouTube searches are almost entirely for in order.

41
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:11,112
Speaker 0: Boardgame design tires and Euphrates board game rare game mechanics game theory game design game mechanics Puerto Rico board game Carcassonne strategy board game.

42
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:12,959
Speaker 1: in his big these days rim to cost her.

43
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:17,555
Speaker 0: Okay, making board game diplomacy board game board games board game game balance.

44
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,780
Speaker 0: how to make a board game.

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,567
Speaker 1: Are all these like one search each now?

46
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,135
Speaker 0: No, they're all hundreds and hundreds.

47
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 0: Okay, it's really funny But rim to cost her is like they're in the top ten.

48
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,880
Speaker 1: Say yeah, okay, whatever.

49
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:32,343
Speaker 0: So what you got?

50
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:32,745
Speaker 0: news?

51
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,589
Speaker 0: wise it's Monday.

52
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:35,637
Speaker 1: Ah, so I do have some news to check it out.

53
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:36,240
Speaker 1: This is relevant.

54
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,632
Speaker 1: This is how we thought of our main bit.

55
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:45,150
Speaker 1: by the way Someone has found a new and interesting way to fish People using mobile browsers.

56
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:48,204
Speaker 1: they developed the proof of concept Which is all they only made.

57
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:52,860
Speaker 1: did the work to make prove it for Chrome on Iowa like what iOS or only what?

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,548
Speaker 1: But you could just take there.

59
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,820
Speaker 1: you could easily take what they did and replicate it.

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,296
Speaker 0: So it's a really clever escalation of like fishing technique, right?

61
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,140
Speaker 1: So here's the deal, right?

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,500
Speaker 1: Let's say you're gonna go on your phone right when you open the web browser.

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,294
Speaker 1: You know how you scroll down and you really want to save screen space.

64
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,920
Speaker 0: So not that many P, right?

65
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:18,300
Speaker 1: So what they do on your phone when you scroll down on a web page is they make the location bar go away.

66
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:19,846
Speaker 0: Right, which makes sense.

67
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:20,789
Speaker 1: So it makes sense.

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:33,680
Speaker 1: So what he did this guy is he says, all right I programmed my website such that when you scroll down a bunch and the location bar goes away So the first time you load the page the real location bar is there with the real URL in it.

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,073
Speaker 0: Yeah with the HTTPS and it's like yep, you're at your website.

70
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:42,440
Speaker 1: You scroll down far enough a Different the locate the real location bar goes away.

71
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:50,336
Speaker 1: He takes an image of a fake location bar and makes it appear and it says like chase.com Or hsbc.com or bank of america.com.

72
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,060
Speaker 1: in right?

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,340
Speaker 1: He basically just took a screenshot of the bank location bar on the bank's website, right and just put it at the top.

74
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:05,480
Speaker 1: So now it looks like you're officially green light green lock on This the bank's website, but you're on this other person's website.

75
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:12,209
Speaker 1: If the website also looked like the bank's website then they could fool you into now Presumably with like a link in an email.

76
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,720
Speaker 1: you click the link in the email you land on this website.

77
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:16,307
Speaker 1: It looks real.

78
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,020
Speaker 1: you scroll down the location bar changes.

79
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 1: If you don't notice the location bar was fake and had the wrong URL in it at the start.

80
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,799
Speaker 1: Maybe it was a really close URL using like some Unico shenanigans, right?

81
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,340
Speaker 1: Then it's gonna look like you're really on your bank's website for real like totally trustworthy.

82
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,417
Speaker 1: And then you type and use the in password and then you lose all your money.

83
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:36,315
Speaker 0: Yep All right.

84
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,923
Speaker 0: So it's one of those things we're like Phones.

85
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:43,340
Speaker 0: just the way they're used are very limited and there's a lot of differences compared to a real computer.

86
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:47,535
Speaker 0: So like you can't hover over a URL just like really quickly.

87
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:48,398
Speaker 0: See where does it really go?

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, like things like this disappears the you never have the top bar disappear in a real web browser on a real device.

89
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:57,924
Speaker 1: Right, you know the real You know.

90
00:05:57,944 --> 00:06:11,040
Speaker 1: the way to take this even further would be to make not just use a screenshot of the location bar But to program a fake location bar that can be used to programmatically detect What browser the person is using to show them a location bar that matches their browser?

91
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,747
Speaker 1: Right, like is that using Chrome on iOS?

92
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,400
Speaker 1: Okay, we got to show this fake, you know location bar style, right?

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have to go pretty far to make it really convincing but you know, it goes even where it's actually worse than I thought.

94
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,440
Speaker 0: It says that normally when you scroll up, you know, you get the real bar.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,929
Speaker 1: But now you can never get the real bar back unless you reload.

96
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,800
Speaker 0: Yep, because they put you in a scroll jail.

97
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:35,239
Speaker 0: Yep, scroll jail with an element that just prevents it.

98
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,233
Speaker 0: Let's see overflow colon scroll.

99
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:42,071
Speaker 0: the user thinks they're scrolling up the page But in fact, they're only scrolling up in the scroll jail.

100
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:43,317
Speaker 0: I can see how you can pull that off.

101
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:53,679
Speaker 0: Yep this is pretty big because a Lot of people only have a phone or a tablet as their computing device like they don't have a computer.

102
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,880
Speaker 1: now It's less of a big deal because you know if I'm using my phone I would never do anything.

103
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:01,780
Speaker 1: Secure login in the browser on my phone.

104
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,506
Speaker 1: I was never the app right.

105
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:09,607
Speaker 1: and if you're using iOS at least you can trust the app that came from the App Store For the real App Store if you hear right?

106
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:13,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you downloaded the wrong app, you're already hosed, right?

107
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,266
Speaker 1: But iOS Apple won't let.

108
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,273
Speaker 1: they're not the real app in the App Store.

109
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:24,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, whereas Android might Google Play you can't trust it, but Apple you can more trust it mostly, right?

110
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 1: So if I get the chase app I can trust it's as secure as the chase website on a secure brand-new good computer.

111
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,668
Speaker 1: It was scary.

112
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:39,700
Speaker 0: I guess the moral is on a phone Trust apps like you would a TLS certificate and just use your web browser for things that don't matter, right?

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,072
Speaker 1: Anything secure you do on your phone?

114
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:41,859
Speaker 1: You should be using an app.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaker 1: Don't trust the browser on the phone not just because of this but just in general.

116
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:49,300
Speaker 1: Why are you using the browser when an app is available on your phone?

117
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:54,960
Speaker 0: I mean, I tried to think of what do I actually go to on a browser on my phone?

118
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,134
Speaker 0: And it literally is the gig nights forum.

119
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:01,800
Speaker 0: Yep, Fark Google News There's like nothing else in my hand.

120
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't use it.

121
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,052
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're still like that.

122
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:09,229
Speaker 1: You could they could log into your Gmail with that Now if they tricked me into clicking on.

123
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:16,092
Speaker 1: there used to be more things that I use the browser for on the phone Because there weren't apps for everything, but I've been so long.

124
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:18,340
Speaker 1: It's been like 12 years since I had iPhones.

125
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,492
Speaker 0: I don't go to Google News that often because I also pay for Waypo.

126
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:22,900
Speaker 0: So usually I just open the Waypo app.

127
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:24,479
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, it's like.

128
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,418
Speaker 1: You know, it's been like 12 something years since I had iPhones.

129
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,200
Speaker 1: so Apps exist now right Google Calendar used to not have an app.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,849
Speaker 1: I'd have to like go to Google Calendar on the web.

131
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,020
Speaker 1: now is a really good Google Calendar app, right?

132
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everything's pretty good.

133
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:51,190
Speaker 0: So in some other app related news there's a lot of apps especially in the iPhone store that are designed to either help you curb your addiction to your own phone or Control how much time your kids spend messing with the phone.

134
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,186
Speaker 1: right now Apple in iOS includes lots of functionality Including in the newest version.

135
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:59,360
Speaker 1: They've added a lot of functionality for the helping curbing your addiction.

136
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,836
Speaker 1: I keep getting notifications like your screen times up your screen times down.

137
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,840
Speaker 1: you spent this much screen.

138
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:06,218
Speaker 1: I can look and see exactly how much time I spent in each app.

139
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,234
Speaker 1: It's all built into iOS and Apple's always had parental controls.

140
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:13,326
Speaker 1: ever since like the first iPhone they've only gotten more advanced.

141
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:30,231
Speaker 1: but for some people those controls might not be enough and Apple has always allowed and always supported people making other parental control apps or other screen time management apps and putting them in the App Store as Long as they follow all the App Store rules, you know, we can't.

142
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,180
Speaker 1: we're not gonna talk about the general App Store rules.

143
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,694
Speaker 1: You know deal again.

144
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, right We're only talking about this specific thing.

145
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:40,180
Speaker 1: and what happened is that some of the apps right?

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,272
Speaker 1: We're given notices like hey, your app is not in compliance with these rules.

147
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:48,045
Speaker 1: If you don't fix your app in 30 days We're gonna kick you out of the App Store.

148
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,591
Speaker 1: and some apps fix their shit.

149
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:53,071
Speaker 1: and some apps did not fix their shit And they got kicked out.

150
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:53,699
Speaker 1: and now they're complaining.

151
00:09:54,301 --> 00:10:07,760
Speaker 0: yep, and it seems like the crux of it is the apps that are targeted specifically at children and controlling children's access to things probably because Children being online is heavily regulated both in the US and in Europe, right?

152
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:15,400
Speaker 1: But I think the the main technological thing here that Apple is upset about is the use of MDM which stands for mobile device management.

153
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:39,227
Speaker 1: Right, so basically it much in the way that like when you install an antivirus software on your computer Right the antivirus software in order to clean out viruses and prevent viruses and other Malwares the antivirus software needs a lot of permissions and it needs to do lots of things to detect viruses that are otherwise Not acceptable for other software to do.

154
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,837
Speaker 1: because yeah, it's much in the way to fight a cheater.

155
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:43,820
Speaker 1: You need to be a cheater.

156
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:50,160
Speaker 1: How can I find a rootkit if I can't be even lower levels have lower level CPU access than the rootkit, right?

157
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,440
Speaker 1: How can I clean out the virus from these OS files if I don't have permission to read on write all your OS files?

158
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

159
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:10,580
Speaker 1: so much in the same way to Implement a lot of the parental control features right like seeing spying on what websites are going to spying and how much time different apps Are open, you know seeing what's on the screen, you know, I'm your parent.

160
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,320
Speaker 1: I want to see what you're doing right now to see if it's porn without coming up and looking behind you.

161
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,886
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm looking right.

162
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:18,637
Speaker 1: make your phone turn off and you can't turn it back on.

163
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:19,260
Speaker 1: lock your phone.

164
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:20,607
Speaker 1: Make sure you can't unlock it.

165
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:21,714
Speaker 1: See where the phone is.

166
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:22,840
Speaker 1: all these sorts, you know.

167
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,760
Speaker 1: See what the camera on the phone sees remotely.

168
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:28,470
Speaker 1: These are all major things that would normally be major.

169
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,100
Speaker 1: security flaws cannot allow major permissions problems.

170
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:39,911
Speaker 1: Yeah in order for these parental controls to work you sort of have to allow these things and apples like no That's unsecure as hell really bad.

171
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,233
Speaker 1: We're not.

172
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,580
Speaker 1: we can't allow apps to be doing this.

173
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:42,707
Speaker 0: I would not try.

174
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,580
Speaker 0: I don't trust apps like that in general.

175
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:49,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's the kind of app that I would make if I was gonna try to compromise your phone.

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,773
Speaker 1: I notice you don't put any virus stuff on our computer either.

177
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:55,449
Speaker 0: Yep, because antivirus software It doesn't work and/or is a scam in most cases.

178
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,080
Speaker 0: just use the windows one is fine or don't use anything.

179
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,411
Speaker 0: The windows one is fine.

180
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:03,800
Speaker 1: Whatever the point is The Apple parental controls aren't those enough for you, really?

181
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:09,500
Speaker 1: The article I picked a random article about the Apple feature they just added for managing your screen time.

182
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,704
Speaker 1: That's really not enough for you.

183
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:23,550
Speaker 0: So I picked a random article about this and it seems like the people who are mad are mostly parents who don't understand how to use the Apple one and want Extremely fine-grain control of how their children is.

184
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,116
Speaker 1: you're extremely fine-grain control.

185
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:31,792
Speaker 0: Don't give your kid a phone unsupervised done or give your kid a phone and Be a good parent.

186
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,682
Speaker 1: Yep Why did you?

187
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,730
Speaker 1: why do you have a kid that wants to go look at?

188
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,074
Speaker 1: you know, murder porn?

189
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:38,640
Speaker 1: well ultra porn.

190
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:39,580
Speaker 0: Well, what about the kid?

191
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,760
Speaker 0: Well, what about the kids who are just being recruited by white supremacists because they went to the wrong YouTube?

192
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:47,240
Speaker 1: Why did you raise a kid who wants to go look at white supremacists?

193
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,759
Speaker 1: Why did you raise your kid not to be able to recognize Nazis?

194
00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:02,329
Speaker 0: well one thing I could recognize Nazis now as a kid, I guess one thing I can say that's different between when we were kids and Today is that when we were kids Most kids did not have access to the internet at all.

195
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:15,818
Speaker 0: true and the people who did tended to be pretty technologically savvy Or they couldn't make it work also true and we tended to have unsupervised access But most of the stuff on the internet was made by other people like us also true.

196
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,740
Speaker 0: now There's Nazis like actively trying to sneak in and trick people also true.

197
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,562
Speaker 0: So it is a different world Like I don't want.

198
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,431
Speaker 0: I don't want us to fall to survivor bias of.

199
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,220
Speaker 0: I had unrestricted access to the internet.

200
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:41,690
Speaker 0: I'm fine because when I got it when I got a different internet, it was a different internet in 1997 or 98, dude It is hard to express to some of you like younger listeners how different the internet was in 1997 but my Nazi detecting skills.

201
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,160
Speaker 1: Yes, possibly because I was raised among Jewish people.

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,220
Speaker 1: Maybe everyone should be raised among Jewish people, but I would solve a lot of problems.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,094
Speaker 0: I will say I get the impression that most of the apps that were shut down.

204
00:13:54,155 --> 00:14:01,560
Speaker 0: This is probably fine and The people who are mad about this are a vocal minority who want very specific niche things.

205
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,139
Speaker 1: They're vocal minority who made the apps that got shut down.

206
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:10,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, they probably found some parents who to comply who are mad that the app got shut down and got them They pretended to be their own customers.

207
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:22,720
Speaker 0: Yeah So in some other news that you probably should be paying attention to like it or not The measles epidemic in the United States is can is actually growing rapidly and is a big fucking problem.

208
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:26,154
Speaker 1: If you got measles stay the hell away from me and anyone I know.

209
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,580
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz I got vaccinated.

210
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:38,052
Speaker 1: But in fact if you got the measles and it whether it was because you were bad Or maybe it's because you were good and it just happened because other people were bad You should go find bad people and hang out near them.

211
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:39,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't make the most of it.

212
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:44,775
Speaker 0: There are so there are confirmed at least say over 700 cases across 22 states.

213
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:48,420
Speaker 0: now This is getting to the point to where it is a way.

214
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:57,960
Speaker 1: Is there no class-action lawsuit amongst the people who got measles who were Vaccinated and or some or couldn't be vaccinated against peep anti-vax people to sue them in in the ground?

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,383
Speaker 0: Well, most of the people are getting measles are themselves not vaccinated because their families are anti-vax All right.

216
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,140
Speaker 1: Well, they don't have to sue themselves because they'll just be horribly.

217
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got measles.

218
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,432
Speaker 1: They already got the consequences.

219
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:25,773
Speaker 0: So the biggest outbreak In New York City, yep in Brooklyn in one particular community we talked about this Yep, and the city has actually we talked about.

220
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,499
Speaker 0: like the city was doing they're escalating it.

221
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:38,300
Speaker 0: There are like straight-up mandatory vaccination orders in New York City now Which I think is absolutely justified and they should be us pursuing this much more aggressively than they have been up to this point.

222
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,721
Speaker 1: I think it's.

223
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:44,120
Speaker 1: I would have no moral problem with just physically detaining people and injecting them.

224
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,453
Speaker 0: I'd be okay with having making sure a doctor's sort of like.

225
00:15:47,794 --> 00:15:52,229
Speaker 0: if maybe the kids allergic to the vaccine Obviously a doctor would be doing the injecting.

226
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:53,914
Speaker 0: I'm just saying not like cops.

227
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:55,880
Speaker 1: if you they probably inject it in your eye.

228
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:03,659
Speaker 0: Child died injected with the measles vaccine 70 times in the back, right?

229
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've said they found a measles on.

230
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,099
Speaker 1: the cops can just do.

231
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,839
Speaker 1: No, the cops aren't gonna do the holding part.

232
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:11,385
Speaker 1: Firemen do.

233
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,320
Speaker 1: the whole time we found measles in his pocket.

234
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,145
Speaker 0: It was self-defense.

235
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:16,460
Speaker 1: the firemen will do the holding and the doctor will do the inject.

236
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:20,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, if there's any advice I can give you in terms of I guess EMTs can do it.

237
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not that hard in order the people you should trust with your life.

238
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,489
Speaker 0: Why in terms of like first responders.

239
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,116
Speaker 0: number one firemen.

240
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:30,000
Speaker 0: number two EMTs?

241
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,774
Speaker 0: About the same numbers three through 99 various other bystanders.

242
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,898
Speaker 0: number 100 the police dog.

243
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:40,248
Speaker 1: Someone's assaulting me.

244
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:41,840
Speaker 1: It's like a dog catcher dog.

245
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,807
Speaker 1: No, no cops go away.

246
00:16:47,220 --> 00:17:01,340
Speaker 0: But seriously if you're not sure if you were vaccinated against measles because sometimes medical records get lost like it's actually Terrifying how hard it is to get all my detailed medical records from my entire life because computers weren't really a thing.

247
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,163
Speaker 1: Yes, I saw some people posting I don't know how true it is that like if you got me the measles a vaccine a long time ago Which I did cuz I'm old.

248
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:13,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing we got is not like a hundred percent that we should get another one.

249
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,685
Speaker 0: I'm looking into that.

250
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,780
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm gonna talk to my doctor when I guess I guess I'll just make a doctor appointment.

251
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, yep, but it's like really I'm going to ask my doctor if I should get a like measles booster.

252
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:31,624
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can find the fucking records of when I had the fucking 1980 something.

253
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,633
Speaker 1: it's probably I'm like a piece of paper somewhere.

254
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,040
Speaker 1: You know, my mom has that shit.

255
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,481
Speaker 1: I don't know.

256
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,348
Speaker 1: It's probably buried in some drawer.

257
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:40,440
Speaker 1: That's just like a pile of paper that I'm surprised has this spontaneously combusted.

258
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's anywhere.

259
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:58,724
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think my pediatrician is like saws my records from 1980. something probably went to like one of those, you know stone mountain archiving One thing you should probably do though is if you know anyone who you know is anti vaccine Do you friend them?

260
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:02,700
Speaker 1: never speak to them other than to tell them get a vaccine or stay the fuck away from me?

261
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,081
Speaker 1: You should

262
00:18:03,644 --> 00:18:06,798
Speaker 0: end any contact with them and tell them why and then block them

263
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:23,159
Speaker 1: or Put on protective equipment hold them and physically drag them to someplace to be vaccinated Like find a doctor friend or a nurse friend, you know to like smuggle the vaccine out of work Right, and then there's like invite them over a pizza party hold them down.

264
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:25,824
Speaker 1: Good to go.

265
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,614
Speaker 0: it is still crazy that it there's a lot like.

266
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:36,640
Speaker 0: it really does appear that it's Russian bots and things like that that are really spreading the anti-vax mess or just give it to them in their sleep.

267
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,165
Speaker 1: They won't even know through.

268
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:39,870
Speaker 1: they'll continue being anti-vax though.

269
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:44,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the idea of And then they'll be like I'm it.

270
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,995
Speaker 1: I never had the vaccine and I think actually we get.

271
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,179
Speaker 1: maybe that's what you should do.

272
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:57,511
Speaker 1: Anyone who's like anyone who says who's like, you know, who's like I never had the vaccine and I didn't say just be like actually Yeah, even whether it's true or not.

273
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:57,872
Speaker 1: Tell them.

274
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually we held you down and gave it to you.

275
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,774
Speaker 0: I like the idea of telling them that actually the vaccine is safe.

276
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,640
Speaker 0: The problem is the mercury in the vaccine.

277
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:15,785
Speaker 0: So if you take a raw piece of potato Within four hours of getting the kid getting vaccinated and hold it on the wound for an hour It'll suck the mercury out.

278
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:19,136
Speaker 1: but the vaccination pretty sure it doesn't have mercury anymore.

279
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking to idiots.

280
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,563
Speaker 0: So we make some stuff up.

281
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:25,314
Speaker 0: Okay, it does not have mercury lie to cure a lie.

282
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,360
Speaker 1: Yep, such homeopathic remedies.

283
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,079
Speaker 0: I mean, how do you fight a forest fire but with another fire?

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,800
Speaker 1: Homeopathic water, I'll use one drop to put it a giant forest fire.

285
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:42,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll use a match to put a giant forest here about the guy who died of a homeopathic overdose.

286
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:44,620
Speaker 0: He forgot to take his medicine.

287
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:54,031
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

288
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,280
Speaker 0: you may have seen people post this in our forum.

289
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:57,626
Speaker 0: I saw it all over Twitter.

290
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:13,747
Speaker 1: There's this picture of this like Porco Rosso tailspin looking Fake-ass aircraft like this big bulbous like something that someone made to like hang up in a museum Or a fancy art exhibit somewhere.

291
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:17,940
Speaker 0: It looks like something an air pirate would fly in tailspin.

292
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:21,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, very cartoonish vehicle of the sky.

293
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:25,580
Speaker 0: So I saw a lot of people talking online like wait, there's no way that's real.

294
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,122
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

295
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:28,353
Speaker 1: cannot fly this unless you have a scarf.

296
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,860
Speaker 1: that with a long trail?

297
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,269
Speaker 1: Those goggles and the leather hat.

298
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,955
Speaker 1: otherwise, it won't even start.

299
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:34,678
Speaker 1: you'll just get in it.

300
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:35,300
Speaker 1: Nothing will happen.

301
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:37,091
Speaker 1: Like where's your scarf?

302
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,899
Speaker 1: I ain't starting for you.

303
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:43,580
Speaker 0: This is the kind of plane where instead of having a gun on it You just pull out your pistol and start shooting out the side.

304
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,830
Speaker 1: Also, you got a. the key is a mustache.

305
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,014
Speaker 1: You have a bill mustache.

306
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:48,214
Speaker 1: Yep.

307
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:49,819
Speaker 1: You got to shove it in the ignition in turn.

308
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,500
Speaker 0: So what I wanted to link to my thing of the day is yes, it's real and here is video.

309
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:02,702
Speaker 0: Well, here is a film converted to video from Showing that.

310
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,565
Speaker 0: yes, it's real.

311
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,030
Speaker 0: Yes, it flies.

312
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:10,819
Speaker 0: and if you're curious as to what the deal is with this plane It was not intended to be a plane to be used.

313
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:17,300
Speaker 0: It was basically a prototype to test some ideas about making airplanes, right?

314
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,062
Speaker 1: I mean I've seen.

315
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:24,000
Speaker 1: I thought that the shape would fly because I had I remember making paper airplanes in roughly circular shape.

316
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:27,291
Speaker 1: Tie the wings together at the bottom and they totally flew.

317
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:30,019
Speaker 1: they flew great on some occasions right based on how well you made it.

318
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:36,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the original image I saw showed something really fat and not and I was like that doesn't look right.

319
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,139
Speaker 1: But now that I've seen the video here and some other images, I believe obviously it's it's a flying shape.

320
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,303
Speaker 1: Yeah Yep, it's gonna work.

321
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,269
Speaker 0: It looks kind of fun to fly.

322
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,597
Speaker 1: It's kind of dangerous to fly.

323
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:49,964
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not.

324
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,759
Speaker 0: it can't be any more dangerous than like a BG.

325
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,496
Speaker 1: I mean, you know.

326
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:55,985
Speaker 0: So anyway, what do you got?

327
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:58,331
Speaker 1: So here's a technical thing of the day.

328
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,078
Speaker 1: In fact, it is technical metal.

329
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,738
Speaker 1: So Some don't play it.

330
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:16,780
Speaker 1: So somebody took machine learning slash neural network, whatever stuff and They trained it to produce audio.

331
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:31,541
Speaker 1: Right, so it's basically a computer program and it constantly produces audio at all times and it sends This audio Via RTMP I presume to YouTube where it is streaming this audio 24/7.

332
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:37,013
Speaker 0: right Just turn it on and don't really pay attention to it.

333
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,840
Speaker 0: You'll think oh, it's just a music channel, right?

334
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,515
Speaker 1: So what they did is they trained it to make audio by feeding it.

335
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:48,812
Speaker 1: the discography I presume of the technical death metal band was an arc spire.

336
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,646
Speaker 0: Yeah arch spire arch spire Which I'm not actually familiar with.

337
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:59,529
Speaker 1: I'm not familiar with their of word But or whatever.

338
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:08,035
Speaker 1: however gonna pronounce that over a yeah But yeah, it sound it basically is producing.

339
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:16,960
Speaker 1: if you listen to this It sounds like kind of messy technical death metal that doesn't stop and never repeats itself and is constantly new and fresh.

340
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:22,200
Speaker 1: Yep, and if this advances a few more, you know generations of technology worth.

341
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,920
Speaker 1: That will be really something because it asks a lot of fucking questions like who owns the goddamn rights to this shit?

342
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:33,720
Speaker 1: Yep, can I make if I forget your monkey taking a photo?

343
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,386
Speaker 1: Property question.

344
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:37,500
Speaker 1: that's old hat compared to this bad boy.

345
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:43,810
Speaker 0: I can fit ten monkeys taking a photo in this and like I put it on last night Just listen to it for a while.

346
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:44,739
Speaker 0: I was playing overwatch.

347
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:48,965
Speaker 0: It just sound like unless I pay attention to it It just sounds like death metal.

348
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:54,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I pay attention to it like you hear the voice like it's death grunting But it doesn't make words.

349
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how much is our spire supposed to get from this?

350
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot going on here But also hey, it's running 24/7 non-stop metal to I feel like you could make you could have a club that just plays this and make a thing about it.

351
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is this is metal.

352
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,049
Speaker 1: This is intellectual property.

353
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,093
Speaker 1: And this is computer.

354
00:24:16,113 --> 00:24:17,859
Speaker 1: This is a great geek nice thing.

355
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,818
Speaker 1: in a day It's good biz.

356
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:23,236
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment the geek nice book club book is the most painful book we have ever chosen.

357
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:28,114
Speaker 0: is Troy Dennings Branded Planescape novel pages of pain.

358
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,600
Speaker 1: There are no like sequels or prequels, right?

359
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,025
Speaker 0: Okay, it starts.

360
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,114
Speaker 1: I am one-third of the way through this book.

361
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:34,539
Speaker 1: I'm nearly there.

362
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,404
Speaker 1: I'm a major Turning point in the book.

363
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:40,551
Speaker 0: Is this where they start walling them into the labyrinth?

364
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:41,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's.

365
00:24:41,494 --> 00:24:43,440
Speaker 1: I'm out there running around the labyrinth right now.

366
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,305
Speaker 0: Yep, that's it.

367
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:44,788
Speaker 0: That's the scene.

368
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:46,157
Speaker 1: I don't know how they got in the labyrinth.

369
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:49,100
Speaker 1: to begin with That wasn't really clear but kind of got built around him.

370
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,930
Speaker 1: It's I like how this book is like.

371
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,840
Speaker 1: I'm like how fast are these dudes building?

372
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,809
Speaker 1: It doesn't make any sense.

373
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,422
Speaker 1: But well, they're in now I right.

374
00:24:55,503 --> 00:25:04,960
Speaker 0: one thing I'm realizing reading this with adult eyes very specifically is that If you don't already know some shit about the planescape universe good fucking luck.

375
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:13,920
Speaker 1: I know what I've been told by these other nerds and I've learned that everything these nerds have told me they learn by reading this fucking book.

376
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything everyone's ever said to me about planescape is just like in the first five pages of this book.

377
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,320
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, I'm like you nerds didn't play any fucking planes.

378
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:25,119
Speaker 1: Shit, you just all read this one book and are telling me what you read.

379
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:26,422
Speaker 0: There ain't?

380
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:27,407
Speaker 0: no they read two books.

381
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:30,560
Speaker 0: they read this book and there's one planescape source.

382
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,999
Speaker 1: I thought you said there were no sequels or prequels.

383
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,693
Speaker 1: Well, no the other book is the one that comes in the box.

384
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:38,029
Speaker 0: is the bar in the box There's a book that's like this is the fucking deal with planescape.

385
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,893
Speaker 0: It's right over there.

386
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:40,280
Speaker 1: You want to say all the same shit.

387
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:43,204
Speaker 1: That's in this died.

388
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,625
Speaker 0: it's The thing about planescape.

389
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:50,420
Speaker 0: is that the moral of planescape is that that city fucking sucks.

390
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:52,168
Speaker 0: Do not go anywhere near it.

391
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:53,052
Speaker 0: It just sucks there.

392
00:25:53,072 --> 00:25:54,740
Speaker 0: Okay smells like pee forever.

393
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,610
Speaker 0: So otherwise our real arm of games panel is on YouTube.

394
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,673
Speaker 1: That's good.

395
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,538
Speaker 0: Our rare game mechanics panel is on YouTube.

396
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:02,899
Speaker 1: That's good.

397
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:05,186
Speaker 0: Judge anime is on YouTube.

398
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:05,668
Speaker 1: That's good.

399
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,440
Speaker 0: And we're gonna make it a bunch of board stuff as fast as we can.

400
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,305
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

401
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:13,883
Speaker 0: We have no geek nights obligations Until PAX West.

402
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:18,998
Speaker 0: so as long as it is not too nice outside, we're gonna be making a bunch of content.

403
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:19,800
Speaker 1: starting next week.

404
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,746
Speaker 1: It's gonna be nice outside.

405
00:26:21,068 --> 00:26:22,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we got to make a bunch of content.

406
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,028
Speaker 1: like this week I did playing a bunch of auto chess.

407
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:34,320
Speaker 1: this weekend a big patch just came out that made a lot of good stuff happen And I may be able to play auto chess because the overwatch season just ended.

408
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,927
Speaker 1: Well, the auto chess season is about to end.

409
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:38,116
Speaker 1: you got today to set your rank.

410
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:45,837
Speaker 1: tomorrow Is a no rank day where it just doesn't matter and then May 1st, the new season will start and everyone will be like I guess zero rank.

411
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:46,500
Speaker 1: I don't know how it works.

412
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,505
Speaker 0: I can start from scratch.

413
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:49,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, I'm gonna play a lot of objects.

414
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Started thinking real hard.

415
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:57,260
Speaker 1: I like that gap day because the other like to let you learn the meta or whatever.

416
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:58,426
Speaker 1: The other games don't do that.

417
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:00,960
Speaker 1: Like Hearthstone is like, okay reset go go go.

418
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,951
Speaker 1: It's like so everyone's a good idea.

419
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:07,600
Speaker 1: gives everyone a chance to like Settle and figure out how they want to play without affecting their rank.

420
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,231
Speaker 0: And so you know overwatch does that you can.

421
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 0: you can always play quick play Which is the same as competitive just like doesn't count for anything.

422
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do that in Hearthstone too, but it's like you're not gonna be playing against people who are right.

423
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,450
Speaker 1: This makes everyone forced to play right in the know.

424
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,375
Speaker 1: the experiment, you know, no ranked mode.

425
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:28,927
Speaker 0: you can play competitive Went between seasons and overwatch.

426
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,311
Speaker 0: It's called the offseason.

427
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,637
Speaker 0: It's competitive rules competitive matchmaking.

428
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:33,740
Speaker 0: with your previous rank.

429
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:34,744
Speaker 0: It just doesn't count.

430
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:37,093
Speaker 0: Oh, it's it's actually pretty cool.

431
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:38,639
Speaker 1: That's basically what this is.

432
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but actually I really like the fact that the offseason exists.

433
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's no offseason in Hearthstone and other games don't have season.

434
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,689
Speaker 1: But basically there's gonna be a one-day auto chess offseason.

435
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:50,120
Speaker 0: So now that it's sort of an aside I'll talk about this more next Tuesday.

436
00:27:50,220 --> 00:28:03,920
Speaker 0: But because we can now script in maps in overwatch and make like really custom game modes I started musing on how to make a geek knight's overwatch An overwatch auto chess kind of thing and I actually came up with a pretty good idea.

437
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,408
Speaker 0: So I got to read the scripting like the SDK.

438
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:08,355
Speaker 1: Just make geek knight's overwatch instead.

439
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:09,560
Speaker 0: What it's just me and you?

440
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,626
Speaker 0: Like what would geek knight's overwatch?

441
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,536
Speaker 0: All our friends as characters?

442
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:14,119
Speaker 1: I don't know.

443
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,105
Speaker 0: It's just skeletons.

444
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,112
Speaker 0: It's just a map full of skeletons.

445
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:19,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we're talking.

446
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,319
Speaker 1: We're getting there.

447
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,560
Speaker 0: I feel like I could make an auto chess-y thing and I figured out like what it would look like.

448
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:37,637
Speaker 0: I just have to read the documentation to see if what I want to do is possible and Feasible with the scripting and if it isn't just completely like trivial to do.

449
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:39,143
Speaker 0: if I just write the scripts I ain't doing it.

450
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:46,820
Speaker 1: Oh, you could do it as like a mod for you know source engine I could or Arma or you know, all those other engines that allow mods.

451
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:48,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I really only want to do it for overwatch.

452
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:49,772
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I don't care that much.

453
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:54,129
Speaker 0: Okay, otherwise, I'll go back to Grease the wheels which needs second round.

454
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,690
Speaker 1: Quake 2 mod.

455
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:56,316
Speaker 1: Quake 2 auto chess mod.

456
00:28:56,396 --> 00:29:01,359
Speaker 0: Dude, if I'm gonna make Quake 2 I'll just make a Doom 2 mod cuz that's the only game engine I actually know inside and out.

457
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,728
Speaker 1: All right, Doom 2 auto chess.

458
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:03,030
Speaker 1: Let's go.

459
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:04,660
Speaker 1: Oh, I get three imps.

460
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,530
Speaker 1: They become the super imp and you watch.

461
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,553
Speaker 0: you just watch him fight.

462
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:10,520
Speaker 0: You're like floating above and you just watch him fight.

463
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,468
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we could make that the doom engines.

464
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:14,431
Speaker 0: not hard to learn.

465
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,757
Speaker 1: I got three cyber DVs.

466
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,606
Speaker 0: level two cyber DVs Oh shit.

467
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:20,160
Speaker 1: It's just got two rocket hands.

468
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:30,472
Speaker 0: The scripting is shockingly versatile in Doom 2 As long as there's a limited number of action frames you can take advantage of though.

469
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:33,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, let's talk about non-games.

470
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:38,274
Speaker 0: yes, so it is Monday and And We were talking about fishing.

471
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:43,340
Speaker 1: somehow We never did a show about fishing and can't believe this and my news reminded me about fishing.

472
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,584
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna show my fishing.

473
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:47,233
Speaker 0: So they're fishing is it with a pH?

474
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:49,440
Speaker 0: is an industry term like a technology term?

475
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,820
Speaker 0: It's changed a lot over the years because the internet has changed a lot.

476
00:29:53,101 --> 00:30:02,638
Speaker 0: But the basic idea is that you are trying to trick someone into Thinking that they are interacting with a thing, but really it was.

477
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,579
Speaker 0: do We're interacting with you.

478
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:14,070
Speaker 1: this doesn't only apply and most of the time it applies to a fake website or a fake email that looks like it came from a Bank or some official place.

479
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,299
Speaker 1: Google, right?

480
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,874
Speaker 1: Facebook or you know an app that looks like the real app, but it's not.

481
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:27,680
Speaker 1: it's another app that just you know Looks like the real app, but it actually applies to a lot of situations where anything is a fake front.

482
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,820
Speaker 1: For example, I give you a phone call and I say this is your so-and-so Bank.

483
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:38,085
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, that's tell a scamming tell them, you know, whatever Robo calling.

484
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:43,023
Speaker 1: but it's also fishing because I am pretending to be Some official thing.

485
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:45,432
Speaker 1: when I'm not right I can set up a fucking store.

486
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,940
Speaker 1: I can set up a bank branch, right?

487
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:49,791
Speaker 1: It looks like a real bank branch.

488
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:56,817
Speaker 1: I trick you to come in and You come and you swipe your card in my not official ATM.

489
00:30:56,897 --> 00:31:06,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's all sorts of things like that Usually only reserved for trying to get someone to Authenticate with or otherwise click on a link, right?

490
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,082
Speaker 1: Because that's the.

491
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:10,860
Speaker 1: that's why it's called fishing because you're fishing for their information, right?

492
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:20,463
Speaker 1: He's sort of a fake storefront and you're trying to collect somebody's username password pin number codes Numbers.

493
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,840
Speaker 1: you're trying to collect their most secret personal information.

494
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:32,019
Speaker 1: That's what you're fishing for and when you catch a sucker and get their info you get the credit card number you get whatever It is you need and now you take all their money.

495
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:33,203
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do whatever.

496
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:39,285
Speaker 0: go all the way back to in the early like the early days of just steal their identity a Unix machine Or a Linux machine.

497
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:40,331
Speaker 0: What do you make?

498
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,940
Speaker 0: a screen that looks like the logon screen?

499
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,448
Speaker 1: You make a screen that you make a terminal a shell.

500
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,114
Speaker 1: Yeah is the bash shell?

501
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,600
Speaker 1: you dig the bash shell source code.

502
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you modify it to send anything that they type to you.

503
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,716
Speaker 1: Yep, they type in their password.

504
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,809
Speaker 1: eventually They type SSH.

505
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,238
Speaker 1: eventually you got him.

506
00:31:58,262 --> 00:32:05,464
Speaker 0: So fishing really came to be in a modern sense when email became Widespread like.

507
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:12,349
Speaker 1: that is the beginning of modern fishing right because people were not able Set unsavvy people still to this day.

508
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:16,562
Speaker 1: Yeah cannot tell an email, you know, if it looks like an email from their bank They don't.

509
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,150
Speaker 1: in order to tell that it's not.

510
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:20,120
Speaker 1: you have to look very carefully.

511
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,300
Speaker 1: It's a look at like the email headers, which are unreadable to most human beings.

512
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,990
Speaker 1: Yeah You have to look at the from address and the user interfaces on.

513
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:38,359
Speaker 1: most email clients do not highlight that information Widely, the biggest thing is like the subject right of the email and then the contents of the email far outweigh the from area.

514
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:47,660
Speaker 1: Well, so unless you look closely you can easily be fooled and before spam filters are any good You actually saw those emails in your inbox like a lot.

515
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,545
Speaker 0: It was kind of a thing.

516
00:32:48,606 --> 00:32:51,261
Speaker 0: Like I remember the first time I got one Like.

517
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,023
Speaker 0: I remember being like.

518
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,029
Speaker 0: wow, someone's trying to trick me.

519
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,012
Speaker 0: That's funny.

520
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:59,505
Speaker 0: I wonder if anyone else has thought of doing this before Like.

521
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:01,360
Speaker 1: and then it's super widespread.

522
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:10,920
Speaker 1: People are trying to do this constantly and it works because they send so many of them That even if they're all blocked like it all blocked across all Gmail block.

523
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:27,440
Speaker 1: Sorry, it's like someone who's like at cable company.com using that email somewhere gets hit by it Or you just sneaks through a spam filter one some sucker Right you hit one or two and it's like it cost you basically nothing to cast all those fishing lines out in the sea.

524
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:31,414
Speaker 1: If you catch any fish, it's like alright, that's thousands of dollars.

525
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:32,960
Speaker 1: I just got from their credit card.

526
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,758
Speaker 0: No There's two main kinds of fishing and it is worth bringing up.

527
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:45,831
Speaker 0: Regular old fishing is like what Scott should describe but most security officials will refer to another kind called spearfishing Which is you are targeting an individual, right?

528
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:46,975
Speaker 1: I know this person.

529
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,660
Speaker 1: I know their bank.

530
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,820
Speaker 1: I know that they recently done a thing.

531
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,840
Speaker 1: There's something I know about them that I probably got from publicly available or easily available information.

532
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:57,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe I'm their friend and I'm evil.

533
00:33:58,053 --> 00:33:58,718
Speaker 1: I'm not their friend.

534
00:33:58,778 --> 00:33:59,080
Speaker 1: I'm there.

535
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:00,285
Speaker 1: Here's the here's the modern.

536
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:13,034
Speaker 0: I know them cuz I don't get too much into the history of like how this used to be Because none of that stuff it matters anymore No, but typically someone will go and buy like there'll be some storefront not Amazon But like a second or third tier storefront.

537
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:13,920
Speaker 0: that's legitimate.

538
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:33,280
Speaker 0: but as for security and they get hacked someone will buy that information on the dark web and then they'll look through that information find profiles of individual people Who they know bought something from this third tier storefront and will try to use that information To target that individual to have a higher rate of success in stealing their credit card or whatever.

539
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:42,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know if I buy something from Geek night store calm and then I get an email like his geek night store calm We we had a security problem.

540
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,411
Speaker 1: Everyone's got to reset your password.

541
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:48,960
Speaker 0: come and tell your password in yep And in fact, that's one of the most common techniques.

542
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,301
Speaker 0: It's all.

543
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,850
Speaker 0: this really is just like crafted social engineering.

544
00:34:52,889 --> 00:35:06,547
Speaker 0: you tell someone yo your security is compromised do this to fix it Not them not realizing that the initial statement you gave them was in fact do it's a Specific subset of the social engineering.

545
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:18,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, where you do a fake you socially engineer via providing a fake front And then get someone to input their information that is real into your fake front and then saving it.

546
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,660
Speaker 0: Yep, so there's a lot of babies first ways that this happens that unless you're really on the savvy.

547
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,406
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be able to fall for like.

548
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:30,240
Speaker 0: the link is clearly just like not your bank's website, right?

549
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:36,960
Speaker 1: a lot of times it'll be like WWW dot Chase dot something that's not chase.

550
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:43,649
Speaker 1: And it's like yeah, and I see the green lock there, but it's not chase calm It's something else.

551
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,098
Speaker 1: dot not chase calm.

552
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to look at the whatever's closest to the calm is what counts right.

553
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:53,067
Speaker 1: there might be like, you know WWW chase that doesn't matter.

554
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:56,158
Speaker 1: I could make a W to chase that front row crew calm if I wanted to right.

555
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:59,313
Speaker 1: It's gonna be the last one before the calm.

556
00:35:59,333 --> 00:35:59,916
Speaker 1: that's the one.

557
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:14,139
Speaker 0: so in the old days it used to be pretty easy to spot these just because the emails themselves look dodgy as shit, but modern technologies come a long way and people will literally just like apply the exact same style that a Legitimate email has from that bank.

558
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:16,870
Speaker 0: Like they will look a hundred percent right.

559
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:19,420
Speaker 0: the URLs even look right when you hover over.

560
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:20,705
Speaker 1: They'll use a lot of times.

561
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,909
Speaker 1: You'll see URL shorteners.

562
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,492
Speaker 1: You're all.

563
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:28,053
Speaker 1: shorteners are a big problem because Oftentimes they are used legitimately right.

564
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:34,400
Speaker 1: or even if they're not shorteners Various redirects will be used legitimately often for advertising purposes, right?

565
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,440
Speaker 1: I can Google you click on an ad you're actually getting the link for that ad.

566
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,533
Speaker 1: It looks like you're going to say let's say we've got a geek night's ad.

567
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:43,040
Speaker 1: It looks like it's gonna recruit a calm.

568
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,802
Speaker 1: It's an ad for front row crew that's purchased on Google You.

569
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:55,040
Speaker 1: if you actually look closely at the link it goes to Google ad something something and then it that's gonna redirect you to front Row crew after tracking all your ad biz, right?

570
00:36:55,321 --> 00:37:02,740
Speaker 1: So a court in some emails a lot of emails that people send from legitimate places They send out their email newsletter from their company to their customers.

571
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:13,941
Speaker 1: They fill that email up with all these redirecting ad links so that they can track people Who are clicking on the newsletters so that they can you know get stats on their newsletter design their newsletters better all that kind of Stuff.

572
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:14,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

573
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:19,040
Speaker 1: And so now you're used to having these redirects and URL shortened links in your newsletter.

574
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:27,433
Speaker 1: So then someone sends out a fake one and you look at all the links and none of them make any sense and it's like Okay, obviously these aren't gonna be at the actual place.

575
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,641
Speaker 1: calm because you know It's it.

576
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:33,880
Speaker 1: they're all ad blinks, but you click one and I redirects you to shady site.com.

577
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:39,679
Speaker 1: No, but you couldn't tell when you clicked on it because it was a short shortener or redirector.

578
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:50,913
Speaker 0: With this escalation of like increasingly advanced phishing techniques and like the news we just talked about with the inception bar There's really only one real defense against this like being smart.

579
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:51,355
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:56,674
Speaker 0: Well being smart being knowledgeable and Find if you're not that smart or not that knowledgeable.

581
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,368
Speaker 0: There's a simple set of rules You can follow.

582
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:03,553
Speaker 0: rule number one Never ever click on a link you received in an email even if the email appears legitimate.

583
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:08,692
Speaker 0: if your bank emails you saying Hey, there's a thing like whatever it might be.

584
00:38:08,712 --> 00:38:09,295
Speaker 0: I yep.

585
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:10,580
Speaker 1: I do this even myself.

586
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:14,440
Speaker 0: I I see that email and I don't care if it's a real email or not.

587
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,744
Speaker 0: It made it through my spam filter.

588
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:16,868
Speaker 0: So it may well be legit.

589
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:22,440
Speaker 0: I then type my bank comm into a browser Yep, and go to it independently.

590
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:27,996
Speaker 0: And if I don't see the information in my account that the email purported should be there.

591
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,180
Speaker 0: I know it was fake.

592
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:39,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever I get an email from some site where I have important like an email like say from steam Yeah, it's like hey, you know, we gotta you gotta you know, check out some steam thing.

593
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:40,027
Speaker 0: I go log into.

594
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:41,319
Speaker 1: I go to steam.

595
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:41,440
Speaker 1: doc.

596
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:49,788
Speaker 1: I just open my browser and go to steam to see if I can corroborate what the email says and if I can't I Whether I can't I can't I delete the email.

597
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,623
Speaker 0: it's similar to if your bank ever calls you saying Anything.

598
00:38:53,944 --> 00:39:00,608
Speaker 0: you should tell them that you're gonna hang up and you're gonna call them back at the number actually printed on your card Yep, and be like, yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

599
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:06,345
Speaker 0: That's like that'll that following these two rules Basically makes you immune to fishing.

600
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:10,558
Speaker 0: It is very hard to get trick if you follow those two very simple rules.

601
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:14,840
Speaker 1: Yep If you want to technologically stop avoid fishing, right?

602
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:19,157
Speaker 1: One way to do it is like I was just talking about those redirects and you're all shortness, right.

603
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:29,329
Speaker 1: ad block Of course is really good at helping you avoid a lot of fishing things because a lot of fishing stuff Right is hosted in shady parts of the web.

604
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:33,100
Speaker 1: a lot of those redirectors which are used for ad tracking are used for fishing.

605
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:40,447
Speaker 1: right and ad block for example, like my pie hole like DNS ad block them or Actual ad block will.

606
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:47,780
Speaker 1: often not it's you know, they're geared mostly towards ads But they will often block a lot of shady fishing things and not legit things.

607
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 1: So I there have been often times where you know something shady comes up and I noticed that it's shady Even faster than usual because half of it is blocked and the links don't work.

608
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:01,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, like oh my ad block is blocking all of this thing.

609
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:02,997
Speaker 1: Oh because it's a bunch of bullshit.

610
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:07,488
Speaker 1: That's why yep So I got all ads everywhere always.

611
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,619
Speaker 0: it does really sad me how effective fishing is considering how?

612
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,280
Speaker 0: Desperately easy it is to avoid being caught by a head like even my company.

613
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,187
Speaker 1: They said it's it's a game of numbers.

614
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,797
Speaker 1: right if you cast enough lines, you still catch people.

615
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:22,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, send it up It's the same thing.

616
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:23,734
Speaker 1: My spam is such a big deal.

617
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:26,830
Speaker 1: Even still today You try to sell Viagra to enough people.

618
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:27,734
Speaker 1: someone will buy.

619
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:28,075
Speaker 0: Yep.

620
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,656
Speaker 1: Someone's clicking on that link There's still someone out there.

621
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,808
Speaker 0: Mostly what I'm amazed by is that there was ever a time where if you clicked on that Viagra email Someone actually sent you Viagra.

622
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:40,339
Speaker 1: I always assumed at least once there was.

623
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:45,180
Speaker 0: I assume that if you tried to buy Viagra you would in fact just get your credit card overdrawn.

624
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,713
Speaker 1: Well, I mean all those Nigerian scams.

625
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:48,900
Speaker 1: there was someone on the other end.

626
00:40:49,141 --> 00:40:51,792
Speaker 1: They just weren't someone with a pile of gold that needed help.

627
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:53,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were just someone who needed help.

628
00:40:56,782 --> 00:41:02,492
Speaker 0: But what's all that was also interesting about this kind of fishing is that They really have to trick you.

629
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 0: you say you click on a link because you're dumb.

630
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:08,247
Speaker 0: even then they still have to make the website look legit enough.

631
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:15,170
Speaker 0: you type your credentials in and The other way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication for everything.

632
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:25,170
Speaker 0: Yep, because if even if you try to log into one of these fishing sites And you type your real password, it won't be able to do the like two-factor TOTP.

633
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:29,902
Speaker 1: However, there have been some more developments along this way.

634
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:30,243
Speaker 0: Yep.

635
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,430
Speaker 0: There's an OAuth vulnerability, isn't there?

636
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no but what people do is like yeah, they'll just fish the two-factor part also, right?

637
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:43,397
Speaker 1: You log in then they take that and they Immediately use it to log in.

638
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:47,270
Speaker 1: while you're waiting for the lot the fake login to happen there at the computer.

639
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:48,013
Speaker 1: That's evil.

640
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:52,150
Speaker 1: is immediately using your username and password to try to see if it's real.

641
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:58,660
Speaker 1: It's like in the background of that some server somewhere is now trying to log into your bank account With the username and password you just gave.

642
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:00,309
Speaker 0: it waits for the prompt for the TOTP.

643
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,660
Speaker 1: You're sitting there waiting and it notices wait.

644
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,825
Speaker 1: This person's got two-factor.

645
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:07,109
Speaker 1: It comes back to you and is like Hey, can we have a two-factor?

646
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:14,223
Speaker 1: And then if you type it in and they'll immediately log into your bank account and then change your password You know, then they got you, right?

647
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:19,785
Speaker 0: Yep But that is a note like that is more sophisticated than a typical fish.

648
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,254
Speaker 1: that is a very sophisticated one But they do exist.

649
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,339
Speaker 1: I've seen people.

650
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,004
Speaker 1: I haven't seen them necessarily in the wild But I've definitely seen proofs of concept and such-and-such.

651
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:34,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of the proofs of concepts I've seen involve SMS because it's just way easier to mess with SM.

652
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:34,992
Speaker 0: I've

653
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:49,957
Speaker 1: seen similar stuff used for captchas where It'll try to log in and because the bot the capture comes up and it'll send the capture to the person who's being fished To get it to solve the capture for them and then it will send the capture solution and now it's logged in even though It's a bot.

654
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:55,350
Speaker 0: Yep so I Don't know what else there is to really say fishing.

655
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,173
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's.

656
00:42:56,313 --> 00:43:01,410
Speaker 1: it's strange that despite, you know, you think internet savvy people right would know about fishing already.

657
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,132
Speaker 1: But actually this is the thing that comes up not like at every job I've had.

658
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:12,277
Speaker 1: this comes up often like the IT people are emailing pretty constantly like saying Hey, we noticed a fishing thing.

659
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:14,044
Speaker 1: Don't click on this thing everybody.

660
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:19,310
Speaker 1: We've seen an email that looks like this Don't click on it like constantly like once every week couple weeks.

661
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,370
Speaker 0: Well, see I work very much more sophisticated and larger organization that has much more like security is a big deal.

662
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:33,998
Speaker 0: so we pretty much regularly we get a lot of emails that are fake phishing attempts and From the company like with they have this whole system.

663
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:38,110
Speaker 1: So your company is sending fake phishing attempts to its own employees.

664
00:43:38,231 --> 00:43:40,309
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you click on one you're in a lot of trouble.

665
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,030
Speaker 1: But I mean the fact that it gets through the spam filter.

666
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:48,810
Speaker 0: Well, no, it bypasses the spam filter because it's coming from inside the house on purpose, right?

667
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,670
Speaker 1: But that's what I'm saying.

668
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,750
Speaker 1: Is that it becomes sort of now like a standout in my inbox like what the fuck is this weird thing in my inbox?

669
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time only one that gets through.

670
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:00,390
Speaker 0: I would argue that savvy people what the fuck is this thing?

671
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,304
Speaker 0: In my inbox is how I regard almost any email again.

672
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,768
Speaker 1: I Don't trust email But the fact that it came through and it would need to have like lots of company right.

673
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:18,141
Speaker 1: like if I didn't have a spam filter then it would sort of come in and Sort of look like everything else on my inbox and blend in with the crowd.

674
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:24,910
Speaker 1: if it comes in when I have a spam filter Blocking all the other real fishing then it now is like a black sheep and a pile of white sheep.

675
00:44:25,011 --> 00:44:25,968
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck is that?

676
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,650
Speaker 1: Yep, but I guess it needs to be a white sheep to sneak fast.

677
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,010
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's not trying to sneak fast because this the filters are already really effective.

678
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:34,890
Speaker 0: So stuff really doesn't make it through anyway.

679
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:48,230
Speaker 0: It's more just to like make people who aren't that good at this afraid of emails Which honestly if someone can't figure this out on their own the only alternative is to make them afraid of clicking on links and emails.

680
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:54,481
Speaker 0: That's good Like they have to actually be afraid of it and then they won't click on them and then they'll accidentally follow the rules We just provided.

681
00:44:54,501 --> 00:45:08,930
Speaker 1: hmm I think spearfishing is the real like upcoming frontier because that is a fake house That looks like your house where you live and you put your key in the door And now I copy the key and go open the door to your real house.

682
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,389
Speaker 1: But it is that I moved to another county and then see all your stuff.

683
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,369
Speaker 0: I think you don't need to do that because one if I get even like one because if I can pick up your house I can smash the door down.

684
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:24,919
Speaker 0: Well, if I get one photo of your key, I can make your key or don't let anyone see your keys, by the way Yeah, like don't hold your keys up in front of cameras.

685
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:31,150
Speaker 0: Nope, but to even without that bump key It's like people don't really realize how easy it is to pick a lock.

686
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,977
Speaker 1: I'm you know I'm just trying to say I get to.

687
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,793
Speaker 0: I. I'm just saying I could teach you Scott in about Ten minutes.

688
00:45:35,894 --> 00:45:37,360
Speaker 1: I could learn from YouTube if I cared.

689
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,550
Speaker 1: it's a hobby of nerds that I'm just not that's not mine.

690
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:41,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, thing is don't learn how to really pick a lock.

691
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,886
Speaker 0: just use a bump key just pop up.

692
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,570
Speaker 0: Oh it just opens.

693
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:44,994
Speaker 0: Mmm, you don't have to do anything.

694
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:48,505
Speaker 0: some of them most most locks most locks on tours.

695
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,115
Speaker 0: You could bump key open pretty easy Maybe.

696
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:52,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, fishing.

697
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:58,407
Speaker 0: I think it like it's growing to the point that it I think the reason I say spearfishing is actually a danger.

698
00:45:58,427 --> 00:46:10,263
Speaker 0: is that Increasingly the the sources of spearfishing attempts seem to be state-sponsored actors Like targeting journalists targeting researchers targeting government officials.

699
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:14,016
Speaker 0: That is literally what happened in America 2016 election.

700
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:16,230
Speaker 1: there is one other thing to discuss right?

701
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:16,972
Speaker 1: You know how?

702
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:23,474
Speaker 1: whenever you're in your browser and something's gonna go full-screen like gonna make a full-screen video Yeah, it's like.

703
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,970
Speaker 1: hey, do you want to give this permission to go full-screen?

704
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:30,150
Speaker 1: It's always asking for permission for things to go full-screen and like in Windows.

705
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:39,559
Speaker 1: It's like when it with the screen is locked and like it makes you press ctrl alt delete to like get past And make the login screen come up, right?

706
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:51,281
Speaker 1: It's like why the reason it's doing all these things is to prevent Full-screen fishing because if you have an application that is allowed Full-screen access to draw to all the pixels on the screen.

707
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:57,182
Speaker 1: I could just redraw all of Windows I could redraw your entire desktop and I could have some app.

708
00:46:57,684 --> 00:47:13,685
Speaker 1: and you think you're just using your computer But actually my app is full screen on top of all your other apps eating all your keyboard commands Right not letting you actually get to your real apps behind me Just pretending to be your real apps behind me and capturing everything you type in.

709
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:15,270
Speaker 1: you're typing into my evil app.

710
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:16,478
Speaker 1: That is full screen.

711
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:28,122
Speaker 1: full screen is real dangerous And that is why your computer always asks for permission to let things go full screen and you should think more More about what you let go full screen.

712
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:30,773
Speaker 1: if you let websites go full screen That shouldn't be.

713
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,199
Speaker 1: you could be in a world of hurt.

714
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:40,430
Speaker 1: and the reason Windows makes you press ctrl delete To get the login screen to show up is because if there was some sort of fake login screen, right?

715
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,050
Speaker 0: That was actually remember the thing I said in the very beginning the first fishing arguably, right?

716
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:57,694
Speaker 1: If there was a fake login screen and you pressed ctrl delete on Windows that makes you know The things happen of when you press ctrl delete, right and that would get you around and make you suddenly realize Hey, wait a minute.

717
00:47:57,895 --> 00:47:58,899
Speaker 1: There's an app running.

718
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,670
Speaker 1: That looks like a login screen that happened to be full screen.

719
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:02,713
Speaker 1: What's up with that?

720
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:09,909
Speaker 1: whereas the control cuz ctrl delete always go get sent to windows around any kind of app Even if it's full screen.

721
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:27,985
Speaker 0: But seriously, I cannot stress this enough All you need to do to never be caught by fishing is to never click on a link that gets sent to you by anyone Even if you think that is a legitimate source, and if you click on one of those links, like let's forget We're not talking about malware deployments or malware payloads.

722
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,030
Speaker 0: We're just talking about fishing.

723
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,460
Speaker 0: So if you click on something and it takes you to a login screen Don't log into that.

724

Speaker 1: like you could like click on a file and get hurt, right?

727
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,044
Speaker 1: It's like you're not gonna get hurt by fishing unless you type in your real infos.

728
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:50,705
Speaker 1: like you can go to the fishing site and like Look around as long as you don't type in like your security number.

729
