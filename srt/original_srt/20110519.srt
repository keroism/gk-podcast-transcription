1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,748
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 19th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:12,389
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,011
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,234
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:20,824
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about asses and Mars and reactors Quaid.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,492
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:32,756
Speaker 0: I Swear this has nothing to do with all this sudden news about Arnold having a kid.

8
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:33,780
Speaker 1: It's a nice coincidence.

9
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just happen to.

10
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:42,300
Speaker 0: you know many people in our crew had never seen Total Recall and Why are you skipping in the second half of the show right away?

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,260
Speaker 0: It's one of those movies that everyone's seen so we made sure everyone saw it.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,520
Speaker 0: But the reason I bring it up early is that I didn't care at all about this whole.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,512
Speaker 0: You know Arnold had a kid and he was paying child support.

14
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:52,397
Speaker 0: I don't care either.

15
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:55,106
Speaker 0: So I Happened to see a picture of the kid.

16
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,692
Speaker 0: All right, and you know, what's great.

17
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:57,616
Speaker 1: Is he gigantic?

18
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:10,100
Speaker 0: The kid looks Exactly like Arnold like not even like a little like Arnold but like it's Arnold Baby Arnold like there is no doubt to the paternity of this child.

19
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in much more happy news it was sunny today.

20
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:18,878
Speaker 0: Rainbow Dash finally did her job.

21
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,690
Speaker 0: not really I was sunny most of the day.

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,940
Speaker 1: Have you looked out the window like right this second?

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,008
Speaker 0: I had a nice lunch at Bryan Park Sun was out.

25
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,171
Speaker 0: the white stones of the library were gleaming so hard I can hardly look at him.

26
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:36,800
Speaker 0: the library I got a go-to in about a day and because it was raining in the morning hardly anyone was in the park.

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,046
Speaker 0: So it was just fantastic.

28
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:38,709
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,920
Speaker 0: And there were signs all over the park.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,983
Speaker 0: You know what those signs said?

31
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:45,251
Speaker 1: don't go on the grass smell the flowers not the smoke.

32

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,455
Speaker 1: There'll be brimstone smell.

40
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:10,286
Speaker 1: I Actually like the smell of brimstone.

41
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:13,439
Speaker 0: So you'd better listen to geek nights pretty soon because this is pretty much it.

42
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:20,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you if you wanted to listen to some old episodes Maybe we should.

43
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:24,236
Speaker 1: maybe we should you know, stop being nice after the apocalypse.

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,480
Speaker 1: It's gotta end sometime, right?

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,927
Speaker 1: We can't do it when we're 90 years old.

46
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,699
Speaker 1: We I think we could especially since when I'm 90 you'll be dead.

47
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to win the game of who lives the longest.

48
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,960
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I'm gonna win that game.

49
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:36,049
Speaker 1: I'm winning that game.

50
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,340
Speaker 0: I'll bet you all my money.

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,001
Speaker 1: That is the game that we've been playing since we were born and will not end for hopefully a long time, you know Tomorrow?

52
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,930
Speaker 0: supposedly Thomas Jefferson and John Adams played the same game.

53
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:47,733
Speaker 1: They did.

54
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:48,154
Speaker 1: who won?

55
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:49,458
Speaker 0: it was close.

56
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,083
Speaker 0: suppose It was real close.

57
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:55,515
Speaker 0: Jefferson died first, but Adam died saying Jefferson still lives.

58
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the story that I've heard as well.

59
00:02:58,624 --> 00:02:59,108
Speaker 1: True it is.

60
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,600
Speaker 1: we'd have to ask this story, but you know what?

61
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,269
Speaker 0: You know what?

62
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,305
Speaker 1: That would be awesome If the same exact thing happened, huh?

63
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:07,137
Speaker 1: Well, I'm dying and I'm like that bastard rim still is.

64
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,060
Speaker 1: meanwhile rim is dead.

65
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:15,962
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were exactly as they were portrayed in 1776.

66
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,709
Speaker 1: I think they disagreed more than we do though.

67
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:25,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, we agree on a lot of fundamental Fundamentally disagree on a lot of things but they'd fundamentally disagreed on everything.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,800
Speaker 1: They were like opposite opinion on ever write down the the whole not are both pretty keen on democracy.

69
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:33,033
Speaker 1: They were pretty keen on alcohol.

70
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:39,494
Speaker 0: Yeah and ladies And wait none so much as Benjamin Franklin.

71
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:40,780
Speaker 1: Well, you know, he was the man.

72
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,689
Speaker 0: I mean, why else would you go to New Brunswick?

73
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:43,553
Speaker 0: They were professionals.

74
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,959
Speaker 1: Ben Franklin was the master.

75
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:49,707
Speaker 0: So you got any news.

76
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,334

Speaker 1: Remember where the guy Right where the guys in the the restaurant or whatever?

82
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,500
Speaker 0: It's probably the only reason that anyone in America today knows who Alexander Hamilton or Aaron Burr.

83
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:16,868
Speaker 1: I knew who they were before the career.

84
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:21,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think anyone else did maybe but anyway My co-worker actually never saw the commercial.

85
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,715
Speaker 1: really one interesting piece of information.

86
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:29,706
Speaker 1: side note this Commercial was directed by Michael Bay The explosion guy.

87
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:32,139
Speaker 1: Wow, I know that I didn't either.

88
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:34,146
Speaker 1: So here's the story.

89
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:35,009
Speaker 1: some guy.

90
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,939
Speaker 1: His name is left ventricle two years ago.

91
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:40,282
Speaker 0: Okay Uploaded.

92
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:41,647
Speaker 1: his YouTube name is left ventricle.

93
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:42,891
Speaker 1: Okay, he uploaded.

94
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:47,289
Speaker 0: I was wondering is I mean is ventricle the surname like Ventricle years ago.

95
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:52,369
Speaker 1: He uploaded I think in oh eight That video of that commercial to YouTube.

96
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,919
Speaker 1: it got many views many many views.

97
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 1: However, this guy left ventricle is his YouTube name.

98
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:03,898
Speaker 1: Apparently has OCD and you know YouTube comments.

99
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,908
Speaker 0: Did he take it down and put it back up?

100
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,014
Speaker 0: No, does he respond to every comment?

101
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:10,860
Speaker 1: No, he moderates all the comment.

102
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:21,650
Speaker 0: Whoa has been doing so for years Whoa, so when I made my youtube account to put up the you know The way is geek nights rim if you want geek night stuff.

103
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pretty much Looked at all the stuff I could do with comments and decided that would never be worth my time, right?

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,814
Speaker 1: So what he does is like any comment.

105
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:33,220
Speaker 1: that's just like misspelled or whatever.

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,541
Speaker 1: He actually deletes this guy's any and he got pissed off because there were like certain trends in commenting Like.

107
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:43,439
Speaker 1: there are a whole bunch of people who would comment like spit out the sandwich dumbass and he would delete all those.

108
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:47,200
Speaker 1: Or the be people who would point out facts like wait wait who?

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,420
Speaker 0: Commenting to spit out the sandwich is like the old guy who yells at the screen in the movie theater.

110
00:05:54,424 --> 00:06:05,673
Speaker 1: Right, but basically there are people who are posting like facts like, you know the actor, you know People would make a comment like oh the actor's name is Sean Whalen The DJ on the phone's name is Rob Paulson and director is Michael Bay.

111
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:11,382
Speaker 1: and anyone who posts that information He deletes that too because he already has it in the description I'd like.

112
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,051
Speaker 1: basically he's moderates this thing every day.

113
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:14,874
Speaker 0: and what do you think?

114
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,780
Speaker 0: We'd have to pay him to moderate our forum.

115
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:23,100
Speaker 0: He's a completely obsessive nut and yeah, I really want him to moderate our right, but I would consider paying him.

116
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:26,997
Speaker 1: But the point is is that it's like he's been doing this on this YouTube video.

117
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,640
Speaker 1: where he could He could just turn off comments.

118
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,400
Speaker 0: I want to invite him into the ivory tower.

119
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:40,810
Speaker 1: but the point just gotta read the story of this guy because it's like an epic story of a guy who does not understand the Internet and has fallen victim to it and his own.

120
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,235
Speaker 0: this is pretty disordered.

121
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:47,372
Speaker 0: I mean this guy is basically It's the equivalent of correcting all the graffiti that you see.

122
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,780
Speaker 0: not not removing the graffiti but correcting.

123
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,713
Speaker 1: So the top two comments are number one with 78 thumbs ups.

124
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,869
Speaker 1: Judging by the uploader comments in description.

125
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,519
Speaker 1: the person who uploaded this is a massive control freak asshole.

126
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:04,213
Speaker 1: Comment number two not 56 upvotes Michael Bay.

127
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:05,256
Speaker 1: question mark then.

128
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:06,660
Speaker 1: where the hell were all the explosions?

129
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:11,436
Speaker 1: It seems unlikely that left ventricle will ever find peace.

130
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,023
Speaker 0: So Very briefly.

131
00:07:14,043 --> 00:07:25,780
Speaker 0: I probably will regret this but I do want to talk a little bit about President Barack Obama's recent speech about the Middle East because Many US presidents have given speeches and tried to do them.

132
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,724
Speaker 0: Not every single one.

133
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:28,867
Speaker 1: the top few decades.

134
00:07:28,987 --> 00:07:33,260
Speaker 0: Thomas Jefferson did not give any speeches about how we need to reconcile Israel and Palestine.

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,609
Speaker 1: He cared about Tripoli just close.

136
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:43,878
Speaker 0: Yeah So, you know Carter Wanted to have peace in the Middle East and pretty much every American president is wanted to have peace in the Middle East.

137
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,244
Speaker 0: and we do Because you got it.

138
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:48,196
Speaker 1: You can't just do nothing because stuff is happening and you're the president's.

139
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:54,071
Speaker 0: not just that It's because the United States plays a very vital role in Israel's foreign policy of

140
00:07:54,131 --> 00:08:05,800
Speaker 1: course and you know You got to do something and I bet every single one of those presidents is thinking if I'm the guy who makes the big move And actually something good comes of it then I will be remembered forever as so great.

141
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,648
Speaker 1: So they all try to do something.

142
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,040
Speaker 0: pretty much every time this has come up.

143
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:27,300
Speaker 0: the US is usually really heavily sided with Israel and for many reasons, but President Barack Obama might have grown another testicle because he Basically said that Israel needs to pull back to the 1967 borders and give up the West Bank and East Jerusalem anti-semite.

144
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:32,133
Speaker 0: And I am so proud of him for going for this.

145
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:37,000
Speaker 0: and now it's funny because you know We're doing some more hardcore panels at PAX this year.

146
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:46,878
Speaker 0: So I bought three books on game theory All right, and they're through their three levels of difficulty and so far having read one and a half of them We got this shit not difficult enough.

147
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:47,883
Speaker 0: yet We know this shit.

148
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,068
Speaker 0: the math is the hard part.

149
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,960
Speaker 0: so I flipped through the third book and the first two pages.

150
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,663
Speaker 0: They're like, all right.

151
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:56,120
Speaker 0: All right, the rest of the book is almost nothing but math.

152
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:58,164
Speaker 0: We'll see.

153
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:01,219
Speaker 0: we'll see I've been writing utility functions and they seem to work.

154
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:16,319
Speaker 0: anyway, there's a Concept that we already know and we've already talked about this a lot on the show and in our lectures at Conventions like tax but it comes up very directly in this situation and it came up in the book I was just reading so it was fresh in my mind.

155
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:28,696
Speaker 0: It's the idea that you can play an equilibrium strategy in a strategic game like foreign policy Which guarantees you a minimum return but also limits your maximum return, you know, assuming everyone's rational.

156
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:30,320
Speaker 0: This is like your default strategy.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,326
Speaker 0: It's the equivalent of playing conservatively in hearts.

158
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:38,006
Speaker 0: Yep, if I play conservatively and the three people I'm playing with their dumbasses I'm pretty much guaranteed to win.

159
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,839
Speaker 0: and if I play conservatively and everyone else is smart.

160
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Speaker 1: Someone's gonna shoot the moon eventually because they're either gonna play conservatively or shoot the moon.

161
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:56,379
Speaker 0: but on average playing conservatively guarantees that you will not lose a game of hearts because odds are at least one person's a dumbass or Someone will make a mistake or the game will come down to use a complete randomness.

162
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:07,960
Speaker 0: But the only way to break out of a perfect equilibrium where both sides are rational is to get into the poison cup Second-guessing game where you decide that you think the other person is going to be perfectly rational.

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,160
Speaker 0: Therefore you act very irrationally and have a smaller chance of a bigger payout.

164
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:20,600
Speaker 0: That's how to you know Because it's more interesting to play a game like hearts when you go over the fucking moon because otherwise you're guaranteeing yourself second place.

165
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,546
Speaker 0: Who wants second place?

166
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:27,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might risk falling way low But you get a chance of shooting the moon and going directly to first.

167
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:28,396
Speaker 1: do not pass go now.

168
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:42,726
Speaker 0: the book gave an interesting Example because I used to always give an example of this Situation in terms of paper rock scissors the idea that if you're playing paper rock scissors against a little kid You can pretty much assume they're gonna throw scissors Because kids try it sometime.

169
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,033
Speaker 0: little kids feel like scissors is powerful.

170
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,420
Speaker 0: They tend to throw scissors first almost always.

171
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,611
Speaker 1: It's I remember doing that when I was a kid.

172
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no kid, you know why you're kid?

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,770
Speaker 0: You're not even like sentient yet cuz it made of metal.

174
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,719
Speaker 1: It's like yeah cutting is cool.

175
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:57,824
Speaker 0: It's the same way.

176
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:01,620
Speaker 0: in your little kid you got a coloring book and yours like yeah blue all over the fuck place.

177
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,753
Speaker 1: It's like paper whatever papers boring rocks.

178
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,300
Speaker 1: I have rocks in the backyard, but scissors.

179
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,677
Speaker 1: I'm not even allowed to play with dangerous scissors as a dangerous weapon.

180
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:10,219
Speaker 1: as a kid.

181
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:20,108
Speaker 0: I read I recognize this and I thought all right if the if the kid I'm gonna play paper rock scissors with is a dumbass I know he's gonna throw Scissors so I'm gonna throw rock.

182
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:20,551
Speaker 1: how about that?

183
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:21,013
Speaker 1: Pete and Pete.

184
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:28,800
Speaker 0: and then I would think about Someone who's one like degree removed from dumbass attitude like he's one level less of a dumbass.

185
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,612
Speaker 0: I assume that he knows the same thing.

186
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,508
Speaker 0: I know that the kids are gonna throw scissors So he assumes that I think he's gonna throw scissors.

187
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:40,117
Speaker 0: So he throws rock to get rid of my scissors.

188
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:40,579
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:50,540
Speaker 0: So basically you can iterate through this repetitive mod 3 math Depending on what degree of intelligence you think the other person has relative to a five-year-old, right?

190
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Speaker 1: But the thing is if they have once they're at the fourth level of intelligence, you know, they're gonna pick randomly.

191
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,010
Speaker 0: Ah, no, I don't think they will.

192
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,080
Speaker 0: I think that you know, I'll pick randomly.

193
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaker 0: There's a modulus 3 that goes to infinity degrees of intelligence Unless they're smart enough to realize that playing randomly is the only way to get out of that.

194
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:16,180
Speaker 0: But if you know, they're going to play randomly, you know that your best strategy is to also play randomly However, and you can't affect the outcome so it doesn't really matter.

195
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:23,720
Speaker 0: But if you know if you think the other person is going to play randomly and they don't then everything moves around again.

196
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 1: Hey, let's do one right now.

197
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:25,567
Speaker 1: Just one.

198
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,294
Speaker 1: All right, one, two, three.

199
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,078
Speaker 1: Are you scissors?

200
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:28,600
Speaker 0: Are you scissors?

201
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:38,651
Speaker 0: So The point of all this is that Barack who aren't any smart at all.

202
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,514
Speaker 1: That's what that means, right?

203
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,856
Speaker 0: or we're modulus 3.

204
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:52,488
Speaker 0: So Barack Obama I think is bucking the trend of previous presidents who basically said yeah is real blah blah blah blah and he's basically taking The the more he's trying to shoot.

205
00:12:52,528 --> 00:13:06,479
Speaker 0: he's trying to shoot the moon instead of not losing because Israel is gonna be like no Fuck you but you know what Palestine's chill with this and Much of the rest of the world is chill with this and it really shifts the onus of who's the bad guy.

206
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,719
Speaker 0: even though They're both both good and bad guys a little bit more toward Israel I still don't have confidence that they will ever.

207
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:22,171
Speaker 0: I do I think I will predict right now that in our lifetime you and me before we both die We will see a Palestinian state.

208
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:25,546
Speaker 1: that doesn't mean that there will be peace and they'll stop fighting I don't know.

209
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:28,299
Speaker 1: but there could be a state but there's still gonna be war and it's never gonna end.

210
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:35,344
Speaker 1: I think it'll actually reduce quite a bit because having a pal and I'm saying it won't reduce or wax and wane with the times But it will never end.

211
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:36,669
Speaker 0: that's that's stupid.

212
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,813
Speaker 0: That's pointless.

213
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,600
Speaker 0: That's like saying yeah, there will always be entropy.

214
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:44,275
Speaker 1: Well, no, but always Scott there always be war in that particular spot.

215
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,640
Speaker 0: There will always be dumbasses.

216
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,706
Speaker 0: You can't eliminate the dumbass.

217
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,696
Speaker 1: I think there will never be peace between Israel and Palestine.

218
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:53,080
Speaker 0: I think there will be relative peace.

219
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:06,739
Speaker 0: I think a Palestinian state two or three generations from the point where that happens just by pulling the rug out from under the semi-legitimacy of the groups that actually try to get people to be suicide bombers that rile the people up.

220
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,700
Speaker 0: if There's if that like core legitimacy of yes, we need our own state is gone.

221
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:15,880
Speaker 0: They can really only tap the craziest people and a few generations out.

222
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,839
Speaker 0: I think the rate of violence will go the same route that the rate of violence in North Ireland did.

223
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,364
Speaker 1: It's incredibly optimistic.

224
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:31,031
Speaker 0: Look I know but again 50 years a lot can happen and I praise Barack Obama For shooting the motherfucking moon.

225
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:31,914
Speaker 1: He didn't shoot the moon yet.

226
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,274
Speaker 1: He's trying to shoot the moon, which is cool I think by saying this is his policy.

227
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:35,899
Speaker 0: He shot the moon.

228
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,120
Speaker 1: You don't know you actually have to shoot the moon.

229
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:42,479
Speaker 1: I could try to shoot the moon all I want but as soon as you take the Queen that's it.

230
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,680
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is there's nothing the US can do other than you know.

231
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,245
Speaker 0: I guess if you cut all our aid to Israel we could force them to pull back to those I know I'm not saying it's a bad move.

232
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:52,028
Speaker 1: It's actually.

233
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,252
Speaker 0: that's not shooting the moon.

234
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:55,378
Speaker 0: That's that's going all in.

235
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:55,880
Speaker 0: and Euchre.

236
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,245
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's a bad move.

237
00:14:57,325 --> 00:14:57,626
Speaker 1: I'm just.

238
00:14:57,707 --> 00:14:59,494
Speaker 1: I have very little optimism.

239
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:00,517
Speaker 0: That's going alone in Euchre.

240
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,086
Speaker 0: He's not going alone He's just shooting the moon.

241
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,134
Speaker 1: I don't think he's actually gonna.

242
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:03,899
Speaker 1: he's gonna take a heart.

243
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,549
Speaker 1: Ah You're gonna he's gonna.

244
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,016
Speaker 0: ah, you know what I'm gonna make a crazy prediction.

245
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:21,786
Speaker 0: All right, I think there will be a pseudo-palestinian state with some form of legitimized self-rule Within Barack Obama's second term.

246
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,587
Speaker 1: if he has a second term, I guarantee you're also predicting a second term I'll bet you 500 bucks.

247
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:27,431
Speaker 0: He gets a second time.

248
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:30,091
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there'll be a second term also But you're not gonna bet against me.

249
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,084
Speaker 0: I'm 99% You're wrong.

250
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,269
Speaker 0: he's not gonna have a second term.

251
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:35,980
Speaker 0: Oh really because the Raptors this fucking weekend.

252
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:44,339
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I've one other thing I want to talk about because this actually kind of annoyed me.

253
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,819
Speaker 0: It's just a news that I randomly stumbled upon.

254
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:56,266
Speaker 0: United Airlines Apologized to a fat person to everybody everybody because they happen to have two flights flight 175 and flight 93 recently.

255
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,717
Speaker 0: Okay, those happen to be the flight numbers of the flights that went down in the 9/11 attacks.

256
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:15,920
Speaker 0: Okay, so so apparently enough people recognize that and were pissed off about it and had thought that the airline had retired the numbers because apparently Terrorist attacks are the same as hockey where you retire the jersey.

257
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:20,009
Speaker 0: So they apologized and they have now retired.

258
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,740
Speaker 0: those two numbers, okay, and I just find that incredibly stupid.

259
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,546
Speaker 1: Agree that it is incredibly stupid.

260
00:16:25,646 --> 00:16:26,228
Speaker 1: I mean fucking.

261
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:32,449
Speaker 0: I didn't forget that the September 11th attacks happened on September 11th But I had already forgotten the flight numbers.

262
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,234
Speaker 1: and who cares.

263
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,300
Speaker 1: It's just a fucking number.

264
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,847
Speaker 0: The thing is I don't even know who cares.

265
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,580
Speaker 0: It didn't state any particular person was angry.

266
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:44,315
Speaker 1: The news article just said we apologize It was probably the press saw it and the press wanted to make a story.

267
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,459
Speaker 1: a lot of these things are like that.

268
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:45,640
Speaker 1: where?

269
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,562
Speaker 0: Manufacture?

270
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,338
Speaker 0: some outrage like yeah, they may not store.

271
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:52,055
Speaker 0: recently There was a story about a woman who injected Botox in a little daughter's face.

272
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:52,678
Speaker 1: Was that true?

273
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:57,800
Speaker 0: No Well, but it basically it generated so much traffic.

274
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,567
Speaker 0: There's a great industry in manufacturing outrage.

275
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:06,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like we can export it To where we gonna export it to.

276
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,660
Speaker 1: everybody's already has outrage.

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,449
Speaker 0: Scandinavia doesn't have plenty of outrage.

278
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,954
Speaker 0: I don't think they have a go.

279
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,500
Speaker 0: So how many fat?

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,347
Speaker 0: Indignant slow people are there in Scandinavia?

281
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,172
Speaker 1: They've got other kinds of out.

282
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,776
Speaker 0: They do but it's it's cold.

283
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:25,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's enough That's not outrage that's all right, that's something.

284
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,134
Speaker 1: it's just you're so cold.

285
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,859
Speaker 1: You don't look outraged you're just shivering.

286
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:29,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're not gonna make on the inside.

287
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:34,394
Speaker 1: The outrage is like 10x And the beer is also 10x.

288
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,419
Speaker 0: So things of the day This is just a kid's toy.

289
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:51,017
Speaker 0: it all they can say is numbers But in the fashion of everyone awesome.

290
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:55,690
Speaker 0: someone discovered that you can fairly trivially make it say motherfucker fuck and fuck you.

291
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,080
Speaker 1: I wonder if it was designed into the toy or just an accident.

292
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,407
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure 50/50.

293
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:08,710
Speaker 0: It's just an accident But I enjoy any time something like this happens like the guy who realized that Cookie Monster can also sing romp.

294
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,820
Speaker 1: Well, the best is when you get like an eight-year-old.

295
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:21,335
Speaker 1: you sort of knows the bad words and then he discovers it and like nursery School or something in the in the playroom and that is where the awesomeness happens Take away the toy.

296
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,022
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just an innocent toy.

297
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,290
Speaker 0: You didn't know when I was a little kid.

298
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,483
Speaker 0: I was like six and my brother was like three and a half.

299
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,250
Speaker 0: Maybe he was four and he was in the kitchen.

300
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,210
Speaker 0: You know kids just like do stuff.

301
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:40,794
Speaker 0: He was just in the kitchen like on a stool in the kitchen sink Just like doing stuff in the kitchen sink Like he filled it with water and he was doing something whatever kids do And he dropped something.

302
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,439
Speaker 0: and just from the other room.

303
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,164
Speaker 0: We hear this four-year-old boy.

304
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:48,739
Speaker 0: Just yell son of a bitch And it was one of the funniest things I'd ever experienced.

305
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good.

306
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:50,144
Speaker 1: I like that.

307
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:51,348
Speaker 0: So motherfucker.

308
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:51,690
Speaker 0: What do you got?

309
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:57,610
Speaker 1: So, you know an f1 the steering wheels are totally insane, yeah, they got a billion knobblies on him, right?

310
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:06,143
Speaker 1: Well in this video Nico Rosberg who is sort of like I don't think he's actually won anything any championships At least not that I remember.

311
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:15,555
Speaker 1: maybe I'm wrong But I remember that when he was brand new to f1 They were like they were all talking about like oh how great he was and like, you know They're like the testing and such.

312
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:19,570
Speaker 1: like he had he had passed the test like better than any other rookie ever or something like that.

313
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:28,480
Speaker 1: but anyway He in this video he describes what everything on his steering wheel does except there might be something hidden on the back cuz he doesn't Show you the back of the steering wheel.

314
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,728
Speaker 1: So there might be something secret back there.

315
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:36,632
Speaker 1: But at least on the front he tells you what every one of those knobs does and it's so clearly now pretty interesting if I Want to.

316
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:40,369
Speaker 0: I am fully aware of what I need to do to drive an f1 car.

317
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:44,482
Speaker 1: Well, you don't know how to work the pedals Gas and brake clutch.

318
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:47,410
Speaker 1: the clutch is first of all The clutch is on the steering wheel All right.

319
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:52,850
Speaker 1: Second of all this gas brake and then there's a bunch of other levers to adjust other things that you that were in the car.

320
00:19:53,215 --> 00:20:00,280
Speaker 0: so according to Wikipedia the wheels cost about 25,000 pounds and are made of carbon fiber.

321
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,290
Speaker 0: Yep, and it doesn't say anything about the back or a secret.

322
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess you know, they told him not to show anyone the back.

323
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,450
Speaker 0: So I wonder something back there.

324
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you think it's the like the wiring heart.

325
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,510
Speaker 1: I think it is because and you can see the whole back of the steering wheel on television Whenever they're showing the front view of the driver's helmet.

326
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:21,990
Speaker 1: But what you can't see is the part of the steering wheel that actually connects to the steering column.

327
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,218
Speaker 1: That must be where the secret magic is.

328
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,303
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that.

329
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:29,998
Speaker 1: I think either he's got another button Or he could have another button and they're hiding they're cheating.

330
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,410
Speaker 0: or I think there's some sort of maybe the design of the paddle Or something like on the back.

331
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,369
Speaker 0: There's some design and the way he's got the grips that they think is great and they don't want anyone to see it.

332
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:40,467
Speaker 0: Possible?

333
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:43,409
Speaker 0: or Maybe he's just fucking with us.

334
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:44,716
Speaker 1: No, cuz I'm pretty.

335
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,228
Speaker 1: he seemed like he wanted to show it to you, but he was told not to.

336
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:50,869
Speaker 0: yeah Maybe he was told not to just because they're like, hey, let's pretend there's something on the back.

337
00:20:51,111 --> 00:20:52,787
Speaker 1: No, you know, they're always so secret in the f1.

338
00:20:53,113 --> 00:21:01,210
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess the only reason they even showed the front is because it's probably public knowledge anyway And he gets some attention and you can see the whole front no matter where you look.

339
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,218
Speaker 1: I just really can't hide the front of things.

340
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:07,174
Speaker 0: You can hide the back to the day when we finally get f0 I know.

341
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:08,641
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if there's ever f0.

Speaker 0: yeah Get your ass to Mars to Mars Get eats quaid.

388
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:41,038
Speaker 1: so like we said We discovered recently that some of the people in our crew had not seen the movie total recall a very important science fiction action film from the 90s.

389
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:50,268
Speaker 1: so we got it on DVD real cheap at the book off and We finally got around to watching it with those people and now they have seen it But they are not here to comment on it.

390
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,838
Speaker 1: instead We are here to comment on it people who have seen it in our youth.

391
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,483
Speaker 1: yep, and then again.

392
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:59,376
Speaker 0: I had not I'd seen total recall Probably in 1990.

393
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:06,604
Speaker 1: I I saw it in the late mid to mid ish 90s And I saw it again in the late night probably on television theater.

394
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:07,890
Speaker 0: I think we rented.

395
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,438
Speaker 1: I don't think I saw it on the theater.

396
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,650
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we rented it from a video store.

397
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:21,882
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I saw it on a VHS and also on TV with commercials, and then I'm pretty sure I also saw it perhaps Sometime at RIT or maybe during a summer.

398
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:22,405
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

399
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:23,490
Speaker 0: I just it was weird.

400
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:30,967
Speaker 0: It was one of those movies that when I was a kid like I just assumed Everyone had seen it kind of like I don't know Terminator 2.

401
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:36,370
Speaker 1: well there words I knew there were some kids who didn't see it because you know it is pretty gory and also has boobies in it.

402
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,685
Speaker 1: So there were some kids who were not permitted to see it.

403
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,110
Speaker 0: Yeah Or I was going to our at the time it came out when I was a little kid.

404
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,016
Speaker 0: I mean, I saw a Robocop like right away.

405
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:48,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, but I didn't actually like.

406
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:48,950
Speaker 0: I remembered the plot.

407
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:49,918
Speaker 1: I remember the plot.

408
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,249
Speaker 1: I remembered some scenes.

409
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:59,589
Speaker 0: I remembered all the important scenes because the important scenes in total recall are pretty much when he rips that Johnny cab apart Yeah, when he pulls the thing out of his nose.

410
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,770
Speaker 1: I actually forgot about the Johnny cab until I saw it that I remember the job.

411
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:05,149
Speaker 1: When he pulls the thing out of I remember pulling the thing out of it.

412
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, three breasted hooker three breast.

413
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,205
Speaker 1: he can't forget that one.

414
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:09,230
Speaker 0: I forgot the midget hooker.

415
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,395
Speaker 1: I remember the ending.

416
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:17,143
Speaker 1: I remembered all the parts where you know he went into the memory machine And I remembered some of the action scenes.

417
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,390
Speaker 0: got y'all house to Mars.

418
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:22,384
Speaker 1: I actually forgot about the guy in the stomach until I until I saw him.

419
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:24,110
Speaker 1: then I was all right forgotten kawatu.

420
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,716
Speaker 1: I Dennis actually saw kawatu.

421
00:25:25,736 --> 00:25:27,684
Speaker 1: I was like all right kawatu right.

422
00:25:27,945 --> 00:25:34,590
Speaker 0: and I also remembered I remember that the guy was a traitor that none of it actually happened, and it was just a dream and planted into his brain.

423
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,222
Speaker 1: Well, it's sort of like Inception.

424
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:36,383
Speaker 1: right.

425
00:25:36,423 --> 00:25:40,783
Speaker 0: you could go either way Good, but the evidence is overwhelming by the way spoilers.

426
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,590
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen total recall what you want fuck.

427
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:47,924
Speaker 1: so When this is not for people who haven't seen total recall by though.

428
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:58,368
Speaker 0: here's my primary evidence And I don't think I need any other evidence, and I can dismiss the few points of evidence against me By saying that the movie was somewhat poorly constructed.

429
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,755
Speaker 1: all right I'll play a game all right.

430
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:07,388
Speaker 0: one of the only evidence you need is that when he goes in to get his You know his memory he's gonna buy that trip to Mars and put his ass there.

431
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:17,452
Speaker 0: as The tech is taking the little CD looking thing to load up the program He holds the case and he looks at it and it very quietly in the background says huh blue skies on Mars That's a new one.

432
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:18,416
Speaker 0: That's true.

433
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:21,227
Speaker 0: I think that's clinches it all right, so I got.

434
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:22,491
Speaker 1: I got two points All right.

435
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,595
Speaker 1: number one right.

436
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:34,010
Speaker 1: if the whole movie was from the time when he first goes into the machine at recall Yeah, very end of the movie is if that is the memory that is implanted that whole thing right?

437
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:40,022
Speaker 1: then Why would they implant a memory in which he does not end up where he started?

438
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,349
Speaker 1: otherwise it would be inconsistent with ah?

439
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:45,235
Speaker 0: Movie.

440
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,623
Speaker 0: he they just didn't show you the end.

441
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:56,630
Speaker 0: I mean it's it's basically Brazil without that little clip at the end where they're like oh yeah by the way in case you didn't get I mean if they're Selling you vacations the vacations would have to end with you coming back home.

442
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't show that in the movie.

443
00:26:58,556 --> 00:27:05,250
Speaker 1: so somehow you're saying after that the memory continues and somehow He ends up back home with the wife that he killed.

444
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,098
Speaker 0: Yeah He remembers all this.

445
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,930
Speaker 1: he said he remembers killing his wife as part of his vacation.

446
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,116
Speaker 1: What kind of a who sells a vacation like that?

447
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:17,970
Speaker 0: uh clearly this company has some has some Cave Johnson in it.

448
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,899
Speaker 0: I mean who is selling that memory was pretty cave job.

449
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:24,532
Speaker 1: is possible that they sold him a memory that would totally fuck up his Life?

450
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:35,730
Speaker 0: it's also possible that they sell the memory But maybe the way it works is they play it out in his head like a dream with stimuli to imprint it But his conscious brain is reacting.

451
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:40,508
Speaker 0: Maybe but anyway um because he acted like himself just with superpowers.

452
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:40,910
Speaker 1: It's true.

453
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,579
Speaker 1: So here's a second is another isn't?

454
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,470
Speaker 0: so he must just really hate his wife, maybe?

455
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:52,530
Speaker 1: So there's the scene where the wife and the psychologist show up, and they tell him that he's you know in inside of recall.

456
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,263
Speaker 0: That's just a really clever scene that they put in the scenario.

457
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:57,888
Speaker 1: or was it true?

458
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:08,380
Speaker 1: and actually The reason that the dream doesn't the reason that the vacation doesn't match up and bring him back home at the end is Because he really was being lobotomized.

459
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,125
Speaker 1: and there that's the real ending is.

460
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:14,261
Speaker 1: so it was all recalls You're right, but it wasn't that wasn't the dream.

461
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:14,944
Speaker 1: They intended.

462
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:16,530
Speaker 1: You know what I actually got lobotomized.

463
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,449
Speaker 1: I'm going to place like they said and that was real.

464
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:23,084
Speaker 0: I accept your point as an alternate answer because it still proves to me right.

465
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,949
Speaker 0: my core point was not that The whole thing was a dream.

466
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:47,990
Speaker 0: My main argument against is that they show you a couple of scenes where Quaid's not there to see anything But there are many scenes where Quaid is not but at the same time they don't show Quaid knowing about that information and Maybe he just remembers it.

467
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,573
Speaker 0: Maybe that's just.

468
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:51,469
Speaker 0: you know Verhoeven not being the best director in the world.

469
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the goldfish Quaid is never in that office.

470
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, right as far as I can remember.

471
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:58,516
Speaker 0: So yeah that the other thing is.

472
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:06,005
Speaker 1: it went to perfectly of course, I mean he's basically an invincible superhero Yeah, but I mean in terms of you know was the movie good.

473
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:06,910
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty good.

474
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,548
Speaker 1: It's not Terminator 2, but it's like one step under.

475
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:18,216
Speaker 0: well It's a sci-fi part of Terminator 2 I think hold up pretty well one these the action scenes because this is a 90s movie But it's the beginning.

476
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,948
Speaker 0: It's 1990. the action scenes reek of 80s.

477
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:22,314
Speaker 1: Well, they do.

478
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:25,525
Speaker 1: the action scenes do reek of 80s, but they're clearly aid.

479
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:30,822
Speaker 0: it's Arnold with a machine gun going Million bullets, they're really not so bad.

480
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,510
Speaker 1: It's not like they're painful to watch.

481
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:44,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but the problem is that since then we've had such advances in action scene choreography, you know now I know the matrix didn't cause those advances and it was simply stealing from you know, Asian cinema.

482
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:45,913
Speaker 0: But

483
00:29:45,973 --> 00:30:05,130
Speaker 1: the matrix did introduce those advanced fight choreography Techniques to the Western audience and because of that we have you know Western audiences in general have now gotten used to much much higher Expectations of what kind of things you're gonna see in action scenes and that you know causes total recall to be dated in that respect.

484
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,298
Speaker 1: But really it's not.

485
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,010
Speaker 1: it's not like I'm watching the action scenes going.

486
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:09,557
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so bad.

487
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,947
Speaker 1: Like when you look at the CG and Tron now, right?

488
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:18,990
Speaker 1: It's not like that It's just you know And also some of the action scenes with like the drill are pretty cool.

489
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:30,390
Speaker 0: Yeah It is clearly also more 80s than 90s in that the technology of the future apparently is just 80s technology But more of it, I mean, well, that's something that's something that gets right.

490
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:37,080
Speaker 1: So in the beginning of the movie when he's in the apartment with the with the wife They got this incredible flat-screen TV.

491
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,130
Speaker 1: It's like part of the wall and it can actually be three panel.

492
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,672
Speaker 0: How do you know?

493
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:45,129
Speaker 0: it's not just a giant CRT but then the rest of the movie is all CRT's.

494
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,519
Speaker 0: But this is their vision of the future.

495
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,910
Speaker 0: It's like 80s culture extended into the future.

496
00:30:50,414 --> 00:30:53,812
Speaker 0: TVs fucking everywhere and They suck.

497
00:30:54,474 --> 00:31:00,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one has any way to communicate except payphones, but the payphones have TVs in them I know right and it's just.

498
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,761
Speaker 0: everything really looks like the 80s Like it's not like Ferris Bueller, which is set in the 80s.

499
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,568
Speaker 0: It's set in the future, but it looks like the 80s.

500
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,257
Speaker 1: This is the problem.

501
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:14,902
Speaker 1: if you make anything that's set in the past You can't become dated.

502
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:16,550
Speaker 1: It's guaranteed to be timeless.

503
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:19,746
Speaker 1: But if you make anything ever that's set in the future, right?

504
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,681
Speaker 1: It could unless it's like Star Wars.

505
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:27,017
Speaker 1: right Star Wars pulls the ultimate trick Long time ago galaxy far far away.

506
00:31:27,037 --> 00:31:35,916
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't actually think and we oh shit long time ago Star Wars is in the past And that's how right.

507
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:40,919
Speaker 1: and by making it a totally different time and a totally different place They can do whatever the hell they want.

508
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,109
Speaker 1: But because total recall is earth This earth in the future.

509
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:49,570
Speaker 1: Pretty much you're going to be dated at some point no matter what year you said it at.

510
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,842
Speaker 1: I mean how many animes are set in 20x DX and shit?

511
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:53,404
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

512
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:54,508
Speaker 1: It's actually now it's 20x DX.

513
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,529
Speaker 0: We fucked well, I mean October in.

514
00:31:57,553 --> 00:31:59,581
Speaker 0: That was the end day.

515
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:00,825
Speaker 1: No, not the Saturday.

516
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:04,210
Speaker 0: I was at a football game But this Saturday isn't the end day.

517
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,298
Speaker 0: That was a better end day.

518
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:07,442
Speaker 0: It was all you can't.

519
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:14,610
Speaker 1: you can't make any work of art You can't tell any story about the future of Earth without being dated unless it's near future.

520
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:19,749
Speaker 1: It's not possible because you can't get it exactly right, but at the same time you can do it.

521
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:26,271
Speaker 1: Well, you can look at Minority Report, which actually people, you know is the movie that people are always like, oh, yeah It gets.

522
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,361
Speaker 1: you know, it's like Minority Report, right?

523
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,170
Speaker 0: Well, here's one way to look at it.

524
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,150
Speaker 0: Look at a movie like Ferris Bueller where it's set in the 80s and it works.

525
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:46,070
Speaker 0: Look at a movie like Terminator 2 where while it's got a lot of futuristic stuff It uses like good techniques from its era so that it doesn't like it doesn't use crappy 90s soundtrack.

526
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:49,280
Speaker 1: Well, I think what Terminator 2's advantage right?

527
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,097
Speaker 1: Is that the future of Terminator 2 is the post-apocalyptic Fantasy future.

528
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:56,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though it's sci-fi because it's robots and machines.

529
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:04,940
Speaker 0: Compare all the movies from the era of Terminator 2. a lot of them have Crappy, you know late 80s early 90s synth soundtracks.

530
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,270
Speaker 0: That's true pop songs that really stand out.

531
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:14,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the worst thing to do that but Terminator 2 orchestral sound has one of the better soundtracks in the history of movies.

532
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,134
Speaker 1: That's true.

533
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,727
Speaker 0: I mean how many people?

534
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:32,010
Speaker 1: just Yeah, that's why I'm a big fan of pretty much everything Either using you know, I really don't like it when people use, you know, like actual songs like from radio.

535
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:34,116
Speaker 0: No, here's my third thing.

536
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:37,210
Speaker 0: Remember I watched the the Lost Boys recently because Emily never seen it.

537
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:39,498
Speaker 0: It's a great vampire movie from the 80s.

538
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,589
Speaker 0: Yeah 90s Corey Haim Corey Feldman all those guys.

539
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:50,361
Speaker 0: Yep, and it is set in that time and it plays all songs from that time like Saxophone.

540
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:54,030
Speaker 1: I Was about to say if you're making a Vietnam movie, right?

541
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,490
Speaker 1: You always got to use those same songs.

542
00:33:56,812 --> 00:34:02,470
Speaker 1: I like give me shelter by the stones and all the same songs You got to do if you're doing a Vietnam movie.

543
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,349
Speaker 0: I don't do that.

544
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,971
Speaker 0: If you just make if it happens to be that year and you're making a movie that's set at some generic time Yeah You can't.

545
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:15,601
Speaker 1: I'm talking about when somebody makes a movie and because the movie happened to be made in 2006 they use in the movie.

546
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:19,097
Speaker 1: the soundtrack is the hit songs of 2006. that is.

547
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:22,210
Speaker 1: the problem is when you just use the hit songs of the day.

548
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,587
Speaker 1: The movie was released as promotional things as opposed to picking songs that fit the movie.

549
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:38,255
Speaker 1: and I still prefer original score orchestral if possible right or musical like ponies or broadish or show tunes to Using hit songs.

550
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:43,469
Speaker 1: because then you're the reason I prefer that is because a most of the great movies do that.

551
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:47,547
Speaker 1: It's just like a. you know, there's a there's a correlation there and two.

552
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:49,654
Speaker 1: It makes more music.

553
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:50,777
Speaker 1: You're making new music.

554
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,730
Speaker 1: You're creating more art as opposed to you know, you're actually making less art.

555
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,793
Speaker 0: What about a movie?

556
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:01,646
Speaker 0: That's like a mat cross kind of thing where it makes a new hit song that happens to also be a hit song.

557
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:03,340
Speaker 1: That's fine.

558
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, Matt cross You did both orchestral sort of rock and show tunes for itself that were originally new.

559
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,603
Speaker 1: They created new music for the new show.

560
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,440
Speaker 1: as opposed to you know It's like you're there's more art created in the world.

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,702
Speaker 1: if you decide to spend money to record new music It is if you just use existing music, you're actually making less stuff.

562
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,167
Speaker 1: That's the main thing.

563
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:24,190
Speaker 0: So here's something weird.

564
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,015
Speaker 0: I noticed that I never noticed before.

565
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:30,388
Speaker 0: Benny the cab driver the assholes also a mutant.

566
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:42,270
Speaker 0: Yep They foreshadow the fact that he was gonna die by a drill and pilot a drill Like crazily Every time you like you see him like he's driving or something.

567
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:49,947
Speaker 0: There are three scenes in the movie well before he drives the drill and tries to kill them and then gets drilled Where you see him and then you immediately see one of those drills.

568
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:54,222
Speaker 0: Yep They do that three times like they're being like hey, he's gonna get drilled.

569
00:35:54,624 --> 00:36:03,003
Speaker 0: and apparently the movie was originally rated X. Yep, they had to cut several Ultraviolet sections of existing scenes to get the movie to our.

570
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,830
Speaker 1: one of them was thing is if that movie.

571
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:09,896
Speaker 1: Here's the thing if they had the original cut of the movie the one that was originally rated X Yeah that came out today.

572
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:13,010
Speaker 1: It would not be rated X. Nope and the same thing with Hellraiser, right?

573
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,901
Speaker 1: These were not porn.

574
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:26,689
Speaker 1: nowadays you have to be a hardcore porn to be rated X or I guess maybe something like each of the killer might be if they Bothered to rate it, but I mean, you know, the original cut of Total Recall would no way be rated X.

575
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,619
Speaker 0: today Really X doesn't do.

576
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:30,464
Speaker 0: it have to be MD.

577
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:38,830
Speaker 0: MD They Show you what happened to Benny instead of just kind of implying what happened to Benny.

578
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,451
Speaker 0: Yeah and they also the scene where he I Love.

579
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:48,230
Speaker 0: when Arnold is in a movie and in the end the thing that saves him is the fact that he's just Arnold.

580
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:55,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean in the end Things often stabs the one scientist in the neck.

581
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,710
Speaker 1: that's yeah, that's what you see in an Arnold movie.

582
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,230
Speaker 0: Apparently they cut out a lot of him stabbing other scientists in that scene.

583
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,157
Speaker 1: It's actually, you know surprising though.

584
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:16,344
Speaker 1: You go to look at Arnold's movies Terminator 2 Total Recall Predator and Running Man and you know these kinds of movies and it's like it's kind of surprising how a lot of the other Action movie stars, you know

585
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:16,525
Speaker 0: Stallone

586
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of them pretty

587
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:19,640
Speaker 0: much Tom Selleck

588
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,650
Speaker 1: just did boring action.

589
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,821
Speaker 1: But you know Arnold did a lot.

590
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,570
Speaker 1: you mean Arnold did his share of boring action.

591
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,361
Speaker 1: I mean a race, you know, he's got bad movies eraser crap, right?

592
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:36,523
Speaker 1: But I like last action hero, though It's okay, but okay The point is is that he did a lot of movies that actually had a plot.

593
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:38,950
Speaker 1: That was a pretty good sci-fi plot.

594
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Total Recall is based somewhat loosely on a Philip K dick dick story and it's a pretty good sci-fi.

595
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,762
Speaker 0: Just they threw in a lot of Arnold.

596
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, you know It's a it's a two-for-one deal.

597
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:58,370
Speaker 0: Also because I haven't seen an Arnold movie in a while Motherfucker makes some great faces sometimes.

598
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:04,530
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's not like he's not playing a character he's playing Arnold playing a character, right?

599
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,274
Speaker 1: But it's you know, it's.

600
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,260
Speaker 1: everyone had.

601
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,850
Speaker 1: it gets a start for a reason, right?

602
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,512
Speaker 1: Even people.

603
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:12,390
Speaker 1: you might you know, you look at famous people, right and it's like how did you know?

604
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,057
Speaker 1: This person isn't talented or they suck.

605
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:14,579
Speaker 1: I hate them.

606
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:16,930
Speaker 1: But the fact is they got to start somewhere, right?

607
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,033
Speaker 1: They didn't start out famous.

608
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,770
Speaker 1: They had some sort of talent or something that got them off on the right foot somewhere.

609
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,970
Speaker 1: It might have just been something shallow like good looks or an Arnold's case.

610
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,190
Speaker 1: He was like, you know ultra muscly because he was a bodybuilder or whatever.

611
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,095
Speaker 1: But he had to have some acting skills what you know in order to get into movies they just wouldn't have.

612
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:41,382
Speaker 1: you know, if he didn't sell tickets and Wasn't able to act directors wouldn't want him.

613
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:48,908
Speaker 0: You know, he had something going on Whoa, so supposedly in the early like when they were trying to get this movie made Philip K dick was still alive.

614
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:51,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, and They went through.

615
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,770
Speaker 0: they thought about getting Richard Dreyfuss or Patrick Swayze to play Quaid.

616
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:59,976
Speaker 1: Okay, that would have been a very different movie totally different movie Not even close to the same movie.

617
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:00,578
Speaker 0: You know what though?

618
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:07,170
Speaker 0: I think Stallone could have maybe pulled it off Tom Selleck would have pulled it off just fine.

619
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:16,881
Speaker 1: I think Bruce Willis Bruce Willis might have made this one of the best movies that he's the breeze pretty much the other guy who does action movies that Are also have some intelligent sci-fi thing.

620
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:21,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he also nearly sci-fi A lot of his action movies.

621
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:22,441
Speaker 0: He's Bruce Willis.

622
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:22,983
Speaker 0: That's right.

623
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:25,250
Speaker 0: And I love Bruce Willis and I love Arnold.

624
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, not Arnold but Arnold.

625
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:35,289
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know in in related news I also wanted to watch this movie because there's actually a total recall comic book coming out.

626
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,404
Speaker 1: Oh I ordered the first issue just because curious.

627
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:39,690
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's gonna be good.

628
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:49,925
Speaker 1: I actually doubt it will be good, but I actually saw the cover To the second issue because I they sent me the evil catalog I hate for free and the second issue has aliens on the cover.

629
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,278
Speaker 1: So I guess We're gonna find out right.

630
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,170
Speaker 1: I guess if you're if you're right or not.

631
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,370
Speaker 1: It goes this comic is canon and it picks up where the movie left off.

632
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,670
Speaker 0: Well, well, apparently there's a script for total recall - that was never made.

633
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:02,996
Speaker 1: There's a script for every.

634
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:08,941
Speaker 0: no, so, you know what is based on minority report And it picks up right after where Quaid is still Quaid.

635
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:09,643
Speaker 1: Well, there you go.

636
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:11,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, how about that?

637
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:13,075
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean that's another thing.

638
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:23,030
Speaker 1: right is if you go with my theory that he was really lobotomized And that means he's probably a vegetable but he's probably Dreaming this vacation until the day his vegetable body dies.

639
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:31,629
Speaker 1: so it could just be that you know that continue any continuation you come up with is all in his brain and It's part of his infinite vacation until he his body runs out.

640
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,682
Speaker 1: You know though I would say and since he's got a pretty muscly body It's gonna be a while if you've never seen total recall.

641
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,270
Speaker 1: Why did you listen this far?

642
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,719
Speaker 0: I highly recommend seeing it because it is a very enjoyable movie.

643
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:51,347
Speaker 0: It's definitely iconic of 90s action movies like basically Until the matrix all good action movies were kind of like this.

644
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:59,010
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm a matrix like above Terminator 2 just because and I put total recall one step lower than that.

645
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,760
Speaker 0: Well because Terminator 2 all did the same thing.

646
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,586
Speaker 0: the matrix did like movies were action.

647
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:04,530
Speaker 0: movies were a certain way.

648
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:06,739
Speaker 0: Terminator 1 was just another action movie.

649
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,430
Speaker 0: Terminator 2 happened and the entire world went whoa.

650
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:11,821
Speaker 0: And then movies changed forever.

651
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,950
Speaker 1: We need a new we need a neck.

652
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:14,754
Speaker 0: Terminator 2 did that.

653
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:15,878
Speaker 0: the matrix did that.

654
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,082
Speaker 0: Star Wars did that.

655
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:17,764
Speaker 1: we need one.

656
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:19,690
Speaker 1: we need something to break us out.

657
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,830
Speaker 1: Did you know that there are more movie sequels this summer than ever ever in history randomly?

658
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:27,989
Speaker 1: There's 20. there are 27 sequels coming out this year.

659
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,430
Speaker 1: I had to clean up living need something like Star Wars Terminator 2 or the matrix to break something a blockbuster.

660
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,599
Speaker 1: I mean we can make all the great art films we want.

661
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,490
Speaker 1: there are plenty of them, but they're not gonna change Hollywood.

662
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:50,570
Speaker 1: We need something big like matrix Star Wars Terminator 2 - I have Hollywood has gold member Buster a few days ago while I was gold member the Austin Powers one yeah, not as funny as the first.

663
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:52,660
Speaker 0: You know what not even funny at all.

664
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a terrible movie.

665
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:58,999
Speaker 1: I I still like the first one I like the first one is the second one.

666
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:05,005
Speaker 1: the girl is way hot like the hottest But the third one has the hottest girl, but the I think the second one.

667
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,539
Speaker 1: the second one has the hottest girl Foxy 70s.

668
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:11,358
Speaker 1: oh, yeah And the first they've got.

669
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:14,855
Speaker 1: not that the girl in the first movie isn't incredibly hot either It's just the second movie.

670
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:16,280
Speaker 1: one is tiny bit hotter.

671
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,541
Speaker 0: No.

672
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:17,967
Speaker 0: There's no anapuma.

673
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:18,830
Speaker 1: No there's.

674
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:21,917
Speaker 1: We're getting off topic.

675
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:35,429
Speaker 0: yeah, I think we're running out of steam here, I mean I Think that total recall is a fine movie and the sci-fi angle is good, but if you want an Arnold action movie I think running man is a better Arnold movie.

676
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:39,544
Speaker 1: I would put my if I had to rank are not a better movie.

677
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:40,990
Speaker 0: It's a better Arnold movie.

678
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,181
Speaker 1: I think predator is better.

679
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,730
Speaker 0: Oh predator is better as well.

680
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,959
Speaker 0: I haven't seen predator up ready since I was a little kid.

681
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,025
Speaker 0: really I haven't seen.

682
00:42:51,426 --> 00:43:02,890
Speaker 1: I mean when I had this um In high school I took a sci-fi class But it ended up being filled with like a bunch of these sort of funny Frat drunk you guys and all they wanted to do is watch predators every day in class.

683
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,550
Speaker 1: They'd be like the predator and then on the last day of class the teacher was cool, and we watch predator.

684
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,570
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
