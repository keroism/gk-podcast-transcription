00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:32,481
Speaker 0: I love about living in New York.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,030
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of reasons to like it.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,570
Speaker 0: I mean I went to a place called milk and honey and got a really good bagel this morning.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,542
Speaker 1: But if it was called milk and honey, why did they have bagel?

11
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:42,430
Speaker 1: shouldn't they have had milk and honey?

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:42,932
Speaker 0: You know what?

13
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:48,728
Speaker 1: there was neither milk nor honey there what but they had bagels But you couldn't buy milk to wash down your bag.

14
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,550
Speaker 1: No Well, the thing is that or did you get your bagel flavored by honey?

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,328
Speaker 0: They're super kosher and there's even a sign like they won't let you bring in any other food in there.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:56,428
Speaker 1: Okay?

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,773
Speaker 1: It's one of those you places.

18
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,685
Speaker 0: All right, and it was a really good bagels, but I couldn't get any milk.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,095
Speaker 1: Oh They probably had some meats there.

20
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,148
Speaker 0: Yes, they had locks and locks doesn't count.

21
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:06,510
Speaker 1: It's fish.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,122
Speaker 0: They also had kosher sushi and they had much other stuff.

23
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:11,668
Speaker 1: Anyway, fish doesn't count.

24
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:12,330
Speaker 0: What about mermaid?

25
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,501
Speaker 0: What what about mermaid?

26
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,364
Speaker 1: I Think because mermaid doesn't exist.

27
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:28,669
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter But if mermaid did exist I'm sure you could go to a rabbi and ask him and I'm pretty sure he might tell you that the bottom half is Okay, and the top half is not okay to eat.

28
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:37,907
Speaker 0: But uh, what I really like is that you know, I lived in Michigan and my commute I guess to high school would be interrupted by occasionally a car accident.

29
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:42,227
Speaker 0: Maybe a deer Maybe a prayer for pretty much a lot of people.

30
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:56,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, but living here, my commute is being interrupted by the UN General Assembly and motorcades and armed guards and diplomats and bodyguards and Funny people wearing funny outfits from funny countries talking to each other in funny languages.

31
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:57,393
Speaker 1: I love those.

32
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:04,664
Speaker 0: those are the best and they always look so happy like every diplomat I've seen For the entire week has looked really really happy.

Speaker 1: Why don't they boat in?

73
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,473

80
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:03,548
Speaker 1: Pete I don't talk about the specifics of my job too much on the show but You know, our company was somewhat recently acquired by another company, but it wasn't like haha.

00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,726
Speaker 1: My company was owned by four partners.

84
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,910
Speaker 1: I assume they were equal partners.

85
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,392
Speaker 1: I don't know.

86
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,077

Speaker 1: I just code there and they sold the company to this other company.

88
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,530
Speaker 1: So now they're just managers and now the new company is the bosses, right?

89
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:26,134
Speaker 1: Okay, big deal didn't really change my job that much except for Something that happened today.

90
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:31,370
Speaker 1: You see we used to just you know, and he wanted to buy things specifically in tech, right?

91
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,030
Speaker 1: We had a tech budget and we spent the tech budget, right?

92
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,499
Speaker 1: We would buy a server when he wanted.

93
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,130
Speaker 1: you'd buy something else you want, right?

94
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,950
Speaker 1: And we would always get exactly what we asked for one of the new dev server.

95
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,188
Speaker 1: We got this Dell like one you rack mount Dealey with like, you know, two CPUs in there.

103
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,270
Speaker 1: They didn't really give us a tech budget.

104
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,660
Speaker 1: They just said when you want to buy something tell us and we'll get it for you.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,750
Speaker 1: Okay, so my boss, right?

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,172
Speaker 1: Go it.

107
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:09,270
Speaker 1: He went down to you know, the North Carolina where the where the new companies are and Well, there are new owners are anyway.

108
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,521
Speaker 1: And he saw that all the people there all the tech people had tons of monitors.

109
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,672
Speaker 1: one guy had three monitors stacked vertically on Each other.

110
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:21,070
Speaker 1: other people had like, you know big stretches out right and he's sitting there in his office, right?

111
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,195
Speaker 1: Basically, he's now head of tech in New York.

112
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,063
Speaker 1: He's got a 24 inch Dell ultra sharp.

113
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:26,444
Speaker 1: Not bad.

114
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,567
Speaker 1: Not bad, right.

115
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:43,423
Speaker 1: and also In addition to that I have this really I don't like it 22 inch Samsung Which is the same resolution as my 20 inch Dell and I would much rather either have you know B20 injured the same resolution or a 24 inch of the bigger resolution.

116
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,370
Speaker 0: Actually, I would just prefer not a Samsung.

117
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,268
Speaker 0: I don't like their screens.

118
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:51,882
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is Samsung looks like I like their HDTVs a lot But I don't like their monitors.

119
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:53,370
Speaker 0: the monitors their new monitors.

120
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:57,089
Speaker 1: Their monitors used to be awesome when I bought those 17 inch Samsung's back in the day.

121
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,992
Speaker 1: Yeah hot but nowadays poop I just.

122
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,870
Speaker 0: basically they're too glossy and like they look they look cheap.

123
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:10,690
Speaker 0: One of the more noisy really now It's all the ones we have at work like they're glossy and they have this really cheap glossy plastic rim around him, right?

124
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,670
Speaker 1: So my boss has this plan, right?

125
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,650
Speaker 1: I wanted a new monitor because the color on the Samsung's fucked up anyway, and it was actually hindering some web work.

126
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:28,750
Speaker 1: you know, I was seeing the wrong colors and whatnot and He wanted you know to sort of get you know Felt like he was getting played out because the people in North Carolina had better displays than needed.

127
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:31,946
Speaker 1: So and for other reasons, you know, he needs the way he works.

128
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:36,190
Speaker 1: He has windows He just opens his taskbar is basically loaded with way too much shit.

129
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,859
Speaker 1: He just leaves everything open all the time and a million windows.

130
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,050
Speaker 1: So he really needed another monitor anyway for the way he works.

131
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:43,723
Speaker 1: I don't cuz I have virtual desktops.

132
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:55,550
Speaker 1: So He ordered two 24 inch Dells, right and then he was gonna give his current 24 inch Dell Which is the previous model to me, right and then everything will be all cool.

133
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,585
Speaker 1: Someone else who didn't care could take my 22 inch Samsung who wasn't a tech person.

134
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,649
Speaker 1: They would be more than happy with it.

135
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,161
Speaker 1: So he orders the 220 inch 22 inch Dells.

136
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:09,970
Speaker 1: and You know the I the one system in guy in New York sends a letter to North Carolina.

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,320
Speaker 1: So they can order it and have it sent here and today to Dell.

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,630
Speaker 1: boxes arrived obviously containing 24 inch monitors.

139
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:22,140
Speaker 1: Right, he opens one up He sets it up You know and he had a problem because they were all.

140
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,204
Speaker 1: he was dumb and he didn't.

141
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:29,150
Speaker 1: his computer didn't support didn't have two DVI outs and he bought the wrong video card and whatever and I could have done better job with that.

142
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:42,544
Speaker 1: but you know, I sorted that out, but we noticed that this Dell monitor that showed up didn't have that the memory card slots on the side and Wait a minute, and that sounds like it's not an ultra sharp and the screen.

143
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:43,870
Speaker 1: you couldn't move it up and down.

144
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,768
Speaker 1: All you could do is tilt it.

145
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,364
Speaker 0: I'm moving my screen up and down to right and it didn't swivel left and right.

146
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,555
Speaker 1: you had to just move it to the left Into the right.

147
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,209
Speaker 0: you didn't get an ultra sharp.

148
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:55,370
Speaker 1: Well, we go and we're like, wait a minute, right?

149
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,947
Speaker 1: So after a few minutes of confusion and whatever, you know first we're just like, I don't know.

150
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,791
Speaker 1: maybe you know That's that's it I don't know.

151
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:08,295
Speaker 1: after some look I go to the Dell website and I see and I realize aha That is not the ultra sharp.

152
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,562
Speaker 1: That is the non ultra sharp.

153
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:18,648
Speaker 1: That is what has happened here and he's like Shit, I you know and I look the price of the ultra sharp is like 600 something dollars to the 24 inch.

154
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,784
Speaker 1: But the non ultra sharp is like 300 something and that's the retail price.

155
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,189
Speaker 1: So we paid less than that.

156
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,670
Speaker 1: So we go and we're like did we order the wrong one?

157
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:38,809
Speaker 1: Let's check and we go and we look at the email that was sent to North Carolina and it says ultra sharp very specifically Which means North Carolina changed the order on us.

158
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:40,734
Speaker 0: Did that did you?

159
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:41,738
Speaker 0: did you call him on it?

160
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,927
Speaker 1: Did you say hey, they're calling him on it.

161
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:44,650
Speaker 1: That's not my job.

162
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,036
Speaker 1: I didn't order the monitors.

163
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,629
Speaker 1: The point is let this be a lesson to everyone out there.

164
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:59,748
Speaker 1: You might think that selling your company is great because you get a pile of money But don't do it cuz they'll stiff you on the monitors And that's totally not worth it.

165
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:01,859
Speaker 1: He was really pissed cuz.

166
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,044
Speaker 1: a minute, you know, I think of it.

167
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:11,030
Speaker 1: you'd be pissed too if you were like You know, you're in charge of this company Basically, then you sell it to someone and then and now they stiff you on the monitor.

168
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:19,150
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, you know at what my argument if I were North Carolina would be Can you articulate to me why you need the much more expensive ultra sharp?

169
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:22,240
Speaker 0: For any reason other than personal comfort and enjoyment?

170
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,109
Speaker 0: it would be easier, right if swivel it you can.

171
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:35,310
Speaker 1: Developers and the other tech people in North Carolina didn't have amazing monitor setups to you know Which we could point at but they had normal monitors down there.

172
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,399
Speaker 1: We could point we couldn't point at them, but now we can.

173
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:38,745
Speaker 0: but why do you?

174
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:39,790
Speaker 0: why should you have the same thing?

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,136
Speaker 0: There's no business reason if you know.

176
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:47,262
Speaker 1: if you see how my boss works, you know that he needs that Plus, you know, he refused, you know, we're like that.

177
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:47,966
Speaker 1: we're tech people.

178
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:50,418
Speaker 1: We're very particular For the normal people.

179
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,949
Speaker 1: they got no reason for the tech people.

180
00:10:53,352 --> 00:11:03,086
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know, it's Thursday and we'd said a long time ago we'd slowly start changing up the format of Thursday because What I'm gonna talk about might seem like it's the thing today, but I'll get to why.

181
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:03,970
Speaker 0: it's news now.

182
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,094
Speaker 0: I've talked about this man.

183
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:05,938
Speaker 0: There's legend.

184
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:12,216
Speaker 0: I thought you did this thing in there this legend among men Boring news first.

185
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:16,300
Speaker 0: I've talked about him kind of often on the show a long time ago But I hadn't talked about him in a long time.

186
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,145
Speaker 0: I kind of forgot.

187
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:17,669
Speaker 0: We forgot it.

188
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:19,341
Speaker 1: I never forgot the guy.

189
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,490
Speaker 1: I forgot his name.

190
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,233
Speaker 0: I just didn't.

191
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:25,150
Speaker 0: I stopped thinking about him because he wasn't on FARC all the time anymore.

192
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,454
Speaker 0: And you know, he kind of faded from the limelight, but just recently, you know Scott asked me Hey, what was that guy's name?

193
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:38,359
Speaker 0: And sure enough acid every once in a while, but he asked recently and then sure enough Henry Earl appeared in the news again.

194
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,614
Speaker 1: now Henry Earl my here one of my heroes not my top hero But he's on the hero list.

195
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:46,810
Speaker 0: I can say that I know the story of Henry Earl to heart.

196
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,734
Speaker 0: I know this man's ins and outs Familiar with Henry Earl.

197
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:55,148
Speaker 0: I am in fact because you see I've been really got intimate with Henry Earl for a long time.

198
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:07,850
Speaker 0: However I'm just going to read to you the Wikipedia about Henry Earl because the whole thing it's not that long But the way it is phrased I find it somewhat hilarious.

199
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:15,090
Speaker 0: Henry Earl born October 24th, 1949 is a homeless man from Lexington, Kentucky.

200
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,310
Speaker 1: I thought he had a home famous for his extensive police record.

201
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 0: Nearly all of his arrests have been for public intoxication With a few charges of disorderly conduct third-degree trespassing Second-degree trespassing and at least one count of begging.

202
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:41,630
Speaker 0: the fire Website showing Earl's arrest record from 1992 to present indicates that he's not been arrested for any theft or violent offenses.

203
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,790
Speaker 0: So he pretty much is only ever arrested for public intoxication.

204
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,364
Speaker 1: You don't have to be afraid of Henry Earl.

205
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:53,917
Speaker 1: if you meet this guy You should totally hang out with him be like whoo get him drunk And then he'll spend a night in jail.

206
00:12:53,997 --> 00:13:01,810
Speaker 0: and there's in fact a problem in the area where he is Frequent to be frequently attends where college kids will spend their spring break.

207
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,090
Speaker 0: They will actually go to Lexington, Kentucky and find him.

208
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,410
Speaker 0: He's not difficult to find and take him around drinking.

209
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:24,911
Speaker 0: That is a common spring break trip, in fact, there have been stories on multiple groups of students from multiple schools Simultaneously each trying to bribe him to follow them around instead of the other group with increasing amounts of alcohol Times.

210
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:32,250
Speaker 0: Henry's rise to fame was in large part because of the Fayette County Jail at a public website Which listed a person's arrest record and mug shots?

211
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:39,010
Speaker 0: Henry had an extensive record and a wide range of emotions expressed in the mug shots from despondent to happy.

212
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,710
Speaker 0: The page was linked to regularly by internet news blog FARC calm.

213
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:48,549
Speaker 0: The new website eventually had to be shut down due to the strain that was being placed upon it.

214
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:54,630
Speaker 0: Henry's made numerous talk show appearances has been featured in national and international media venues.

215
00:13:56,334 --> 00:14:07,669
Speaker 0: Really I want to see that on November 16th 2005 it was reported that a 55 year old black man had died in police custody in Fayette County prompting speculation the Henry Earl had in fact died.

216
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:12,358
Speaker 0: The man turned out to be Donald Ross another man.

217
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,883
Speaker 0: It was not Henry Earl.

218
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:17,058
Speaker 0: people, you know, breathe breathe the sigh of relief In 2006.

219
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,989
Speaker 1: sigh of relief because someone died.

220
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:21,784
Speaker 0: Well, because it wasn't Henry Earl who does.

221
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:22,910
Speaker 1: I loved Henry Earl Moore?

222
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:31,119
Speaker 0: Yes, because Donald Ross you see it also been arrested for third-degree assault Has never hurt anyone but himself.

223
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,143
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay.

224
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:33,108
Speaker 1: I guess kinda.

225
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:41,349
Speaker 0: in 2006 Henry Earl sobered up with his number of offenses a number of days spent in jail overwhelmingly lower than previous years.

226
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,578
Speaker 0: Fortunately, he returned to his old ways in 2007.

227
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,529
Speaker 1: No, that's that's simultaneously sad and awesome.

228
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:54,240
Speaker 0: now the thing is Henry Earl is kind of a folk hero and He got enough folk heroes.

229
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,484
Speaker 0: He exemplifies a A Idiom of life that I agree with in one regard.

230
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,850
Speaker 1: He's a modern Johnny Appleseed.

231
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:09,290
Speaker 0: If you're gonna do something be the best damn doer of that thing that they can possibly be.

232
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about it.

233
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:10,636
Speaker 1: right?

234
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:19,488
Speaker 1: if you're like a meth addict, that's pretty sad But if you're an epic mecha meth addict, at least there's in the horribleness of your existence.

235
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,750
Speaker 1: There is some like silver lining on your cloud.

236
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,190
Speaker 0: It could be a cautionary tale.

237
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:25,733
Speaker 0: It's hard.

238
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:28,249
Speaker 1: because of being a meth addict that cloud is real dark.

239
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:33,290
Speaker 1: But if you're being a drunken hobo The cloud is a lot less dark than meth addict.

240
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:44,409
Speaker 0: basically If you can make the best of a bad situation or in the very least if your life can serve as a warning to others Then you have in some small way mitigated the misery that otherwise was your life.

241
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,016
Speaker 1: And I mean that guy.

242
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:51,826
Speaker 1: I mean think about all the hobos who just get drunk in a dark alley Wasting their lives away with no recognition, right?

243
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:58,550
Speaker 1: They're just sad and no one learns from them and they don't learn from anyone and their existences are just terrible.

244
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:04,870
Speaker 0: Henry Earl is internationally famous and people fly to his hometown to find him and buy him drinks.

245
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:08,909
Speaker 0: Now the reason Henry Earl comes up is he was in the news recently.

246
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:15,265
Speaker 0: Basically a bunch of news media had reported that Henry Earl had achieved a milestone in his life.

247
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:20,390
Speaker 0: He had been arrested for his 1,000th public intoxication incidents.

248
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:25,713
Speaker 1: That's is that more arrest than anyone ever I Don't know.

249
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:34,190
Speaker 0: what I do know is that this was patently untrue Because the people reporting were digging up a story and they basically didn't do all their research.

250
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:42,113
Speaker 0: In fact, Henry Earl had reached that milestone long ago Has been arrested 1,333 times to date.

251
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:48,035
Speaker 0: Oh, man, he should stop at 1,337.

252
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:51,490
Speaker 0: I'm going to say this this is another quote from that Wikipedia.

253
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,115
Speaker 1: Let's get arrested four more times and then go sober for real.

254
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,657
Speaker 0: I point out that in Wikipedia.

255
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,260
Speaker 0: This is the first citation.

256
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:11,829
Speaker 0: in 2008 Earl was arrested for the 1,000th time since 1992. the judge sentenced him to 1,000 days in jail saying that the sentence was quote only fair.

257
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:15,887
Speaker 1: That judge is an awesome judge at that time.

258
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:25,069
Speaker 0: yet In fact when arrested one thousand three hundred and thirty three times since his first arrest in July of 1970, man They should send some just one night in jail for every friggin thing.

259
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,672
Speaker 1: Why why?

260
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,882
Speaker 1: why this thousand days keeping them off the liquor?

261
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,328
Speaker 0: maybe trying to help him?

262
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:29,870
Speaker 0: I don't know.

263
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:38,698
Speaker 0: So I would like to point out that if you wish to follow Henry Earl, there's in fact an RSS feed and The page you want to go to is called.

264
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,024
Speaker 1: Is there a Firefox extension?

265
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:40,586
Speaker 1: Yes you.

266
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:46,670
Speaker 0: whether he's in or out of jail It's much like the a pagoda Firefox extension that tells you whether or not a pagoda is alive.

267
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:48,950
Speaker 0: There is the Henry Earl Firefox extension.

268
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,635
Speaker 0: At least there was.

269
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:52,392
Speaker 0: I don't know if it still exists or if it works in Firefox 3.

270
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:55,390
Speaker 0: That tells you if he is in jail or not in jail.

271
00:17:56,093 --> 00:18:06,229
Speaker 0: But if you go to what's up with Henry Earl, which I will link to Every time you go there's a random mugshot of Henry Earl and let me tell you he's smiling in the vast majority of them.

272
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:10,990
Speaker 1: Even though he's a sad story there's something to like about Henry.

273
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:19,916
Speaker 1: You in a way you should be Henry Earl, you know, whatever your lot in life is You should you should go full out.

274
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:25,041
Speaker 1: But in a way you shouldn't be Henry or you should not be Henry Earl homeless and drunken.

275
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:32,693
Speaker 0: I Can say one thing though Henry Earl has not harmed anyone but himself and that's more than you can say for a lot of other People out there.

276
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:33,437
Speaker 1: that is true.

277
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,949
Speaker 1: In fact, Henry Earl has helped many other than himself mostly front behind.

278
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:42,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that was my exciting and interesting Thursday bit.

279
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:48,050
Speaker 1: Why you gotta be using cool things of the day like Henry Earl right before my completely boring and everyday news?

280
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,455
Speaker 0: Well, you see what.

281
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:51,201
Speaker 0: there are things I could have talked about.

282
00:18:51,321 --> 00:19:12,190
Speaker 0: I really want to talk about the business with Obama calling McCain and being like yo, let's do something about this economic disaster and McCain saying, okay I'll call you back and then immediately hosting a press conference asking Obama to do something Great and then, you know trying to cancel the debate or I could talk about the fact You know that there was a general collapse in the stock market.

283
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,806
Speaker 0: I could talk about all sorts of things but that all had to go on.

284
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:16,590
Speaker 0: Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker 0: There's an animated gif of Henry Earl right here.

286
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,904
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all those mugshots.

287
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,088
Speaker 0: Great Wow.

288
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,157
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, Scott, what do you have?

289
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,124
Speaker 0: What's new and exciting in the world of Scott?

290
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,670
Speaker 1: Alright, so check this out, right?

291
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:31,580
Speaker 1: You know, I always hate the fake medicines.

292
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:39,110
Speaker 1: I'm well aware of your vitriol Yes, and recently the government has actually been cracking down and the fake medicines have been very nice.

293
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,109
Speaker 1: They they're going after a fake cancer cure websites, you know that are in the US that they can actually go after.

294
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,590
Speaker 1: They're you know, sort of crack it down and some false claims on various things, you know making them stop.

295
00:19:50,650 --> 00:20:05,683
Speaker 1: there's there's some pretty good action going on in terms of fight against fake medicine and the FTC the Federal Trade Commission which you know sort of regulates commerce and makes sure you don't falsely advertise is You know doing its job and they have said that they're not gonna stop.

296
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:07,010
Speaker 1: this isn't like a one-time deal.

297
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,854
Speaker 1: They're keeping an eye out.

298
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,980
Speaker 1: They actually made a website.

299
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:13,236
Speaker 1: I think it's ftc.com Slash.

300
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,045
Speaker 1: is it curious?

301
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:22,005
Speaker 0: I think No, yeah, no you complain that I have a good news and yet you don't.

302
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:22,927
Speaker 1: you're not even ready.

303
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:23,890
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

304
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,018
Speaker 1: I just forgot about the sub.

305
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:25,803
Speaker 1: say until - here it is.

306
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:29,488
Speaker 1: Yes, ftc.gov Slash curious you see my mess up there.

307
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:36,568
Speaker 1: Anyway, and it's a website that basically tells you how to spot fake cancer cures and tells you to be skeptical.

308
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,618
Speaker 1: and it's it's Curious get it.

309
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:43,020
Speaker 1: See you are e - oh You're curious about the cure.

310
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,507
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, perhaps I should use hey.

311
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:46,896
Speaker 1: Oh Instead it's a good website.

312
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:50,650
Speaker 1: if you're you know, if you have cancer and you're really uninformed, it's that's a good place to go.

313
00:20:51,161 --> 00:21:02,410
Speaker 1: but anyway so the government's doing a good job there, but there's a study recently and People have known for a long time many of the reasons that people go to fake medicine.

314
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:07,710
Speaker 1: Right, and one of the reasons people go to fake medicine is because when you go to the doctor, right?

315
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,136
Speaker 1: the doctor a real doctor is usually not that nice or Attentive.

316
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:15,390
Speaker 1: they don't make you feel good.

317
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,470
Speaker 1: They're actually kind of scared even even as much as I know that the real doctor is where it's at.

318
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:25,070
Speaker 1: It's not comfortable going to a hospital or a doctor's office or anything like that.

319
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,575
Speaker 1: I mean you're in a hospital.

320
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,903
Speaker 1: the doctor maybe shows up once a day.

321
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:33,461
Speaker 1: It doesn't say much to you You know, it's it's not really pleasant.

322
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,410
Speaker 1: The doctors don't do a lot to make you feel good.

323
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:44,980
Speaker 1: But if you go to fake medicine, right some like bullshit, you know, homeopathy Chiropractors something something Acupuncture, you know meditation BS, right?

324
00:21:45,502 --> 00:22:02,469
Speaker 1: They're not actually gonna help you with any actual medicine But they'll be real nice to you and they'll sit down and talk to you for a long time and make you feel really good In terms of you know, mentally speaking they'll be very reassuring with lies But it's reassuring and this is something we've sort of known.

325
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,723
Speaker 1: but it was something you knew in sort of a common sense sort of way.

326
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,775
Speaker 1: and well the There was a study.

327
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,501
Speaker 1: the study author was dr.

328
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:16,164
Speaker 1: Diane Morse an assistant professor of medicine and psych Psychiatry at University to Rochester.

329
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:25,790
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Despite RIT being the super geek school U of R had a far better arcade Yeah, and U of R was a big school for medicines.

330
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:26,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had.

331
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:30,587
Speaker 1: they ran the hospital that you know RIT students went to if they had a problem.

332
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:35,289
Speaker 1: anyway They did a little study there and they found that.

333
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,075
Speaker 1: Well, I'll read from the little article here.

334
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:51,223
Speaker 1: while doctors are able to address such concerns as medication issues missed appointments or pain They tended to skirt existential issues such as questions dealing with life and death Which are of paramount importance to most patients.

335
00:22:51,585 --> 00:23:03,469
Speaker 1: the study author said Physicians only responded to 10% of empathic opportunities and when patients raised existential concerns Physicians tended to shift more to biomedical responses.

336
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:20,490
Speaker 1: Physicians had trouble addressing the bulk of concerns that were about patient fears Concerns about death or dying or worsening conditions and they go on and on and pretty much they studied and they found out Doctors really won't say anything to make you feel better now.

337
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:24,870
Speaker 1: They didn't go in to ask why doctors aren't saying these things, you know.

338
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:35,216
Speaker 1: But I can come up with some ideas such as doctors are very concerned about being ethical and if they start You know getting too friendly and and you know close to you It might sort of break that.

339
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:39,151
Speaker 1: you know, what's appropriate for the patient doctor relationship, you know It's.

340
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:48,192
Speaker 1: it's real hard for you know, you know There's a lot of doctors who have to you know Sort of unpleasant things to your body and if they sort of know you too Well, it could.

341
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:53,870
Speaker 1: I could imagine it being more difficult, you know than doing it in a cold and calculated matter of doctoring.

342
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,873
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's.

343
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,568
Speaker 1: uh, it's pretty interesting and I've had an idea for a while.

344
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:01,664
Speaker 1: Let rim Let me tell you I might have I told you this idea before that.

345
00:24:01,704 --> 00:24:01,966
Speaker 0: All right.

346
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:02,710
Speaker 0: All right, you can shoot.

347
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,590
Speaker 1: I think that when you go to a doctor or a hospital or something, right?

348
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,378
Speaker 1: It's obvious that there needs to be.

349
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,070
Speaker 1: you know, the doctors need to talk to you more.

350
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:22,230
Speaker 1: But the problem is not only do the doctors not want to you know, have ethical problems or you know Patient-doctor relations problems, but they also don't have a lot of time especially hospital doctors.

351
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,679
Speaker 1: They got to treat so many people.

352
00:24:23,699 --> 00:24:32,349
Speaker 1: they're running around from hospital to hospital You know, they can't spend too much time with any one person, you know They can't afford to sit there and talk to you because they actually had to be doing procedures.

353
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:33,232
Speaker 1: Do you know?

354
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,759
Speaker 1: checking people running tests, etc, etc.

355
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,705
Speaker 1: I really think that there's a space to have a new job of Person who you can talk to at the doctor or at the hospital.

356
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:52,430
Speaker 1: just a person whose job it is to Talk to the patients and tell them what's up, you know who can know have enough medical knowledge to you know.

357
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,325
Speaker 1: Read the charts see what your condition is, you know tell you about your condition and things.

358
00:24:57,586 --> 00:25:12,887
Speaker 1: maybe not actually perform procedures or tests or make medical biomedical recommendations or you know prescribe anything or anything like that, but just You know to discuss your problems with you and make you feel better and such and we don't.

359
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,131
Speaker 1: I don't think we have people like That.

360
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:18,249
Speaker 1: I think we need them and maybe if we did people wouldn't go get fake medicine so much.

361
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:26,799
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day now.

362
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,167
Speaker 0: if geek nights means one thing to you.

363
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,893
Speaker 0: It should mean Dedication.

364
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:35,990
Speaker 0: you see I feel as though I have found a kindred spirit out there in the world of radio.

365
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:37,916
Speaker 1: I don't think I have.

366
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:42,330
Speaker 0: I have at least I mean to still be doing this after what five three years?

367
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,601
Speaker 1: 500 plus crazy episodes 500 plus crazy episodes is not equal to what is in this video.

368
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:52,008
Speaker 0: This video is fantastic.

369
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:52,910
Speaker 0: It is pretty good video.

370
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,894
Speaker 0: I mean, I just I don't really want to describe it but suffice to say a radio DJ is talking You know doing much like I'm doing now.

371
00:25:58,934 --> 00:25:59,997
Speaker 0: He's leaned into his microphone.

372
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:08,309
Speaker 0: He's talking increase something starts to happen behind him something Possibly dangerous and it's not like he doesn't notice it.

373
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,650
Speaker 0: He basically turns around while still talking has this look of oh shit.

374
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:22,943
Speaker 0: But he keeps talking without skipping a beat and meanwhile like you read like he turns his back on the thing that is happening Continues to do his radio thing.

375
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:29,269
Speaker 0: Obviously, he's live I guess waiting for someone to help him and eventually someone comes in to help him.

376
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:30,995
Speaker 0: They do not help.

377
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:35,730
Speaker 0: the situation escalates and I will leave it as a surprise to you what happens in the end.

378
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:41,287
Speaker 0: This man is a tiny hero, he's a little bit more of a hero than Henry Earl.

379
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:42,050
Speaker 1: No, he's not.

380
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,136
Speaker 1: He's just crazy and stupid I think.

381
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,750
Speaker 1: but at the same time crazy and stupid makes for incredible video entertainment.

382
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,964
Speaker 0: crazy and stupid awesome All right, however, I think the coup de grace today will be well.

383
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,650
Speaker 0: tonight is Scott's thing of the day.

384
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,239
Speaker 0: Yes, I I have trouble not cracking up.

385
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,022
Speaker 0: Just thinking about it.

386
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:04,769
Speaker 1: This video is one of the best videos I've seen in quite a long while.

387
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:17,010
Speaker 1: Many people, you know have trouble when listening to the hip-hop music's Comprehending what is being said and the same can be said for you know, metal music's or rock music's.

388
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:54,110
Speaker 1: but in this particular case talking about the hip-hop music's and they listen to hip-hop music's and either because they are not familiar with the vocabulary or Because the way the words are enunciated they can't actually, you know, make them out with their ear, you know Perhaps because of slurring or or you know the rhythmic, you know movements of the words make it hard to decipher them Or many reasons why someone who is untrained in the in the arts is not used to listening to it would not be able to Comprehend exactly what is being said in the lyrics of hip-hop song if those lyrics were not written down and maybe even partially or fully translated.

389
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:56,528
Speaker 1: So what we have here is a video.

390
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,057
Speaker 1: It seems like there's.

391
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:10,227
Speaker 1: it looks like a school gymnasium or equivalent Community center room pretty big actually a packed house and on stage There are a couple of hip-hop artists having a freestyle battle.

392
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:16,930
Speaker 1: a freestyle You know battle is where you know, they they hip-hop and they rap without any preparation.

393
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,440
Speaker 1: They don't write the lyrics up beforehand.

394
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,098
Speaker 1: They come up with them as They wrap them now.

395
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:22,610
Speaker 0: granted we could do a whole show about that.

396
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,570
Speaker 0: It's a cool thing, but there's a lot of a lot of tricks and filler words and like things you do like freestyle.

397
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,521
Speaker 0: Rap is difficult, but you can do a lot of preparation to be good at it.

398
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,750
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, it's it's but to do it.

399
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,767
Speaker 1: Well, really, you know, that's why they have competitions.

400
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:44,557
Speaker 1: It's if someone, you know keeps falling back on say, you know a repeated phrase or theme, you know Well, they think of the next thing to say.

401
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:47,930
Speaker 1: that's not as good as someone who keeps coming up with newer and more indefinitely.

402
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:53,970
Speaker 1: It's like a verbal fencing and someone who you know keeps the rhythm better without going uh, I mean you go.

403
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,145
Speaker 1: Oh, that's like you lose.

404
00:28:55,246 --> 00:29:03,010
Speaker 1: but you know Someone who keeps a better rhythm or has you know better rhyming words or clever rhymes is definitely getting ahead in the freestyle rap battle.

405
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:08,910
Speaker 1: Anyway, here's a video of a freestyle rap battle between a man named hydrogen and a man named boost.

406
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,410
Speaker 1: The man named hydrogen, right?

407
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:15,504
Speaker 1: He does his rap followed by you know, the man named boost.

408
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,010
Speaker 1: then, you know, they decide who's the winner.

409
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:18,465
Speaker 1: This video.

410
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,702
Speaker 1: however The audio is completely dubbed over.

411
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,690
Speaker 1: there is none of the original audio is left.

412
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,099
Speaker 1: The original video is but not the original audio.

413
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:30,187
Speaker 1: instead what we have are some white guys.

414
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:37,860
Speaker 1: they have translated the lyrics to the freestyle hip-hop battle and They speak them at.

415
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:49,624
Speaker 1: you know As they be hip-hopping is going on so that if you aren't someone who does not understand hip-hop lyrics You can watch this video and you will understand what these people are saying.

416
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:51,330
Speaker 0: now, I want to say one thing.

417
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,579
Speaker 0: I got to say this pretty clearly.

418
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,396
Speaker 0: This is Hilarious beyond belief.

419
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:05,103
Speaker 1: not only is the translation of the lyrics itself hilarious, right The end of the video has a special treat.

420
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,770
Speaker 1: That is the payoff.

421
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:18,976
Speaker 0: basically I will not reveal because you're going to watch it wait for it because it's one of those things where like it's funny and you're really digging it and then Something happens and music starts playing and It is it is.

422
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:20,990
Speaker 0: it is somewhat hilarious.

423
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:28,430
Speaker 1: You could say yeah Do not do yourself a disservice by skipping around in this video or anything like that because you need the build-up or else it is.

424
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,590
Speaker 0: The payoff is not worth it.

425
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:36,817
Speaker 1: Just play the video and watch it from beginning to end and then if you are not laughing I don't know what's wrong with you.

426
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:40,290
Speaker 0: It's such a I have a joke, but I can't make it without spoiling.

427
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:46,967
Speaker 0: Don't don't make it anyway tonight How you made the joke, that's right.

428
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:57,982
Speaker 0: so tonight Finally after a long long time of it being put off by various things We're to talk about Neal Stephenson's snow crash in a spoiler if ik.

429
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,710
Speaker 0: final thoughts the geek nights book club manner.

430
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:16,910
Speaker 1: So if you haven't read snow crash, like we told you to and it seems like actually looking at a poll I put up maybe like half the people read it then 25% plan to or kind of sorta but then 25% No, so actually that's a lot better than we were thinking.

431
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,010
Speaker 1: I think it's just the people who read it, you know weren't speaking out enough.

432
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:29,210
Speaker 1: So I think we're just gonna force the book club because you know, it's sort of like in the library We have the signs that say read and a famous person with a book, you know, we're sort of like that.

433
00:31:29,332 --> 00:31:29,906
Speaker 1: I think that's good.

434
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:38,530
Speaker 0: I think we can avoid talking about a lot of the things we talked about when we Introduced this book in terms of you know, why like why we read it and why it's important.

435
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,690
Speaker 0: I forgot what we said when we introduced this book, but we'll have to touch on a lot of that.

436
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,016
Speaker 0: Anyway, because it's kind of central.

437
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:51,024
Speaker 0: I mean the book itself is important Primarily because it kind of catapulted Stephenson into this I guess.

438
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:52,007
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

439
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:52,850
Speaker 0: He's a real author.

440
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,652
Speaker 0: Look at what he wrote.

441
00:31:53,973 --> 00:32:05,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, Neal Stephenson was pretty much just like a nerd author and then snow crash You know sort of brought him into being a real author who is respected although nerdy.

442
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:10,926
Speaker 1: So because of that we have two Neil's the Neil Stephenson and the Neil Guyman.

443
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:12,150
Speaker 1: do not confuse the two.

444
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:15,162
Speaker 1: It is very important that you have a clear separation in your mind.

445
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:19,619
Speaker 1: Neil Stephenson is NEAL Neil Guyman is NEIL.

446
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,807
Speaker 1: All right, very different people.

447
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:22,730
Speaker 1: No confusion.

448
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:30,855
Speaker 0: Well, the one thing we really have to just bring up again because it bears repeating is that this book was published in 1992.

449
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,126
Speaker 1: oh that just that freaks me out.

450
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:33,769
Speaker 1: cuz I read it.

451
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,149
Speaker 1: Well, not more than two years ago.

452
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:43,401
Speaker 0: Basically you read it now and you think like it reeks of the 90s But it was written before the 90s really happened.

453
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,063
Speaker 0: Like you read it.

454
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,368
Speaker 0: You're like, wow, it's the 90s.

455
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,644
Speaker 0: This is what the internet was like in the mid late 90s.

456
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,428
Speaker 0: This is what this is a 90s book, but it was basically written in the late 80s.

457
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you wrote this book or a similar book now Everyone would say that's derivative crap derivative crap.

458
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:05,150
Speaker 1: and you know a part of the things some of the things in this book Right warrant completely original at the time of its writing.

459
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:07,928
Speaker 1: But a lot of it was a whole lot of it.

460
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:18,709
Speaker 0: It was it was it was ahead of its time and that it it talks about the internet as it would be in the late 90s well before it happened with a scary degree of accuracy.

461
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,410
Speaker 0: Granted I say with the degree of accuracy because it takes a lot of liberties.

462
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:26,610
Speaker 0: I mean the actual reality of what's going on in this book.

463
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,448
Speaker 0: I mean the metaverse VR all those things which are really big in the 90s.

464
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,139
Speaker 0: But VR never really came to pass.

465
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:35,610
Speaker 0: like VR is almost entirely faded from the limelight.

466
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,957
Speaker 1: Well, it's like any science fiction book.

467
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:47,105
Speaker 1: right when you write about the future you write about not the actual future usually But you write you know what that the vision of the future was in that time.

468
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,188
Speaker 1: like, you know, you read some 50s sci-fi.

469
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:50,338
Speaker 1: It's all like moon men and shit.

470
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,570
Speaker 0: or you watch like a strange days Which is still one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever.

471
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:56,449
Speaker 0: But you look at you're like wow.

472
00:33:57,012 --> 00:34:02,110
Speaker 0: That doesn't like you feel like the culture of the movie feels off like it doesn't feel like a future culture.

473
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:10,550
Speaker 0: but it was made in like 1991 and it's set in 1991 and 99. if you go back to 91 and you look at what the world was like and what?

474
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,312
Speaker 0: America was like.

475
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:15,263
Speaker 0: you think wow back then I could see this as being the 1999 future.

476
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:22,070
Speaker 1: and then inevitably, you know After something, oh, you know science fiction book comes out and the future does happen.

477
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:38,810
Speaker 1: We look back and we always find you know Some facets in some science fiction book somewhere that match the future we have created and we always wonder Did we just take the fiction and make it reality or was there just so much fiction that no matter what reality happened?

478
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,092
Speaker 1: Something would match it?

479
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:46,550
Speaker 1: and it's it's a tough question, but science fiction inevitably become science fact somehow eventually.

480
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:48,223
Speaker 1: It's just always been that way.

481
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:52,989
Speaker 0: I don't know why But we just talk about the book spoiler.

482
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,549
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is it's not like other works like we talk about Ava.

483
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:01,290
Speaker 0: You know a lot of anime a lot of other books and there's just oh you can spoil it blah blah blah blah.

484
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:03,427
Speaker 0: But this is not really a spoilable book.

485
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:06,138
Speaker 1: That's kind of what I like about it.

486
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,290
Speaker 1: Is it you know, really spoiling?

487
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:18,816
Speaker 1: I don't want to go into my spoiling rant But if something can be spoiled that means to me at least that it relies heavily or somewhat on surprise Right or twists of some kind.

488
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:35,270
Speaker 1: and if knowing the twist beforehand makes the work No longer enjoyable or as enjoyable then perhaps it was relying too heavily on the surprises and the twists Whereas a work that is continued to be enjoyed in successive rereadings, you know.

489
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,880
Speaker 1: Or maybe you find new things each time you look at it.

490
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:40,210
Speaker 1: That is a long-lasting enjoyable work.

491
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:45,290
Speaker 1: You know, the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa, you know, you can't really spoil them, right?

492
00:35:45,672 --> 00:35:46,021
Speaker 0: She's marking.

493
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:49,844
Speaker 1: in fact, the more you look at them the more you enjoy them.

494
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:50,226
Speaker 1: right.

495
00:35:50,266 --> 00:36:00,250
Speaker 1: and snow crash is Sort of like that in which the more you think about it The more you can see what was so important about it what it was saying the more things you can find in there to be.

496
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:07,889
Speaker 1: But in other ways if you reread it there are certain things you notice that are maybe not so it's not perfect in any way.

497
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:19,950
Speaker 0: But yeah, well, you know speaking of not perfect the one real criticism I have and I have this with all any Stevenson work I've ever read but I guess it stands out more in this one because I think it's one of his earlier works.

498
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:30,246
Speaker 0: But he while he can write very iconic action scenes Like you think to you know Listen to reason that whole business with reasons the kind of thing where a nerd reads it and go.

499
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:34,572
Speaker 1: Oh my god Moments.

500
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:46,480
Speaker 1: I really think that the whole reason thing in there while we love that listen to reason scene Right and while it's so awesome and this great joke and it's it's pretty fucking awesome and in a movie It would be so badass even in your mind when you're reading.

501
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,103
Speaker 1: It's badass.

502
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:52,210
Speaker 1: I Think that he really just put that in there because it was awesome.

503
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:59,201
Speaker 0: But a lot of the scenes in this book and a lot of his works are like that and I mean it seems like it's Tamed as his works have gone on.

504
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:06,700
Speaker 0: but like you see it here There are a lot of scenes or moments that he was probably thinking man It'd be really cool if this happened and I kind of puts it in.

505
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:14,530
Speaker 0: but yeah at the same time in the story if they Didn't have reason a lot like a lot of the plodges couldn't have had but it didn't have to be reason.

506
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,093
Speaker 1: It could have been something else, you know calling it reason and making it specifically like that is sort of what the you know Is the it didn't.

507
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:29,233
Speaker 1: really there's no reason it had to be called reason other than to make a joke and to be double Awesome, but I'm going to make but pretty much the most scathing criticism I have about Neal Stephenson.

508
00:37:29,674 --> 00:37:32,903
Speaker 0: the dude can't write action scenes for crap.

509
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,590
Speaker 0: His action scenes are by and large awful.

510
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,639
Speaker 0: They're confused.

511
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:37,970
Speaker 0: They're they're cloudy.

512
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,250
Speaker 0: It's like he didn't plot out and he sort of like if you tried to film it based on what he wrote.

513
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:47,310
Speaker 0: It would basically be impossible and everyone who tried to film it would be completely different.

514
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:47,992
Speaker 0: It's muddled.

515
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:53,788
Speaker 0: then the narrative kind of shifts in and out of all these different voices like Neal cannot write action scenes.

516
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:55,555
Speaker 1: Good God Well, I didn't notice that.

517
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:59,011
Speaker 1: the one thing that really stands out in my mind in that sense It's like.

518
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:02,829
Speaker 1: well the the two big action scenes that I can remember at least right are.

519
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:10,668
Speaker 1: In the early part is the car chasey bit right and where he's trying to deliver the pizza Well, he's not really a chase But he's trying to get the pizza there on time.

520
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:13,139
Speaker 1: Right and I could sort of follow that.

521
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:28,853
Speaker 1: but really more in that scene was less about the actual Action happening and more about introducing you to the world, you know, the the crazy libertarian Corporate world or everything is privately owned and everything and how he gets on the highway owned by one company and pays a toll And all that stuff.

522
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:34,910
Speaker 1: but toward the you know, the climactic action scene of the what is a bicycle race in cyberspace, right?

523
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, that scene was basically.

524
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:38,104
Speaker 1: it's a rhyme.

525
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:42,690
Speaker 0: Yes There wasn't much to that scene to be honest.

526
00:38:42,811 --> 00:38:45,270
Speaker 1: No, I couldn't follow that scene at all.

527
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:48,129
Speaker 1: All I sort of got out of the scene was they're chasing, you know.

528
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,721
Speaker 1: And it didn't have the suspense of one person's winning.

529
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,930
Speaker 1: now the other person's winning now the other person's winning.

530
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,656
Speaker 1: You know who's ahead or who's behind.

531
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:57,445
Speaker 1: it was just sort of like this crazy race going on.

532
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:58,448
Speaker 1: It's whoever wins.

533
00:38:58,508 --> 00:39:00,274
Speaker 1: Oh my god I don't know what's going on.

534
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:03,503
Speaker 1: and then suddenly weird shits happening and then someone wins.

535
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:13,407
Speaker 0: Okay the end but also in general, I mean Obviously his later works are much better, but the writing in snow crash I'll be honest in a lot of points is a little amateurish like it.

536
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:22,918
Speaker 0: just then like the voice or the like the passive nature will come in and out and this it is disjointed and Chapters really don't flow into each other at all.

537
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,864
Speaker 0: And it's kind of just all over the place.

538
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:42,445
Speaker 0: But at the same time I Don't know if it was intentional or not But the result of that the disjointed narrative almost kind of mirrors the world that he is presented to us this fractured Balkanized world that in the physical real world makes almost zero sense like it did.

539
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:43,709
Speaker 0: it couldn't really be.

540
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:52,009
Speaker 0: but at the same time if you look at Internet culture as it grew and what it became which I point out was far after he wrote this book.

541
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:58,250
Speaker 0: It's almost a perfect like metaphor or a perfect representation of what internet culture is like.

542
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:06,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the book, right the one of the things I really love about snow crashes the world of snow crash Which is sort of like this libertarian paradise where?

543
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,217
Speaker 0: well, it's a libertarian paradise It's a cast not a paradise.

544
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:12,240
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was a paradise.

545
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:15,070
Speaker 1: It said specifically is a capital L libertarian paradise.

546
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:20,990
Speaker 0: Yes, I guess you have to make sure that Libertarian paradise is in quotes and that you cannot construe paradise from it.

547
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is a paradise only for libertarians or at least it is what libertarians say they want.

548
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:27,149
Speaker 1: right now.

549
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:35,090
Speaker 1: It is a world in which the US government is incredibly weak and limited and everything in you know The United States or they guess the rest of the world?

550
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,257
Speaker 1: I don't know, but it's mostly.

551
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:39,775
Speaker 1: this story takes place in the United States or future United States.

552
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:44,070
Speaker 0: there's narcolumbia the corporation instead of Columbia the company exactly.

553
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:51,242
Speaker 0: There's Mexicali and and the fact that the mafia is just a franchise And you can just totally like get a job with it.

554
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,688
Speaker 0: Like you've got a job at McDonald's.

555
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:59,086
Speaker 1: all Everything in the country quotes right country is owned by some private company.

556
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,710
Speaker 1: All the roads are privately owned.

557
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:05,490
Speaker 1: So if you drive on say mafia roads, you have to pay mafia tolls to use those roads.

558
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:14,630
Speaker 1: They're not government roads for you know, everyone to share, you know You know if your your house is in one court, you're a citizen of a corporation, right?

559
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,270
Speaker 1: He's a hero protagonist didn't even say his name yet right is the main character.

560
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:21,750
Speaker 1: He's basically a hacker with a samurai sword, you know nerd porn.

561
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:27,253
Speaker 0: I just have to say in terms I don't think we need to really explain because we're assuming that everyone listening to this has read The book.

562
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:32,077
Speaker 1: All right, basically the hacker with the nerd sword What is he lives in like, you know, basically what.

563
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:34,444
Speaker 1: the equivalent of the Chinatown corporations like mr.

564
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,187
Speaker 1: Food.

565
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:35,488
Speaker 1: Mr.

566
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:35,829
Speaker 1: Lee.

567
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,277
Speaker 1: Oh, mr Lee's something Hong Kong, right?

568
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:38,658
Speaker 0: Yes.

569
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,047
Speaker 0: I love the giant disclaimer that come.

570
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:43,722
Speaker 0: it's like welcome to mr Lee's blah blah blah and then giant disclaimer, mr.

571
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:44,810
Speaker 1: Lee's something Hong Kong.

572
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:46,754
Speaker 0: Anyway, mr.

573
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:47,781
Speaker 1: Lee's greater Hong Kong.

574
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:48,324
Speaker 1: That's what it is.

575
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,017
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, mr Lee's greater Hong Kong is fucking awesome.

576
00:41:51,057 --> 00:41:55,294
Speaker 1: If I lived in the snow crash world, I would be a citizen of mr Lee's greater Hong Kong.

577
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:56,096
Speaker 0: I don't know.

578
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,421
Speaker 0: I might join the Mafia.

579
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:59,428
Speaker 1: The Mafia is also really cool.

580
00:41:59,549 --> 00:41:59,830
Speaker 0: I got it.

581
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:06,806
Speaker 0: I gotta say this now Uncle Enzo is like the coolest fucking dude ever forget right easily.

582
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:07,227
Speaker 0: Seriously.

583
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,490
Speaker 0: Uncle Enzo is cool.

584
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,469
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's not like I'm a badass way, but I exactly totally cool do.

585
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:13,870
Speaker 1: Raven.

586
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,050
Speaker 1: I actually don't like Raven, but he is badass.

587
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,365
Speaker 1: But uncle Enzo is really.

588
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:25,127
Speaker 1: I think If there was someone in the book I wanted to be my friend it would be uncle Enzo.

589
00:42:25,147 --> 00:42:28,319
Speaker 0: say this though I don't feel like uncle Enzo works as a character.

590
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,163
Speaker 0: He does not.

591
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,966
Speaker 1: I think that's why he played such as you know small at least.

592
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:39,298
Speaker 1: Uncle Enzo's the Mafia played a larger role, but him himself played a smaller Inconsistent and poorly conceived character.

593
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:46,390
Speaker 0: However in the vein of this book He is awesome because this book is a collection of nerd pornography.

594
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:48,978
Speaker 1: Well, it's that's the thing is that it's hard.

595
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,910
Speaker 1: the book does have a pile of nerd porn in it, right?

596
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:53,834
Speaker 1: It's got reason.

597
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,030
Speaker 1: it's got bat the badass thing with the nuke on the bicycle.

598
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,065
Speaker 1: It's got you know, those hacker guys who have all the gadgets hanging off of them.

599
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:02,410
Speaker 1: It's got cyberspace.

600
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:07,704
Speaker 1: You know, the main character is a pizza delivering hacker with a samurai sword.

601
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:23,037
Speaker 1: Okay, this is nerd porn all over it But it very easy for someone who doesn't give the book a big enough chance to misconstrue the entire book as nerd porn from cover to cover all the way down to the bottom and There is a lot of nerd porn.

602
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,910
Speaker 1: but the nerd porn is the surface level activity in this book.

603
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:37,690
Speaker 1: There is actually some deep high quality cyberspace Metaphors and things going on in this book and you could easily tell that same deep story with something else besides nerd porn on the top.

604
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:40,360
Speaker 1: But having nerd porn on the top just makes it better for us nerds.

605
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:41,042
Speaker 1: Right?

606
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,106
Speaker 1: Am I right?

607
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:43,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

608
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,818
Speaker 0: I mean, this is the book that has that famous speech We don't need to say the speech again about.

609
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,230
Speaker 0: you know, every man blah blah blah wants to be a badass.

610
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,563
Speaker 1: It's exactly what all nerd guys think and you know what.

611
00:43:55,326 --> 00:43:56,129
Speaker 0: we're past the age.

612
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:57,454
Speaker 1: It's too late.

613
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:02,230
Speaker 1: I think we are past the age but Stevenson knows cuz he obviously was a nerd.

614
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,930
Speaker 1: He knows about the whole hog and you know Linux and whatnots.

615
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,514
Speaker 1: So he knew.

616
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:22,629
Speaker 1: so it was easy for him to write a book that tapped in to our Demographic because he's in our demographic and it doesn't seem like a large number of Successful science fiction authors are in our demographic and also are lauded and successful like Stevenson is.

617
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,340
Speaker 0: Now there's the only other.

618
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,910
Speaker 0: I guess I'll get all my criticisms out of the way.

619
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:36,906
Speaker 0: the only other thing that really kind of stood out is being bad about this book was there was a I Guess an attempt at a semi erotic scene between YT and Raven.

620
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:38,473
Speaker 1: see that for me I didn't.

621
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:40,123
Speaker 0: I remember all those days.

622
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:50,066
Speaker 0: that scene was written awkwardly, and I don't want to rag on Stevenson, but it was written as Though the person writing it had never had an erotic moment.

623
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:55,470
Speaker 1: right now first of all Right, the entire book has the Chekhov's gun of the stupid dentata, right?

624
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:06,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that is you know, while a Chekhov's gun is a fine literary mechanic It was used pretty poorly because they showed you the gun too many times They kept bringing it up and bringing it up and bringing it up.

625
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:08,463
Speaker 0: It's like if Chekhov walks out on stage who says

626
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:09,610
Speaker 1: I had a fucking gun

627
00:45:10,194 --> 00:45:15,529
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fucking use it and he does this At the beginning of every act and then walks away and leaves the gun there

628
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:19,222
Speaker 1: Right and with shining bright lights on it and say right

629
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:21,308
Speaker 0: like the spotlight keeps going back to the gun.

630
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:25,344
Speaker 1: exactly So it Chekhov's gun is fine, but not you know, the it was a little too.

631
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:26,388
Speaker 1: Chekhov's gun.

632
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:30,368
Speaker 1: e right They can't he get coming out and reloading it and everything all the time, you know.

633
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,118
Speaker 1: And then came the scene.

634
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:34,805
Speaker 1: and when that scene was coming up, right?

635
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:41,247
Speaker 1: I knew basically Here's the time you saw it coming a mile away was the first problem right a Chekhov's gun.

636
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:47,370
Speaker 1: for it to be successful You need to at least shut up about it right before it goes off, right?

637
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:53,502
Speaker 1: But no as soon as it was about to go off I said, oh and like, you know The next page is gonna go off and sure enough it did right.

638
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:55,410
Speaker 1: and in addition to that, right?

639
00:45:56,271 --> 00:46:00,829
Speaker 1: I wasn't quite sure what was going on in that scene other than the fact that it was gonna go off.

640
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:04,246
Speaker 1: Really I couldn't tell otherwise what was going on.

641
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:10,407
Speaker 1: there was there Consensual activity which I think it actually was consensual activity, but not really.

642
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,190
Speaker 1: I don't know.

643
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:16,298
Speaker 1: It made not a lot of sense to me But it sort of happened and that it was what it was.

644
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:22,930
Speaker 0: but very specifically like the the scene where he's like got her up And he's like sitting on his lap.

645
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,331
Speaker 0: It was just.

646
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,386
Speaker 0: it was so awkward like even the first time I read this book a long time ago.

647
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:30,818
Speaker 0: I remember going Wow Awkward.

648
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,799
Speaker 1: yeah, it was It's not so great.

649
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,909
Speaker 0: but I got one other thing I just got to say Elbab Rife.

650
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,970
Speaker 0: Every time I picture him throughout the entire.

651
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:45,086
Speaker 0: No, I didn't picture Elron Hubbard, you know, I picture.

652
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,509
Speaker 0: I picture Duke Phillips from the critic.

653
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:54,949
Speaker 0: Look, I just I that is Duke Phillips is this guy like it is so him kinda.

654
00:46:54,969 --> 00:46:56,653
Speaker 1: but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

655
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:04,630
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing here, you know, but just based on the nature of the character and the name that given to the character I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be an hour on Hubbard, right?

656
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,370
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but Duke Phillips fits so much better because he's like this barrel so fit going around.

657
00:47:09,971 --> 00:47:11,805
Speaker 0: You know devil may care guy.

658
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:12,127
Speaker 0: He's just.

659
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:12,510
Speaker 1: he's.

660
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:24,366
Speaker 1: No enough about Elron Hubbard the first time I read it to sort of get that Pictured him as one of those crazy TV evangelist guys, but he's also more an amalgamation of other people.

661
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,490
Speaker 0: I mean Bob.

662
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, it definitely some Bob there.

663
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:42,859
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, but you know despite the fact that the book is a little poorly written and you know A lot of scenes really awkward and the action scenes are incomprehensible the book Makes up for that almost pretty much a hundred and ten percent.

664
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:46,970
Speaker 0: Yeah with charm with style and with ideas.

665
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:52,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we wouldn't be making this book a geek nights, you know book club I guess whatever we're gonna call this.

666
00:47:53,142 --> 00:48:02,250
Speaker 0: if it was bad The book is just all right, I'd almost say it's a romp It's a ride and it's an excuse to bring out a lot of it.

667
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:09,713
Speaker 0: Well a lot of really interesting ideas a lot of prescient ideas and a lot of just crazy ideas that are nonetheless Interesting.

668
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:14,129
Speaker 1: a lot of these ideas have been used elsewhere before and after.

669
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:16,557
Speaker 1: you know Very I mean the Tower of Babel.

670
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,403
Speaker 1: myth has been used.

671
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,490
Speaker 1: how many times however about a bajillion?

672
00:48:20,691 --> 00:48:27,030
Speaker 0: I've never seen a work of literature take that idea and make it so pseudo scientific as this book made it.

673
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:36,793
Speaker 0: I mean taking those myths and legends and turning it into what he turned into with the neuro linguistic programming and all that business was just Amazing.

674
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:50,474
Speaker 0: and I think that cuz you know old Samaritan like so monarchy taso and you think oh wow Yeah, and when you're reading this book Everyone for a moment will be like, you know that kind of makes sense before their brain says no It doesn't shut up.

675
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:53,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's that second where you're like, you know?

676
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:56,168
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's not just you know.

677
00:48:56,771 --> 00:49:02,590
Speaker 1: There's the there's the mat the the symbolism of the Tower of Babel and the neuro linguistic programming.

678
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:03,429
Speaker 1: But it you know.

679
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:09,368
Speaker 1: The reason that the book is all nerd porn and hackers actually fits because he's actually talking about.

680
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:16,210
Speaker 1: is you know Assembly language and how sort of the assembly language has been lost and everyone's talking and see in Python.

681
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:20,262
Speaker 1: But if someone managed to learn assembly they could get down to the roots.

682
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:23,563
Speaker 1: it actually fiddle, you know with the with the with the guts of.

683
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:25,317
Speaker 1: You know the brain.

684
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,757
Speaker 0: and I got to say when I was in high school hanging out with you know My high school D&D playing nerd.

685
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:39,817
Speaker 0: friends know me and Ken and Dan and Don, you know You play D&D then you watch some anime and then you all go to like the football field and hang out drinking soda looking Up at the stars and talking about stuff.

686
00:49:39,837 --> 00:49:42,006
Speaker 1: that that's the kind of stuff you talk.

687
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:49,170
Speaker 0: if you record that Conversation and listen to it ten years later You just shake your head and go wow every 16 year old is like that if they're a nerd.

688
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,300
Speaker 0: But we had conversations like this like about this.

689
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,246
Speaker 0: we talked about the brain language.

690
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:55,510
Speaker 0: now, you know that you know.

691
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:04,121
Speaker 0: You know, it's like high school kids are effectively stoners when they have these conversations except there There was no high school nerds at least but there's no weed involved.

692
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:06,610
Speaker 0: You're just stoned on geek nerd stuff.

693
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:13,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, like this book and you have got a high school kid and you read this book You're gonna be coming up with weird shit like that for weeks.

694
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:14,710
Speaker 0: Yes, but good God.

695
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,095
Speaker 0: but no we talk.

696
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:19,709
Speaker 0: you know lay in there after our D&D game all in like the football field about like.

697
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:27,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, the brain language, you know that language that when you're thinking right your brains not thinking in English like it is.

698
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,862
Speaker 0: But there's that undercurrent that other language down there.

699
00:50:31,444 --> 00:50:33,130
Speaker 0: What if it's the same in everyone's brain?

700
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,656
Speaker 0: What if we could communicate with that?

701
00:50:34,977 --> 00:50:36,222
Speaker 0: That would be hardcore.

702
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could totally hack people If only we could understand it.

703
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:40,822
Speaker 0: and then this book is like.

704
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,650
Speaker 0: it takes that and it did.

705
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,750
Speaker 1: Well, it takes that it can it can compares and contrast it to you know, the computer programming hacking, right?

706
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:58,117
Speaker 1: But then also on the other level you have you know, the the reality of it Which is that language and you know The English language or whatever language you speak and does.

707
00:50:58,137 --> 00:51:02,330
Speaker 1: that could be restraints on that language do restrain how people think.

708
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:07,450
Speaker 1: You know, how many times is there an argument that comes down to semantics and the semantics of the word you use?

709
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:14,070
Speaker 1: constrain your ability to come up with different ideas if you don't have the words to go with those ideas or or to communicate with.

710
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,034
Speaker 0: Now what's really interesting?

711
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:26,110
Speaker 1: how you can use words in a way to you're not directly actually Controlling people the way you control a microprocessor with assembly language, but you know propaganda and marketing and whatnot.

712
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:34,250
Speaker 0: But using words in certain ways you can control how people think and act, you know, I gotta say there's a point I can't really make because it would spoil other works.

713
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:42,278
Speaker 0: But Scott think about the all the business here and think about the way Magic and everything works.

714
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:48,870
Speaker 1: I was gonna say that I was actually trying to say that like a minute ago But I decided that I didn't want to do some Prince of Nothing spoilers in the snow.

715
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:51,104
Speaker 1: That's why I can't make the argument be fair.

716
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:59,370
Speaker 0: I can't make the argument I want to make but just the ideas of this book Really add a lot to the Prince of Nothing and vice versa.

717
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:04,170
Speaker 1: I'll go with this right is you know, you've listened to me and rim talk a lot, right?

718
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:08,670
Speaker 1: And whenever there's any idea or any any discussion of anything, right?

719
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,210
Speaker 1: What do we always do even with games with anime or with any you know with anything?

720
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:16,647
Speaker 0: We immediately boil it down to core semantics and then bitch about exactly.

721
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:24,510
Speaker 1: we head To the core when we look at something like wow, we ignore the surface level stuff We scrape that all off the barnacles, right?

722
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:31,877
Speaker 1: We cut it open and we look to the heart of the matter as if that is that is it really matters the fundamental Nature of the thing.

723
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:34,530
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you've got this board game with all these great rules.

724
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:41,190
Speaker 1: Well, actually this game is just rock-paper-scissors at the core or you know, oh you've got this, you know great anime.

725
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:48,510
Speaker 1: Well actually at the core, this is just another, you know Monster of the week show even though the robots look really cool or whatever, right?

726
00:52:48,590 --> 00:53:16,786
Speaker 1: We we go straight for the core and all of these different geek works here all sort of have this Idea that there is a there is a language or is there there is a way of controlling the core of Manipulating things at the core level going straight to the bottom ignoring the fluff, you know working with the the the true matter the Whatever it is the the pure essence of things and then thus, you know, the rest of everything comes out of that.

727
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:18,494
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

728
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:21,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an idea We like a lot because it matches how we think.

729
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,830
Speaker 1: or perhaps, you know it being exposed to these ideas So much it shaped how we think but you know.

730
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,773
Speaker 0: Anyway, just to get back to the book itself one thing I can say that maybe it's because you know I read.

731
00:53:32,874 --> 00:53:39,302
Speaker 0: I've read a lot of Kurt Vonnegut since I first read snow crash But I see a lot of Kurt Vonnegut ideas in snow crash.

732
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:40,948
Speaker 0: not, you know, there's some of it there.

733
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:46,470
Speaker 0: mostly, you know I read hocus-pocus which is one of my more favorite works of Kurt Vonnegut's and I didn't read that one.

734
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:57,390
Speaker 0: It's a good one But I feel as though there are strong Similarities in some of the overarching themes not the plot of snow crash but a lot of the themes of snow crash.

735
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:07,283
Speaker 0: Definitely, I don't know if they were drawn from hocus-pocus or if they're just parallel and analogous But I feel this connection that I can't really articulate deeply.

736
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:10,934
Speaker 0: unless you've read Kurt Vonnegut's hocus-pocus Which you should all read.

737
00:54:10,995 --> 00:54:13,343
Speaker 0: it's a great if somewhat depressing book.

738
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:15,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's.

739
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:16,728
Speaker 0: It's also short.

740
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:23,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of reminds me at least a little bit of cat's cradle in which they sort of have that narrative structure.

741
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:35,950
Speaker 1: That's pretty typical and a lot of works of we give you some word or some phrase or something early on like snow crash Or ice nine or something something along those lines right away, right?

742
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,785
Speaker 1: And then you sort of don't learn what it is until later.

743
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:43,900
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's lame Sometimes it's hackneyed but like both around I never learn it.

744
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:46,670
Speaker 0: Boca Rado did it like the best I've ever seen anything.

745
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,810
Speaker 1: It's not a bad literary technique.

746
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,083
Speaker 1: It's used quite often to great effect and you can see why right is you?

747
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:53,810
Speaker 1: you give him someone's pretty solid.

748
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:56,047
Speaker 0: He's a prince of nothing, right?

749
00:54:57,031 --> 00:55:00,830
Speaker 1: It's like you give somebody a label, right?

750
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,229
Speaker 1: But you don't know what the label is.

751
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,226
Speaker 1: So that now this you've created this empty box that they can't see all this closed box.

752
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:10,109
Speaker 1: They know the box is there They can't see inside of it.

753
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:17,529
Speaker 1: They know there's something in there and over time You slowly reveal or don't and then suddenly reveal or never reveal what's in the box.

754
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,383
Speaker 1: and That's a great way to keep someone reading something.

755
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:21,730
Speaker 1: is I want to know what's in the box?

756
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:29,026
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know what's in the box and you can do it Well, and you can do it poorly and snow crash actually does it pretty well, you know, what is snow crash?

757
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:42,030
Speaker 1: Oh It's this, you know Neurolinguistic virus that can infect people and computers at the same time because it consists, you know The base or language or again babble nerd porn here.

758
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:43,174
Speaker 0: Is that not?

759
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:46,849
Speaker 0: I mean to to quotes a somewhat infamous movie?

760
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:54,250
Speaker 0: Hack the planet is nothing more pornographic to nerd hackers than the ability to hack the real world.

761
00:55:55,711 --> 00:55:56,995
Speaker 0: Not much not much.

762
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:59,341
Speaker 1: I mean, that's what that's what hacking is all about.

763
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:01,206
Speaker 1: hacking isn't just about computers.

764
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:19,830
Speaker 1: hacking is about, you know Finding flaws in systems ways to to manipulate systems or pretty much doing anything you can to to boost You know power in unseen ways, you know You see something and you say aha actually I can get that to go twice as fast and twice as easily by just doing this.

765
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that's that's what hacking is all about.

766
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:40,890
Speaker 1: so the idea of being able to control things at the lowest level is sort of like the ultimate in hacking because Having you know Root access and being able to just type in any assembly command you want Allows you the full power and once you've achieved that that is sort of like the be-all-end-all of hacking.

767
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:46,070
Speaker 1: I have controlling everything at the lowest possible level with the highest level of power.

768
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:50,245
Speaker 0: Now there's also there's a lot of little I don't know I keeps.

769
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,875
Speaker 0: I said charm a couple times But there are.

770
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:57,298
Speaker 0: there's a lot of really Interesting style to the way people talk or like.

771
00:56:57,398 --> 00:57:04,950
Speaker 0: the best example of this is day it and I'm pretty sure I would pronounce his Name dead, you know dia is David but da5 ID real.

772
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:06,158
Speaker 1: I just called him in my.

773
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:06,742
Speaker 1: I was having.

774
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:07,165
Speaker 1: that's the thing.

775
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:13,249
Speaker 1: when I read it My mind is a hard time saying his name because I want to call it David, but there's a five there instead of a weird.

776
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:18,090
Speaker 1: But so I'm like is it day five ID day fit, you know, but I don't have that problem.

777
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:18,896
Speaker 0: But like the way

778
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:19,541
Speaker 1: I've ID

779
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:40,870
Speaker 0: the way my brain Processes names and I think it's partly because I got on the internet and I got online real early and I spent a lot of Time, you know back when avatars and shared spaces were a much bigger deal on the internet and like real-time Avatar based communication and like real-time Chad was real important compared to how important it is now.

780
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,770
Speaker 0: Well now you people are really into the time shifted Chad and I could do a whole show about that business.

781
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:55,142
Speaker 0: But back then like my I would process because everyone had a lead hacker name and when I say lead I mean Old-school lead like the lead that no one uses anymore.

782
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:57,270
Speaker 0: the lead that was really stupid had a name like that.

783
00:57:57,331 --> 00:58:00,374
Speaker 1: Now people would think you were eight years old Yes but or 13.

784
00:58:00,374 --> 00:58:10,370
Speaker 0: back then like a lot of people used words and names like that like day it and My brain processed all those names as blobs as like they were like there were not letters in the name.

785
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,629
Speaker 0: The name itself was a unit in my brain.

786
00:58:13,052 --> 00:58:21,170
Speaker 0: so when I see this my brain just like uses the unit and Translates it kind of has a look-up table that translates it into a way to pronounce it.

787
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:28,890
Speaker 1: So my brain looks at you know date da5 ID and just sort of goes dead Id you know and it's just like I want to say David.

788
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,470
Speaker 1: But when I try to say David in my mind looking at that my brain goes

789
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:48,210
Speaker 0: ah, see, I think my brain I tend to make blobs like to the point where if someone has a title or There's a phrase even a long phrase or a sentence even that appears more than one time in a book It immediately becomes like compressed into this blob.

790
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:53,810
Speaker 0: So when I see it again I skip it and move on to the rest of the words just kind of already having known what that was.

791
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,889
Speaker 1: So see how nicely this conversation relates to the main idea in this book.

792
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:58,290
Speaker 0: That was kind of my intention.

793
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:03,790
Speaker 0: But yeah day it just immediately like I saw it and my brain said date and that was how I pronounced it.

794
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:04,901
Speaker 0: I feel like that's correct.

795
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:05,609
Speaker 1: I'll talk about him.

796
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:08,773
Speaker 0: I don't have a lot to say about him But just the name.

797
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:14,730
Speaker 0: and there's a lot of things in the book like that that really set up the way the internet is today.

798
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:21,610
Speaker 0: Just reading this book again You know, I just feel as though the world it sets up could never exist in the physical world.

799
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:25,529
Speaker 0: But the world it sets up is what the internet is like now.

800
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:28,681
Speaker 0: Yeah in a like in a direct and real sense

801
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:44,359
Speaker 1: and sort of debt and sort of trying to create this You know world of libertarian paradise He actually, you know created a physical world that matches our modern virtual world and his virtual world sort of matches the fictional Virtual traditional

802
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:45,709
Speaker 0: is a perfectly chromulant word.

803
00:59:45,810 --> 01:00:00,695
Speaker 1: Yes, the fictional virtual world which sort of never going to exist, you know Sort of the idea that everyone always had of oh, well, I'll just sort of go and you know so like reboot which is sorry, I guess kind of like it but more like What was that really bad movie?

804
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:08,664
Speaker 0: you watch Avalon, oh my god, oh my god I'd forgotten about that movie that sepia tone piece of shit.

805
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:10,778
Speaker 0: That was one of the worst movies I've ever sat.

806
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:11,789
Speaker 1: it was pretty terrible.

807
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:17,253
Speaker 0: Then you realize that that is the lot because I'm one of those people who if a movie is bad enough I will walk out.

808
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:19,740
Speaker 0: I'll turn it off and say no not worth it.

809
01:00:20,322 --> 01:00:25,823
Speaker 0: I've walked out of or stopped watching maybe Three movies in my life one of which was Clifford.

810
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:29,720
Speaker 0: I Think Avalon was the worst movie.

811
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,804
Speaker 0: I've not walked out on.

812
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,250
Speaker 1: I know I still don't happen.

813
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,696
Speaker 0: I know what happened.

814
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:40,600
Speaker 0: the movie tried to set it up self up to be deep and serious And then it had a turnabout and I was like, oh wow.

815
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,866
Speaker 0: Oh man, this movie's awesome.

816
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:57,726
Speaker 0: And then It had another turnabout which basically undid all the goodwill I had toward the movie and in an instant I went from wow This movie was okay - this movie was not worth any amount of investment or time.

817
01:00:58,006 --> 01:01:00,029
Speaker 0: This movie is oh my god I hate that movie.

818
01:01:00,151 --> 01:01:01,741
Speaker 1: I don't know why people hyped it up so much.

819
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,687
Speaker 0: that movie was terrible.

820
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,109
Speaker 0: if you like it You're a terrible person.

821
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:08,994
Speaker 1: If you know if you don't know what we were talking about don't ask or I'll say this I'm gonna spoil it.

822
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:10,119
Speaker 0: No, I'm not gonna spoil it.

823
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,183
Speaker 0: Don't watch it.

824
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:12,288
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

825
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:12,830
Speaker 1: It's not.

826
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:14,918
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna say why it's not worth it.

827
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,124
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

828
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:20,283
Speaker 0: And if you don't believe me Well, you're a. you deserve what you get.

829
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:21,690
Speaker 0: trust me it's not worth it.

830
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:23,668
Speaker 0: It's an Odin.

831
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:25,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

832
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:32,235
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the virtual world in snow crash is sort of like the virtual world that everyone wanted to come to be But hasn't yet and might never.

833
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:37,751
Speaker 1: but meanwhile the real world in snow crash is almost exactly like the word The.

834
01:01:37,972 --> 01:01:41,530
Speaker 1: you know virtual quotes, you know internet world that we have today But

835
01:01:41,570 --> 01:02:00,389
Speaker 0: not in a literal sense like the literal actions in the book like the way the metaverse is That the whole idea of the metaverse is something that came into being you know without the VR obviously but the metaverse existed and Then stopped existing because it almost immediately became obsolete in the eyes of the majority of people on the internet.

836
01:02:00,892 --> 01:02:12,938
Speaker 1: Well only because the you know, we didn't have that, you know science fiction Virtual reality interface where you sort of tap in and suddenly you're in this other world and it's it's like another world You've actually transported to and you've.

837
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:21,089
Speaker 1: you're completely separate from the real world Feel and see and walk and you know spaces that were functionally like that with everything except the.

838
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:24,180
Speaker 0: you know Virtual VR immersion like second life.

839
01:02:24,883 --> 01:02:26,610
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, except like same came a lot later.

840
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:31,255
Speaker 0: I'm talking about a lot of earlier things then I'd Early second life's that were no good.

841
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:34,904
Speaker 0: I participated in all the second life is but it's like before.

842
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:41,070
Speaker 0: that thing became technologically feasible in the nerd pornography sense.

843
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:51,597
Speaker 0: other Unforeseen technology like time-shifting Communication did not really Exist back then like it does today.

844
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:54,307
Speaker 0: I mean we we've even time shifted chatting.

845
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:55,130
Speaker 0: What is Twitter?

846
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:58,710
Speaker 0: It is time shifted space shifted chatting.

847
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:08,245
Speaker 0: Yeah in many ways and and time the forums and all these things took off in a way that Obsoleted many of the benefits of the metaverse now obsolete.

848
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:09,350
Speaker 1: It is also perfectly crime.

849
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:16,158
Speaker 0: Yes, it is made obsolete provided obsolescence for yeah but I don't know.

850
01:03:16,178 --> 01:03:20,057
Speaker 0: I feel like it was prescient in a lot of ways but the literal truth of it did not come to be.

851
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:21,349
Speaker 0: but What?

852
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:26,945
Speaker 0: Fundamentally the internet is today is exactly like the real world of snow crash and I keep saying that.

853
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:28,630
Speaker 0: but it's so true.

854
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:37,586
Speaker 0: It's this bogan eyes set of different cultures and you buy in you join The cultures that most agree with you and you're walled off from the cultures.

855
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:38,410
Speaker 0: You don't agree with.

856
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:41,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, the government is relatively weak, but present.

857
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:46,502
Speaker 0: Yes present But can't actually do anything to you unless you're stupid or you mommy.

858
01:03:46,602 --> 01:03:49,030
Speaker 1: is it off the mafia or criminal element is?

859
01:03:49,270 --> 01:04:02,070
Speaker 0: Actually, not that evil and people kind of okay with it and it's you know It's also perfectly legitimate outside of you know, like outside of the US things that are totally illegal are totally okay on the internet.

860
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:08,351
Speaker 1: Yep, there are plenty of cool places for just people to hang out and you know with each other and be cool like, you know Mr.

861
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:12,930
Speaker 0: Lee's greater Hong Kong with their robot dogs, you know, like the front row crew forums, which you should all join.

862
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:21,589
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I don't want to talk about the implications of the ramifications But the rat things that that was some great right that wasn't great writing, but it was great work

863
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:31,823
Speaker 1: Yep, and their religious nut jobs You know have crazy ideas and they completely separate themselves from the world and hide and do crazy things that actually Can harm lots of other people.

864
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:38,858
Speaker 0: I got to admit I got a little bit of a kick out of the fact that in the world of snow crash all Religion is basically boiled down to Scientology.

865
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:39,701
Speaker 1: Yeah.

866
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:40,363
Speaker 1: Yeah.

867
01:04:40,604 --> 01:04:42,230
Speaker 1: Well, aren't this two religions go?

868
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:42,651
Speaker 1: Well, there's.

869
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:44,118
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of religions, but there's two.

870
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:50,019
Speaker 0: but the sacrament of swiping the credit card I just yeah, it's kind of like wow.

871
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:56,330
Speaker 0: This point was made in a very inelegant way, but yet I still found it hilarious.

872
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,751
Speaker 1: Well, I mean cuz that's what it is right Is it?

873
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:07,284
Speaker 1: sometimes you can you know, you can be deep and subtle about making your point about you know The religion is sapping money or you can be blatant with it, right?

874
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:23,335
Speaker 1: You can come out and be like, yeah They're taking everyone's money but if you just say it like that, it's sort of rough and and sort of it's sort of like a to to I Don't know blunt, right but by pushing it out real hard, but also put a little spin on it You know how.

875
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,270
Speaker 1: the sacrament of the credit card?

876
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:32,961
Speaker 1: It's like ah now it's suddenly it feels a lot like, you know, the commercials in You know what it is, oh that's a good example, but it's not.

877
01:05:33,423 --> 01:05:35,750
Speaker 0: it's not blunt like just a blunt ugly object.

878
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,517
Speaker 0: It's blunt like a snub nose bullet like it's.

879
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:45,940
Speaker 0: the example I would use is it is not the clean and elegant Weapon of days past aka the lightsaber.

880
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,044
Speaker 1: It's it's reason.

881
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:48,830
Speaker 0: it is more a blaster.

882
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:52,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, efficient and gets the job done.

883
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:56,224
Speaker 1: Yeah reason is not efficient, but oh my god Listen to it.

884
01:05:57,356 --> 01:06:06,617
Speaker 1: The only reason he called that thing The only reason he called it reason is so he could make that joke by having that guy say they'll listen to reason and yet The book is full of things like that.

885
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:09,670
Speaker 0: Oh, by the way Juanita coming back at the end is total bullshit.

886
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:11,462
Speaker 1: I I agree with that camp.

887
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:13,451
Speaker 0: that was out of nowhere Bullshit.

888
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:16,361
Speaker 0: Yeah that whole like in fact, you know what.

889
01:06:16,401 --> 01:06:20,896
Speaker 0: the whole resolution of the plot was pretty much bullshit But you didn't I see.

890
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,703
Speaker 1: the problem is is I think the plot.

891
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:26,756
Speaker 1: as soon as they had a scene with the helicopter That should have been the end.

892
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:31,090
Speaker 0: but instead there's that kind of BS useless fight between Enzo and Raven.

893
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,193
Speaker 0: It's like the one.

894
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:34,681
Speaker 0: this scene is poorly written - it serves no purpose.

895
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:35,002
Speaker 0: three.

896
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:39,856
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of boring and for It wasn't good.

897
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:40,478
Speaker 0: I didn't enjoy.

898
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:44,510
Speaker 1: if I made snow crash the movie the end of the movie would be they get in the helicopter.

899
01:06:44,831 --> 01:06:45,775
Speaker 1: They say who are you?

900
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:47,261
Speaker 1: I'm the president United States.

901
01:06:47,522 --> 01:06:49,210
Speaker 1: the helicopter takes off and that would be the end.

902
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,097
Speaker 1: That would be the end of Scott's snow crash.

903
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:52,884
Speaker 0: Well, you know what diamond age?

904
01:06:52,964 --> 01:07:02,180
Speaker 0: not I'm not gonna spoil diamond age But it did the same thing where it climaxed Awesomely, and then there's another 20 or 30 pages of bullshit.

905
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,962
Speaker 0: You don't care about.

906
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:07,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's really got to work on his Demma, what's the word?

907
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:09,593
Speaker 0: Denim all.

908
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,218
Speaker 1: yes, that's the word.

909
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:22,341
Speaker 0: However, I'll point out I have not read his very recent work so I don't know if yeah, I have zodiac is on my floor and The Baroque trilogy the three monsters.

910
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:25,376
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get those someday, you know They're gonna be.

911
01:07:25,396 --> 01:07:26,544
Speaker 1: I'll have a whole life to read them.

912
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:29,558
Speaker 1: All right, I'm not in a rush So we'll see what the deal is there.

913
01:07:29,638 --> 01:07:32,629
Speaker 0: But well, you realize zodiac was his second work.

914
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,482
Speaker 0: No as it's all that was written in the 80s.

915
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:36,728
Speaker 1: Well, I'll check it out.

916
01:07:37,191 --> 01:07:41,464
Speaker 1: I'll check it out and I didn't even know the work you wrote before that I've only read parts of.

917
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:42,814
Speaker 1: in the beginning There was the command line.

918
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:43,659
Speaker 0: see the thing is I didn't.

919
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:48,170
Speaker 0: I knew that snow crash was his third work But the only work I knew of he wrote before it was zodiac.

920
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:53,146
Speaker 0: So I just went over to Wikipedia right now and apparently he wrote something called the big you.

921
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:54,250
Speaker 0: when I was two years old.

922
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:55,239
Speaker 1: I never heard of that.

923
01:07:55,542 --> 01:08:00,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I haven't read Anything he wrote since kryptonomicon which by the way, I didn't read that one anything.

924
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:05,301
Speaker 0: kryptonomicon is great But it is just nerd pornography.

925
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:07,147
Speaker 0: It is it is there is almost.

926
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:15,355
Speaker 0: the thing is unlike Snow crash which brought forth a lot of prescient interesting ideas kryptonomicon Rehashes well-known ideas.

927
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:18,524
Speaker 1: Well, I did kryptonomicon come out where they will they well-known ideas at the time.

928
01:08:18,624 --> 01:08:18,984
Speaker 0: Yes.

929
01:08:19,587 --> 01:08:21,712
Speaker 0: It was written in 99.

930
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:29,684
Speaker 0: It's basically talks about cryptography and the thing is if you don't know about Cryptography or about computers like on a really deep hacker level.

931
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:31,189
Speaker 0: It's a great book.

932
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:35,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the PGP stuff went down I think around then or a little before then.

933
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:51,582
Speaker 0: but if you know about corporate like basically it is pornography in the sense that Kryptonomicon is basically oh my god This is about the kind of corporation that every nerd wants to be a part of The kind of adventure that every nerd wants to have.

934
01:08:51,602 --> 01:08:53,229
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not really like that.

935
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:56,689
Speaker 1: It's weird because you know, I'm having a hard time.

936
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,799
Speaker 1: You know snow crash and diamond age being the main books of his that I've read.

937
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:08,848
Speaker 1: It's like I sort of likes no crashes message, you know a little bit more the whole thing, you know the Tower of Babel metaphor and I like the.

938
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:17,389
Speaker 1: You know the stylings of snow crash But the actual story of diamond age and the climax and sort of the.

939
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:18,533
Speaker 1: you know the actual book.

940
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:19,617
Speaker 1: I sort of like that more.

941
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:28,089
Speaker 0: so put it this way snow crash is a fun romp nerd porn and It's just a collection of awesome and memorable scenes.

942
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:32,372
Speaker 0: diamond age has real-world Applicability.

943
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:33,598
Speaker 1: they die in that.

944
01:09:33,698 --> 01:09:40,505
Speaker 0: if you could do which I think you can What was done on a fundamental level in diamond age in the real world?

945
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:41,830
Speaker 0: It would change everything.

946
01:09:42,071 --> 01:09:45,890
Speaker 0: I think so - no crash has nothing to say about the real world today.

947
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:49,019
Speaker 0: Basically the its claim to fame in the real world.

948
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,554
Speaker 0: is it said what is going to be a long time ago And it was largely right.

949
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:53,996
Speaker 1: right.

950
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:57,210
Speaker 1: well isn't that that it was right in this weird almost wrong way?

951
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,079
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean isn't that what all the great a lot more.

952
01:10:00,139 --> 01:10:02,548
Speaker 1: many of the great science fiction works have in common.

953
01:10:02,588 --> 01:10:02,970
Speaker 1: is that they?

954
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,790
Speaker 1: Were right ahead of their time.

955
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:11,331
Speaker 1: You know a whole bunch of science fiction books gets written the future happens the future ends up matching some of them and those ones Are looked at.

956
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:13,879
Speaker 1: so yes is why 1984 was so great.

957
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,547
Speaker 1: It's why brave new world is so great.

958
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:19,253
Speaker 1: You know is because That's the world.

959
01:10:19,273 --> 01:10:23,391
Speaker 1: well some people would argue that brave new world is the world we live in and not 1984.

960
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:31,199
Speaker 1: But there are definitely 1984 aspects to the to the modern world and that is Fahrenheit 451. is is because that's what came to be.

961
01:10:31,259 --> 01:10:32,864
Speaker 0: here's why I enjoy diamond age.

962
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:36,094
Speaker 0: more snow crash is about hey Here's what it's gonna be like.

963
01:10:36,536 --> 01:10:37,399
Speaker 0: diamond age was.

964
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,130
Speaker 0: hey you morons do this.

965
01:10:41,192 --> 01:10:44,990
Speaker 0: That is that is definitely true that snow crash doesn't tell you to do anything.

966
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:48,339
Speaker 0: well Well, you know what tells me to do.

967
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:50,410
Speaker 1: go go to the hills and become a Buddhist.

968
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:55,805
Speaker 0: No one does or because I'm already over 25 be uncle Enzo.

969
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:57,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish I could be uncle.

970
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:58,251
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

971
01:10:58,311 --> 01:10:58,852
Speaker 0: Is he cool.

972
01:10:59,313 --> 01:10:59,754
Speaker 1: It's weird.

973
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:03,159
Speaker 1: It's because the book has you know I don't really like.

974
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:11,580
Speaker 0: oh you know I this is not a spoiler for anything, but Uncle Enzo was a master.

975
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:13,489
Speaker 0: Raven was a professional.

976
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:18,254
Speaker 0: oh And that is actually deep If you see.

977
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:24,220
Speaker 0: if you if you've read and seen all the things that we've read and seen No, I haven't even seen a red, but I know what you're talking about.

978
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get it.

979
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:26,387
Speaker 0: It's obvious.

980
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:40,750
Speaker 0: so with any of you Master Keaton is long and kind of slow but if you watch all of master Keaton and you know what a master is and what a professional is then The difference between Raven and uncle Enzo takes on this whole new interesting level.

981
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:43,906
Speaker 1: I think that is what as another key difference between two books is right.

982
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:54,922
Speaker 1: when you read a book Generally you want to like the characters in the book The only characters they sort of like and snow crash right or like I like the robot dogs, okay They're not really characters so much.

983
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:56,070
Speaker 0: I like uncle uncle Enzo.

984
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:03,934
Speaker 0: Like uncle Enzo I like YT's mom even though I'll say that I like YT too because you know You know what she is.

985
01:12:04,135 --> 01:12:07,754
Speaker 0: she exemplifies one thing and one thing alone Punk kids.

986
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:10,629
Speaker 0: yeah, she is the good kind of punk kid.

987
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:15,795
Speaker 0: She is a good kind of punk kid, but you know what she really is and this is the frightening thing She is fortune.

988
01:12:16,156 --> 01:12:16,357
Speaker 1: Yeah.

989
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:17,924
Speaker 1: She is what that is.

990
01:12:17,944 --> 01:12:20,710
Speaker 1: I don't like her that much though It's not like I'm like a huge fan.

991
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:23,930
Speaker 0: I'll say I enjoy the scenes with her a lot more than most of the scenes with Hiro.

992
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was no really sort of lay.

993
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:33,560
Speaker 0: the early scenes with Hiro are great because they're basically you know metaverse hacking blah blah blah But his action scenes all suck.

994
01:12:33,902 --> 01:12:35,650
Speaker 0: YT's action scenes are at least passable.

995
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:40,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz she's got like you know the hovering stuff, and she throws the rope on like the.

996
01:12:40,209 --> 01:12:42,251
Speaker 1: you know That's.

997
01:12:42,552 --> 01:12:55,308
Speaker 0: that is one of the reasons why when someone said Poon you know PWN for the first time in a mega TF match I was in we all pronounced it Poon and in retrospect Poon Poon this book.

998
01:12:55,348 --> 01:12:57,623
Speaker 0: there may be a Some sort of correlation.

999
01:12:57,643 --> 01:12:58,470
Speaker 1: I think you're stretching it.

1000
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:02,066
Speaker 0: I don't think I made that correlation, but I think someone out there did.

1001
01:13:02,146 --> 01:13:03,090
Speaker 1: I think you're stretching it Cuz.

1002
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:09,956
Speaker 0: I know is that far all the people who use the word Poon in the quake one in quake two FPS and days say Poon.

1003
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:13,389
Speaker 0: to this day everyone who started using it recently says Poon.

1004
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:16,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can tell how old someone is by how they pronounce that way.

1005
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,517
Speaker 1: I don't think that's in any way related to snow crash.

1006
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:21,850
Speaker 1: for the fact that snow, but it's your linguistic programming.

1007
01:13:24,827 --> 01:13:25,858
Speaker 0: I Think we're done.

1008
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:27,370
Speaker 0: unless we start getting into the minutia.

1009
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't I don't think you want to hear me talk about one minutia.

1010
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,175
Speaker 1: I want to talk about which is.

1011
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:33,145
Speaker 1: you know how he sort of relates.

1012
01:13:33,185 --> 01:13:34,150
Speaker 1: You know okay?

1013
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:44,281
Speaker 1: It was the Tower of Babel right BABEL, but also BABB le That that's not pretty crash what that's old anyway.

1014
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:47,910
Speaker 1: I know but that you know, but it's just pointing that out.

1015
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:51,334
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you don't need to do that It's just sort of.

1016
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,502
Speaker 1: it was a little painful when they actually it's like.

1017
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,730
Speaker 1: it's like the thing you're not supposed to say.

1018
01:13:56,294 --> 01:13:59,755
Speaker 1: You know how it's like whether it's an obvious comparison And you've made it and you succeeded.

1019
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:03,390
Speaker 1: and then you make you like you compare two words and make a bad pun.

1020
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:04,734
Speaker 1: That's sort of what that was.

1021
01:14:04,795 --> 01:14:05,256
Speaker 1: no so like.

1022
01:14:05,637 --> 01:14:06,781
Speaker 1: ah yeah, well.

1023
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:09,450
Speaker 1: It's like no don't say that you would set it up already.

1024
01:14:09,874 --> 01:14:26,409
Speaker 0: I can say one thing though The way the book ends while it is incredibly Dissatisfying and anticlimactic and just kind of Peters off and then ends basically the end of the book as I point out is Everybody you know all the punk kids the the couriers that kind of saved the day.

1025
01:14:27,032 --> 01:14:31,270
Speaker 0: I'll get bored and wander off after you know like up all right whatever and they just kind of wander away.

1026
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:39,130
Speaker 0: And then YT is like like she does all this crazy stuff like she's had all these adventures And she's basically saved the world and all the blah blah blah.

1027
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:45,419
Speaker 0: And then as soon as the action dies down even a little bit She gets bored and just wanders away.

1028
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,410
Speaker 0: and that kind of epitomizes the the current General the generation after us on the internet.

1029
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:52,876
Speaker 0: Get bored.

1030
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,968
Speaker 0: wander away is like the rallying call of the internet.

1031
01:14:55,988 --> 01:15:02,429
Speaker 0: today It most definitely is and I don't know if that was intentional or if he just doesn't know how to end a goddamn book.

1032
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:04,301
Speaker 1: I don't know it.

1033
01:15:04,402 --> 01:15:07,239
Speaker 1: You know if you It's it.

1034
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:13,013
Speaker 1: without interviewing Stevenson It'd be hard to tell how much of it is throw shit against the wall And how much of it is.

1035
01:15:13,374 --> 01:15:17,347
Speaker 1: recognize things people are already thinking and figure out what they're gonna think next.

1036
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:21,648
Speaker 1: or you know just match up with things people already thinking or I don't know.

1037
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:23,593
Speaker 1: but There is there.

1038
01:15:23,633 --> 01:15:31,917
Speaker 1: definitely I can't not believe that there isn't definitely a significant element of throw shit against the wall And some of it's gonna match and some of it's not this.

1039
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:39,110
Speaker 1: definitely that's going on All right, so actually there's a little tiny problem with the next book, but I'm not changing my mind.

1040
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:42,658
Speaker 1: I tried to think of a book right.

1041
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,905
Speaker 1: that would be really good because we're not gonna.

1042
01:15:44,926 --> 01:15:48,099
Speaker 1: We're not going with bad books here We're only doing top quality.

1043
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:48,522
Speaker 1: all right.

1044
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,170
Speaker 1: We don't give you no poop here at geek night.

1045
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:52,730
Speaker 0: So as a result the next book is Ethan Frome.

1046
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,673
Speaker 1: It's not Ethan from.

1047
01:15:57,713 --> 01:15:58,676
Speaker 1: Ethan Frome is terrible.

1048
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:00,280
Speaker 1: anyone says otherwise it's stupid.

1049
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:03,468
Speaker 1: um it goes down his sled and hurts himself.

1050
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:09,470
Speaker 1: the end Okay.

1051
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:17,280
Speaker 1: So I tried to think of a book right because you've also had a problem with people not Reading or not wanting to read or being unable to read.

1052
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:23,087
Speaker 0: yes as much as I want the next book to be the count of Monte Cristo, I think one of you will read that.

1053
01:16:23,228 --> 01:16:29,950
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean Reading the entire count of Monte Cristo is equivalent to reading all three Prince of Nothing books and people had trouble reading the one.

1054
01:16:30,111 --> 01:16:43,028
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna dump that on you, so I dare to think what's a really good book That is easy to read maybe shorter right yet Still has substance to it, and it's not like c-spot run right cuz I mean we could throw some dr.

1055
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:43,530
Speaker 1: Seuss out there.

1056
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,699
Speaker 1: That's pretty good, but it really wouldn't be a lot of episode.

1057
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,966
Speaker 1: I mean oh man wasn't it great?

1058
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:52,212
Speaker 1: when there are two fish How about?

1059
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:53,657
Speaker 0: I'm all about blue fish.

1060
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:54,399
Speaker 1: No.

1061
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,105
Speaker 1: I think you're all about hopping on pop.

1062
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:57,610
Speaker 0: Hop on pop is good.

1063
01:16:59,131 --> 01:16:59,854
Speaker 1: You missed my joke.

1064
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,801
Speaker 0: I saw your joke and I went right past it.

1065
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:03,488
Speaker 1: actually about the Lorax is the wind.

1066
01:17:03,508 --> 01:17:07,264
Speaker 1: but anyway The book we're gonna do all right is.

1067
01:17:07,405 --> 01:17:08,652
Speaker 1: I think it's a good choice I made.

1068
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:12,710
Speaker 1: the choice is a Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin.

1069
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:14,082
Speaker 1: It's a fantasy book right.

1070
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:14,989
Speaker 1: you've probably heard of it.

1071
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:21,308
Speaker 1: There was a recent Studio Ghibli movie based on it right pretty important fantasy book from the late 60s.

1072
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:28,910
Speaker 1: But it's a book that really the reading level of it I could have read it in you know maybe sixth seventh grade.

1073
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:35,070
Speaker 1: This is you know is the book perhaps on the same reading level is something like Lord of the Flies.

1074
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,807
Speaker 1: You know it's sort of that level of reading.

1075
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:39,680
Speaker 1: so Really everyone should be able to read it.

1076
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,570
Speaker 1: You know it shouldn't take you that long.

1077
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,924
Speaker 1: It's a book that I could read probably in a few hours.

1078
01:17:45,045 --> 01:17:46,230
Speaker 1: It's not difficult at all.

1079
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:51,186
Speaker 1: I'm only gonna do volume one of it right and volume one is a complete story.

1080
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:52,752
Speaker 1: if you like it a lot You can go and get.

1081
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:56,630
Speaker 1: other are the other Earthsea books which sort of directly continue the story.

1082
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,555
Speaker 1: All I'll say about Earthsea right the.

1083
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:06,788
Speaker 1: the one thing I want to tell about right now is When you read a lot of fantasy novels right Lord of the Rings prince of nothing.

1084
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:09,037
Speaker 1: right now I'm reading Thomas Covenant.

1085
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,382
Speaker 1: right what not?

1086
01:18:10,523 --> 01:18:11,768
Speaker 1: white gold-wielding and such.

1087
01:18:12,029 --> 01:18:12,210
Speaker 1: right.

1088
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:18,220
Speaker 1: There was always you know There's the current epic quest going on or whatever something like that.

1089
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:25,766
Speaker 1: and there was always in the past right some Even greater quest that set the stage of the current world.

1090
01:18:25,947 --> 01:18:26,810
Speaker 1: right Lord of the Rings?

1091
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:30,500
Speaker 1: Okay, the Silmarillion set the stage of the Middle Earth that you're.

1092
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,144
Speaker 1: you know that Frodo is in.

1093
01:18:32,485 --> 01:18:36,677
Speaker 1: you know the great battles of The gods and everything happened in the past.

1094
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:42,193
Speaker 1: and I always say I want to see those great battles of the gods with a million Dragons everywhere.

1095
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:43,276
Speaker 1: how can we never see those?

1096
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:47,369
Speaker 1: and the reason is because it's boring from a you know a book perspective.

1097
01:18:47,389 --> 01:19:06,767
Speaker 1: in Earthsea there is the great past with the dragons and all that stuff right to build the world upon but as it turns out the story that happens in that first book of Earthsea is Is Even if you don't realize it the stage-setter, it's actually like oh my god.

1098
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:07,670
Speaker 1: This is it.

1099
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:16,477
Speaker 1: It's the business and that's that really gives me a strong feeling about that book and it's significant in Many recent geek things.

1100
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:18,142
Speaker 1: it's an important fantasy work.

1101
01:19:18,242 --> 01:19:18,844
Speaker 1: You should read it.

1102
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:19,987
Speaker 1: It's easy.

1103
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:20,890
Speaker 1: It's also cheap.

1104
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,401
Speaker 1: Let me go look how much it is on Amazon.

1105
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:26,022
Speaker 1: while rim says something Or all rim doesn't say anything.

1106
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:27,411
Speaker 0: well pretty much I mean.

1107
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:35,203
Speaker 0: the way we're doing this in the future is that Scott and I are gonna take turns picking books with Unilateral and uncontestable power are we?

1108
01:19:35,283 --> 01:19:36,027
Speaker 1: oh is that how we're gonna.

1109
01:19:36,067 --> 01:19:37,052
Speaker 0: Do that's how we're gonna Do it.

1110
01:19:37,253 --> 01:19:38,984
Speaker 1: see I gave you a chance to.

1111
01:19:39,004 --> 01:19:42,285
Speaker 1: you know cuz I picked it out And I don't you you had a chance to say so.

1112
01:19:42,346 --> 01:19:46,310
Speaker 0: I will say this I will not abuse this until you do so as long as we play civil.

1113
01:19:46,471 --> 01:19:47,538
Speaker 1: Oh is that how we're gonna.
