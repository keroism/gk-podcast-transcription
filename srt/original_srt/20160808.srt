1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,941
Speaker 1: It's Monday, August 8th, 2016!

2
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,990
Speaker 1: I'm Rim, he's Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight!

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,430
Speaker 1: Specialized peripherals for computers!

4
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:22,629
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,560
Speaker 0: Alright, so we took a ferry over to a beachy place, but that was also a bicycle place, which is pretty much the best place.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,680
Speaker 0: Combining two great tastes that taste great together, except, you know, the beachy place.

7
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:42,960
Speaker 0: The sand was a little eh, and, you know, the water wasn't amazing blue water, but it was actually nice water.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,140
Speaker 1: It was real swimmable water, like it was good beach time.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,760
Speaker 0: Good temperature.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,879
Speaker 1: We saw some Cold War era nukes.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Speaker 0: Yup, so anyway, on the way back, right, we take the ferry, and apparently there's some deal with this ferry, that you can only take it from there to New York City if you used it to go to the beach from New York City in the morning.

12
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:10,060
Speaker 1: Now, I've used this ferry twice, this was the second time I used it, and I used it with Emily before, because basically before we invited, like, Scott and everyone else to come to this beach.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:28,418
Speaker 0: Like, if you drive to the beach, and say, let's say you're hanging with your friends in New Jersey, right, and you're a New York person, and you hung out with them all week, and at the end of the week, they drive you to the beach, and then you just want to take the ferry one way back to New York, you know, and your friends drive back home to Jersey, you cannot do this.

14
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:59,754
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting, so Emily and I, like I said, we tried this ferry out to go to this beach before we invited other people to make sure, like, it was worth doing, and it was, but way back when we did this, the sign, there was no sign saying anything like that, but now, as I got on the ferry the second time with Scott when we were coming back, there's a bunch of signs on the dock itself, and nowhere else, that say, you can only use this ferry if you came here from Manhattan today, and spent the entire day at Sandy Hook.

15
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,820
Speaker 0: However, that sign... So I couldn't even come on the thing, sleep on the beach, and go back tomorrow.

16
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:13,640
Speaker 1: No, what's weird is that sign is literally like on the dock, like past where they take tickets, and does not exist anywhere else in the world, or even on the website of the ferry.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:28,470
Speaker 0: It's also interesting how the ferry is clearly run by a private company, right, and this company charges 30 plus dollars, 30 is like the minimum amount to get on this ferry, we paid 35 because 30 plus a bike fee, but if you get on the later ferry, not the crack of dawn ferry,

18
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,092
Speaker 1: it's

19
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:30,277
Speaker 0: like 40 something dollars,

20
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:31,321
Speaker 1: I think it's 47,

21
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,360
Speaker 0: and you add the bike fee, you could pay anywhere between 30 and 52 dollars to ride this ferry.

22
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:46,221
Speaker 0: So there's like hundreds of people on the ferry, and it runs like three times, so that's like three times a few hundred times 40.

23
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:50,520
Speaker 0: They're making like 300k almost a day running this ferry.

24
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,239
Speaker 1: And it takes like 40 minutes for the ferry to get there.

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, owning a boat is expensive, buying a big boat, it's really big, is expensive, if you make 300k a day, you're profiting on the boat.

26
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,400
Speaker 1: They also sell a bunch of terrible booze for cash on it.

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:22,976
Speaker 0: They sold mad booze on this boat, people were getting Bloody Marys at 8am, but they were selling a decent bagel, decent meaning edible, for a dollar, it was better than a street cart bagel which cost a dollar, it wasn't as good as a real bagel, right, and I bought it for a dollar and they gave me an orange juice, also reasonable, like a dollar.

28
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,080
Speaker 0: fifty two dollars, so alright.

29
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:25,017
Speaker 1: I'm shocked by that.

30
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:59,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, but this is a privately owned boat, but for some reason when the boat lands at the park, you know, it's a beach and a national park and all this other stuff, the National Park Rangers, federal employees, are managing everything on land and helping the ferry, like with its line and with all this stuff, they're helping the private company out, there are federal employees that federal tax money is being used to pay their salaries, and they're helping out a private ferry company that should, I think, have their own employees managing their own line.

31
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,160
Speaker 0: So just as we're coming up to the ferry to go home, And you know what, there's no one even managing the line on the New York side at all, there's just a big line of New Yorkers.

32
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:17,500
Speaker 1: So I start telling Scott the story of the last time Emily and I came, and how this crazy guy and his family almost got arrested by these federal park people, because there was some crazy drama.

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,719
Speaker 0: They're just park rangers, like Yogi Bears, you know.

34
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there was some

35
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:21,990
Speaker 0: crazy drama

36
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:43,480
Speaker 1: where this guy wanted to park his car there and take the ferry into Manhattan with his family for the weekend and come back and get his car later, and the lady was yelling at him and then she called a whole bunch more cops, like more rangers showed up and surrounded his car and there was this crazy drama, and just as I'm telling this story to Scott, we get interrupted by basically the same situation but escalated.

37
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, this lady gets out of a car, I couldn't tell if it was her friend or an Uber or something.

38
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Speaker 0: I suspect it was an Uber, just the way things played out.

39
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:01,197
Speaker 0: But the car left, the car wasn't there anymore, so she got dropped off, and the ranger's like, "Listen, you can't get on the ferry unless you came here from New York this

40
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:01,538
Speaker 0: morning.".

41
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,757
Speaker 0: And she flips out, and I'm like, "Oh, crazy

42
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:05,099
Speaker 0: person.".

43
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,510
Speaker 1: Zero to crazy in zero seconds.

44
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,198
Speaker 1: She starts screaming, "I've got to get to New

45
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:09,479
Speaker 1: York.".

46
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, and she starts running towards the ferry.

47
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:20,460
Speaker 1: So this ranger, standing in front of her, saying, "You can't come in," she runs past her and bolts toward the ferry.

48
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,812
Speaker 0: It's like, "What do you think's going to happen?

49
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:22,417
Speaker 0: You're not getting on the

50
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:22,660
Speaker 0: boat.".

51
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,014
Speaker 1: So the ranger starts yelling for, "I need backup,".

52
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:38,480
Speaker 1: and then she gets into a radio, and then these other rangers come out, and the woman's running around trying to get away from the rangers, and then three more rangers' cars come up, and one thing leads to another, and she gets fucking arrested, handcuffed, and driven away.

53
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,079
Speaker 0: Now, there were a lot of questions, right?

54
00:05:41,220 --> 00:06:00,024
Speaker 0: One question was somebody said they heard her yelling about her father being sick, so maybe best case scenario, well, not best case for her, but she was on the beach and got a phone call, and then was clever, and was like, "Aha, I can get to New York to see my suddenly sick father really quickly with this ferry,".

55
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,379
Speaker 0: and didn't know the rules, and because was in a bad situation, was freaking out.

56
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,240
Speaker 0: But, yeah, no matter how bad the situation, freaking out is not good.

57
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,800
Speaker 0: You just made shit worse for yourself.

58
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,217
Speaker 1: Freaking out by the police, especially in America.

59
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:19,420
Speaker 0: Well, they're federal park rangers, I don't even know, and I guess they could arrest you.

60
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,940
Speaker 1: While she was being crazy, she was not being get-arrested crazy.

61
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:24,360
Speaker 1: Right.

62
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:27,020
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the fuck they arrested her on.

63
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't see anything she did.

64
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:30,660
Speaker 0: that was warrant being arrested.

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,420
Speaker 1: She warranted at most being yelled at and told to go away.

66
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
Speaker 0: She warranted being yelled at, being made to calm down and explain her deal.

67
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe being put in the police car.

68
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,102
Speaker 0: You know what?

69
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:46,277
Speaker 0: Maybe if you explained your deal calmly and quietly, maybe the people on the ferry would be like, "Oh shit, yeah, we'll let you on this

70
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:46,659
Speaker 0: ferry.".

71
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,040
Speaker 0: So

72
00:06:47,101 --> 00:07:01,515
Speaker 1: meanwhile, while this is going on, another car pulls up and tries to drop some people off at the ferry, and that same police person or park person who had arranged the arrest of this crazy lady runs over and starts yelling at him, "You can't drop people off here.

73
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,338
Speaker 1: This ferry is only for

74
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:02,579
Speaker 1: people.".

75
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,603
Speaker 1: And it's the same deal.

76
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:08,380
Speaker 1: They're like really, really aggressively enforcing this rule.

77
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,460
Speaker 1: But

78
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:26,340
Speaker 0: meanwhile, there's someone in line next to us who said they got yelled at by the ranger, and I think the ranger has a problem with their communication because the person who was standing in line next to us did arrive by the boat in this morning from New York, and instead of taking the stupid shuttle bus, they had their friends from Jersey pick them up in a car.

79
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:30,020
Speaker 0: So of course, when they came back to the ferry, they were in a car.

80
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,459
Speaker 0: Even though they didn't break that rule.

81
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,150
Speaker 0: Even though they totally had a right to ride the ferry back to New York, because they came from New York this morning, because they arrived in a car, the ranger was like,

82
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,211
Speaker 0: "Eh.".

83
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,475
Speaker 0: And it's like, I think the ranger needs to, when they approach these cars, be like, "Hi, excuse me, did you come from New York this

84
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:45,858
Speaker 0: morning?".

85
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:47,980
Speaker 0: And then give them the what for.

86
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:54,840
Speaker 1: So we thought before I learned a new piece of information that part of this might have been because there's no ticket office in Sandy Hook.

87
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,820
Speaker 0: No, there were people who lost their tickets and were buying tickets right before they got on the boat.

88
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I went on the website.

89
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:04,900
Speaker 1: Not only that, you are totally allowed to buy tickets on the ferry.

90
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,420
Speaker 1: You can get it on without a ticket and then you buy it just like a train.

91
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,193
Speaker 0: They didn't come and check tickets.

92
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:09,800
Speaker 0: How would they even know?

93
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:14,300
Speaker 1: I guess you have to tell them when you try to get on and they do something because the website actually says that specifically.

94
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,067
Speaker 1: I scoured the website.

95
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:25,580
Speaker 1: That rule that we keep talking about only exists on two signs hidden on the gangplank to get on the ferry in Sandy Hook.

96
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,320
Speaker 0: But was being enforced by federal people quite strictly.

97
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,060
Speaker 1: But that rule is not on the New York side.

98
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,498
Speaker 0: The ferry didn't seem to care, actually.

99
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,647
Speaker 1: It's not on the website.

100
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:44,560
Speaker 1: In fact, if you go to the ferry's website, as an intelligent human being, I looked at that ferry website and I am confident based on that website that I could drive to Sandy Hook and get on that ferry right there totally legally.

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,540
Speaker 1: So the only place this rule exists, the rule that got the crazy lady arrested and seems to cause constant parades of drama is on a printed sign that appeared there only in the last few weeks.

102
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:17,720
Speaker 1: But my suspicion, my guess, I don't know if you have a different guess, is that this is either the federal people who run the park or the New Jersey people who run the park or whoever is responsible for that pier being, for whatever reason, weird about the fact that this ferry is here and enforcing this rule that no one else wants enforced.

103
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,320
Speaker 0: I think that it's a protectionist racket.

104
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:24,619
Speaker 0: There are other ways to commute and get from Jersey to New York.

105
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,318
Speaker 0: Like path trains or tunnels with tolls.

106
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,780
Speaker 1: And they don't want you to use this really convenient ferry.

107
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:41,779
Speaker 0: Those organizations do not want, you know, they basically said, "Okay ferry, we'll let you ferry, but we're not going to let you become a new competing option for people to get from Jersey to New York.

108
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,976
Speaker 0: So you can't let those people do

109
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:44,138
Speaker 0: this.".

110
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:54,800
Speaker 1: But the fact that it's federal officers enforcing that rule and that they're enforcing it so aggressively and kind of violently despite the fact that the rule-- And the ferry people didn't care, and they're park rangers.

111
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,840
Speaker 0: They should be warned about keeping the birds on the beach protected or whatever.

112
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:06,419
Speaker 1: I also wonder if what they're doing is actually legal because that rule doesn't exist anywhere except on one sign after you get on the ferry.

113
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:10,720
Speaker 0: And because they're federal park rangers, I think only the FBI can go and investigate.

114
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Speaker 0: I don't think-- Who else can you call?

115
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I did a ton of-- You can't call the New Jersey Police Department to say, "Hey, these park rangers are like--".

116
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:20,552
Speaker 0: And where do they take you?

117
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:21,440
Speaker 0: Park ranger jail?

118
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,735
Speaker 0: Is that like a wooden hut with a fire outside?

119
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 1: It's a weird situation.

120
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,872
Speaker 1: It seems to be escalating day by day.

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,999
Speaker 0: And I can find-- I only went to this place twice, and it happened both times.

122
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,059
Speaker 1: Yup, multiple times both times.

123
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:45,660
Speaker 1: Everyone who uses the ferry regularly knows this one park-- And it's the same ranger is super aggressive.

124
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,840
Speaker 0: She basically-- Yeah, she's maybe got some issues also.

125
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,600
Speaker 1: Credit, you escalated the situation by heckling the crazy lady.

126
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,412
Speaker 0: I wasn't involved in the situation.

127
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,640
Speaker 0: I was a spectator.

128
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,340
Speaker 0: No one who was involved in the situation heard my heckling.

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,439
Speaker 1: Your heckling was a little loud.

130
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,420
Speaker 1: I would have heckled more quietly in the direction of my audience and not at the crazy lady.

131
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,280
Speaker 0: I had to keep an eye on the-- I can't heckle if I got an eye on the action.

132
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:14,959
Speaker 0: If I turned around to look at you while heckling, I wouldn't have been having-- I can't make a play-by-play.

133
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,499
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the crowd, right?

134
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:20,677
Speaker 1: So then later, Scott's getting on the ferry, and he's like, "I hope they let me bring my ice water

135
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:20,919
Speaker 1: on.".

136
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,230
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Nah, it's a federal

137
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,532
Speaker 1: crime.".

138
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,520
Speaker 0: That was really interesting happening.

139
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,920
Speaker 0: Everything else that was interesting was just stuff that was there, not things that happened.

140
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:34,194
Speaker 1: Maybe on Thursday, the next Thursday show, we'll talk about it, because we actually got a tour of--.

141
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:45,280
Speaker 1: For those of you who aren't aware, there was nuclear anti-aircraft-- nuclear anti-aircraft systems in Sandy Hook around New York.

142
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:53,779
Speaker 0: Anyone who doesn't know the geography, look at Google Maps and look for Sandy Hook near New York City, and you'll see that this is a place where you can defend New York City from pretty much any boat.

143
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, before airplanes existed?

144
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,940
Speaker 1: This was like, literally, no boat could get to New York Harbor.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,031
Speaker 0: From the Revolutionary War onwards-- Until the '70s.

146
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:15,100
Speaker 0: Until the '70s, this little spot was used to defend New York from any kind of attack, mostly by boat, but then eventually also defending from planes.

147
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,800
Speaker 0: But then once planes got too good, it became mostly useless.

148
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,560
Speaker 0: So now there's no more active defenses there.

149
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,540
Speaker 1: When planes got too good, they made the anti-aircraft rocket artillery nuclear.

150
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,118
Speaker 1: So there's nukes.

151
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,280
Speaker 0: And then the Cold War ended, so we don't need anything here anymore.

152
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,040
Speaker 1: I'm frankly really glad those nukes are not there anymore.

153
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:37,159
Speaker 1: Especially now that I know how they worked.

154
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, they were a deterrent, and they did their job.

155
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Speaker 0: No one ever attacked New York City ever.

156
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:53,815
Speaker 0: It was very interesting that, in fact-- Because of the little things they put on that island, all the artilleries they set up there-- Not just the artillery, but the hydraulic shore batteries and all those things from the 1980s.

157
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,099
Speaker 0: They put many things there, and they were very effective at keeping New York where it is now.

158
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,839
Speaker 1: None of the weapons ever-- A job well done.

159
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,836
Speaker 1: No weapon ever put on that island was used in anger, which is amazing.

160
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,740
Speaker 0: A worthwhile investment.

161
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,240
Speaker 0: I think they might have shot at some boats in the olden days.

162
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,683
Speaker 0: No!

163
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,480
Speaker 1: You didn't get to do the other tours.

164
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,619
Speaker 1: We got tours of all the old batteries.

165
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaker 0: They didn't even have to shoot at boats in 1812.

166
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Speaker 1: The Potter battery never used in anger.

167
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 1: The 9-gun never used in anger.

168
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,408
Speaker 0: Really?

169
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,320
Speaker 0: The War of 1812, they didn't try to ride up on into New York with their boats?

170
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:25,034
Speaker 1: I don't think they had those installations there in the early 1800s.

171
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,660
Speaker 0: I thought they were there in the Revolutionary War.

172
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,399
Speaker 1: No, Revolutionary War was other stuff, I'm pretty sure.

173
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,179
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was good times.

174
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,379
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll do some investigative journalism, try to figure out what's up with the Sandy Hook ferry thing.

175
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,660
Speaker 1: Question A-- I thought I was clever.

176
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,040
Speaker 0: Why are the federal park rangers helping the private boat?

177
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,240
Speaker 0: B, why do they have this rule?

178
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,920
Speaker 0: C, why are they enforcing the rule so crazily?

179
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,979
Speaker 1: Does this rule even exist?

180
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,440
Speaker 1: I'm dubious of whether or not this is an arrestable offense.

181
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,699
Speaker 0: Maybe, I don't know.

182
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,000
Speaker 1: If I insisted on getting on the ferry, what could they arrest me for?

183
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,440
Speaker 0: My general advice, though, is in life, there's really no reason to flip out.

184
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:06,968
Speaker 0: Tell you what, guys-- There are things that are actually so bad in this world that it's like, "Yeah, that's really, really bad.

185
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,598
Speaker 0: That's worthy of flipping out

186
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:08,879
Speaker 0: about.".

187
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,140
Speaker 0: But don't flip out even then, because flipping out doesn't help anything.

188
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:18,000
Speaker 1: Scott, you be the park ranger, and I'll be crazy lady, and I'm going to roleplay how I would handle that situation as clever rim.

189
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:19,079
Speaker 0: Okay.

190
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,740
Speaker 0: All right.

191
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,740
Speaker 1: I just need to get on the ferry, but what's the problem?

192
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:27,780
Speaker 0: Some rule, you can't get on the ferry unless you came here from New York this morning on the ferry.

193
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,780
Speaker 0: It's a return trip only ferry.

194
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,665
Speaker 1: I did come this morning.

195
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:31,512
Speaker 1: I took the 8 a.m.

196
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:32,520
Speaker 1: sea streak or whatever.

197
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,780
Speaker 0: Do you have the other half of your round trip ticket?

198
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's buried somewhere in my wallet.

199
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,299
Speaker 0: Well, show it to me.

200
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:38,778
Speaker 1: Shit, I can't find it.

201
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,238
Speaker 1: They said I have to buy another one on the ferry if I lost it.

202
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,660
Speaker 0: Okay, because I'm a reasonable human being.

203
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:58,830
Speaker 1: Or even better, thanks officer, sorry, drive away, wait 10 minutes, leave the car somewhere else, walk to the ferry line from the other side and blend in with the gigantic crowd.

204
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a ways around those things.

205
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:07,080
Speaker 1: So, in another kind of open it before we get to the news.

206
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,774
Speaker 0: Rent a bicycle, come back, return the rented bicycle, walk up to the...

207
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:17,718
Speaker 1: Just make a fake receipt for a ferry ticket on your phone and show it to them really quick.

208
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:24,859
Speaker 1: So, anyway, remember how last week my thing of the day was the entire Nintendo Power Archive on archive.org?

209
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,180
Speaker 0: Is there some other archive on there?

210
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,997
Speaker 1: No, that shit got taken down within 48 hours.

211
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:39,100
Speaker 1: So, the question of, I wonder how this was legal, the answer was Nintendo hates you and took it down and there is no way to legally see old Nintendo Powers.

212
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:46,540
Speaker 0: Also, some people made an awesome Metroid 2 remake because Metroid 2 is actually pretty good Metroid, it's different from the other Metroids, but still Metroidy and worth playing.

213
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:48,437
Speaker 0: But it was only ever a Game Boy game.

214
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,360
Speaker 0: really, I guess you get the Virtual Console version.

215
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,630
Speaker 0: It's not really nice to play, but a lot of people that remade.

216
00:15:56,011 --> 00:16:01,560
Speaker 0: Metroid 2 is like a good PC game, that's the same map, the same game, only smooth and pleasant like a Super Metroid.

217
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:07,900
Speaker 0: And Nintendo was like, yeah, take that shit down, but you can get the torrents, like people are spreading it wisely.

218
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,799
Speaker 0: Listen, people, when you got something to spread, don't make a fucking website and post it.

219
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,919
Speaker 0: Just make a torrent only and only on Pirate Bay, that's it.

220
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,063
Speaker 0: Torrents only.

221
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,499
Speaker 0: And then there's no one to send a takedown to.

222
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,919
Speaker 0: Fuck yourself, Nintendo.

223
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,959
Speaker 1: In fact, the torrent of all of Nintendo Power would be smaller than like one episode of a TV show.

224
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,280
Speaker 0: Exactly, it's like, don't go posting stuff on a website with a link on a server.

225
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,799
Speaker 0: Just make a torrent only.

226
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:39,660
Speaker 0: People who are posting stuff on YouTube and get taken down and then they post on Dailymotion, it's like, dude, torrent only.

227
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:51,580
Speaker 1: Well, no, what the kids do now, and I've watched, I know people who watch shows this way, I don't know why, the audio is sped up like 10% and the stereo channels are like munged and messed up.

228
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:58,720
Speaker 0: I've seen stuff on YouTube where there's like, most of the video frame on YouTube is taken up by a JPEG and the video is in a smaller frame within that JPEG.

229
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,599
Speaker 1: And the video itself is zoomed in a little bit and twisted a little bit.

230
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:03,760
Speaker 1: Like, don't watch shows like that.

231
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,859
Speaker 1: Just fucking pirate it at that point, Jesus.

232
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,660
Speaker 1: Like, just go to Pirate Bay.

233
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:12,499
Speaker 1: If you respect the media enough to pirate it, at least pirate a good copy of it.

234
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,920
Speaker 1: Do you disrespect your own time that much?

235
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,719
Speaker 0: I think it's because a lot of the people posting a lot of this content are trying to make money off of it.

236
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:25,480
Speaker 0: No one makes money if you pirate something the honorable way.

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,979
Speaker 1: But it only gets posted and makes money because people do want to pirate things in this degraded, terrible form.

238
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,517
Speaker 1: Got any news?

239
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:34,596
Speaker 1: Newsboy?

240
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,859
Speaker 1: You said you had the news.

241
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:43,140
Speaker 0: Alright, so Edward Snowden made this tweet that was clearly some cryptographic key and then waited a bit and then deleted it and everyone started freaking out.

242
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,220
Speaker 0: Like, oh my god, he's dead.

243
00:17:45,062 --> 00:18:05,580
Speaker 0: Because the truth is he did actually give a bunch of journalists a bunch of these documents that are all encrypted and it's believed that if he dies that they will receive the key to decrypt these documents and then spread them, which is sort of like a great way to tell the world, hey, if you're the person who doesn't like me, don't kill me.

244
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,856
Speaker 0: That would be bad for you.

245
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 1: Or I got killed, hey everybody, if I actually did have real information, avenge me.

246
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,360
Speaker 0: Right, it's like who knows what.

247
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 1: There could be anything in there, but it's basically a pretty good- If it was just a picture of dick butt.

248
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:24,440
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good thing to have existing, to have yourself not be killed when you're a person that many people want dead.

249
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,037
Speaker 1: Yep, you just gotta have blackmail somewhere.

250
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:35,340
Speaker 0: It's also a good way to keep your information safe and spread it around the world, but not actually spread it, but still in the event of your death.

251
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:45,359
Speaker 0: For example, I could have a document that has all my passwords in it and I could encrypt it and give it to RIM and then have a system set up to where I have to push this button every day

252
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:46,003
Speaker 1: and if

253
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:51,680
Speaker 0: I don't push the button for one day, it'll send the key to RIM so he can encrypt and get all the passwords to everything.

254
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:59,840
Speaker 1: When I'm getting older, I'm still thinking about setting up a system to publish every email I've ever sent or received into the public domain on the day of my death.

255
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:05,060
Speaker 0: I think I'm going to do the easy way and just put all my passwords and stuff on a piece of paper.

256
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:06,199
Speaker 1: And then give it to a lawyer.

257
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,780
Speaker 0: And put it in a safe deposit box and then have the keys somewhere.

258
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,695
Speaker 0: and then if I die, someone will find the keys in my apartment.

259
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,411
Speaker 1: If I do that, I might have the will say, "All the media I ever created is public domain.

260
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,858
Speaker 1: if it is legal to public domain

261
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:19,939
Speaker 1: it."

262
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,220
Speaker 1: Including all my emails, all my correspondence.

263
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,789
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't even care.

264
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,614
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "I'm dead.

265
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,278
Speaker 0: What the fuck do I

266
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:25,479
Speaker 0: care?".

267
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:25,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,560
Speaker 0: Whoever can find my keys in my apartment, it's like, you know.

269
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:39,800
Speaker 1: I hope I'm famous enough to where some day, someone working on their senior thesis at some dumpy school somewhere uses RIM's email archive from 100 years ago to research something stupid.

270
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:40,384
Speaker 0: Anyway.

271
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:42,119
Speaker 0: Right, so he did this.

272
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,020
Speaker 0: And we're pretty sure he's not actually dead.

273
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:45,375
Speaker 0: Yep.

274
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,980
Speaker 0: That's just a bunch of people freaking out.

275
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,559
Speaker 1: I didn't see any explanation of it, though.

276
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:51,360
Speaker 0: I think that basically the reasonable explanation is.

277
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:55,439
Speaker 0: he needed to give a key to somebody and they needed to know that it was definitely from him.

278
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:55,855
Speaker 0: Yep.

279
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,079
Speaker 0: And rather than, you know, digital signing is hard, but if he tweets it, all right.

280
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:01,540
Speaker 0: And it doesn't matter if anyone else has the key.

281
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,379
Speaker 0: What are they going to do with it?

282
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,525
Speaker 1: Well, it's important.

283
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 1: if you need to protect the identity of someone you're sending data to as opposed to the data itself.

284
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,900
Speaker 0: Exactly, right.

285
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,839
Speaker 0: So it's like whoever he was sending this information to, we have no idea because he broadcasted the whole world.

286
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,479
Speaker 1: It might have just been a numbers thing, too.

287
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:19,338
Speaker 1: It could have been a code saying, "Hey, people do a

288
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:19,560
Speaker 1: thing.".

289
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:22,039
Speaker 1: I mean, to this day, number stations exist.

290
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:25,899
Speaker 1: If you listen to the right radio bands, there's human voices just saying numbers.

291
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:26,459
Speaker 1: Yeah.

292
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,900
Speaker 1: 24/7, just numbers.

293
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,380
Speaker 1: Four, eight, seven, nine.

294
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,380
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of nerds who obsessively try to figure out what these things are and it's pretty much just spy codes.

295
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,700
Speaker 0: It's just a random number generator to help with your encryption.

296
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,699
Speaker 1: It's coded information, but the idea is that you distribute the information to everyone so that no one can pinpoint who you're sending the information to.

297
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:46,939
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

298
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:59,020
Speaker 1: At least Snowden, as a person, if we're talking about that stuff, I respect him deeply and I'm glad that he did what he did and I really wish the United States would pardon him and bring him home.

299
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,699
Speaker 0: I don't know why Obama doesn't just pardon him.

300
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, pardon him and bring him home and then put him on an agency.

301
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:10,820
Speaker 0: If I was the president right now, I'd be like, "Oh, Everett Snowden, you are now firing whoever's in charge now.

302
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,540
Speaker 0: You are now in charge of the Department of Homeland Security.

303
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:17,140
Speaker 0: You're the boss of the whole thing because I know you're not corrupt and evil.

304
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,399
Speaker 0: And by the way, if you find anyone corrupt and evil, let me know.

305
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as opposed to, say, Assange and WikiLeaks, which basically prove that it is, at best, gamergate.

306
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,980
Speaker 1: And at worst, it's just like a right-wing propaganda nonsense machine.

307
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,040
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, WikiLeaks started out with an honorable mission of take information that shouldn't be secret.

308
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,760
Speaker 1: Wait, no, it started out with an honorable mission of ethics and journalism.

309
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:46,260
Speaker 0: Well, it's like take information that's being kept secret that probably shouldn't be or doesn't need to be and make it public.

310
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,600
Speaker 0: And it's like, yeah, we should do a lot of that.

311
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Speaker 1: Except it pretty much only targeted left-wing and Jewish and democratic things.

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,320
Speaker 0: Well, it just so happens that the people running it are awful people regardless of what their actual mission is, right?

313
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,140
Speaker 0: It's like my mission could be, you know, save the dolphins, right?

314
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,899
Speaker 0: And on the boat of people who are all out saving the dolphins and cutting fishing nets, everyone on the boat's a Nazi.

315
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,860
Speaker 0: And it just so happens they don't save the Jewish dolphins.

316
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,812
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's still.

317
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,140
Speaker 0: the mission itself is fine.

318
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,398
Speaker 0: If anyone else wants to find, you know...

319
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,440
Speaker 1: Yes, the idea of the mission is fine.

320
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 1: The entire structure of everyone involved in WikiLeaks is corrupt and irretrievably so.

321
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they released many informations that should have been released.

322
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 1: There's been a pattern of releasing information.

323
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,400
Speaker 0: They released all those like diplomatic things.

324
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,960
Speaker 0: That was like their big one, right, way back years ago.

325
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,600
Speaker 1: I think part of what might have happened is that the WikiLeaks group sort of tried to like get volunteers to help them out, you know, around the world.

326
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,720
Speaker 0: And of course, yeah, if you ask the internet for volunteers, you know who you're going to get.

327
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,500
Speaker 1: GamerGaty-type Reddit people were primarily the people who needed that call.

328
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,796
Speaker 0: Neckbeard1, Neckbeard2, and Neckbeard3.

329
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,248
Speaker 0: They got nothing better to do.

330
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:53,913
Speaker 0: They got no lives.

331
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:54,759
Speaker 0: They got no friends.

332
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,260
Speaker 1: Yup, so steer clear of WikiLeaks.

333
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,439
Speaker 0: And they're way libertarian and way believe in that mission.

334
00:22:58,903 --> 00:22:59,659
Speaker 0: Even more than we do.

335
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Speaker 1: In other news, if you might have noticed, Delta Airlines had an outage supposedly due to a power outage somewhere.

336
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,440
Speaker 0: How could you have an outage from a power outage in the modern times when every data center has like mad diesel generators outside of it?

337
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,080
Speaker 1: Sometimes those things fail or they don't come on right away.

338
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:19,659
Speaker 0: I've never seen that happen.

339
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:20,911
Speaker 1: It happens all the time.

340
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:21,599
Speaker 1: You just don't know shit.

341
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:23,120
Speaker 0: I've never seen that happen.

342
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,820
Speaker 1: Real data centers have blips in power sometimes.

343
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,200
Speaker 1: Like in a serious outage, sometimes the generators don't come on right away.

344
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,379
Speaker 1: And you get a blip of power.

345
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,760
Speaker 0: Deltacrew.com has never gone down because of power outage.

346
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm saying that is way more common than you think.

347
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,800
Speaker 0: Like our crappy website can't even be taken down by power outage.

348
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Speaker 0: How does Delta Airlines get taken down by power outage?

349
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,099
Speaker 1: Well, a system probably got rebooted.

350
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:44,872
Speaker 1: Maybe a UPS itself died.

351
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:45,760
Speaker 1: That happens sometimes.

352
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,799
Speaker 1: Like redundant power supply might blow up.

353
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,879
Speaker 1: And then the secondary one doesn't kick in right away.

354
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:51,200
Speaker 1: So the server just reboots.

355
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,159
Speaker 0: All right, but then it comes right back up.

356
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,492
Speaker 1: No, because your server was shitty.

357
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:55,220
Speaker 1: Your software was shitty.

358
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,893
Speaker 0: Well, why that's your Delta Airlines?

359
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:57,559
Speaker 0: That should not be.

360
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:02,680
Speaker 1: So you, Scott, don't seem to... I guess I've worked with a lot more big iron enterprise stuff.

361
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:13,640
Speaker 1: For the last decade, there has been a continuous drive to reduce the cost of ops because pretty much no one values the operations mission anymore.

362
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,859
Speaker 1: And the bigger iron something is, like the more important it is, I get the impression that the less valued that role actually is.

363
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,539
Speaker 0: Well, everyone's outsourcing all their shit to Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.

364
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,400
Speaker 0: Rather than do it themselves, which is actually great.

365
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:35,920
Speaker 1: It's better than having shitty ops that you run is way worse than the lower SLAs of like outsourcing to Amazon.

366
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:43,957
Speaker 0: It's like you can actually save a ton of money if you do it yourself, but you need mad, knowledgeable, hardworking people that aren't so cheap.

367
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:49,818
Speaker 1: So, "Large-scale cancellations are expected today while flights already in the air operating

368
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:50,060
Speaker 1: normally.".

369
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,460
Speaker 1: Basically, no one could check into flights.

370
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:57,720
Speaker 1: I guess they couldn't send passenger manifests and things that were required to be sent for planes.

371
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:09,380
Speaker 1: And basically, because their entire information system globally got effed because this one server or system had an outage somewhere, no one could fly, tens of millions of dollars of damages.

372
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,100
Speaker 0: First of all, they probably have an insurance policy against this kind of thing.

373
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,680
Speaker 1: See, that's the other problem.

374
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:25,880
Speaker 1: If you insure against outages that could have been prevented by operations, that is way cheaper than having an operations team.

375
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:34,139
Speaker 0: It's like if you think of the operations thing as insurance, the cost of the operations is more expensive than the insurance premium, and it evens out.

376
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,225
Speaker 1: I worked at IBM.

377
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:46,500
Speaker 1: And IBM was one of the few companies I've ever encountered, just in terms of all my professional experience, that took this kind of stuff seriously internally.

378
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:51,180
Speaker 1: And we had a real fucking crack ops team.

379
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:56,099
Speaker 1: And when I worked for that broker-dealer, that was my first Wall Street job.

380
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:06,760
Speaker 1: I learned since then that that job, that company, probably had 100 times more operations than any other financial company on earth.

381
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,740
Speaker 1: And most people considered what that company that I worked for did to be way overkill.

382
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,220
Speaker 0: You mean the normal amount of stuff?

383
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:23,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, what I consider to be baby's first, bare minimum operations, is considered by the majority of companies in the world to be overkill.

384
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:49,178
Speaker 1: So you should actually be terrified of this, because basically no one has significantly capable operations teams to deal with outages, because clearly Delta underestimated the importance of this system, did not have high availability, did not have a rapid disaster recovery, did not have a break glass system of, "Hey, what if that system goes

385
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:49,520
Speaker 1: down?".

386
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:50,272
Speaker 1: "Wouldn't it be a

387
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:50,680
Speaker 1: disaster?".

388
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,777
Speaker 1: "Is there a procedure we can follow to mitigate that

389
00:26:53,838 --> 00:26:54,140
Speaker 1: damage?"?

390
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,799
Speaker 1: Apparently not.

391
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's weird too, if you look at the very top, right?

392
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:04,359
Speaker 0: The Googles, the Facebooks, the top tier, that shit really doesn't go down.

393
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:10,480
Speaker 0: I think way back in the day, I remember a couple times it happened, but only in the most infancies, right?

394
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,060
Speaker 0: Amazon went down once in the 90s or something, right?

395
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,895
Speaker 1: I mean Google Calendar or Gmail has gone down a few times in recent memory, but it was outages...

396
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,420
Speaker 0: It was years ago, it's so rare.

397
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:21,920
Speaker 1: No, there was an outage like a month or two ago.

398
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:23,020
Speaker 0: I don't remember that.

399
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,440
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember it, it happened.

400
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,680
Speaker 0: It didn't affect me, but anyway.

401
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,080
Speaker 1: Okay, it affected millions of people.

402
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:28,580
Speaker 0: All right.

403
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,200
Speaker 1: Just because you don't see things doesn't mean they don't happen.

404
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:31,819
Speaker 0: Anyway.

405
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,140
Speaker 1: But the outage lasted hours, and flights were not grounded because of it.

406
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:48,456
Speaker 0: Sure, but if you go to the second tier, Delta Airlines for example, or Blizzard Entertainment, you think someone who has systems that handle steam?

407
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,560
Speaker 1: Well what, Blizzard actually almost never has outages.

408
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,655
Speaker 0: They fuck up all the time actually, notably.

409
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,619
Speaker 0: Diablo 2 launch, oh, Diablo 3 launch, oh, their systems are down for days.

410
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,579
Speaker 1: Ah, but you wait a few days and everything's fine.

411
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,500
Speaker 0: But shouldn't their shit be working from the beginning?

412
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:15,140
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell you straight up, it costs so much to make things work from day one, especially under a high load peak, there's literally no money to be made, there's no reason to ever support that.

413
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,560
Speaker 1: And the real problem is expectations.

414
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,998
Speaker 1: People expect a giant new system launching day one, like Pokemon Go for example, to just work when a billion people hit it.

415
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,615
Speaker 0: It should.

416
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,344
Speaker 1: Why?

417
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,180
Speaker 1: It's not worth the money.

418
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,160
Speaker 1: You'll make the same money if it takes a few weeks for it to actually start working.

419
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,640
Speaker 0: Not if everyone gets pissed and they decide to not play your thing because you're just broke.

420
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,418
Speaker 1: That never happens.

421
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,060
Speaker 1: That never happens.

422
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,780
Speaker 0: Anyway.

423
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,658
Speaker 1: And look, even then, Overwatch came under a huge DDoS right after they banned all the cheaters in a sudden wave.

424
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,820
Speaker 0: Huge DDoS.

425
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,060
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, DDoSs, like legit ones, they're actually pretty difficult to mitigate.

426
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,560
Speaker 1: Like, there's a lot of systems that claim to mitigate DDoSs, but they still require a lot of tuning.

427
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,077
Speaker 1: And it's not just like, "Oh, the DDoS has

428
00:28:57,117 --> 00:28:57,460
Speaker 1: stopped.".

429
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,980
Speaker 1: It's more like services degraded for hours, possibly days, as you slowly heuristically tune to avoid the DDoS.

430
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,880
Speaker 0: That's why Cloudflare is actually making tons of money.

431
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:08,068
Speaker 1: Yeah.

432
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,680
Speaker 1: Cloudflare is still not perfect.

433
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:16,420
Speaker 1: And under a severe DDoS, you'll see a similar pattern of service degradation, not outage, but significant degradation.

434
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,439
Speaker 1: And then you slowly reapproach.

435
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:20,079
Speaker 1: You regress back to the mean.

436
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,620
Speaker 0: But when you use Cloudflare, your stuff doesn't get fucked up.

437
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:26,160
Speaker 0: It gets absorbed by all of Cloudflare.

438
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,240
Speaker 1: What it is also is that you're paying someone else to do that.

439
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:31,817
Speaker 1: It's kind of like- It's not free.

440
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,800
Speaker 0: They have a free option, actually.

441
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:33,973
Speaker 0: They do.

442
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:35,000
Speaker 1: And you know what?

443
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:35,754
Speaker 1: You want the real one.

444
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:38,659
Speaker 1: That free option, you should just use it if you can.

445
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

446
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,460
Speaker 0: But you can pay for the real option.

447
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

448
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,320
Speaker 0: It's not actually that expensive if you're just a little tiny website.

449
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,680
Speaker 1: But the thing is, if you outsource to a company like that, their job is deal with this weird edge case that happens occasionally.

450
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Speaker 1: Most companies, there's no money in dealing with the weird edge case that happens occasionally.

451
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 1: And most companies, there's no money in having a good operations team because the cost of an outage is still less than the cost of what ... To have a really good operations team, like on Wall Street, you need 20 people like me, and I'm not cheap.

452
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:18,959
Speaker 1: So, you're better off, or at least a lot of companies feel like they're better off, hiring people who cost- It would cost you many millions of dollars a year.

453
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:19,538
Speaker 1: Yup.

454
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,915
Speaker 1: So instead, hire people who cost a fourth what I cost, and you'll deal with the average outage.

455
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:29,580
Speaker 1: But in the event of a serious outage, you're fucked, and it takes forever to come back online and huge damages.

456
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,116
Speaker 1: And you know what?

457
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:32,760
Speaker 1: Those huge damages were probably still less.

458
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,879
Speaker 0: Were the huge damages less than the millions a year?

459
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, sometimes.

460
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,000
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

461
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:37,997
Speaker 0: How do you know?

462
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:39,139
Speaker 1: You don't.

463
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,860
Speaker 0: And what's the insurance company going to charge if you want to pay for protection against?

464
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:50,840
Speaker 1: I would love to know if and how the damages caused by Delta's issue were covered by insurance because- They might not have been.

465
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,276
Speaker 0: They might have just been like, "Oh, we fucked

466
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:52,417
Speaker 0: up.".

467
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,240
Speaker 0: In which case, they should have paid the more obvs people and considered their salaries to be insurance premiums.

468
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:04,477
Speaker 1: Now, I've also seen companies where they decide that the potential damages are a cost of doing business.

469
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,160
Speaker 0: Yeah.

470
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:07,700
Speaker 1: And that's actually really common.

471
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,140
Speaker 0: They just work it into the budget.

472
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,799
Speaker 0: They're like, "Oh, part of the budget this year.

473
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:13,978
Speaker 0: We're going to allocate $2 million to this outage we're going to have.

474
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,400
Speaker 0: that's going to make all our customers upset.

475
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:15,602
Speaker 0: All

476
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:15,766
Speaker 0: right.".

477
00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:17,137
Speaker 1: But I'll tell you this.

478
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:26,700
Speaker 1: Usually these problems, like what Delta had, the general case for this is not a super high tech solution or a serious technical hurdle or problem.

479
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:42,720
Speaker 1: Really, it just takes having someone who's relatively smart and relatively technical and relatively capable, spend the time to look at what your business does, know what it does, and be able to ask questions like, "So what would happen if that thing went down?

480
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,689
Speaker 1: Could you guys recover from

481
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:43,871
Speaker 1: that?".

482
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,479
Speaker 1: Oh, you couldn't.

483
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,518
Speaker 1: You don't know what that thing is, do you?

484
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,440
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

485
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:57,519
Speaker 1: This was a little thing.

486
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:11,899
Speaker 1: It's a little game where you can load the New York City subway system from various eras, including the planned system for 2025, and you can then modify the New York City subway system by adding and removing stations and lines and-

487
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:15,139
Speaker 0: I tried this thing and it was so broken, I just gave up in 10 seconds.

488
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,460
Speaker 1: See, you say that, but it worked completely fine for me, and I actually started designing.

489
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:28,280
Speaker 1: what I thought was ... I started seriously trying to improve the subway system in New York based on my knowledge- From Queens to Brooklyn.

490
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,560
Speaker 1: Actually, only one more, but also extending the seven down, and then having an 11 line- You can now go from Flushing south.

491
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:47,420
Speaker 1: I had an 11 line that follows Super Express on the seven line, but also connecting across from Astoria into the Bronx, and anyway, but the system- Yeah, Queens to Bronx.

492
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,239
Speaker 0: We need that line.

493
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,959
Speaker 0: Actually, a line there, so the cool thing about- Just have a train go over the tribe of our bridge, like whoosh.

494
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 1: I was looking at some of those lines, places you could put trains to anyway.

495
00:32:57,162 --> 00:33:05,920
Speaker 1: If you don't live in New York, you don't give any shits about this, but if you do live in New York, this is real fun, but more importantly, it does a cool thing.

496
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:21,099
Speaker 1: It's actually based on data, and it estimates how the ridership, what effect the changes you were making would have on how many people use the system daily, and it estimates how much a MetroCard would cost if you had to pay for the new system.

497
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:27,659
Speaker 0: It's actually based on census data, jobs data- Because I'm going to tax cars to pay for it.

498
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,299
Speaker 0: Commuting data- That's my system.

499
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:44,480
Speaker 1: But it basically, it uses data to show you a pretty interesting overall heuristic analysis of what the changes you propose would do to the system, and I tried it out, like yeah, if you had a bunch of bullshit everywhere, the system just gets way worse.

500
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:50,614
Speaker 1: It knows, but we could have a really cool subway system if we were just willing to pay for it.

501
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,140
Speaker 0: We could have a really cool everything if we were willing to pay for it.

502
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you got a thing of the day?

503
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,199
Speaker 0: I do.

504
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:04,199
Speaker 0: So this dude, he's biking around, and he's biking around, and he gets up on the sidewalk, and a cop immediately walks out to him.

505
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,240
Speaker 1: Was that a cop or a bobby?

506
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,998
Speaker 0: Bobby walks out to him and says, "Hey, why you got your bike in the sidewalk

507
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:12,239
Speaker 0: there?".

508
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,719
Speaker 0: And he's like getting ready to give him a ticket, and he says, "This is a little bike path here.

509
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,513
Speaker 0: It goes over the sidewalk to the next

510
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:18,775
Speaker 0: road.".

511
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,177
Speaker 0: And the bobby looks down and he says, "Oh, I guess it

512
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:23,398
Speaker 0: does.".

513
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:24,378
Speaker 0: All right.

514
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:25,351
Speaker 0: Wow.

515
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,056
Speaker 0: It's a good day.

516
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,620
Speaker 1: What a weird ending.

517
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:28,219
Speaker 0: Yeah.

518
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,540
Speaker 0: That's so unusual.

519
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,737
Speaker 1: That is not how it would go down in the US.

520
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,500
Speaker 1: You'd be lucky if you didn't get shot.

521
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:35,936
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

522
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:50,088
Speaker 1: I mean, New York, there's that video of the dude who literally got a ticket for riding his bicycle in the street, which was legal, and the reason he was in the street was because the bike lane was blocked by the car

523
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,935
Speaker 0: of the cop who wrote

524
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:54,038
Speaker 1: him a ticket for not using the bike lane.

525
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Speaker 0: Which isn't even an offense.

526
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,519
Speaker 1: Even though it's not illegal to not use the bike lane.

527
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,260
Speaker 0: That's right.

528
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,816
Speaker 1: So the cop blocked the bike lane and then wrote him a ticket for legally not using the bike lane.

529
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,459
Speaker 0: This has happened at least once to my knowledge.

530
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:06,913
Speaker 1: Yup.

531
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,590
Speaker 1: And I don't know what to say.

532
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,179
Speaker 1: other than American cops shouldn't have guns.

533
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:14,380
Speaker 1: Can we just hire Britain to send us their cops?

534
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,459
Speaker 0: They don't have enough of them.

535
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,399
Speaker 0: They don't have a lot of land.

536
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
Speaker 1: Why don't we do an exchange program?

537
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,379
Speaker 1: We'll send them a bunch of our cops.

538
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,216
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea, right?

539
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,560
Speaker 0: It's like how many cops are in London, right?

540
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,600
Speaker 0: Take half of them, move them to New York and we'll send you the same number of our cops to go to London.

541
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,879
Speaker 1: I don't think they want our cops.

542
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,600
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

543
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:41,640
Speaker 0: No, our cops will have to learn how to be London cops with no guns and then we'll cycle like student exchange program until we've cycled all of them, right?

544
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,599
Speaker 1: What if the problem is the cops that come here might want to start wanting guns?

545
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:47,139
Speaker 0: Uh, maybe.

546
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:50,438
Speaker 1: We might make things worse instead of better, depends on it.

547
00:35:51,121 --> 00:36:00,659
Speaker 0: I imagine they will both get quite an education in how shit goes down and you know, there's not really a language barrier and eventually everyone will have cycled.

548
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,260
Speaker 1: So you know, I travel a lot and I want to say, I want to point this kind of an aside.

549
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:12,659
Speaker 1: There is more of a language barrier than you think because when I am in London, I mean, you're not talking to someone from Wales.

550
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,940
Speaker 0: You're talking to someone from London.

551
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:24,956
Speaker 1: When I am in London, it is surprising how often at a bar or a restaurant I will order something from the menu and the waiter will not understand me and I have to repeat myself multiple times.

552
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,820
Speaker 0: What if you try fake British accent?

553
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:32,860
Speaker 1: So I feel like that would just offend people.

554
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,959
Speaker 1: However, I have sort of picked up enough of an Australian accent.

555
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,819
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

556
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,924
Speaker 0: You think it would offend them.

557
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:49,860
Speaker 0: yet if you ask an Australian or someone from the UK or an English speaking person anywhere on earth who's not from the US to say, please do an American accent invitation.

558
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:50,819
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so great.

559
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,500
Speaker 0: They would love to hear your fake British accent.

560
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,017
Speaker 1: In London I haven't because it would have felt weird and also I feel like I couldn't do it.

561
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,480
Speaker 1: I would come off like, I would sound like Monty Python at best.

562
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,465
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is like.

563
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:10,280
Speaker 0: at the one hand, I feel like if I went to say Scotland and said, they would be like, would they be offended?

564
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:21,080
Speaker 0: Maybe I shouldn't do that and I probably wouldn't, but at the same time I know that there's someone in Scotland who wants to hear me say, ah, let's talk like Scrooge McDuck and would be so happy to hear me do that.

565
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,580
Speaker 1: When I'm trying to speak French in France, like the last time I was in Paris.

566
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:32,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's definitely someone in France who wants me to say, and there's someone in France who if I say that will want to kill me.

567
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,520
Speaker 1: But there was a Frenchman in France who gave me some advice.

568
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,679
Speaker 1: There was a waiter and he was super nice and he was really funny.

569
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:44,540
Speaker 1: This was the same guy who was pretending not to speak English for this other horrific tourist that I saw on the other part of the restaurant.

570
00:37:45,141 --> 00:38:05,140
Speaker 1: But he suggested to me that when I'm speaking my rudimentary French to imagine a stereotypical French accent and affect it and it would sort of even out the awkwardness of me not speaking French very well and I would sound, it would make it easier for people to understand me and it kind of worked and I, and the same thing worked kind of well in Australia.

571
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:20,578
Speaker 1: Like when I'm there, I'll sort of just slur my words and draw my vowels and try to not say the letter R and it probably sounds kind of dumb, but at the same time, waiters asked me to repeat myself way less often when I do that.

572
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:24,420
Speaker 1: Like if I'm like a long black, like I kind of brought out like that.

573
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Speaker 1: No one ever says what, but if I say, yeah, can I have a long black?

574
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,440
Speaker 1: They're like, what, what, what do you want?

575
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,820
Speaker 1: What in the meta moment?

576
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,140
Speaker 1: The booklet book was Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

577
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,278
Speaker 1: We did the show.

578
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:37,059
Speaker 1: You should read the book and listen to the show.

579
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,679
Speaker 1: It was a really good book.

580
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,597
Speaker 0: Oh, Oh.

581
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,480
Speaker 0: Do you know the book?

582
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,540
Speaker 0: I forgot to completely forgot to tell you what the book club was.

583
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,658
Speaker 1: What's the new book going to be?

584
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,120
Speaker 1: Is it going to be the mad Adam trilogy?

585
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,519
Speaker 0: No, there's actually two books that can be, I got to pick one of the two.

586
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,680
Speaker 1: Oh, you haven't picked yet.

587
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,918
Speaker 0: I will do so right now.

588
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,900
Speaker 1: So I'll warn you if this book is good, I got a good idea for the next book club.

589
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:59,360
Speaker 1: If the book you choose is one that I do not approve of, there's a nonfiction book.

590
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,360
Speaker 0: I don't see any reason to disprove of either of these books.

591
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,580
Speaker 1: So I just say it, I got a nonfiction book.

592
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,257
Speaker 1: I kind of want to use.

593
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,060
Speaker 0: There's this one book, right?

594
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:10,879
Speaker 0: That has been like, apparently this is the hot fantasy thing right now.

595
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,179
Speaker 0: And we know we love the hot.

596
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,540
Speaker 1: We're already reading the prince of nothing.

597
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,760
Speaker 0: No, this is supposed to be the hottest thing.

598
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Speaker 0: It's by some lady from Brooklyn, right?

599
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,120
Speaker 0: It's called the fifth season by NK Jemisin.

600
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,380
Speaker 0: Like this is like the hottest thing right now in the fantasy world, right?

601
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,539
Speaker 0: So we can go with that or the other thing we can go with.

602
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:32,180
Speaker 0: I bought on Kindle.

603
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:32,879
Speaker 0: It was so cheap.

604
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:33,717
Speaker 0: I did not know.

605
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:35,739
Speaker 0: Actually, let me let me ask for him here, rim.

606
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:37,120
Speaker 0: Alfred Hitchcock.

607
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,959
Speaker 0: We like him, right?

608
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a fan.

609
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,520
Speaker 0: He makes good.

610
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,020
Speaker 0: He made good movies when he was alive.

611
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,079
Speaker 1: They had a really good TV show.

612
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,819
Speaker 0: What was the best movie he made?

613
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,600
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

614
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,400
Speaker 1: Like you have to break it down by era.

615
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:57,180
Speaker 1: I mean, he was quite the best like technically or the one that I think he was quite prolific.

616
00:39:57,366 --> 00:39:57,618
Speaker 0: Right.

617
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,979
Speaker 1: Well, like I really, really like the lady vanishes.

618
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,574
Speaker 0: Whatever.

619
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:03,100
Speaker 0: All right.

620
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
Speaker 0: What movie he made is Scott's favorite movie.

621
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:06,740
Speaker 0: Yes, right.

622
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,620
Speaker 0: What is what movie he made is Scott's second favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie.

623
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:13,079
Speaker 1: Not the birds.

624
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,035
Speaker 1: The 39 steps.

625
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Speaker 0: No, birds is kind of lame.

626
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Speaker 0: I don't like birds.

627
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,379
Speaker 0: I don't know why people like that.

628
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,760
Speaker 1: It's not the man who knew too little or too much or whatever.

629
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,759
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

630
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:26,720
Speaker 1: You will pretty much only ever talk about Rear Window.

631
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,360
Speaker 0: No, that's because it's the best movie.

632
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:34,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, the movie that is the second best Alfred Hitchcock movie is Rebecca.

633
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,540
Speaker 0: Have you seen Rebecca?

634
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,879
Speaker 1: I've never actually seen Rebecca.

635
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,039
Speaker 0: Well, that's fucked up.

636
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,340
Speaker 0: So anyway, uh, Rebecca is like one of the best movies ever made.

637
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Speaker 1: Full disclosure, I've seen more of Hitchcock's like weird, like way early movies.

638
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,219
Speaker 0: Because you watched from that box set.

639
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:48,469
Speaker 0: Yeah.

640
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,460
Speaker 0: You don't watch anything else because you're an uncultured heathen.

641
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,099
Speaker 1: Oh, and then I pirated off a complete collection of Hitchcock.

642
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're some uncultured heathen anyway.

643
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,660
Speaker 1: Actually, lately I've been watching a bunch of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

644
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:57,992
Speaker 0: Well, fine.

645
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,439
Speaker 0: Watch Rebecca today.

646
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,020
Speaker 0: All right.

647
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:12,240
Speaker 0: Uh, but I did not know because I'm stupid until maybe like a month ago that Rebecca based on a book, the book is called Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier.

648
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,240
Speaker 1: Maybe I should read the book before I watch the movie because then I'll have the perspective of not tainted by the movie.

649
00:41:18,306 --> 00:41:19,320
Speaker 0: Uh, that would be weird.

650
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

651
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,199
Speaker 1: That's a rare opportunity.

652
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,219
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it would be like someone watching Terminator 2 for the first time not having had it spoiled for them.

653
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:27,660
Speaker 0: Sure.

654
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:33,780
Speaker 0: Um, I don't know how many pages are in the book cause I only have this Kindle version which is ridiculously inexpensive.

655
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:41,040
Speaker 0: Um, I don't know how long it is, but uh, I assume it's a crazy good book.

656
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:47,319
Speaker 0: So one or both of these and you know what, whichever one I don't pick, the other one's probably going to be the next one.

657
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:48,279
Speaker 1: Those are pretty good.

658
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,238
Speaker 1: So I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to do the nonfiction book that I really want to do.

659
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,878
Speaker 1: So you've got to reprieve.

660
00:41:53,763 --> 00:42:02,940
Speaker 1: I always threaten you with Dumas, but I feel like if the choice was, you know, the Count Lecompton Monte Cristo or nonfiction, you'd probably rather like the Count.

661
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,459
Speaker 0: All right, so, so what mood are you in?

662
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:15,076
Speaker 0: Are you in a mood for, Ooh, there's a, you know, a house and this dude is haunted by, you know, his dead wife or whatever or some kind of fantasy thing that's supposedly so hot right now.

663
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:22,899
Speaker 1: So I'm actually more in the mood for Rebecca because, all right, so I just read the entire fucking wheel of time.

664
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:24,736
Speaker 1: You want to learn about trollocs?

665
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,239
Speaker 1: Tell you all about trollocs.

666
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:26,719
Speaker 0: I don't care.

667
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,259
Speaker 0: So let's read.

668
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,657
Speaker 1: Fourteen books of trollocs.

669
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,040
Speaker 0: So you have to read Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, French.

670
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:39,396
Speaker 0: And then, uh, we will later read the fifth season.

671
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,998
Speaker 0: so you can get on that fifth season now if you really want to.

672
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,820
Speaker 1: But you know, I guess I'll pick a book in between those two.

673
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,920
Speaker 0: I'll probably just read one and then read the other.

674
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,200
Speaker 1: I got a few ideas.

675
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,640
Speaker 1: I kind of want to read the mad Adam trilogy really quick, but I'll read the book club book first and those aren't going to be the book club.

676
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,739
Speaker 1: No, I'm just going to read them.

677
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm also going to read it.

678
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,679
Speaker 1: I kind of, I want, especially now that I know I've read more snaps as to what the other two are about.

679
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:09,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to read the other two books, especially because multiple people have said repeatedly that the other two books are both better than Oryx and Craig.

680
00:43:09,437 --> 00:43:10,937
Speaker 1: and then Oryx and Craig is still super good.

681
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,999
Speaker 1: So if it's better than Oryx and Craig, I liked Oryx and Craig, so it's only, everything's coming up Milhouse there.

682
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,479
Speaker 0: Also watch the movie Rebecca, what the fuck is wrong with you?

683
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,519
Speaker 1: I'm going to read the book first.

684
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,380
Speaker 0: That's about enough.

685
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,039
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

686
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,654
Speaker 1: I've read it.

687
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,900
Speaker 0: I have a feeling this is a movie better than book situation.

688
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,098
Speaker 1: It very much could be.

689
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,678
Speaker 0: I don't know.

690
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,080
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not, but that's why I kind of want to see otherwise at PAX West, which is coming up sooner than you think less than a month.

691
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:44,940
Speaker 1: We were doing on Saturday, September 35 PM in the chicken theater, the grind, our newest lecture, all new market on it, and if it's good, it's the only time we'll do it live probably.

692
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,619
Speaker 0: So you'll see why we won't do it again.

693
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:49,360
Speaker 1: Well, if we, if we do, I only stopped doing a lecture.

694
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:52,820
Speaker 1: If the video of it that we get at a particular convention is perfect.

695
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,899
Speaker 0: Like if it's really good, like, well, I'll be using this at magfest and shit, what are you talking about?

696
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,720
Speaker 1: All right, fine.

697
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,700
Speaker 1: It'll be the only time we'll do it at a PAX West.

698
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:01,500
Speaker 0: That's probably true.

699
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:02,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

700
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,556
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm also going to be a PAX dev and I just looked at the schedule.

701
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:07,220
Speaker 0: cause the whole schedule Yeah, they put the schedule up.

702
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,099
Speaker 1: There's some real good looking stuff.

703
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:13,760
Speaker 1: The one I'm most interested in, cause it's relevant to us, I guess the schedule is public knowledge.

704
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:37,660
Speaker 1: It's one on designing, you know, tabletop games or whatever, but specifically with one purpose, like one goal, one angle, and the angle is if you're going to physically actually print produce the game, like it's different kinds of rules or pieces that maybe make it impossible to publish your game because you don't know how to deal with Chinese factories, all that kind of stuff.

705
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,480
Speaker 0: So I just make a game cards and cards only.

706
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:40,754
Speaker 0: Yup.

707
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,020
Speaker 1: It's really easy to get cards.

708
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:42,595
Speaker 0: I know.

709
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:43,680
Speaker 0: I don't have to know anything.

710
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,878
Speaker 0: If I know I'm going to print cards and put them in a box.

711
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,138
Speaker 1: So I need interlocking cubes.

712
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,819
Speaker 1: These cubes have to interlock like puzzle pieces.

713
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,179
Speaker 0: I invented Blockus.

714
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,074
Speaker 0: How am I going to make it?

715
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,380
Speaker 1: And seems like the answer is usually you're not, but they made Blockus.

716
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:57,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

717
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,260
Speaker 0: I mean they make fucking mousetrap.

718
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:00,940
Speaker 1: Mousetrap.

719
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,519
Speaker 1: Well, mousetrap never really worked.

720
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:03,577
Speaker 0: Worked for me.

721
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,220
Speaker 1: I never got the original mousetrap set like the original original one.

722
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,119
Speaker 0: I don't know which one you had.

723
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,519
Speaker 0: The mousetrap I had worked just fine.

724
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:13,040
Speaker 1: Mine was so old that it was like this ancient thing in my grandma's house.

725
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:25,040
Speaker 0: I definitely didn't have the oldest available mousetrap that has ever been made, but I had seen mousetraps that were super old and they were not significantly different in design than mine, except mine was made of like cheapo plastic in some parts.

726
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,880
Speaker 1: I wonder if someone's uploaded a 3D print of all the pieces for mousetrap.

727
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:28,998
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could.

728
00:45:29,503 --> 00:45:30,359
Speaker 1: I'm curious if someone did.

729
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,298
Speaker 0: You know.

730
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:31,873
Speaker 1: Yeah.

731
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,520
Speaker 1: Otherwise.

732
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,980
Speaker 0: I guess you can't 3D print the rubber band or the marble, the metal ball.

733
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:37,455
Speaker 1: Yup.

734
00:45:37,942 --> 00:45:39,280
Speaker 1: Otherwise, stay tuned for magfest.

735
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:45,199
Speaker 1: I think hotels went live, so I guess if you need a hotel room, it's probably all sold out and it's too late and you can't go to magfest now.

736
00:45:46,723 --> 00:45:48,197
Speaker 1: I guess badges are on sale, I think.

737
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,015
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

738
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,560
Speaker 1: Will be at magfest.

739
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,559
Speaker 1: We filled out the form.

740
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:53,620
Speaker 1: Will be there doing the same stuff.

741
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,899
Speaker 1: We always do at magfest.

742
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,260
Speaker 1: Magfest is our favorite non-Paxcon.

743
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,640
Speaker 1: It is approaching equal, but different.

744
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,440
Speaker 1: Like if you had to choose between Pax East and magfest, kind of would say magfest.

745
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:11,436
Speaker 1: But if you had to choose between Pax Prime and magfest, I think Pax Prime still edges it out.

746
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,580
Speaker 1: So we've done a lot of shows on computer components and I think we've covered pretty much everything.

747
00:46:20,063 --> 00:46:34,540
Speaker 1: So there's not much left, so I guess we're going to talk about, and this will be a short show, kind of on purpose, all the weird peripherals, like specialized crap, anything that isn't like a normal thing, like things that you don't automatically buy when you buy a new computer.

748
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:42,520
Speaker 0: Most people buy a mouse and a keyboard, but there's so many other input devices that are only for specialized purposes, most of which I've never bought or used.

749
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:43,259
Speaker 1: Let's see.

750
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,039
Speaker 1: What have I bought ever?

751
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:53,280
Speaker 0: I bought- They've got crazy 3D things you can get, and I've seen things in the past that were gimmicks, like finger- Remember the mouse man, the 3D mouse?

752
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, the stuff like that.

753
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,419
Speaker 0: There was a thing where you put it on your finger and it said you worked with brain waves, but it didn't really work.

754
00:46:59,521 --> 00:46:59,917
Speaker 0: It was bullshit.

755
00:47:00,748 --> 00:47:01,019
Speaker 1: Let's see.

756
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:05,700
Speaker 0: I once bought a keyboard- Toy sticks and game pads, but I mean, that's just common sense, right?

757
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,960
Speaker 1: We don't need to talk about those.

758
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,640
Speaker 1: I bought a long time ago a keyboard extension.

759
00:47:10,342 --> 00:47:25,137
Speaker 1: It was like a thing that you put plugged into your keyboard slot, and then you plug your keyboard into it, and it had some buttons on it, and those buttons, you could map them to be special keys, and I basically used it as a gaming input device, except it barely worked.

760
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,839
Speaker 1: It was a piece of shit.

761
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:43,600
Speaker 0: I mean, my earliest keyboards, I bought one that had extra buttons on it, but at one point, I was using the Happy Hacking keyboard, which had no numpad, and I wanted a numpad, so I bought this thing that was a numpad and a wireless mouse, wireless numpad mouse combo deal, and it had weird stuff.

762
00:47:43,820 --> 00:48:01,420
Speaker 0: It was also a timer and a clock and a thermometer, it told you the room temperature and all this stuff, and I bought one, it totally worked, and I used it a bunch, and also, I would sometimes just take the wireless mouse part only and use it with a laptop, and it was quite a useful thing when I had it, but now I have no use for that anymore.

763
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:12,880
Speaker 1: So I guess the only things that we use, that we have a lot of experience with, the only things we've bought in the modern era of computing that really constitutes specialized input, I guess except game pads, but that's one.

764
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,619
Speaker 0: I already said, there's nothing to say about game pads.

765
00:48:15,585 --> 00:48:16,300
Speaker 1: You know what I could say?

766
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,220
Speaker 1: The Steam controller is kind of shitty.

767
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:19,760
Speaker 0: It's average.

768
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:20,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's eh.

769
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,719
Speaker 0: You're probably better off with your PlayStation or Xbox controller plugging into the PC.

770
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,160
Speaker 1: Yup.

771
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:37,160
Speaker 1: But the two things that both Scott and I have are drawing tablets, or at least Scott has a drawing tablet and I have a drawing tablet, and I have a basically video editing knob.

772
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,660
Speaker 0: Right, and obviously if you're a person who draws, you want to get the fanciest Wacom, maybe even the Cintiq, because like, whoa man, right?

773
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,419
Speaker 0: That's like the best drawing thing there is in the world, but if you can't draw, why the hell would you want one of these things?

774
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,154
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of tools that are beyond the scope of this episode, because like my giant mixer.

775
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,920
Speaker 0: I've never used one except at a demo station.

776
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,479
Speaker 1: Well look, yes, I've played with them at PAX's.

777
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:00,759
Speaker 1: That's literally it.

778
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,680
Speaker 1: But like the giant mixer that I'm touching next to my computer.

779
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,259
Speaker 0: It's not a computer peripheral, really.

780
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:12,411
Speaker 1: Well, it's a weird specialized peripheral for professionals, but you only need it if you have a super specialized ultra professional, like.

781
00:49:12,552 --> 00:49:17,640
Speaker 1: never buy something like that unless you are using that for like a job, because the Cintiq is like that.

782
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,080
Speaker 0: But the cheapo Wacoms tablet, like the cheapest, cheapest one is actually way, way cheap.

783
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:23,520
Speaker 0: It's like less than a hundred bucks.

784
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:24,780
Speaker 0: The tiny crappy one.

785
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:30,518
Speaker 0: And you know what, if you have a computer, it's actually not a bad idea to buy that no matter what.

786
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:40,240
Speaker 0: Because even if you rarely use it, that one time you want to like do something in MS paint or make a funny drawing or even just using the windows snip tool for a screenshot.

787
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,716
Speaker 1: And then you will like write a note on the screenshot before you send it to someone.

788
00:49:44,118 --> 00:49:46,820
Speaker 0: compared to doing it with the mouse or having to own a tablet.

789
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,980
Speaker 0: It's like an iPad tablet.

790
00:49:49,605 --> 00:49:50,339
Speaker 0: It's so cheap.

791
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:51,567
Speaker 0: It's like, why not have?

792
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:53,740
Speaker 0: you could even buy the old version of the crappy one.

793
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,520
Speaker 0: It'll be just fine.

794
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,040
Speaker 0: You can probably get a used one that someone got rid of like 20 bucks.

795
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:57,939
Speaker 1: So here's what I use mine.

796
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,980
Speaker 0: I have actually the medium level one.

797
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:09,020
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good with buttons on the side, because even though I don't draw for photo editing, if you do photo photography stuff, it's way good and useful.

798
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:13,460
Speaker 0: Like, oh crap, I need to make this person's face brighter and you can do that the mouse or you do it the pen.

799
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:13,822
Speaker 0: It's just.

800
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:15,920
Speaker 0: it just makes your life so much easier.

801
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,640
Speaker 0: More comfortable.

802
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,358
Speaker 1: It's like one of the things I do at work and it's inexpensive.

803
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,020
Speaker 0: Only the way the Cintiq ones that are also monitors are expensive, really.

804
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,280
Speaker 1: But I'm a UX designer.

805
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,860
Speaker 1: So one of the things I do is I just draw and I use mischief just like a drawing pad.

806
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:33,559
Speaker 1: And the cool thing about it is it's just a vector drawing tool with infinite zoom and an infinite canvas.

807
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:36,040
Speaker 1: So just draw all over it and save it, whatever.

808
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,280
Speaker 0: So I would not waste paper.

809
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:38,700
Speaker 1: Yeah.

810
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:45,260
Speaker 1: So basically, whenever I'm at work, any time I would use paper, I just draw with my tablet instead.

811
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:46,660
Speaker 0: I stop doodling on paper.

812
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:48,160
Speaker 0: I doodle on my iPad with a magic pencil.

813
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:48,456
Speaker 1: Yeah.

814
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:49,539
Speaker 1: Like I don't keep anything.

815
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,317
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, my God.

816
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,460
Speaker 0: Magic pencils, a ripoff for one hundred bucks.

817
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,258
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

818
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,840
Speaker 0: It is a super ripoff for one hundred bucks and magic pencil.

819
00:50:56,321 --> 00:51:01,500
Speaker 0: But I've already saved more than one hundred dollars in ink and pens and papers of doodles.

820
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,479
Speaker 1: But the other thing I use them for is that I can make better doodles.

821
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,320
Speaker 1: Most tablet interfaces are also a multi-touch pad like you'd have on a super fancy laptop.

822
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:21,420
Speaker 1: The use of that is one, if I'm playing like Civ five, actually leaning back, holding that tablet to interact with the game instead of using my mouse way better.

823
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,180
Speaker 1: And also, if I'm playing Civ five on my laptop, no laptop has a good touchpad anymore unless you get a MacBook.

824
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:33,239
Speaker 1: So I pretty much need that to do anything on my laptop at this point.

825
00:51:35,144 --> 00:51:36,440
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I don't really use it for anything.

826
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:38,000
Speaker 1: But see, it's a specialized.

827
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,019
Speaker 0: It's so worth the small price paid for it.

828
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:40,252
Speaker 1: Yeah.

829
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,469
Speaker 1: It's like you pay a nominal fee to have an augmented device next to your mouse for specialized input.

830
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,158
Speaker 0: Like if you have Photoshop installed on your computer or Lightroom installed on your computer, you should have one.

831
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:55,440
Speaker 0: If not, you know, maybe buy the super cheap one if you can get a discount.

832
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,029
Speaker 0: Otherwise.

833
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:56,832
Speaker 0: Yeah.

834
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,312
Speaker 1: Yep.

835
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:06,260
Speaker 1: The moment the first time you ever are trying to draw something in the gimp, even if it's something dumb, you should probably just buy one of these things and use it for that forever.

836
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:11,436
Speaker 0: So you never need to like replace it or as long as you don't break it, it'll be good forever.

837
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,819
Speaker 0: As long as USB is still a thing.

838
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:14,431
Speaker 1: So this jog wheel I got now.

839
00:52:14,471 --> 00:52:15,800
Speaker 1: originally I was going to go way cheaper.

840
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:25,480
Speaker 1: I was thinking because all I really was the problem was one day I was using Premiere after an update and they reversed what the mouse wheel does in some of the interfaces.

841
00:52:26,462 --> 00:52:29,900
Speaker 1: And also they changed the way the sensitivity were made up was down and down was up.

842
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,320
Speaker 0: Basically, you can change it in the options preferences.

843
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,453
Speaker 1: You could change it kind of, but not a hundred percent.

844
00:52:35,473 --> 00:52:37,137
Speaker 1: like I couldn't get it back to the way I liked it.

845
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,900
Speaker 1: And even then, my pipeline was not great because you couldn't just adapt to the new way.

846
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:44,500
Speaker 1: So the problem was my workflow.

847
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,116
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

848
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:49,260
Speaker 1: My workflow, because I added a lot more video than you, was never super optimal.

849
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,500
Speaker 1: Kind of like how imagine doing your workflows in Lightroom without a tablet.

850
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,699
Speaker 1: Like I use Lightroom.

851
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,780
Speaker 0: I'd be okay if I didn't, you know, sometimes you don't got to draw on a picture.

852
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:06,460
Speaker 1: But like my, my, uh, my workflows in Premiere or like my workflows in Lightroom are way simple so I don't use it often enough to need the specialized input.

853
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:09,180
Speaker 1: Like yeah, maybe I'm not as efficient, but it doesn't matter.

854
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:11,200
Speaker 1: Like you don't need to be more efficient.

855
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,160
Speaker 0: It's not really about the efficiency so much.

856
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,100
Speaker 0: Actually I could be more efficient.

857
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,960
Speaker 0: It's also less pleasant.

858
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,700
Speaker 0: It's when you have to do stuff that's sort of like drawing, right?

859
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:26,720
Speaker 0: Like I got to brighten up the sky and you got to like drag this gradiated filter or you want, you're poking at someone's face, you're moving all their like zits and shit.

860
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,069
Speaker 0: Right.

861
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,980
Speaker 0: You don't remove natural things like a mole, but you know, someone's got like a zit.

862
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,760
Speaker 0: It's like you got to hit it with the, you know, and like going clicking on the thing is a lot more less pleasant than, you know, going with the pen.

863
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

864
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,058
Speaker 1: But it's the comfort thing too.

865
00:53:39,221 --> 00:53:41,640
Speaker 1: Like it's less comfortable to do the suboptimal thing.

866
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,080
Speaker 1: But say I only edit video a couple of times a year.

867
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:44,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

868
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,260
Speaker 1: Just adapt.

869
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:45,718
Speaker 1: It's fine.

870
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:47,599
Speaker 1: But I edit video almost every day.

871
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,640
Speaker 1: Like I added a lot of video.

872
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,038
Speaker 1: I fuck around premiere all the time.

873
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:58,459
Speaker 1: So getting the specialized knob, not only did I get around the minor annoyance, how does a knob that turn help with video editing?

874
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,820
Speaker 1: So what you can't do with the mouse is there's two things.

875
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,680
Speaker 1: They're shuttling and there's jogging and they're very different use cases.

876
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:10,660
Speaker 1: So if I, so one, if I spin the wheel, every clicks like a mouse wheel.

877
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,815
Speaker 1: Every click is one frame.

878
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,680
Speaker 0: I mean my mouse wheel clicks.

879
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,278
Speaker 0: I can do that.

880
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:15,556
Speaker 1: Yeah.

881
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,439
Speaker 0: So if I spin it fast, my mouse wheel does that too.

882
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:18,711
Speaker 1: No.

883
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,540
Speaker 1: If I spin it fast, it does not accelerate or decelerate.

884
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,560
Speaker 1: It is just clicks equals frames by default in premiere.

885
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,897
Speaker 1: In most places, if you spin your mouse wheel real fast, it'll accelerate unless you go in and change a bunch of stuff.

886
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:36,580
Speaker 0: And it's not just that the, so your computer doesn't see this wheel as a mouse.

887
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,000
Speaker 1: Nope.

888
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,760
Speaker 1: It sees this wheel as a specialized interface.

889
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:42,000
Speaker 0: Is it like a game pad as far as windows is concerned?

890
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,220
Speaker 1: It has its own driver.

891
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:43,977
Speaker 1: It's its own thing.

892
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:48,479
Speaker 1: So it, so this is the thing is a specialized tool.

893
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,720
Speaker 1: So it has software and the drivers are set up.

894
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,340
Speaker 0: So premiere has special knowledge of this, the way that Photoshop has special knowledge of Wacom tablets.

895
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:01,761
Speaker 1: Premiere actually has special stuff for jog wheels and shuttles and all these things in general.

896
00:55:01,821 --> 00:55:08,699
Speaker 1: because if you're a super pro, you'll have a giant editing console and it just premiere just says, Oh, you have money.

897
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:10,699
Speaker 1: Let me just work with that thing.

898
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,419
Speaker 1: This is just the cheap version of that.

899
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,379
Speaker 1: So it's, it's got that one thing like, yeah, your mouse can do that.

900
00:55:17,741 --> 00:55:26,620
Speaker 1: But around the wheel, the, the, the, the wheel where I can do the frame by frame, I have another wheel that I can turn about 80 degrees in either direction.

901
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,919
Speaker 1: Then it stops and it Springs back to center.

902
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:30,099
Speaker 0: Oh, that kind.

903
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,400
Speaker 0: Okay.

904
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:30,696
Speaker 1: Yeah.

905
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,059
Speaker 1: So if you turn it forward a little bit, the move, the video starts playing at a crazy almost like a steering wheel.

906
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:36,434
Speaker 1: Yep.

907
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:42,199
Speaker 1: And the fast, the more I move it to the right, the faster the video plays and I can go back the same way.

908
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,000
Speaker 1: So thinking about when you're editing, I can be like, all right, Scott's talking.

909
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,840
Speaker 1: I know what he's saying.

910
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:48,240
Speaker 1: Wait, did I cough?

911
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,599
Speaker 1: And I let go and it stops.

912
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:51,780
Speaker 1: I go back a little bit like, yep, there's a cough.

913
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:57,419
Speaker 1: And then I, I switched from that to the frame by frame and I get to the X spot and then I got all these buttons.

914
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:04,860
Speaker 0: I have to do that, uh, by using the, like I'll control all and shift and different combinations and the arrow keys on the keyboard.

915
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,229
Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:06,299
Speaker 0: That's how I have to do it.

917
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,516
Speaker 1: So see, if I was only editing video and audio occasionally, then yeah, I would just do what Scott did.

918
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:12,219
Speaker 1: But I do this stuff all the time.

919
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:19,280
Speaker 1: The same thing works in audition for the audio and also the keys do all the buttons.

920
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,719
Speaker 1: There's a whole array of buttons on the top.

921
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,580
Speaker 0: Well that means you're putting your left hand on this wheel, right?

922
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,360
Speaker 0: And your right hand's on the mouse.

923
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,620
Speaker 0: So you need to be buttons there cause you can't hit any keyboard shortcuts.

924
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,820
Speaker 0: So you need buttons around the wheel just because you, even though you have buttons on your keyboard, you only really need the wheel.

925
00:56:35,481 --> 00:56:36,980
Speaker 0: You can't touch those keyboard buttons.

926
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,858
Speaker 0: You'd have to move your hand.

927
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,940
Speaker 0: Therefore the wheel must come with buttons.

928
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:44,340
Speaker 0: So same way with the Wacom tablet, it's like, yeah, I bought the Wacom tablet with buttons.

929
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:44,675
Speaker 0: Why?

930
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:50,000
Speaker 0: Because if I have it on my lap and the pen in my right hand, I can't have like my left hand over on the keyboard.

931
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:52,638
Speaker 1: It's like, you know what the most important button on my tablet is?

932
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,046
Speaker 1: Control Z. Yeah.

933
00:56:54,501 --> 00:57:06,320
Speaker 1: Because literally when I'm actually drawing in a vector thing, it's draw, draw, control Z, draw, draw, control Z, control Z. So yeah, putting your holding, putting your hand on the keyboard every time to control Z. No, I just tap the button on the upper left of my tablet.

934
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:09,819
Speaker 0: So there's not much more to say.

935
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:16,220
Speaker 1: I mean, it really just comes down to if you do something occasionally, just use the, use the generic tool.

936
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,339
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a whole world out there of specialized computer peripheral things that we're not using.

937
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,600
Speaker 1: I mean, but like think of this, if you do, if you, it's a general purpose computer, right?

938
00:57:26,062 --> 00:57:29,100
Speaker 1: So you can do pretty much anything with a mouse and keyboard.

939
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,200
Speaker 1: And unless you have a good reason, you might as well do everything with a mouse and keyboard.

940
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,180
Speaker 1: But like, kind of like how you own some cheap screwdrivers.

941
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,060
Speaker 1: They're pretty generic.

942
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,800
Speaker 1: They work okay.

943
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:42,700
Speaker 1: You don't need fancy screwdrivers in your house unless you use screwdrivers every day.

944
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:43,599
Speaker 0: You might need a power one.

945
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

946
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,758
Speaker 1: But the more you've, the more often you use screwdrivers, the better screwdrivers you should own.

947
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,019
Speaker 1: The more variety of screwdrivers you should own.

948
00:57:51,904 --> 00:57:52,760
Speaker 1: Same thing with the computer.

949
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,059
Speaker 0: So let us know about whatever weird thing you got plugged into your computer.

950
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,040
Speaker 0: that's not normal.

951
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:57,437
Speaker 1: Yeah.

952
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,010
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

953
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:08,130

959
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,210
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

960
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:38,761
Speaker 0: The

961
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:56,240

964
00:59:20,721 --> 00:59:41,451
Speaker 1: If you didn't notice, I post for at least the patrons above that super line that I'm starting an eight player patrons only Civ 5 game, seven of you and me, and we'll fight it out and I'll video all my turns and I won't necessarily publish those turns, at least not except on a significant delay, because otherwise you guys will just cheat and beat me.

965
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:54,058
Speaker 1: But if I don't get a full set of eight from the five dollar and up patrons within a few more days, we're getting close but not there yet, I'll open it up to all the patrons and I think it'll be fun.

966
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:06,880
Speaker 1: Fair warning, based on the people who have already requested to join the game, at least be okay at Civ before you join, otherwise you're just going to be fresh meat for the meat grinder.

967
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:12,918
Speaker 1: There's some people joining this game who I think are very good at Civ, that's the impression that I get.

968
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:30,599
Speaker 1: Expect some Rims Rants and Rimly reviews in the near near future as I continue to re-ramp up everything post-plague and post-Connecticon, and also I'm working real hard on editing that Atari game design panel together because I finally have enough good video and enough time and I have that knob.

969
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,199
Speaker 1: So now I leave you with something strange.

970
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,519
Speaker 1: So they've found it again, have they?

971
01:00:37,382 --> 01:00:38,617
Speaker 1: I thought we'd taken care of it.

972
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:41,919
Speaker 0: The forces of evil are persistent, sir.

973
01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:43,638
Speaker 1: I'm getting too old for this.

974
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,520
Speaker 1: Who have we got lined up to deal with this problem?

975
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:48,397
Speaker 0: Murphy, sir.

976
01:00:49,203 --> 01:00:50,839
Speaker 1: Oh no, not Murphy.

977
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:52,398
Speaker 0: Afraid so, sir.

978
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,535
Speaker 1: What about Spade or Marlowe?

979
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:56,820
Speaker 0: Uh, dead, sir.

980
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:58,379
Speaker 1: Isn't there anyone else?

981
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:01,399
Speaker 0: Sorry sir, he's next on the list.

982
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,799
Speaker 1: Well, I suppose we'll have to make do.

983
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,359
Speaker 1: Knowing Murphy, he's going to need help.

984
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:09,699
Speaker 1: A lot of help.

985
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:12,660
Speaker 1: I'll check the archives and get back to you, sir.
