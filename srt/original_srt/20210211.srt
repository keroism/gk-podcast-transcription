1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,812
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, February 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,293
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:15,979
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,940
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about calendars.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,548
Speaker 1: Let's do this All right?

6
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:30,139
Speaker 1: So when I was back in the office at work Right, I had this thing to play with.

7
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,429
Speaker 1: that was called the fidget cube that I kick-started.

8
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,714
Speaker 1: you can Pretty cheap.

9
00:00:35,055 --> 00:00:40,214
Speaker 1: It's just like a little knobbly and it's got buttons and spinners and you know, whatever right wait Are you not having this?

10
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:43,690
Speaker 0: Is that why you keep fucking with the knob up for the volume on geek night?

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,128
Speaker 1: I'm not fucking with that knob.

12
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:53,344
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was just you know Thinking like hey, I should get something to fiddle with at my home desk.

13
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,427
Speaker 1: That thing is still at work.

14
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:55,190
Speaker 1: I can't go get it.

15
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:06,250
Speaker 0: In my work desk are two geek nights microphones one of my cameras and one of them is I Got like I had some good stuff at the work desk.

16
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:10,468
Speaker 0: Anyway, and hopefully I hope not but I think there might be an apple in my drawer.

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,922
Speaker 1: Hopefully someone found that anyway, so I was thinking oh what should I?

18
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,087
Speaker 1: you know, I should get something to fiddle with.

19
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,483
Speaker 1: and now I realized You know what?

20
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,503
Speaker 1: My whole life I've never solved the Rubik's Cube.

21
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:26,250
Speaker 1: they got to be cheap a few bucks, right?

22
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:32,030
Speaker 1: I don't have to get into the like the speed cubing hobby that you know, I just like do it once like feel it.

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,255
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, I just want to.

24
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:37,533
Speaker 1: I just want to learn how to do the Rubik's Cube slowly and you know Normally right.

25
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,984
Speaker 0: and it's like I've never worse the Rubik's Cube without.

26
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,490
Speaker 1: I was about to ask if you've solved one.

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:51,170
Speaker 0: Nope I uh as a kid like I wanted to but I realized that much like a fellow the Heuristics of doing it are not natural and I didn't find them interesting and I kind of decided to never bother.

28
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:52,925
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that.

29
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:55,814
Speaker 1: So So I got.

30
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:56,839
Speaker 1: so I got.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,836
Speaker 1: not only did I get a Rubik's Cube, right I also saw that they had, you know You always see like they always have these.

32
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:08,417
Speaker 1: I knew that they had these more complex cubes for the people for whom The three by three is not enough.

33
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:11,508
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah what I didn't know and what I ordered?

34
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,141
Speaker 1: I was thinking Hey, this will help get me to solve the three by three.

35
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:17,550
Speaker 1: They make a two by two Rubik's Cube list.

36
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:24,030
Speaker 0: I feel like larger cubes while there's more to do are actually easier, but I can't back that up by anything.

37
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,359
Speaker 1: No, the the bigger it is.

38
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,801
Speaker 1: It's harder.

39
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,086
Speaker 1: It's just more work.

40
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:30,077
Speaker 0: Oh my god Here's the world record for a 15 by 15.

41
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:33,131
Speaker 0: It takes 10 minutes Yep.

42
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:40,450
Speaker 1: So anyway, so I get the Rubik's Cube and I'm trying to learn, you know Just how to solve it slowly normally consciously, right?

43
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,510
Speaker 1: I know there's websites you can go to where you type it.

44
00:02:42,570 --> 00:03:01,250
Speaker 1: You basically tell it what your cube looks like now and it tells you the moves to make to solve it Exactly and you know, but then I search and I'm like, okay, I don't want to Actually like speed cube, I don't just want to solve the cube right just I don't want to make it solved.

45
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:09,884
Speaker 1: I want to understand how to solve it, you know with my brain I'll admit I today do not understand the algorithms fundamentally to do it.

46
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:11,970
Speaker 1: Well, I learned some things, right?

47
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:21,609
Speaker 1: So the first thing that bothered me a lot is when you search on the internet for like how to solve Rubik's Cube Pretty much everyone is like, oh, here's the algorithms, right?

48
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:28,030
Speaker 1: But for them the algorithm is basically just memorize a series of steps.

49
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:35,599
Speaker 1: It's literally like memorize this right side forward top side left and it's like fuck you I don't want to just memorize.

50
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,450
Speaker 1: that's like telling me Oh to do a bubble sort.

51
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:44,190
Speaker 1: Just take the you know, the middle thing and it's like no I want to understand why you move that thing there on the same page.

52
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:50,454
Speaker 0: I wanted to know why my uncle when I was a kid was like trying to teach me the algorithms and that's part of why I don't like Rubik's Cubes.

53
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like every see.

54
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:56,164
Speaker 1: all the whole Rubik's Cube community seems to be revolving around.

55
00:03:56,204 --> 00:04:03,828
Speaker 1: this Method is different methods, but they all involve like just memorizing like yeah, it's like no show me.

56
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:04,610
Speaker 1: How does it move?

57
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,563
Speaker 1: Why does that movement that you're doing?

58
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:07,410
Speaker 1: Why does that work?

59
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,850
Speaker 1: How does that get that piece from there to there without disturbing the other pieces or resetting them to where they started, right?

60
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:14,974
Speaker 1: Why does that work?

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,880
Speaker 1: How did you derive that algorithm?

62
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,190
Speaker 1: You can't derive that algorithm, right?

63
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,643
Speaker 1: From base, you know spatial reasoning.

64
00:04:22,744 --> 00:04:24,390
Speaker 1: if all you have done is memorized it.

65
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:28,142
Speaker 1: I don't consider you to be someone who has solved the Rubik's Cube, right?

66
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:32,534
Speaker 0: You have implemented the solution to the Rubik's Cube Exactly, you couldn't.

67
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:37,390
Speaker 1: if you couldn't come up with that algorithm on your own, you know with no one helping you then you did not.

68
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,860
Speaker 0: You are high school geometry.

69
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,504
Speaker 0: show your proof.

70
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:42,738
Speaker 1: Show me the proof Exactly, and I couldn't find.

71
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,830
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere, but I couldn't find it.

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,610
Speaker 0: So I just googled for Rubik's Cube theory and I think I found it.

73
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,050
Speaker 1: But anyway, send me those links, but I did learn one thing on my own, right?

74
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:59,825
Speaker 1: I have reached the ability to where I can solve one layer of Rubik's Cube either on the small one or the big one.

75
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:07,470
Speaker 1: and what I learned is Basically, it's you know, since it's been how many the last time I even thought about a Rubik's Cube I must have been single-digit age, right?

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:15,090
Speaker 1: So, you know, I can play I can I can criticize my younger self for not realizing this But it's sort of obvious when you think about it, right?

77
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,988
Speaker 1: Let's say you look at the top of a Rubik's Cube, right and you see it's all the same color and you're like BAM.

78
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,257
Speaker 1: That side is solved, right?

79
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:24,585
Speaker 1: It's nine nine yellows, right?

80
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:32,027
Speaker 1: Well, actually No If you look at this cube here it the top layer is solved, right?

81
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:32,710
Speaker 1: It's all white.

82
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:45,329
Speaker 1: But when I look at one side, right because this is the same piece, right and it's like yeah It's white red green and you see three red on the side three blue on this side, right?

83
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:47,033
Speaker 1: Right.

84
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:58,695
Speaker 1: See you could have a situation where you look at one face and it's all the same color But if you look at the edges of the pieces that are on that face, they're all jumbled up They're actually in the wrong spots.

85
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,999
Speaker 1: So I have derived.

86
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,690
Speaker 1: I Can do without any memorization of algorithm?

87
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:11,053
Speaker 1: I can solve one layer of any square Rubik's Cube given sufficient time now But I don't.

88
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:15,609
Speaker 1: what I need to figure out is, you know, I could just repeat that now to solve the bottom layer.

89
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,750
Speaker 1: But that leaves the middle track.

90
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:20,610
Speaker 1: Well the middle the middle first of all.

91
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,086
Speaker 1: The problem is a if I solve the bottom using the same method I used to solve the top.

92
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:25,929
Speaker 1: I'll mess up the top.

93
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:35,149
Speaker 1: And problem two if I is the middle right the the middle Center for pieces at least on a three by three they don't move.

94
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:40,483
Speaker 1: It's only the edge eight pieces on any face that move when you think about it, right?

95
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:46,501
Speaker 1: There's only you know, one two Three four, there's only six faces that you know of a cube.

96
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,384
Speaker 1: Yeah six faces.

97
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,290
Speaker 1: There's only six faces in two directions.

98
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:54,443
Speaker 1: So at any given time there's only 12 12 things to choose from.

99
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,410
Speaker 1: right is because each side is can go clockwise or counterclockwise.

100
00:06:58,512 --> 00:06:59,598
Speaker 1: So at any given state.

101
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:03,777
Speaker 1: you have 12 things to choose from With at least with a three by three.

102
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:07,448
Speaker 1: the two by two similarly, but you have less things to choose from.

103
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,795
Speaker 1: Maybe same know the.

104
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:17,617
Speaker 1: so my two is actually the same number of choices, but the difference is this is no Center immovable pieces on it.

105
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:21,550
Speaker 0: So if you are interested, I'll post a link in the forum after this.

106
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:25,050
Speaker 0: but I found a page that talks about the mathematics of Rubik's Cubes and

107
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:26,854
Speaker 1: That sounds good, yeah,

108
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:40,614
Speaker 0: essentially this looks like what you want that the whole theory of them is around the idea of permutation groups Like groups of permutations, but the math is all shown by unrolling the cube into a 2d Representation

109
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:41,620
Speaker 1: where yeah, I've seen some.

110
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,928
Speaker 1: I've seen some things like that.

111
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:46,259
Speaker 1: This way if you look for example This is is a pamphlet.

112
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,150
Speaker 1: people on the stream can see the pamphlet, right?

113
00:07:48,270 --> 00:08:00,470
Speaker 1: They came with the the cube and it's basically literally like oh if your cube looks like this Right memorize these steps right F and they have a code where it's like FR you are prime you F prime.

114
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm basically just means counterclockwise.

115
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:09,910
Speaker 1: So it's like this means Oh, if your cube looks like this memorize, you know front face clockwise right face clockwise.

116
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:16,186
Speaker 1: You know top face clockwise right face counterclockwise up face counterclockwise front place clockwise.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,136
Speaker 1: and it's like no That's not and I'm not.

118
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,482
Speaker 1: that's not what the point it is.

119
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:22,110
Speaker 0: Do you want to know why?

120
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:23,848
Speaker 0: Permutations do what they do.

121
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,516
Speaker 0: Fundamentals area of this.

122
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:30,698
Speaker 0: So the other thing I'm reading here is the gods number if you're encountered that yet That's not in this community.

123
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,182
Speaker 0: God's number is the Maximum number of moves required to solve any Rubik's Cube.

124
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,806
Speaker 1: Oh, that's interesting.

125
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:50,550
Speaker 1: and the answer for a three by three I've learned I think I think I read that there were like the total number of possible Arrangements of a three by three cube is like 16 quadrillion or some ridiculous number.

126
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,610
Speaker 0: Three by three by three can be solved in exactly 20 moves or less.

127
00:08:55,791 --> 00:09:00,912
Speaker 0: No, okay, no matter what it was an estimated originally in the 80s to be 52.

128
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:10,108
Speaker 0: It was not known to be 20 until 2010 not that long as they used thanks to computers Thanks to a brute force computer idling thing that baby.

129
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:19,290
Speaker 1: Yes Of course But yeah, I think you know, the Rubik's Cube and stuff is interesting from a puzzle math perspective.

130
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,698
Speaker 1: I just personally don't find.

131
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:30,530
Speaker 1: I mean, there's definitely skill involved in the memorization and Dexterity fast and movement to solve quickly, but I'm not interested in any of that.

132
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:43,050
Speaker 0: You know in the same way that I appreciate the massive skill and complexity of like zoomed in MOBAs Like the the ape like the way you are good at a MOBA, but I am not interested in like that execution of my own.

133
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,588
Speaker 0: I'm interested in this higher level of the game.

134
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:53,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can recommend a Rubik's Cube, you know what even if like I'm not sometimes I'm not even trying to solve it Just spinning it.

135
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,570
Speaker 1: It's just nice hand exercise.

136
00:09:57,512 --> 00:10:03,092
Speaker 1: It just feels good to fit to spin it around even if you're not trying to solve it or thinking about it in a puzzle Sort of way.

137
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:07,510
Speaker 1: It's just a nice, you know, it's as good as the fidget cube was for spinning and fiddling.

138
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I can recommend.

139
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,182
Speaker 1: I recommend the no I got.

140
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:13,850
Speaker 1: these are the first ones I've ever I've known they existed.

141
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,822
Speaker 1: But these are the first ones that I've personally handled that are not stickered.

142
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,748
Speaker 1: They're just you know plastic.

143
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:24,490
Speaker 0: Oh, wow Yeah, mine was like an old old old one that had the old stickers and was worn the fuck out.

144
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:26,038
Speaker 1: yeah, this is not.

145
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,119
Speaker 1: these are not stickered and The only thing I can say about I like that.

146
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,265
Speaker 1: they're not stickered because like they're gonna be permanently good-looking But they do get a little bit hand greasy, right?

147
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:43,289
Speaker 1: Cuz they're just sort of slick And as you fiddle with them, they get a little bit slimy and like you every time you mess with them a bunch You go wash your hands.

148
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:49,357
Speaker 1: so I recommend Some partially Rubik's Cube.

149
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:49,939
Speaker 1: It was it was.

150
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,770
Speaker 1: it's already been worthwhile to spend a few bucks just to get a cube.

151
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,894
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna get a station.

152
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:54,698
Speaker 1: I'm never gonna.

153
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,449
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm never getting a more than a 3x3 cube though.

154
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:59,549
Speaker 1: Screw that That's unnecessary.

155
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,770
Speaker 0: So in the news and we're not gonna talk about it because you can just watch it yourself.

156
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:15,350
Speaker 0: Nothing we say will in any way change our opinion But the impeachment trial is ongoing and honestly you should watch it on like go watch this.

157
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:25,623
Speaker 0: it's not that long like it's shorter than Wanda vision is gonna be and it's Interesting how very direct straightforward and simple the argument is.

158
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:28,410
Speaker 1: It's not you know, well if you think about it, right?

159
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,424
Speaker 1: It's a lot like, you know, you ever watch like Court TV or something like that, right?

160
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:38,561
Speaker 1: Usually those are kind of boring Yeah, and a lot of times those right.

161
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:43,979
Speaker 1: here is a case about something that at least Indirectly involves every person in the country.

162
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, right is and basically you are you know It's.

163
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:50,210
Speaker 1: it's just being presented to a jury, right?

164
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:57,843
Speaker 1: And so you're just hearing a case as if you were a jury And there's lawyers telling you trying to convince you to vote guilty or not guilty.

165
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,050
Speaker 1: And the thing is I don't think anything here.

166
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:02,255
Speaker 0: Challenge any with trial.

167
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:04,865
Speaker 1: it's not it's a puzzle not affect the right.

168
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:09,810
Speaker 1: It's not going to affect the outcome It's not going to change anyone's mind whether they're a senator or not.

169
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,170
Speaker 1: You know me maybe this somewhere someone whose mind will be changed by this.

170
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:19,070
Speaker 0: But there's like that that small amount of like quote-unquote centrist in the suburbs of like the Midwest.

171
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:22,009
Speaker 1: Yes, these imaginary non-existent person.

172
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:31,688
Speaker 1: but What I think is good about watching it Is that if you I mean if you're on the the Trump side it is like there's no hope for you.

173
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,150
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

174
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you stop.

175
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,504
Speaker 1: Why are you even listening to this kid?

176
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:37,690
Speaker 0: How did you find this podcast?

177
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:50,110
Speaker 1: Right, but if you're a good person, right you Might not fully understand like, you know the nature of the crime.

178
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,523
Speaker 0: I would use the word in Normandy in this case.

179
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:53,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good word.

180
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, so think about like another crime.

181
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:59,730
Speaker 1: think about like it's like, you know, Charles Manson way bad, right?

182
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:08,234
Speaker 1: you've heard of Charles Manson, but do you really know all the details of exactly what Charles Manson did and how horrifying and how bad Of a person that person is?

183
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:09,197
Speaker 1: but also you really?

184
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:09,739
Speaker 1: what?

185
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,685
Speaker 0: what were the cross like legally?

186
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:12,909
Speaker 0: what crimes did he?

187
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,841
Speaker 0: Actually commit compared to his followers and why is he in jail?

188
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:17,443
Speaker 0: despite that?

189
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:21,175
Speaker 0: that is a really important thing to know Right, so that's important.

190
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:26,090
Speaker 1: it's kind of important to know well that concept not that particular case necessary, right, right that pretty right.

191
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,625
Speaker 1: But it's like do you really need to know about Charles and specifically in your life?

192
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:30,629
Speaker 1: You're living right now?

193
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,781
Speaker 1: Not really, but this is much more important to know.

194
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and but it's the same questions, right?

195
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:46,090
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you know that they you know The former president incited an insurrection attack against the White House the White House the cap.

196
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:53,650
Speaker 1: Right, okay, right trying to overthrow the government, but do you really know everything that went down there?

197
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,619
Speaker 1: It seems kind of important that.

198
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,638
Speaker 1: maybe you should know that like Details of that.

199
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:06,783
Speaker 0: I said this before on Twitter, but this trial which again is short It is shorter than like most anime you will ever watch gonna be.

200
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:07,827
Speaker 1: it's gonna be over pretty soon.

201
00:14:08,168 --> 00:14:13,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Like there is going to be an entire goddamn chapter about this in social studies books

202
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:15,574
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

203
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:29,170
Speaker 0: just like when you were a kid and you had the lesson on like that like times like monumental events in American history like when they signed the Constitution when they did the equal rights like this is gonna be that level of big deal.

204
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:34,950
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's the thing is like you go we we go to school at least in the United States, right?

205
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,319
Speaker 1: And then after school, that's it.

206
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,086
Speaker 1: Any further learning is on you.

207
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:46,850
Speaker 1: Yep, right and You know if the later on you go to school and also many other factors obviously.

208
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:51,785
Speaker 1: But the more at least in history class the more history you learn.

209
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,230
Speaker 1: but also in other classes, right?

210
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,029
Speaker 1: Maybe in physics class if we've discovered more physics.

211
00:14:56,426 --> 00:15:05,670
Speaker 1: Yeah Since I was in high school Someone who takes a physics class now has the opportunity to learn things like archaea and were discovered after I graduated high school in college.

212
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:19,290
Speaker 1: Fundamental ideas about biology have radically changed since I was in high school Exactly, but history is the most because that one's constant right sometimes, you know some sciences and maths, you know It's like how often is there new trigonometry?

213
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:25,696
Speaker 1: History happens every day Quoting someone.

214
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,541
Speaker 0: I remember who but there was.

215
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:32,384
Speaker 0: I might have been one of the Green Brothers But they made a point that was literally like but history is always happening.

216
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,210
Speaker 0: It never stops happening

217
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:57,677
Speaker 1: So it'll later on you go to history because so it's up to you no matter who you are Right or no matter what your life is like right to spend some amount of it I'm not saying what amount because that varies wildly but on catching up on the history that happened since you were in school Yep, right and which is the best way to do it would be to catch up entirely and then just pay attention to what's happening Right now a little bit every day.

218
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:06,770
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you're you're good, but the thing about this trailer trial I really want to highlight and honestly don't even you may not even need to watch the defense because it's not even a legal argument.

219
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,894
Speaker 1: It's not worth your time.

220
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,802
Speaker 0: It literally was not a legal argument.

221
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:16,825
Speaker 1: Like they did not actually argue Anything anyway, but you could watch it just to understand how awful it was.

222
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:30,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point I want to like the thing to really look at is that It seems like government and these kinds of things are very complex and law is really complex and it like normal people don't really Like think about it on this detail level.

223
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:36,795
Speaker 0: but one of the most important skills in the world is to take something complex and Explain it simply.

224
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:42,375
Speaker 0: and this trial like the house impeachment managers This is like a case study.

225
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:55,368
Speaker 0: in taking something that was complex and describing it simply they are doing such an amazing job That even if you don't know anything about American government or history or politics you will understand a lot by the end of just.

226
00:16:55,408 --> 00:17:02,430
Speaker 1: I highly recommend People from other countries watch this not because you know that you know.

227
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:03,315
Speaker 1: I think the u.s.

228
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:19,621
Speaker 1: Is worth paying attention to if you're lucky enough not to live here But also if anyone in another country Right has a similar thing from your country along these lines for us to watch Right, like maybe there was.

229
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:24,982
Speaker 1: I've watched at least a few You know like trials of like various.

230
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:26,790
Speaker 0: I watched a sub war criminals.

231
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:33,310
Speaker 0: I watched one of these places in Poland because Poland is getting like fascist right-wing in a hurry.

232
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,984
Speaker 0: But I was watching some of those debates around abortion because they were.

233
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,350
Speaker 0: it's a lot.

234
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,390
Speaker 0: The Polish law is so fundamentally different from American law in terms like Poland.

235
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:55,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the only news I've seen from Poland which which really made me curious was how basically the right-wing people are also Instituting some amount of left-wing social program.

236
00:17:55,131 --> 00:18:01,547
Speaker 1: It's like free health care and also Right, it's like this mix of like.

237
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,069
Speaker 1: where is it?

238
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:05,940
Speaker 1: You know, you couldn't imagine that mix possibly in the United States, right?

239
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:14,125
Speaker 0: well The United States is interesting in that everything is divided into literally a side where and every idea is bad and a side that is Literally everything.

240
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:14,989
Speaker 0: yet those bad ideas.

241
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:22,020
Speaker 1: but but but imagine if like, you know The Republicans right in the United States who are just like, you know literal white supremacists.

242
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,351
Speaker 1: We're also like we're all we're also and on the side of Medicare for all and the Democrats weren't Medicare for all But the Democrats weren't white supremacist.

243
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:36,836
Speaker 1: that level of partisanship I've seen multiple scholars are and it's sort of like trying to convince you to vote for the white supremacist.

244
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,879
Speaker 1: cuz hey free hunger.

245
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:38,823
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, sure.

246
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:42,239
Speaker 1: They'll do and they were let's say the Republicans were also doing the free student loans.

247
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:51,297
Speaker 0: And I've seen multiple scholars argue recently that the Part the partisan divide in America is unique on the global stage.

248
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:52,602
Speaker 0: right now There are.

249
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:53,485
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like wouldn't that?

250
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,680
Speaker 1: it's like if you're a if you're actually a strategic, you know white supremacist.

251
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:03,400
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you Trojan horse your white supremacy you actually care about inside of the social program?

252
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,279
Speaker 0: But no one of the are ages I saw they want all their cake.

253
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:15,408
Speaker 0: One of those articles was very succinct and it pointed out that the white supremacist violent extremists who are evil and awful But they exist in Europe.

254
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:18,040
Speaker 0: They believe that climate change is real.

255
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:23,849
Speaker 0: They believe awful things about what to do about it But they don't disagree that it is happening.

256
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,580
Speaker 0: yet in America that became a partisan issue.

257
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,579
Speaker 0: So right-wing people also don't believe climate change is real.

258
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:39,859
Speaker 0: hmm, anyway anyway in some other news a Hacker tried to poison an entire city's water supply last week.

259
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is something we've know.

260
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:43,874
Speaker 1: we've talked about this on Mondays a lot.

261
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:45,240
Speaker 1: It's definitely a real threat.

262
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,470
Speaker 0: I'm sure this never happened before like this was.

263
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,294
Speaker 0: we've known.

264
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:49,660
Speaker 1: this has been a real threat.

265
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,598
Speaker 1: But obviously much of the infrastructure in the world, but especially the United States is hooked up to computer systems.

266
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:59,973
Speaker 1: Yep Ideally those computer systems should not be connected to the internet in any way.

267
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:00,233
Speaker 1: ever.

268
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:05,780
Speaker 1: if a computer is controlling the power plants There should be no way to connect to that computer right via internet.

269
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,853
Speaker 0: Right the super powerful computer that had the secret shit was not on the internet.

270
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:16,306
Speaker 0: Tom Cruise had to break into that building to get that data exactly, and that's you know in that way.

271
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:23,920
Speaker 1: a you know, sure the computer should still be updated and secured to prevent say Insiders from messing with it, right?

272
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:30,580
Speaker 1: You know It's just sitting there Unlocked and anyone in the power plant like the janitor could walk over and push your button to turn the power off.

273
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:31,664
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

274
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:36,280
Speaker 1: But at least if it's not in the internet, no one else can do it, right?

275
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,935
Speaker 1: You have to get into the power plant to begin with and this power plants right near us.

276
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,000
Speaker 1: They're surrounded with walls.

277
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,648
Speaker 1: It's not easy to get in rain.

278
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:43,814
Speaker 1: There's barbed wire and shit.

279
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:44,417
Speaker 1: It's not friend.

280
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:44,879
Speaker 1: It's not fun.

281
00:20:46,821 --> 00:20:49,088
Speaker 1: So it's also dangerous to try to get in there.

282
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:57,165
Speaker 0: so in terms of water supply stuff It is really easy to break into those physical Sure is cuz well cuz.

283
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:57,787
Speaker 1: water supply.

284
00:20:57,827 --> 00:21:00,516
Speaker 1: unlike power plants power plants are much more easy to defend.

285
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,820
Speaker 1: they're centralized and all right.

286
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,287
Speaker 0: There's people like water and beacons.

287
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,700
Speaker 0: city water is all we used to live in Beacon, right?

288
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,230
Speaker 0: There's a reservoir up in the mountains like Janda's water.

289
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:12,760
Speaker 1: There's water stuff like all over like a cell tower.

290
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,891
Speaker 1: It's like cell towers just be sitting there in the woods.

291
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,480
Speaker 1: No one's guarding one all day.

292
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,807
Speaker 1: It's just got a little fence around it.

293
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,114
Speaker 1: You could bust in there.

294
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,240
Speaker 1: Maybe someone will know.

295
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,334
Speaker 1: Maybe some alarm gets triggered or maybe there's a camera or something.

296
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:26,046
Speaker 0: It's illegal to swim and then You know who swims in.

297
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,635
Speaker 0: that has has swum in that reservoir many times.

298
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:29,659
Speaker 1: everyone and you.

299
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:35,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, a bunch of our friends Sure, but but this is unsecured.

300
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:36,638
Speaker 0: I'm sorry God.

301
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:41,560
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying is that we've known for a long time that the infrastructure and their computers.

302
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:45,496
Speaker 1: You should be doing these things and by and large we are not we have.

303
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,531
Speaker 1: it's a known vulnerability that some people are watching out for.

304
00:21:49,631 --> 00:22:03,579
Speaker 1: but if you wanted to attack the Infrastructure of the United States right telecommunications power water utilities Things of that nature the telecommunications are probably more secured but in general you could do it.

305
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:12,228
Speaker 1: It's there a lot of things that are set up poorly and a lot of those systems are You know not centrally or uniformly set up.

306
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:18,348
Speaker 1: They're set up by Municipalities in various places with various levels of technical expertise.

307
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:27,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, so One of the I've always thought that Like one of the things that gives me a little bit of hope for humanity Because there's a lot of reasons to not have a lot of hope for humanity.

308
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:41,545
Speaker 0: Especially lately is that despite how utterly easy it would be to stage those kinds of attacks They have been shockingly rare in America until now where this happened and it happened for real.

309
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:42,006
Speaker 0: what had?

310
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:48,950
Speaker 0: the summary is Some hacker got into a system and I'll talk about that in a second because now we know more as of like this morning.

311
00:22:49,050 --> 00:23:01,562
Speaker 0: We know everything now and everything that system controls in Florida, Florida, by the way Yeah controls the chemical balance of the water treatment facility Mmm, they poked around at it and then left it alone.

312
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:09,570
Speaker 0: They returned later and Did the specific thing that would cause the most harm to people as fast as possible?

313
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,650
Speaker 0: There is like clear intent that they wanted to poison the water supply.

314
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,642
Speaker 0: They basically turned the lie level to maximum.

315
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:20,070
Speaker 0: that would have made the water undrinkable and dangerous.

316
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,810
Speaker 0: It also might pretty much really corroded the infrastructure.

317
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:29,027
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's if there's anything you could do with access to that computer system to cause the most harm That was it.

318
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,677
Speaker 1: That was the other thing you've damaged.

319
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:44,464
Speaker 1: there are other things you could have done if you had axe Unrestricted access to that system but like maybe cause a flood or who knows what you have done But that was probably most likely the most harmful thing you could have done now If you had done it successfully.

320
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:58,370
Speaker 0: there were other detection safeguards in place through other facilities and other systems such that if this hacker had succeeded and not getting caught the Poisoned water would have been prevented from getting further But it might have destroyed that water supply and caused a lot of problem.

321
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:09,103
Speaker 0: It was not a good situation, but it is unlikely due to another set of controls that it would have actually poisoned People in that town before the water was just cut off though.

322
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:19,577
Speaker 1: The people were in no time where the people actually Sure Yep, anyway so so Now we know exactly how they got in.

323
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,548
Speaker 0: they used some remote desktop software that a called team viewer.

324
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:29,926
Speaker 0: That is Widely used around the world to give access to system.

325
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:30,809
Speaker 1: I never even heard of.

326
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,704
Speaker 1: I've heard of VNC go to meeting.

327
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,418
Speaker 1: I know Apple has one built in I'm pretty sure and is my.

328
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:42,984
Speaker 0: Microsoft has the one built into Windows And I was like, oh, it's probably go to meeting or some shit like.

329
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:47,075
Speaker 0: that team viewer is Scarily widely used.

330
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:56,270
Speaker 0: it is software that basically lets you open up a Windows computer So that other people can connect to it to perform maintenance with some amount of authentication.

331
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,493
Speaker 0: It is ripe for abuse like I would not.

332
00:24:59,553 --> 00:25:07,084
Speaker 1: most and using that thing I hear most about remote desktops is how like if you fall for one of those Scam phone calls or emails about tech support.

333
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:07,929
Speaker 0: That's the first thing they do.

334
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:12,127
Speaker 1: They make you install some remote desktop thing and then they use it, right?

335
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:12,769
Speaker 1: It's like it's not.

336
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:14,913
Speaker 1: Obviously.

337
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,164
Speaker 1: don't use remote desktop for anything ever anymore.

338
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:19,830
Speaker 1: I used to use it back in the day But now I use it for nothing.

339
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:30,994
Speaker 0: I use it for work in that during kovat times one of the BCP things I have is I can just remote into my desktop in the office and have everything be exactly like It would be.

340
00:25:31,014 --> 00:25:41,847
Speaker 1: my work computer is a laptop that I brought home and as I'm has been on my desk since you know I've been home, but also any connection I have to make to work is via VPN and SSH.

341
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:45,224
Speaker 0: Do that, but I don't because I'm not an engineer like.

342
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,750
Speaker 0: I don't need access to all those systems.

343
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:53,559
Speaker 0: So it's much easier to just use my desktop at work or log into the thing directly because you know We don't just have a work laptop that you can.

344
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,544
Speaker 0: just I could get one.

345
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:56,294
Speaker 0: I chose not to Hmm.

346
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,526
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's all I have.

347
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:14,150
Speaker 0: Yep So one the only reason this was caught and this disaster was diverted was that a human happened to notice that the mouse was moving on the screen and He was like and they happen to be paying it to have to actually be paying attention at that moment.

348
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,441
Speaker 0: Yep, like literally dude happened to see it briefly walking by.

349
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:26,946
Speaker 0: so we're really lucky this got caught - This whole system is controlled by like unpatched Windows 7 machines running team viewer.

350
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,918
Speaker 0: yep, this is a shit show and Short of the US actually.

351
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:40,381
Speaker 1: but the thing is that while it was a shit show it seems like the People handling it after the fact are.

352
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,470
Speaker 1: it seems like they're just going about it, you know

353
00:26:43,310 --> 00:27:10,098
Speaker 0: while Security is basically bullshit pretty much everywhere except tech companies and capital markets companies like there's no security anywhere else because I know hospitals like medical stuff is secure because of the lack of regulations and Also the brain drain the brain drain in this case being There's a small number of industries that can afford to pay a lot of money and they hire all The good tech people like all of them.

354
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:20,611
Speaker 0: So us like the water supply They cannot afford someone who is good at security that nor can they afford the software or the effort it would take to actually implement Security.

355
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:26,670
Speaker 1: they can only outsource to a consultancy that does have tech people that are split across that and many other things.

356
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,809
Speaker 0: Security is just garbage at best every if they choose to pay for it.

357
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:41,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the people who work in these places, even if they are not that technologically savvy They are aware of how insecure and bullshit this is there.

358
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:50,549
Speaker 0: in my experience those people are Constantly complaining to and like telling their management and anyone who will listen that this is a disaster waiting to happen and everyone ignores them.

359
00:27:51,833 --> 00:28:01,570
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I always remember that story when from the Obama days when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State Oh, yeah, and all the State Department people, right?

360
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:10,690
Speaker 1: so the State Department people must have some technical savvy, but they're Largely diplomats and and that sort of foreign affairs people right that they know about passports.

361
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:17,789
Speaker 1: They're not more than they know about computers All right, and they were making a big deal that they really wanted to use Firefox on there.

362
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:23,712
Speaker 1: It was like a huge deal for like like one or two days in the news how they really wanted to use Firefox.

363
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:28,447
Speaker 1: and it's like because they knew just like how shitty like the rules or their computer systems were.

364
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:28,969
Speaker 1: that the.

365
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:38,195
Speaker 1: you know We're under federal government restrictions right and other federal employees that I know also often complain about how The computer systems are.

366
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:56,594
Speaker 1: and some things are because a it is more secure and therefore more of a pain in the ass Just like having ten locks on your door, you know and special hinges that can't be you know hammered or whatever Is more secure but also more of a pain in the ass, but also just also shitty Yeah, and not good.

367
00:28:57,477 --> 00:29:01,029
Speaker 0: So moving on a little bit in some other news really briefly if you didn't see this.

368
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:08,208
Speaker 0: so there's an actress who played a good character in the Mandalorian and She was a super piece of shit.

369
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:10,716
Speaker 1: Like the actress was.

370
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:16,356
Speaker 1: the character in the show is not a piece of character was actually like very good person But was played by actress.

371
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,888
Speaker 1: playing the character in that person in real life was a piece of shit.

372
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:23,478
Speaker 0: Yep, and For better or worse what?

373
00:29:23,518 --> 00:29:32,810
Speaker 0: while we're continuing to be a vile piece of shit She stepped over the line where even Disney and like everyone all the professionals involved had to do something.

374
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,997
Speaker 0: So they fired her her talent.

375
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:38,828
Speaker 0: a post editor share her characters just out of the Mandalorian forever done.

376
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,908
Speaker 1: Yep, she posted, you know stupid shit on the internet on her social.

377
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:53,223
Speaker 0: She went Saying Republican things which is evil to saying like Directly racist things to then being full-on QAnon like in a hurry.

378
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:56,734
Speaker 1: Well, well then they just yeah Just like goodbye.

379
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:59,249
Speaker 1: None of those are protected class so you can be fired for that.

380
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:01,759
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm assuming it's just yet.

381
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:06,467
Speaker 0: her x-wing crashed and there were no survivors something like that.

382
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:19,929
Speaker 0: so last something that we are also somewhat heated about as you might notice there's a global pandemic going on, but Madison Square Garden in New York City is gonna be allowed and is going to actually do it.

383
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:23,010
Speaker 0: They're gonna let some fans come and watch sports live.

384
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, this makes no sense to me, right?

385
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:30,132
Speaker 1: So in other states, they've been doing this and it Like.

386
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:32,283
Speaker 1: I saw them like the number of people at the Super Bowl.

387
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:42,258
Speaker 1: while at one on the one hand It looked like more people than it was because of the car cutouts in the stand and other effects They used to look more crowded Was still way too crowded.

388
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:52,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, well cuz on one hand sure It's like sort of outdoors and like it's a big space everyone spread out but you could clearly see like when the halftime show was starting.

389
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:59,190
Speaker 0: they did this like pan and All those people who had been spread out were all clumped together going to the bathroom at the same time.

390
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:07,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, so the point is even if you're spread out It's like why are you going to a large gathering of people right at the height of the original?

391
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:15,057
Speaker 1: Bump and pandemic and like April right the numbers I'm looking at for New York at least Were like seven day average.

392
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,440
Speaker 1: nine thousand cases, right?

393
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,704
Speaker 1: So currently right?

394
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,110
Speaker 1: We've been in in like, you know, January.

395
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,201
Speaker 1: We were way over that.

396
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:24,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were like 16,000 seven-day average.

397
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:31,202
Speaker 1: it's been going down since January and you would presume that co-ed at least correlates to vaccines.

398
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:40,018
Speaker 1: So it looks like vaccines working which is good news, but It's currently at 80. let's see yesterday two days.

399
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:40,901
Speaker 1: Yeah yesterday.

400
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:41,864
Speaker 1: It says current.

401
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:45,760
Speaker 1: the number I'm looking at on Google is 8,500 seven-day average.

402
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,550
Speaker 1: that's pretty close to that nine.

403
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:53,970
Speaker 1: It's only like a thousand less than the seven-day average from the peak in April when basically everything was shut down everywhere.

404
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,481
Speaker 1: So, why would you why would be at the same number?

405
00:31:57,561 --> 00:32:00,610
Speaker 1: shouldn't we still be shut down everywhere with the same number, right?

406
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:08,366
Speaker 1: Shouldn't like in the summer when the number was really low like hundreds of cases We were way less open than we are now, right?

407
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:16,670
Speaker 1: Oh, you couldn't have a concert this summer But why would you allow people to have a concert now when we're the lowest when everything was closed?

408
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:21,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like just like just it's just a dream.

409
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:22,729
Speaker 1: go back to the extreme.

410
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,860
Speaker 0: It's rolling out like there's light at the end of the tunnel.

411
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:31,738
Speaker 0: Just like send people some income and Guarantee rent for restaurants and just ride it out.

412
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:33,984
Speaker 0: We're near the just extreme extreme.

413
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:37,051
Speaker 1: shut down everything like no one is allowed to go Outside.

414
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,861
Speaker 1: fuck you unless you're an essentially, you know an essential person.

415
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:46,619
Speaker 1: everyone else stay inside like core like not even quarantine like What's it called curfew 24/7.

416
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,690
Speaker 1: you may not leave your house for it.

417
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:58,070
Speaker 0: You let you accept unless you're a deliverer is a point in the early days where the right answer Was the military and National Guard being deployed to distribute food to people who are not allowed to leave their homes.

418
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:02,950
Speaker 1: If we just did that for probably I'm not, you know, not an expert on this, right?

419
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:12,910
Speaker 1: But it feels like you know, if you just did that for a month and kept distributing vaccines like yeah, right But instead no, they want to open up and let 2,000 people go watch hockey games.

420
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,870
Speaker 1: So the thing that bothers me the most is not only this nonsensical business, right?

421
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:43,504
Speaker 1: but the people who are defending it, yep, and The people defending it and this is just a general problem I think in the whole world, especially in the US but also the rest of the world is just this like Devaluing of you know, not just you know Not just like a racist person who devalues the human life of people who aren't like them But the devaluing of just any human life like even someone who's just like you.

422
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,650
Speaker 1: it's like somebody I wrote.

423
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,623
Speaker 1: I wrote a comment like, you know, shut it down and someone was like.

424
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:54,561
Speaker 1: the comment they made was What 99% survival rate I'll take my chances.

425
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,447
Speaker 1: and it's like hold on right?

426
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:10,802
Speaker 1: So You're telling me that a you're fine with getting horrifically sick, you know And losing your sense of taste and smell possibly for a long time more permanently To watch a hockey game in person or to eat at a restaurant.

427
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,589
Speaker 1: It's that's worth the risk to you.

428
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,574
Speaker 1: Yeah What's wrong with you?

429
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,949
Speaker 0: the list of beings that I would be willing to risk a 1% chance of death on?

430
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:26,630
Speaker 0: Like near the top of that list are ridiculous things like saving someone's life saving the world doing some ridiculous ski thing.

431
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,917
Speaker 0: You know, what's at the bottom of that list?

432
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:29,083
Speaker 0: eating at a TGI Fridays, right?

433
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,529
Speaker 1: I know I would need TGI Fridays, even if there was no Right.

434
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:38,650
Speaker 1: But you're also risking other people's lives to do this thing, right?

435
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,649
Speaker 1: You know the usher at the Madison Square Garden has to go to work where they haven't been working.

436
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:45,103
Speaker 1: now You're gonna make them go there and risk their life, right?

437
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,150
Speaker 1: But the other argument, okay.

438
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,167
Speaker 1: So let's say you let 2,000 people let you.

439
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:48,530
Speaker 1: so, okay.

440
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,389
Speaker 1: So let's say you take your chances, right?

441
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,138
Speaker 1: You're letting 2,000 people go in one.

442
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:59,020
Speaker 1: if it's a super spreader event, which it very well could be 1% of people die, right?

443
00:34:59,301 --> 00:34:59,823
Speaker 1: What's 1% of 2,000 20 people?

444
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,655
Speaker 1: Okay, you we're gonna.

445
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:11,045
Speaker 1: you're basically saying it's okay to kill like dead 20 people so that they can watch a hockey game.

446
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:11,869
Speaker 1: That's worth it.

447
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,658
Speaker 1: So let's all right.

448
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,070
Speaker 1: if we think if you say that that's worth it We're gonna take the 20 people from your family.

449
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:24,640
Speaker 1: You take 20 people that you love and care about and we're gonna sacrifice them on an altar Right, and that will be the 20 deaths.

450
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,146
Speaker 1: and now everyone can watch hockey.

451
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:27,070
Speaker 1: Are you okay with that?

452
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're not okay with that then shut the fuck up and stay home.

453
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,576
Speaker 0: And also They trot.

454
00:35:33,616 --> 00:35:35,086
Speaker 0: they pick 20 people out of the audience.

455
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:37,949
Speaker 0: They line them up They shoot them on the air and then the hockey game proceeds.

456
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,738
Speaker 1: Right, or how about this right?

457
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,806
Speaker 1: If you're okay with that, that means you're okay with.

458
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,940
Speaker 1: okay, you know We'll sell you this hockey ticket, right?

459
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,630
Speaker 1: They're gonna have 2,000 hockey tickets.

460
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:56,513
Speaker 1: We're gonna sell them right and then we're gonna pick 20 random numbers from 1 to 2,000 and those 20 people will be shot In the head.

461
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:58,809
Speaker 1: well, are you gonna still buy that hockey ticket?

462
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,840
Speaker 1: Well, no Then you were fogging lying when you said you're gonna take your chances weren't you?

463
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,161
Speaker 0: now?

464
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:08,510
Speaker 0: the the main argument people make when they're not Like excited about sports is always back to the economy.

465
00:36:08,651 --> 00:36:13,615
Speaker 0: But I just want to remind you and let's not get too deep into this to run to our main bit The economy is fake.

466
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:18,030
Speaker 0: like the government could just give people money to stay home.

467
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:21,019
Speaker 0: They don't because the Republicans refuse to.

468
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:21,761
Speaker 1: the government could.

469
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:31,650
Speaker 1: just even if you don't give people money you can do the equivalent Things like just say yeah, all right food is free and you know Rent is illegal.

470
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:36,325
Speaker 1: Everyone is a lot every if you can find any squatting is legal right now.

471
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:39,816
Speaker 1: if you're homeless and you can find a place that No one's living you're allowed to live in it.

472
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:40,860
Speaker 1: In fact, you own it now.

473
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:43,430
Speaker 1: tough shit to whoever owned the property before.

474
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,642
Speaker 1: If no one is living there, it's not yours anymore.

475
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,950
Speaker 1: That's all perfectly legal.

476
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,516
Speaker 1: They could just if they write laws.

477
00:36:48,857 --> 00:37:04,429
Speaker 0: you can write almost anything in a law like, you know, the Constitution is I Don't blame as much like the restaurant that that's owned by someone and they open because they're allowed to because otherwise they can't make Their rent and can't feed their family.

478
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:20,364
Speaker 0: But you know who it deserves the most blame the people who fucking eat at that restaurant when it's open Exactly, but if everyone was good and didn't go eat People who well done anything in the people eat at the restaurant get the second most blame.

479
00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:28,350
Speaker 1: the first most blame government for letting The government that didn't just give them money and also the landlord who continues to charge rent, even though it's a pandemic.

480
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,483
Speaker 1: Yep, right Those are the top the the top baddies.

481
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:33,674
Speaker 0: and the worst part is there were Proposed.

482
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:43,995
Speaker 1: if I owned a building and I was a landlord and I had first of all, I wouldn't do that But I wouldn't be evil right, but if I was a landlord and I was already, you know charging rent I wouldn't have charged.

483
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,321
Speaker 1: read the whole pandemic time.

484
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,509
Speaker 1: It's just obvious, right?

485
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:52,084
Speaker 0: And if you couldn't afford to do that again the government at least not.

486
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:52,305
Speaker 1: not.

487
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:54,328
Speaker 1: if that if the tenant could afford it I'd still charge him.

488
00:37:54,691 --> 00:38:06,749
Speaker 0: Well, like the government could have not a restaurant to do things like they could have done even capitalist things like freeze rent Guarantee the income of the landlords and sort it all out after kovat.

489
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,595
Speaker 0: But they didn't do it.

490
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:12,410
Speaker 1: You don't even have to guarantee the income of the landlord You can just cancel their property tax for the same period.

491
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,919
Speaker 1: That's most where their money has that.

492
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,810
Speaker 0: oh that now we can't afford to pay for the schools.

493
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:16,277
Speaker 0: Guess what?

494
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,089
Speaker 0: Just raise taxes.

495
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:25,096
Speaker 1: Not the property tax though, right Some other tax not the property one.

496
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:26,280
Speaker 0: Yeah raise the taxes.

497
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,343
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

498
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,149
Speaker 0: text Amazon and rich people.

499
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:30,405
Speaker 0: Yeah

500
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:53,367
Speaker 1: Something yeah things that are making money off the pandemic just be like hey Every Amazon package that gets delivered right you put a tax on it and then you say well Amazon You're not allowed to you just you're right and everyone's like oh if you do that Then you know this, you know Cuz there was someone who had that idea and but their idea was that the people ordering would end up having to pay that tax And the idea is to try to get them to shop locally.

501
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:53,710
Speaker 1: instead.

502
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:57,030
Speaker 1: It's like oh you could just write you could just write in the law.

503
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:03,925
Speaker 1: Right just add more words and say yeah We are gonna tax every package that's delivered and Amazon is the one that has to pay.

504
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:05,736
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to pass the buck on To the customer.

505
00:39:05,797 --> 00:39:07,070
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to raise prices.

506
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,077
Speaker 1: You could have made it against the law.

507
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:12,528
Speaker 1: make more and if you're and then you write you could write in the law.

508
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:20,402
Speaker 1: if the Company is caught raising prices on the customer or passing this tax on to the customer Then the entire company is owned by the government nationalized the.

509
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:23,253
Speaker 1: you could write any consequence you go out you could write Yeah, penalty.

510
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,717
Speaker 1: death penalty is still legal.

511
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,443
Speaker 1: He's not in New York, but it's like.

512
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:34,590
Speaker 1: I'm not and I'm against the death penalty, obviously But you could say if your company commits these crimes the CEO is subject to capital punishment.

513
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:38,230
Speaker 1: That's pertinent legal and the only thing you can't do it could be done.

514
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,334
Speaker 0: It's a bill of attainder.

515
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:52,869
Speaker 0: And if you don't know what that is, the impeachment trial will actually explain it and you'll know Sure, but anyway things of the day.

516
00:39:53,592 --> 00:40:05,916
Speaker 0: so this is funny like it's one of those funny YouTube mashup things, but I cannot stress enough the shocking high level of quality effort and care of The Legend of Beavis.

517
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:17,258
Speaker 0: like this would have been funny if they had done a half-assed joke like if they had made like a two-minute YouTube video, this would have been funny, but My hat is off to the creator of the Legend of Beavis.

518
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,390
Speaker 0: This goes above and beyond what is reasonable.

519
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,990
Speaker 1: Well, you're already like a Beavis and Butthead person.

520
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:24,673
Speaker 0: I'm already.

521
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:28,350
Speaker 0: I was so I've started watching Beavis and Butthead near at the beginning of its run.

522
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:30,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, I watched it when you know the beginning of its run.

523
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,550
Speaker 1: I watched it, you know, occasionally, right?

524
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:35,343
Speaker 0: My whole family would sit down and like watch it.

525
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:36,750
Speaker 0: This is what I was very young.

526
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:40,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would just watch it now and then you know when it was on.

527
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:49,575
Speaker 0: I was always a big fan of Beavis and Butthead but until later seasons I was mostly only a fan of them MST3K-ing the music videos because the cartoon was okay But just like super violent and weird.

528
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:53,750
Speaker 1: but the cartoon depended on which some of the episodes were more or less, right?

529
00:40:54,852 --> 00:41:03,295
Speaker 0: but this is the Legend of Zelda cartoon the Nintendo one that was like weird and part of the Super Mario Brothers Super Show and Excuse me princess, etc.

530
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:05,061
Speaker 0: But they've.

531
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:15,514
Speaker 0: they've kept the voice of the princess normal but they've replaced link with Beavis and the king with Butthead and It's just perfect.

532
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:17,639
Speaker 0: It is too funny for this earth.

533
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:21,329
Speaker 1: This is definitely along the lines of a Charles.

534
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:27,215
Speaker 0: Yep This is Literally like.

535
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,550
Speaker 0: it is a coherent story.

536
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:33,739
Speaker 0: It makes sense Every use of Beavis and Butthead in this.

537
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:37,505
Speaker 0: this could be an episode of a real show and you wouldn't know if you'd never heard of Beavis and Butthead.

538
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:38,839
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah.

539
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,262
Speaker 1: All right.

540
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:42,784
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day, this is a really short video.

541
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:48,075
Speaker 1: It's like really quick But yeah, you know In this video, right?

542
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:52,830
Speaker 1: We always have this I guess sort of stereotyped image of the police in Japan.

543
00:41:52,931 --> 00:42:05,750
Speaker 1: I'm sure some of it is based on fact but not having been there I can't say right but you know through anime through you know The Japanese things nerds see right you get this image of the Japanese police that they're more polite, right?

544
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:06,747
Speaker 1: They're not you know.

545
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:13,153
Speaker 1: Like the you you know There's like little police standing in police boxes that you can go and say hi to and get help from in the neighborhood Right.

546
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:14,499
Speaker 1: I know that that is a thing, right?

547
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,790
Speaker 1: I don't know how widespread it still is.

548
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:22,170
Speaker 0: Can you imagine tapping on one of those little police boxes in the subway and asking the cop in there to do it?

549
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:23,749
Speaker 1: They'd be like what the fuck you want.

550
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:46,864
Speaker 1: But anyway So this video which looks like it's real footage You see a Japanese police car and with the limited Japanese language I know I can basically saying tell that over the little PA megaphone that they have in the police car They're they're yelling at the person on a scooter and they're basically saying excuse me.

551
00:42:46,904 --> 00:42:48,730
Speaker 1: Would you would you pull over please, right?

552
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:52,943
Speaker 1: Like, you know, right they're politely asking the scooter to pull over.

553
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:53,524
Speaker 1: is that they can?

554
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,253
Speaker 1: there must be something about them that they need to be pulled over for.

555
00:42:56,374 --> 00:43:02,004
Speaker 1: or you know some reason the cops want to pull them over even if it's wrong or a wrong reason.

556
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:13,044
Speaker 1: right because Cops are bad in every country And the scooter gets away or obviously because otherwise it wouldn't be a thing of the day.

557
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:18,595
Speaker 1: how the scooter gets away is Right, and that's why it's worth.

558
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:24,402
Speaker 1: it's worth, you know, and then whoever edited this video put a little Grand Theft Auto joke on there at the end.

559
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:31,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is worth what the 30 to 60 seconds of your time it takes to watch this video.

560
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:32,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the lead.

561
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:35,710
Speaker 1: maybe maybe this technique will help you in life.

562
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:43,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the letter writing a scooter or a bicycle and the cops are asking politely asking to pull you over ten minutes long.

563
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:53,968
Speaker 0: Oh, wow, but it it continued like it is ten minutes of that high quality like they went all out complete perfect lip-sync and everything dang.

566
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:11,009
Speaker 0: Anyway, so metamoment we're stuck at home not reading books playing train games.

586
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:24,903
Speaker 0: All right, so You got ideas for Thursday shows let us know.

587
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,172
Speaker 0: so we're gonna talk about Calendars.

588
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:32,407
Speaker 1: so I thought of this show idea because there was some Secret Santa going on in December, right?

589
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:33,570
Speaker 1: It's obviously February already.

590
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:43,583
Speaker 0: Oh my god This is just a February You know, what's really making it feel long is all the normal breaks of like all these conventions Like this is the middle of convention season.

591
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:45,550
Speaker 1: Yep but anyway.

592
00:45:45,630 --> 00:46:11,008
Speaker 1: So the things I put on my secret Santa list because I don't want anything right was donate to non evil charity in my name Something to hang on the front door of our apartment like in the hallway Right like a welcome sign kind of thing because we only have some of those for certain seasons and we don't have them for other seasons And they're kind of hard to find ones that are better that you know Fit and suit the bill and are tasteful and aren't gaudy or whatever.

593
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:11,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:18,770
Speaker 1: And then the other one I wrote was like a cool calendar right from you know, a cool independent artist.

595
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:20,587
Speaker 1: That is really awesome, right?

596
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:27,608
Speaker 1: So what showed up in the Secret Santa was the calendar is some calendar that from the I was.

597
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:38,072
Speaker 1: I was first I was a little worried because actually the cover of the calendar has a sort of It basically an art that looks like the Baron from Whisper of the heart.

598
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:48,268
Speaker 1: it was okay, but then inside every single month in the calendar was like incredible and I was like, whoa Okay, this is the cover is like probably the worst art in the whole calendar, right?

599
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:57,630
Speaker 1: So I was very happy with that calendar and I'm like, okay Can we do a show on calendars if we bring in all the other calendar related topics?

600
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:15,425
Speaker 1: Not just calendars themselves the physical object But also, you know calendars in terms of like lunar calendar Gregorian Right, but also if we really need to stretch it we can talk about like planners right agenda books You know a digital calendar even though it reaches into Monday territory.

601
00:47:15,445 --> 00:47:17,942
Speaker 1: Yeah We can talk about that.

602
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,296
Speaker 0: until the food shows up I think we'll go all the way back.

603
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:23,470
Speaker 0: cuz I'm in like we grew up in a pre digital era.

604
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:30,727
Speaker 0: So for most of my life I needed a calendar like like physically like I needed a calendar to know what day it was.

605
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:41,369
Speaker 1: Yeah Even the oldest computers, let's say you were mega-rich right in the 80s and you had like IBM whatever XT, right?

606
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:48,421
Speaker 1: It's like Yeah, that could tell you the date and time because there's a battery in there like Every time you want.

607
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:54,769
Speaker 1: it's like it is Yeah, but even if you just leave it on all the time, it's like well, you're not running a clock app.

608
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,210
Speaker 1: You know what, you know, it's like it only runs one application at a time.

609
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:02,986
Speaker 1: If you app you're running doesn't have a clock in it on display.

610
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:03,990
Speaker 1: That's not helping you, right?

611
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:10,260
Speaker 1: You have a you have an actual clock and an actual calendar somewhere right your computer like, you know There weren't like you think.

612
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:11,510
Speaker 1: Oh Google Calendar, right?

613
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:22,752
Speaker 1: So you can go back in time and look at calendar apps at a certain point Calendar apps disappear like yeah, was there even a calendar app for Windows 95?

614
00:48:22,752 --> 00:48:27,549
Speaker 0: By then I wasn't like doing that kind of thing in there, but it's like you didn't.

615
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there might have been but like it wasn't, you know.

616
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,546
Speaker 1: But now you get a phone and calendar app is like a default built-in thing.

617
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:35,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, there it is.

618
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:48,850
Speaker 0: It's interesting because when I think back When I like calendars were in pop culture like in sitcoms everywhere like you in movies You see like a calendar with like a date circle Like that would be a thing and that was normal people's lives.

619
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:57,855
Speaker 0: Like when I was a kid like I could walk through the kitchen and I could look at the calendar and I'd see dates circled and if I was a Kid was curious like oh When is the dog going to the vet?

620
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,721
Speaker 0: or when's mom's birthday?

621
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:02,210
Speaker 0: because I'm a kid and I don't remember all that stuff.

622
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,610
Speaker 0: Like when are we going to grandma grandpa's house?

623
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:12,189
Speaker 0: Like they were all just written in pen on a calendar I could just look at and the whole family would like put their shit on this shared calendar.

624
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:13,537
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

625
00:49:13,557 --> 00:49:13,919
Speaker 1: We also.

626
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,810
Speaker 1: there was a lot of different styles of calendars, too.

627
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:22,657
Speaker 1: I'm sure all the styles still exist, but it's like there was the style obviously the standard wall calendar Which I think one we used as a family.

628
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:23,339
Speaker 0: There's a big one.

629
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:26,570
Speaker 0: I still like a big wall calendar, right?

630
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:32,187
Speaker 1: But the one I got here that I got from the you know, Secret Santa it's like yeah, it's a wall calendar.

631
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:40,489
Speaker 1: But actually it's appropriately the the actual calendar part of it is just tiny and it's just a bunch of numbers and there's not really like.

632
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,496
Speaker 1: you couldn't Plan anything on this right?

633
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:42,818
Speaker 1: it.

634
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,790
Speaker 1: more than half of the paper is just artwork, right?

635
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,764
Speaker 1: It's a decoration more that you change every month more than it is.

636
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:54,930
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah for a long time Our family calendar was a giant one that had no real art in it.

637
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,459
Speaker 0: It was literally just like it had enough space to put every up.

638
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,290
Speaker 1: You also that that giant style.

639
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:06,199
Speaker 1: They also used to make ones that were the giant style and you'd put them flat on your desk Right and like you wouldn't.

640
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,089
Speaker 1: this is before people had keyboards, right?

641
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:16,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you would sit at your desk and there, you know, you might be doing something on top of the calendar But your calendar was like your desk mat underneath everything.

642
00:50:16,402 --> 00:50:18,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was how I would do my homework on my.

643
00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:24,388
Speaker 1: I have not seen anyone do that style calendar on any desk in like a very, you know,

644
00:50:24,428 --> 00:50:34,370
Speaker 0: funnily enough I was watching a little bit of Rutenna because I'm still poking at the Rutenna thing and I just I saw this shot of like their dorm room and there's two desks and there aren't computers on the desks.

645
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:37,269
Speaker 0: And I had this moment of what the fuck did they do on those desks?

646
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:38,773
Speaker 1: Read books.

647
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,404
Speaker 1: Yeah and do their homework.

648
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:42,632
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly Like.

649
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,980
Speaker 0: there is nowhere to write things on my desk.

650
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,810
Speaker 0: if I need to use a desk to write things I need a different desk.

651
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,701
Speaker 1: Oh, I can write things on my desk.

652
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:51,210
Speaker 1: I just had to push the keyboard out of the way.

653
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:56,029
Speaker 0: Well, my desk is smaller than yours, but other style of calendar, right?

654
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,629
Speaker 1: So you got we hang on the wall.

655
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:01,325
Speaker 1: We got you know big mat or big big one on the wall.

656
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:05,021
Speaker 1: the other style of calendar They pretty sure still exists and I've got.

657
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,969
Speaker 1: I used to get more often and have terror ways.

658
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,059
Speaker 1: Yes, the tearaway kind

659
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:09,742
Speaker 0: every kid

660
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:10,064
Speaker 1: I

661
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:11,309
Speaker 0: do at a far-side one

662
00:51:12,151 --> 00:51:15,276
Speaker 1: Far-side was definitely the best one I think that I can think of and

663
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:23,770
Speaker 0: I had some other plan as a kid to not look ahead At all and everybody and every morning there because that calendar served a different purpose.

664
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:26,550
Speaker 0: The wall calendar was like the planning calendar.

665
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:43,929
Speaker 0: The tearaway calendar was the one that was in my bedroom next to my bed And when I woke when my alarm went off every morning I would turn on news radio to find out if anything happened in the world and then I would tear a page off the calendar and See what day it was and what the shit I had to do that day.

666
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:46,919
Speaker 1: Oh, see the tearaway calendar for me was.

667
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:47,762
Speaker 1: it was on my desk.

668
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:49,489
Speaker 1: I did tear it away every day, right?

669
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:51,294
Speaker 0: I turned away the moment.

670
00:51:51,334 --> 00:51:51,857
Speaker 0: I woke up.

671
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:56,722
Speaker 1: I woke up like it was a thing maybe but you know I mean I did it after I got out of the bed.

672
00:51:56,782 --> 00:52:03,112
Speaker 0: when I woke up, but I would lay in bed It was literally within arm's reach of my it doesn't Like.

673
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:04,015
Speaker 0: look at.

674
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:16,179
Speaker 1: the point is is that that calendar would be a way for you not having a computer That's on displaying a date all the time not having a phone to Say what day is today because you have the wall calendar.

675
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:23,986
Speaker 1: the wall calendar unless you're exiting it off religiously, which you might Doesn't tell you what today's date is the tearaway calendar.

676
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:34,690
Speaker 1: you glance at it You know what today's date is and also in addition It provides you like a thing to check and like a little shot of serotonin or dopamine or whatever every day.

677
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,301
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I pull it and there's a new fireside comic.

678
00:52:37,342 --> 00:52:41,950
Speaker 0: even though I'd already read every fireside comic I would get a little sensible chuckle out of it, right?

679
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:47,530
Speaker 1: So even in a day when you didn't you couldn't doom scroll whenever you needed some brain juice, right?

680
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:51,310
Speaker 1: You could get a little brain juice every day from a tearaway calendar.

681
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:58,097
Speaker 0: I always forget that there was a time in my life when I didn't just have a little box that would give me infinite brain juice Exactly.

682
00:52:58,117 --> 00:52:59,270
Speaker 1: You can just only get brain juice.

683
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,102
Speaker 1: You get this little tiny brain juice once a day from your little calendar, right?

684
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:03,569
Speaker 1: and some of the ones I don't.

685
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:04,735
Speaker 1: I think Some of these are my brother.

686
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:05,902
Speaker 1: I think he got them more than me.

687
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:07,290
Speaker 1: There was like a Mets trivia one.

688
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,349
Speaker 1: There was a Simpsons one that was like full color that had like Simpsons quotes and things.

689
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:18,210
Speaker 1: Definitely every single newspaper comic strip, you know fireside included had one where each day would be a different strip.

690
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:18,572
Speaker 1: I don't.

691
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:21,607
Speaker 1: I don't think maybe Calvin Hobbes didn't have one because he didn't like merchandise.

692
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:26,009
Speaker 0: but yeah And I'm pretty sure at one point I had a foxtrot one.

693
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:31,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I had a Dilbert one too because I didn't know I may have had a Dilbert one Which is like.

694
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:33,361
Speaker 1: at the time Dilbert was fine.

695
00:53:33,402 --> 00:53:35,230
Speaker 1: And now the Dilbert guy is like the worst person.

696
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:40,989
Speaker 0: It's like Dilbert was okay funny at that time and we didn't know anything about the person and then learn about the person.

697
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:46,315
Speaker 0: and also Dilbert Got worse, but simultaneously Knowing what I know.

698
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:49,130
Speaker 0: now old Dilbert has a sinister undercurrent.

699
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:55,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there were also ones that are like, you know cute cat picture, right and you couldn't just get cute cat pictures.

700
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:58,798
Speaker 1: in 1990 something On the internet in the 90s took a while.

701
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:02,116
Speaker 1: It's like you.

702
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:08,006
Speaker 1: there wasn't a plate you couldn't go to like reddit slash our Imgur or whatever and just type cat and see cute cat pictures for days.

703
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:08,910
Speaker 1: There was no such thing.

704
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:12,667
Speaker 1: So getting one cute cat picture a day was worth paying money for.

705
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:18,587
Speaker 1: yeah You never seen those cats or dogs or whatever fish, you know, whatever calendar they sold.

706
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:33,299
Speaker 0: but So what's interesting to me is because I never had calendars where I particularly like the art And I kind of avoided buying them like even if they were really good art because I could only have one or two calendars up At any given time, it would

707
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:35,189
Speaker 1: be really weird to have a whole bunch of calendars.

708
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I knew who had like a lot of calendars for some reason.

709
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:40,950
Speaker 1: It's not like having four clocks for different time zones.

710
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,669
Speaker 1: It's like you put four calendars in the hall really just to show off your four different arts.

711
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd only change the calendars like that.

712
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:47,710
Speaker 1: You only change them once a month.

713
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:52,670
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like, you know, you're not getting you're only getting your you know, your brain juice once a month.

714
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,419
Speaker 1: That's not really what those are for right?

715
00:54:55,439 --> 00:55:00,197
Speaker 0: Yep, and I had a day play like a planner that I would use too But that's kind of a separate topic that will.

716
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:01,261
Speaker 1: let's talk about that.

717
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:02,366
Speaker 1: So well, I don't know.

718
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,250
Speaker 1: so planners, right?

719
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:03,692
Speaker 1: So I do.

720
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:05,543
Speaker 1: I do remember I got an anecdote right.

721
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:08,218
Speaker 1: is my dad What he would use for work?

722
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:10,430
Speaker 1: is there was I don't know if they still must still exist.

723
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:12,870
Speaker 1: There was a company that was or brand called.

724
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,879
Speaker 1: I think was called day runner and they made you could.

725
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:24,550
Speaker 1: there's like a whole section at staples with like day runner stuff and they Sell these little binders and that were small and they would sell all kinds of different things.

726
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,025
Speaker 1: You could put in the binder right calendars and you you never seen these.

727
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:30,510
Speaker 0: I've seen similar things.

728
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:31,113
Speaker 0: I don't think I know.

729
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:34,209
Speaker 0: that sounds like the moleskine equivalent of the things I used.

730
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,677
Speaker 1: It was like the opposite of moleskine right?

731
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,165
Speaker 1: It was like moleskine is like blank pages.

732
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:44,570
Speaker 1: This is like Extreme like you can buy different packs of stuff to put in.

733
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:59,850
Speaker 1: Note pages, you know Rolodex pages, you know plan your whole day agenda by the hour pages meeting notes like specialized pages That are exactly the right size to fit in your day runner, which that honestly

734
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:04,609
Speaker 0: Really important because you didn't have a little box that told you all the things you had to do.

735
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, it totally made sense for the time, right?

736
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:14,041
Speaker 1: It was like it was basically making a palm pilot out of paper And you choose which pages you put in there in what order.

737
00:56:14,443 --> 00:56:15,326
Speaker 1: right and there could be.

738
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,213
Speaker 1: there was like a you get like a Contact thing.

739
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:18,278
Speaker 1: there was the thing you could buy.

740
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:25,150
Speaker 1: that had like little tabs on the side like a through Z. So you could and you could you know, write down all the names and phone numbers of all your contacts.

741
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,790
Speaker 0: I had a literal Rolodex that was also on my nightstand of all my contacts.

742
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:33,615
Speaker 1: But if you had this thing It would basically be everything in one.

743
00:56:33,695 --> 00:56:33,876
Speaker 1: right.

744
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:40,214
Speaker 1: your calendar right for that your monthly calendar your daily agenda right meeting at 3 p.m Kind of stuff right.

745
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:45,877
Speaker 1: your contact list your notes like literally if you were actually a business person Yeah, you would.

746
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:47,390
Speaker 1: you know, you spend some money on this thing.

747
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:53,610
Speaker 1: It's kind of fancy and kind of you know, a little gimmicky, but it would work out in a pre-pump pilot days.

748
00:56:53,851 --> 00:57:02,546
Speaker 1: yeah, you know pre anyway, but pre smartphone days, but So the thing is my dad would use that at work for real.

749
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:06,784
Speaker 1: he used it Legitimately and they're just having to be extra day runners stuff.

750
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:11,263
Speaker 1: So I basically made my own Runner and I would go to Staples and I bought some packs.

751
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:16,158
Speaker 1: I didn't use it properly Cuz I was in what like fourth or fifth grade.

752
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:17,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would.

753
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:20,709
Speaker 0: I had a lot of things to try to organize my life But I didn't have that much to organize.

754
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:26,988
Speaker 1: But I would like carry it around and like have you know fun, I guess pretending to use it whatever kinda.

755
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:39,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that was the thing and honestly like nothing changed in this ecosystem of calendars until like Pretty much after we got out of college.

756
00:57:40,952 --> 00:57:54,955
Speaker 0: Okay, so day runner is now at a glance Cuz like okay, but like thinking even in RIT like there weren't smartphones yet We had a calendar in the kitchen in the geek not geek house Or the geek apartment.

757
00:57:54,995 --> 00:57:58,430
Speaker 0: I guess like I had to use like physical calendars to track stuff.

758
00:57:58,831 --> 00:57:59,816
Speaker 0: There weren't really good apps.

759
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:01,745
Speaker 0: Like I wasn't gonna pay for outlook or anything.

760
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:09,543
Speaker 0: So Even all right, like as late as college I still had physical paper calendars to remember like when is the final exam?

761
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:10,526
Speaker 0: When am I going home?

762
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,570
Speaker 0: What's going on in my life?

763
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:22,050
Speaker 0: the moment where that changed was when I went off to work at IBM while I was at RIT on my first co-op and I won cuz I didn't have any fucking money.

764
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:29,310
Speaker 0: I won a fancy color palm pilot in a raffle among all the co-ops at IBM.

765
00:58:29,953 --> 00:58:33,161
Speaker 0: Remember that little guy That like I was great.

766
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,190
Speaker 0: I used it as a calendar.

767
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,860
Speaker 0: I actually put all my calendar ink into it in like forever.

768
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:44,223
Speaker 0: Like I stopped using physical calendars and it was fucking amazing Mm-hmm, not like me with the day runner.

769
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:45,210
Speaker 1: I didn't actually use it.

770
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:54,952
Speaker 0: You actually used it cuz that was right when my life got more complex Like I had work meetings and then like I had to plan like what weekend am I gonna go back to RIT and hang out With Scott?

771
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:55,756
Speaker 0: like oh this weekend.

772
00:58:55,776 --> 00:58:56,138
Speaker 0: We're busy.

773
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:58,187
Speaker 0: that weekend is an anime music night.

774
00:58:58,207 --> 00:58:58,890
Speaker 0: So that's the weekend.

775
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,547
Speaker 0: I'll go back.

776
00:59:01,055 --> 00:59:03,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that you know What happened was is there were?

777
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:08,230
Speaker 1: I did have several attempts to use some sort of digital calendar situation.

778
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:30,326
Speaker 1: The first one I think was probably Thunderbird because at the time, you know pre gmail We used the Thunderbird email client right to connect to pop or imap email Whatever your service was and that all you know, the whole Mozilla suite right which originally Mozilla was, you know, not just Browser but also the email the composer and the cow.

779
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:31,510
Speaker 1: It was like all those things combined.

780
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:36,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, they took the browser and made it Firefox and then all the other stuff was in Thunderbird, right?

781
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,348
Speaker 1: And the composer I think went in the trash.

782
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:43,555
Speaker 1: But Thunderbird did have that calendar in it Yeah, and I tried to use it.

783
00:59:43,615 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 1: but like I just as much as I tried several times to use Different digital calendaring solutions like I never fully bought into one.

784
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:59,730
Speaker 1: I think early in the iPhone days I was using the iPhone calendar app like sort of but like I wasn't.

785
01:00:00,811 --> 01:00:03,581
Speaker 1: It wasn't like really I wasn't putting everything in there.

786
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:05,789
Speaker 1: I wasn't really checking it, you know, well,

787
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:18,230
Speaker 0: you know There's this weird time period where I had the Palm Pilot which made it easier like I started using it digitally but I had a calendar for my real life and a Separate calendar for work as I started having the kind of job where I had to have like meetings and stuff all the time.

788
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:25,770
Speaker 0: But I used Lotus Notes for that because I worked at IBM and then outlook when I've got my next jobs after IBM.

789
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:31,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that you know, it wasn't until I think Google Calendar I was.

790
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:33,630
Speaker 0: that was the one that was when I converged everything.

791
01:00:34,312 --> 01:00:46,750
Speaker 1: Right, but then I don't know when like when did I actually start because there definitely was a time period between The launch of Google Calendar and then me actually using it for reals.

792
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:53,629
Speaker 0: I started using Google Calendar almost immediately and I got stopped using my Palm Pilot like basically then.

793
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:56,322
Speaker 1: Okay, so when was this?

794
01:00:58,331 --> 01:01:04,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, so I'm a back as Google Calendar came out in 2006 just as we were like moving to beacon.

795
01:01:05,112 --> 01:01:11,550
Speaker 1: Okay, so if I'm looking like 2008 like yeah, there's some events in there, but really it's sparse.

796
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,494
Speaker 1: It's just like this.

797
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:13,017
Speaker 1: I'm not.

798
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:15,970
Speaker 0: I'd have to look at my other old gmail account that I don't use anymore.

799
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:28,281
Speaker 1: Okay, but yeah in 2008 2009 I'm using it a little bit like I'm seeing convention as like only special events like convention Mets game, you know day off work stuff like that.

800
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:33,336
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, I look at today, right today I'm really you know, it's like.

801
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:36,910
Speaker 1: okay here are you know, and not only is it calendar?

802
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:37,411
Speaker 1: It's also.

803
01:01:37,452 --> 01:01:41,924
Speaker 1: I got Google tasks and reminders integrated into the calendar, right?

804
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:43,870
Speaker 1: It's like there's two work meetings.

805
01:01:44,251 --> 01:01:48,064
Speaker 1: There's something someone else is doing because I have their calendar on my calendar.

806
01:01:48,325 --> 01:01:49,870
Speaker 1: There's geek nights on the calendar.

807
01:01:50,131 --> 01:01:50,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

808
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,889
Speaker 1: now we're really using the calendar.

809
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:55,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I've been.

810
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:59,310
Speaker 1: I think I've been really using it from at least maybe 10 ish years.

811
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:00,623
Speaker 0: I think it bothers me.

812
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:12,330
Speaker 0: the most though Is that like I have my work calendar and I have my life calendar and like I just internalize like the differences and that's all Fine, but most of the adults I know won't respond to a calendar invitation.

813
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:15,621
Speaker 0: They don't use digital calendars the way we do ever at least.

814
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:18,290
Speaker 1: everyone at my work everyone uses at work.

815
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:18,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, they work.

816
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:20,717
Speaker 0: Everyone is fine like at work.

817
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:23,305
Speaker 1: Everyone uses Google Calendar and Google Meet.

818
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,770
Speaker 1: the integrations, right?

819
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,792
Speaker 1: Actually, you know the less I'm actually.

820
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:37,365
Speaker 1: the people who are less computer II than me are actually better at using the cool calendar stuff than I I'm talking about Outside of work like people don't like if I send a calendar invite to a normal person.

821
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:38,329
Speaker 0: They just won't see it.

822
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:52,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, no outside of work I mean first of all, the one thing is that when you're at work and even though there's this universal Cal dev thing Which is a Monday topic that does provide integration between different calendar formats whether someone's using Outlook or Apple or?

823
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:59,410
Speaker 1: And it does work if you know how to you know People just can't do it for whatever reason.

824
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:00,755
Speaker 0: I don't know why it does just work.

825
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:06,279
Speaker 0: if someone uses fucking outlook and sends me an email with an iCal in it It'll just work for me.

826
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:08,029
Speaker 1: It'll just work in your Google Calendar.

827
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:10,810
Speaker 0: Yes Seems capable of this right?

828
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:19,548
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you're all using the same system It is still a little bit easier, even though the inter system stuff does work well with the Cal files.

829
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:23,379
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, people can't seem to deal with it.

830
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,090
Speaker 1: if like, you know, we try to use some Google Calendar with friends.

831
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,500
Speaker 0: So I'd I discovered.

832
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:33,770
Speaker 0: I won't name any names But the impression I get from most of these some some friends are doing it.

833
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,300
Speaker 1: The problem is unless all the necessary people do it doesn't?

834
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:37,962
Speaker 1: it doesn't work.

835
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:40,831
Speaker 0: many of our friends just still use physical calendars for some Reason.

836
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:43,599
Speaker 0: a lot of people a lot of adults.

837
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:44,482
Speaker 0: I know you all.

838
01:03:44,722 --> 01:03:51,343
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you might not have a smartphone, but All of our friends have a fully smart phones.

839
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:52,709
Speaker 1: That is correct.

840
01:03:54,632 --> 01:03:55,838
Speaker 0: I don't understand this.

841
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:56,099
Speaker 0: like.

842
01:03:56,481 --> 01:04:00,381
Speaker 0: I've even had people like I like oh Can I send you a calendar invite and they like.

843
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:02,090
Speaker 0: they understand what I asked?

844
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,816
Speaker 0: They're not that far gone, but they are.

845
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:04,799
Speaker 0: they get weird about it.

846
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:06,746
Speaker 0: They're like, why just like?

847
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:07,890
Speaker 0: why do you want to count?

848
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,859
Speaker 0: Like why do you need this?

849
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,648
Speaker 0: Why do you want this?

850
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,041
Speaker 0: It's because it's easy also because you're gonna.

851
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:13,543
Speaker 1: you have to.

852
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,853
Speaker 1: I know you're gonna write it up And also you.

853
01:04:16,295 --> 01:04:22,930
Speaker 1: when you have the calendar on your phone digitally or even on your desktop you get the reminders Right and not only do you get the reminders?

854
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:28,790
Speaker 1: But let's say you create a meeting right between five people and you get all the five people together.

855
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:29,092
Speaker 1: You're all.

856
01:04:29,193 --> 01:04:29,798
Speaker 1: you're all together.

857
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:31,149
Speaker 1: now you're on a phone call.

858
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, you say okay or meeting Friday at 3. everyone writes in their paper calendar.

859
01:04:34,862 --> 01:04:35,825
Speaker 1: Friday at 3 p.m.

860
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:37,249
Speaker 1: Meeting call so-and-so, right?

861
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,903
Speaker 1: Okay, bye, right Friday at 3 rolls around.

862
01:04:41,325 --> 01:04:42,550
Speaker 1: no reminder, right?

863
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:46,149
Speaker 1: But even if you you were looking at your calendar you make the call.

864
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,863
Speaker 1: Someone isn't on the call.

865
01:04:48,964 --> 01:04:49,670
Speaker 1: what happened to them?

866
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:57,038
Speaker 1: I don't know if you had used the digital calendar, even if you had different systems and somebody would be like, ah shit I can't make it.

867
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:01,303
Speaker 1: taking them going They can go click on it and say can't make it.

868
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:08,748
Speaker 1: and now suddenly on everyone else's calendar It syncs up and it's like hey you you know meeting canceled so-and-so can't make it.

869
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:12,030
Speaker 1: And now you don't bother making that phone call at 3.

870
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:17,923
Speaker 1: Yeah, right You can see who's showing up when who's not showing up what meet where it is.

871
01:05:17,943 --> 01:05:20,630
Speaker 1: if the location changes the location changes.

872
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:22,819
Speaker 1: You don't have to like oh shit.

873
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:25,590
Speaker 1: I forgot to write the different location on my account on my paper calendar.

874
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,494
Speaker 1: Right.

875
01:05:26,775 --> 01:05:30,710
Speaker 1: It's like the paper calendar is just dead for life organizing.

876
01:05:30,891 --> 01:05:40,614
Speaker 0: I've noticed a lot of the people I know not just friends But just like acquaintances and co-workers in their normal lives if they have a family with a bunch of kids They tend to like.

877
01:05:40,775 --> 01:05:43,162
Speaker 0: their calendar doesn't really intersect with other people's calendars.

878
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:45,450
Speaker 0: So they just use a physical one that could work.

879
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:50,377
Speaker 1: You could all you know, yeah, I mean if you don't want to you know Put up a whole TV on the wall.

880
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,989
Speaker 1: just display the Google the family Google Calendar, right?

881
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:57,985
Speaker 1: Yeah paper calendar for the family schedules makes perfect sense even in 2020.

882
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:04,377
Speaker 0: The other thing I noticed is some people resisted as being like They have this weird social hang up of.

883
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,430
Speaker 0: it's weird to send someone a calendar invitation for a social or non-work thing.

884
01:06:09,892 --> 01:06:12,643
Speaker 0: Like they have this weird idea that that's weird or awkward.

885
01:06:12,663 --> 01:06:13,045
Speaker 1: Why is that?

886
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:16,900
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem I don't know But I see that resistance happen in real time.

887
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,607
Speaker 1: I haven't I don't know.

888
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:19,310
Speaker 1: That's just strange.

889
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:20,814
Speaker 1: Like why wouldn't you do then?

890
01:06:21,255 --> 01:06:26,830
Speaker 1: I could see someone who's super paper calendary and like to switch to digital calendar.

891
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,942
Speaker 1: They'd have to spend some time putting in all existing things.

892
01:06:30,963 --> 01:06:37,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, right into it and that initial Roadblock might stop someone from making that crossover.

893
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:47,730
Speaker 1: But I think it was easier for me to just because I wasn't Calendaring that much to begin with right and so by I just started for nothing and then I just calendared more over time.

894
01:06:47,850 --> 01:07:07,259
Speaker 0: Well, cuz my calendar really the only things I put in calendars now are When there's when I have travel When I gotta do something at a specific time or date for some reason Or like appointments with like doctors like specifically personal appointments just for the reminders Like I don't have that much occurs granted.

895
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:07,962
Speaker 0: It's COVID time.

896
01:07:08,002 --> 01:07:09,750
Speaker 0: So there's fucking nothing in my calendar right now.

897
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:12,413
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually, you know what?

898
01:07:12,433 --> 01:07:15,042
Speaker 0: I have in my calendar on Monday play games.

899
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:18,722
Speaker 0: I just put it says play games all day event very nice.

900
01:07:21,093 --> 01:07:23,844
Speaker 0: Oh, I just looked at my calendar of magfest is still there.

901
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:25,290
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

902
01:07:27,552 --> 01:07:34,515
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I just want to quickly talk about the third part, you know, cuz the food isn't here yet The types of calendar.

903
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:36,160
Speaker 1: So everyone uses the same.

904
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,933
Speaker 1: I think pretty much the whole world right is mostly using the same Calendar.

905
01:07:39,953 --> 01:07:46,041
Speaker 0: Yes, January February There's are sometimes used in parallel in a lot of countries.

906
01:07:46,122 --> 01:07:48,355
Speaker 0: like there's a lot of that but yes There are.

907
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:51,737
Speaker 1: you know, I being a Jew I've seen you know There's the Hebrew calendar and they always.

908
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:52,661
Speaker 1: basically it's a lunar.

909
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:54,650
Speaker 1: if you don't know the Hebrew calendar is a lunar calendar.

910
01:07:55,033 --> 01:08:03,023
Speaker 1: So a new day starts when the Sun sets And the you know moon rises theoretically Even though the moon can rise at other times.

911
01:08:03,063 --> 01:08:19,608
Speaker 1: I know how the moon works But a day starts when the Sun sets and there's less days in a month because it's synced to the phases of the moon Right, and then what they do is they base to catch up to like the real the Gregorian calendar Right and for other reasons as well.

912
01:08:20,474 --> 01:08:22,564
Speaker 1: Every so I think it's every four years.

913
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:23,430
Speaker 1: They have a leap month.

914
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:30,790
Speaker 1: There's a month of the Hebrew calendar called Adar and it's a dar the first and then they'll every every few years.

915
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:37,629
Speaker 1: They'll be in a dar and a dar - It'd be like if there was January and then every four years there was January - yeah.

916
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:43,326
Speaker 1: And what's interesting is actually the a dar - is actually the real a dar.

917
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:48,057
Speaker 1: the a dar one is the extra time The leave one before the.

918
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,462
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that's true.

919
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:57,654
Speaker 0: There's a Wikipedia page that lists in Order every country formally adopting the Gregorian calendar Starting with Belgium.

920
01:08:57,694 --> 01:09:01,609
Speaker 0: in 1582 a whole bunch of countries for Belgium was the first day.

921
01:09:01,689 --> 01:09:10,670
Speaker 0: Well, Belgium is the first in the list because it starts with B. Much of Europe adopted it in 1582 for reasons that I hope you learned in social studies.

922
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:11,756
Speaker 1: Was that was that around?

923
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:13,509
Speaker 1: was that when Gregor was still around?

924
01:09:14,491 --> 01:09:15,924
Speaker 0: Greg or stabbed Julian?

925
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:19,189
Speaker 0: I heard Yeah, it's to February.

926
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:33,009
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if you scroll through like there's this like slow and steady adoption of a good chunk of the world like in the 1700s like a lot of the Nordic countries all adopted it.

927
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:37,189
Speaker 0: But if you go all the way to the bottom, I'm curious because I did not I did not know this.

928
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:43,529
Speaker 0: What do you think was the most recent country to adopt the Gregorian calendar officially?

929
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,261
Speaker 0: Antarctica, it's not a country.

930
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,856
Speaker 1: I Guess not technically not again.

931
01:09:48,996 --> 01:09:52,029
Speaker 0: I was surprised but it makes sense based on all the other things.

932
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:53,861
Speaker 0: I know but I just didn't think about it.

933
01:09:54,182 --> 01:09:55,410
Speaker 0: I'll tell you the year it happened.

934
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:01,663
Speaker 1: Okay a country that wouldn't it hasn't adopted.

935
01:10:01,684 --> 01:10:03,330
Speaker 0: it's a big real country, too.

936
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,464
Speaker 0: This isn't some like bullshit technicality of like Andorra or something.

937
01:10:06,484 --> 01:10:07,308
Speaker 0: No, no.

938
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:17,422
Speaker 0: Mongolia Saudi Arabia No, that makes they shifted from the Islamic calendar to the Gregorian calendar on October 1st, 2016.

939
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:17,890
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

940
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:27,121
Speaker 0: so the previous time anyone adopted it was basically World War one like Greek Civil War and World War one like Greece was 1923. a whole bunch of countries.

941
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:34,967
Speaker 0: 1919 1918 like Russia Russian Revolution like that makes sense.

942
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,892
Speaker 0: That's why 1918.

943
01:10:36,892 --> 01:10:38,923
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, you know, how did it get adopted?

944
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:40,250
Speaker 1: mostly colonialism, right?

945
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:47,770
Speaker 1: It's like so much of the world was using it because the colonialism and then people in countries were you know Need to communicate with each other and work with each other.

946
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:50,059
Speaker 1: So they needed to have dates that were the same.

947
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:51,223
Speaker 1: and then which calendar?

948
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:51,464
Speaker 1: one?

949
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:56,534
Speaker 1: the one that more people were using already From the Julian calendar It's just handled.

950
01:10:56,555 --> 01:11:03,399
Speaker 1: uh and handle is the earth goes around that regardless of what calendar you're using It's gonna be based on some sort of celestial movements.

951
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:04,442
Speaker 1: Yeah something right.

952
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:06,730
Speaker 1: a day is a day for everybody, right?

953
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,424
Speaker 1: Regardless of what your calendar system is the Sun goes up and the Sun goes down.

954
01:11:10,464 --> 01:11:13,560
Speaker 1: whether you start your day when the Sun goes Down or when it comes up, right?

955
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,244
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

956
01:11:14,264 --> 01:11:19,182
Speaker 1: the complication Concept of a day is the same for everyone.

957
01:11:19,603 --> 01:11:21,690
Speaker 1: So from there you synchronize it.

958
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,974
Speaker 1: However, you got to synchronize it.

959
01:11:23,094 --> 01:11:31,430
Speaker 0: The problem is that it takes a non like divisible number of days For the Sun the earth to encircle the Sun.

960
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,040
Speaker 1: You don't even have to have a count that doesn't you mean?

961
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,710
Speaker 1: a lot of calendars are based on that but they don't have to.

962
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,714
Speaker 0: They don't have to be.

963
01:11:37,734 --> 01:11:40,384
Speaker 0: there are proposals or post earth calendars.

964
01:11:40,986 --> 01:11:42,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could just have a calendar.

965
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:42,852
Speaker 1: That's like okay.

966
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:44,377
Speaker 1: a day is you know?

967
01:11:44,517 --> 01:11:48,870
Speaker 1: one rotation of you know, the earth, you know spinning around its own axis for it.

968
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,830
Speaker 1: You know the Sun to go up and we did have calendars like that.

969
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:55,508
Speaker 1: The problem was and then you start counting it one and that's the day and there's no years.

970
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:56,070
Speaker 1: There's no months.

971
01:11:56,171 --> 01:12:01,830
Speaker 1: It's just yeah today's day When the old ice today today's 2005.

972
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,560
Speaker 1: All right.

973
01:12:02,702 --> 01:12:03,531

Speaker 1: We showed you statements videos affidavits that prove President Trump Incited an insurrection an insurrection that he alone had the power to stop and The fact that he didn't stop it The fact that he incited a lawless attack and abdicated his duty to defend us from it The fact that he actually further inflamed
