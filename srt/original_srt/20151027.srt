00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,963
Speaker 1: We're talking about subterfuge.

00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,249
Speaker 1: It's about submarines.

5
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,303
Speaker 0: Let's do this Get it.

6
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:30,024
Speaker 1: So this is kind of news.

7
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,030
Speaker 1: It would be metanormal.

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,770
Speaker 1: You'd say this is the end of the show, but I'll bring it over the meta moment.

9
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we'll bring it up in the meta moment.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,276
Speaker 1: We will but I'll bring it up at least here.

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,769
Speaker 1: for those of you who just listened to the show is all rims idea.

12
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:53,053
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is uh, you know I've noticed that there's people who are in the forum don't listen to the show and people who listen to the show don't use the forum, so we launched a patreon Mostly to run.

13
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:55,501
Speaker 0: launch to patreon all the projects.

14
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,464
Speaker 1: we want to do that.

15
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,210
Speaker 1: We can't do for a lot of reasons.

16
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:01,305
Speaker 0: I won't do anyway, you'll probably won't do anything different than did before.

17
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:02,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do more stuff.

18
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,630
Speaker 1: Things gonna happen.

19
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:08,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, well if you don't come over and do it I'm just gonna do them all myself cuz actually I can do a lot faster that way.

20
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:15,529
Speaker 1: but anyway, if you want to give us money, we have a patreon and now there's a way for you to do that.

21
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:20,104
Speaker 1: and If we hit $300 a month our first little goal.

22
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:21,469
Speaker 1: I put goals in there.

23
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:29,909
Speaker 1: Then we're gonna release the all the beta episodes of geek nights Which a listener just now messaged me and found them online.

24
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:32,163
Speaker 0: They're not hard to find.

25
00:01:32,244 --> 00:01:38,930
Speaker 0: it's just a yeah You just common sense URL pattern little bit a little bit of thinking got to know some stuff all you know.

26
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,170
Speaker 0: I've given all hints that I'm never gonna give in that forum thread and some people figured it out.

27
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,916
Speaker 1: But I looked at what's in there.

28
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:49,130
Speaker 1: I think there I have more episodes that we never put anywhere.

29
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:50,796
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

30
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,642
Speaker 1: Well, I have a lot of.

31
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,830
Speaker 1: I have all the flack files from the original days.

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,175
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's interesting.

33
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:57,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,544
Speaker 0: Those are all that there was.

35
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:00,070
Speaker 1: I'm gonna figure that out for sure.

36
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:08,590
Speaker 1: And if we hit that goal I'm gonna publish them for backers like one by one with commentary and I'm gonna remaster them as much as I can.

37
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:15,188
Speaker 1: Because the other MP3 podcast commentary this no, I'm gonna introduce them like, okay.

38
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:15,750
Speaker 1: Here's the deal.

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,142
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't want someone to listen to one of those and be like.

40
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,610
Speaker 1: this is fucking geek nights.

41
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,150
Speaker 1: This is what you guys listen to because they're not good.

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,370
Speaker 0: But yeah, I don't understand why even people give us money for this like why what why?

43
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:32,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, well honestly, well, we'll get into it more.

44
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:32,844
Speaker 1: talk about in the meta bit.

45
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,470
Speaker 0: he should probably cancel your patreon.

46
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:40,070
Speaker 1: We also I we are reselling the original geek nights t-shirt.

47
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:41,656
Speaker 0: Why not see?

48
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,470
Speaker 0: that's even crazier than paying for geek nights.

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,890
Speaker 0: I mean you guys will at least entertain someone better than some other podcasts.

50
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:51,086
Speaker 0: I mean, there are definitely better podcast than geek nights, but they're also many many that are worse.

51
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:55,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, not gonna lie I can't but it's still better than most podcasts.

52
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,070
Speaker 1: So the funniest thing we might.

53
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:02,944
Speaker 0: Why would you wear a picture of us on your self?

54
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,770
Speaker 0: So true fact, how would you pay money for that?

55
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,810
Speaker 1: I wore that t-shirt to work today.

56
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:15,511
Speaker 1: Why to see if anyone noticed that I was literally wearing a shirt that had a picture of me on it Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:16,816
Speaker 1: No one noticed.

58
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,143
Speaker 1: Okay, or at least no one said anything.

59
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:19,786
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,110
Speaker 1: I think they would have said something.

61
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,102
Speaker 1: I was kind of hoping they would.

62
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,278
Speaker 1: But Yeah, the t-shirts back and like four of you have bought them.

63
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,225
Speaker 1: so before I got that.

64
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:29,747
Speaker 0: okay, that's our.

65
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,929
Speaker 0: that's a Reasonable expectation for how many stupid people?

66
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,633
Speaker 0: Listening to the show.

67
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:35,719
Speaker 0: people isn't the show usually?

68
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:36,362
Speaker 0: aren't that dumb?

69
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:39,498
Speaker 1: So for dumb people, okay Well, yeah Scott's the self-deprecating one.

70
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,403
Speaker 1: I remember way back.

71
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:46,530
Speaker 1: We were at zinc icon and This kid like a young kid like obviously it like early high school comes up.

72
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,274
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god room.

73
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 1: and Scott big fan of your show.

74
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,505
Speaker 1: Ah, da da da.

75
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:50,550
Speaker 1: Can I have your autograph?

76
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:53,581
Speaker 1: And our two responses were me doing my usual.

77
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:54,926
Speaker 1: Well sure glad you listen.

78
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:55,548
Speaker 1: Thanks to whatever.

79
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:56,373
Speaker 1: shake his hand It's cops.

80
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:57,502
Speaker 1: Like why do you want my autograph?

81
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:58,570
Speaker 1: That's stupid.

82
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,243
Speaker 0: What is wrong?

83
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,149
Speaker 1: Don't listen to our show.

84
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:01,652
Speaker 0: Why?

85
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:05,390
Speaker 1: why do you want this book, but I needed a video to put on the patreon.

86
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:10,705
Speaker 1: So all I did was string together us introducing ourselves at a whole bunch of different panels over the years.

87
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:11,307
Speaker 0: That's a good video.

88
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:18,970
Speaker 1: We uh, We always do the exact same shtick in the beginning of every panel and ever really realized it until I watched it go by.

89
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,410
Speaker 1: What I put in that video is a small fraction of the dozens of almost identical things we've said over the years.

90
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:28,743
Speaker 0: It's a good idea.

91
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:38,205
Speaker 1: Yeah the only problem is the quality of the video gets worse and worse and worse as I go further back, but Anyway in the actual news, it's Tuesday.

92
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,070
Speaker 1: This isn't the meta part.

93
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,710
Speaker 1: We're not supposed to talk about geek nights other than during the one specific part of geek nights.

94
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:46,690
Speaker 1: Uh Gator gates back in the news a little bit.

95
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,733
Speaker 0: Are you talking about them?

96
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,081
Speaker 1: because this is actually worth knowing about.

97
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,850
Speaker 1: so South by Southwest is a convention.

98
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,310
Speaker 0: It's not really a convention.

99
00:04:54,511 --> 00:05:00,418
Speaker 0: Well this thing that sort of takes over Austin and messes up the town for a few days I remember and it's really weird.

100
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:02,105
Speaker 0: It's like it's not like any other.

101
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:02,989
Speaker 0: I mean, I've never been to.

102
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:03,812
Speaker 0: well I don't make this.

103
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,036
Speaker 1: magfest isn't a convention either.

104
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:05,839
Speaker 1: It's a festival.

105
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,090
Speaker 0: Whatever magfest is like conventions despite its name, right?

106
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just happens to have concerts that don't stop a schedules a little different.

107
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:21,269
Speaker 0: But South by Southwest is like it's spread out all over town with these separate events, you know You know packs there's sometimes like corporate events outside of packs, right?

108
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:27,783
Speaker 0: It's all by Southwest for what I can tell is a lot of things like that and it's well You know why they're the strangest combination.

109
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:28,850
Speaker 1: You want to know why they're that way.

110
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,150
Speaker 1: We know that because penny arcade when they open, you know, they were gonna do a pack south.

111
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:37,710
Speaker 1: They looked at putting it in Austin and Austin literally cannot host a large event, right?

112
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,881
Speaker 0: It doesn't have hotels or facilities but there's music festival.

113
00:05:41,921 --> 00:06:05,607
Speaker 0: this technology this and it seems like it's the most corporate thing and from what I can tell it's just a really big excuse for Trendy companies both startups and you know the midsize somewhat successful ones right that are all trendy and cool to all party get wasted and Have a blast in Austin for a week a year or whatever.

114
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:06,270
Speaker 1: not gonna lie.

115
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,478
Speaker 1: And I really not go to this.

116
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,550
Speaker 0: I have no, you know for everything that I've heard about it.

117
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,689
Speaker 0: I have no intention of ever going and I wouldn't suggest that anyone else go.

118
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,521
Speaker 0: But it's I don't know that I've never been.

119
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,365
Speaker 0: so I could be wrong.

120
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:30,022
Speaker 1: on the Wikipedia page Gross to the festival has brought concerns of violence and safety but I would have maybe considered going cuz they do panels like do a panel.

121
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,487
Speaker 0: I'm sure nobody goes to.

122
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:37,403
Speaker 1: yeah, but They don't compensate their panelists at all, aren't you paying to be a panel?

123
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:40,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're paying for the privilege of being a panelist Right.

124
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,336
Speaker 0: It's it's a corporate event.

125
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:43,845
Speaker 0: It's not something for a convention like we're used to.

126
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,479
Speaker 0: it's not a fan-run thing It's a man.

127
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:45,664
Speaker 0: also

128
00:06:46,291 --> 00:07:08,010
Speaker 1: Anecdotally, I've met a lot of people who are really into South by Southwest just in my like professional circles Most of the people I know or have met I hope they're not listening to this who have been to South by Southwest and like it are the kinds of people I would never want to be alone in a room with Not not the highest caliber people by and large.

129
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,897
Speaker 1: But anyway, they do have panels.

130
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:15,890
Speaker 1: and apparently the way you submit panels to South by Southwest is so stupid.

131
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:22,067
Speaker 1: It's on the tier of that reddit convention that fan not reddit to young blur the tumbler convention that failed.

132
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:23,250
Speaker 1: that shall not be named.

133
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:35,635
Speaker 1: so basically, what happened is Some people submitted a bunch of panels and Some of the panels were talking about like harassment and games and things and I think like Brianna Wu independently had a panels you Wanted to do.

134
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:39,796
Speaker 1: like people are just submitting panels I'm gonna quote from an article.

135
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,970
Speaker 1: That is a great insider view of what actually happened the full details.

136
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,858
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna quote because this just explains it all.

137
00:07:47,640 --> 00:08:01,333
Speaker 1: I hadn't previously been aware not having submitted to SXSW before that SXSW makes proposed panels Available for a public vote which includes both up votes and Down votes.

138
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:05,009
Speaker 1: the ability to download or just like something has proven in the past to be a pretty terrible idea.

139
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,014
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah If you have let.

140
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:13,030
Speaker 0: if you let the public choose your panel schedule every convention is gonna be 4chan the convention.

141
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,219
Speaker 1: Can you imagine PAX if they didn't have the super smart people?

142
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:25,650
Speaker 1: they have just picking the panels and they actually were like hey internet Vote on what panels you want from this list 4chan the panel, 4chan the panel, 4chan the panel.

143
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,870
Speaker 1: So basically the Gomergate morons flooded this thing with death threats and nonsense and voted down all the actual good panels.

144
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,066
Speaker 0: None of those people are actually gonna go to SXSW.

145
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,210
Speaker 0: Shouldn't you at least have to have a SXSW ticket to be able to vote?

146
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,216
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

147
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would make sense, right?

148
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,810
Speaker 0: I mean if you only let people with tickets vote then you might like actually succeed with this plan.

149
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,089
Speaker 0: It actually could work.

150
00:08:49,471 --> 00:09:11,030
Speaker 1: basically SXSW did nothing to deal with the ridiculous like violence threatening screeds that were being posted in the threads about all these panels and Then they cancelled all the panels that were getting this controversy Basically giving the Gomergators a win by cancelling all the harassment type panels that were gonna be at this convention.

151
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:19,958
Speaker 0: Wouldn't a thing to do to be cancel all the Gomergate panels and then it make those good panels win by default To make the Gomergate people lose.

152
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:22,105
Speaker 1: SXSW appears to be run very poorly.

153
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:35,988
Speaker 0: I mean Like if someone says hey Scott, we're gonna threaten you don't play Counter-Strike anymore, and I say Okay, I won't play Counter-Strike anymore, and I just play TF2.

154
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,155
Speaker 1: Well, then I'd threaten you to stop playing TF2.

155
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:40,302
Speaker 0: I just gave them what they wanted shouldn't I?

156
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:40,723
Speaker 0: shouldn't?

157
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:44,610
Speaker 0: the response be fuck you I'm gonna play extra Counter-Strike.

158
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,665
Speaker 1: The thing is this would happen at any convention if you let the internet vote that the answer is.

159
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:51,330
Speaker 0: I think I don't say any.

160
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:52,474
Speaker 0: I think if can.

161
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,781
Speaker 1: any large convention that was it was in.

162
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,087
Speaker 0: for example if we had Kineticon if we let them vote Only people had tickets vote.

163
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,886
Speaker 1: Okay, only people who have already pre-registered only people who have pre-registered members of Kineticon.

164
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:06,202
Speaker 0: if we let them vote Wouldn't be perfect.

165
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,090
Speaker 0: There would be problems.

166
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:15,643
Speaker 0: For example, they would probably vote in some homestuck panels that we don't want and they probably not because they're homestuck But because they're just ask a homestuck nonsense.

167
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:19,517
Speaker 0: Also, they would probably There'd be a lot of fan crab.

168
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:26,907
Speaker 0: the largest community right amongst all the nerd communities We get them get would probably dominate the schedule panels right.

169
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,915
Speaker 0: So like if cos if the cosplay community was bigger than the Doctor Who community then they could fill like the whole Schedule with cosplay panels

170
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:41,524
Speaker 1: which would be a problem because wall cosplay is a huge part of like Kineticon and lots of cosplayers Attend and like it's a big part of the kind of people are really.

171
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:42,790
Speaker 0: but the proportions would be off.

172
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:52,910
Speaker 0: You'd have like if people don't go to the cosplay panel 50% of the pet schedule would be cosplay panels, but cosplay just outnumbered the other geekery.

173
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,890
Speaker 0: So maybe 20% and all the other ones.

174
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,857
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it would be an adverse selection where that community would get their content in but yet their panel content is actually not Well-attended or pop and also a few panels.

175
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:09,718
Speaker 0: that should happen despite no one going to them like, you know Dog mushing probably wouldn't happen at all.

176
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:10,741
Speaker 1: I mean also like.

177
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,230
Speaker 1: honestly, I see all the submissions.

178
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:17,345
Speaker 1: I would not be comfortable as a person response, but it wouldn't be.

179
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,658
Speaker 0: but it wouldn't be as bad as The South by Southwest.

180
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,383
Speaker 0: let the enough vote.

181
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:22,390
Speaker 0: No, no, that's what I'm saying.

182
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,028
Speaker 0: You wouldn't really shouldn't do it, but it wouldn't be that bad.

183
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,495
Speaker 0: Just be bad one.

184
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:34,294
Speaker 1: if you're a prospective panelist never perform at a convention that won't at least comp your badge ever like fuck that Yeah, and oh.

185
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,529
Speaker 0: and also if they make you pay for pretty much and it's like you're working for them.

186
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:42,950
Speaker 0: They're putting on a convention and they need entertainment to get people to come to it.

187
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:52,823
Speaker 0: So usually when you're a convention you pay special guests money to fly Stay in a hotel and be at your convention and you advertise.

188
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,710
Speaker 0: this person is gonna be here that you paid.

189
00:11:55,204 --> 00:12:02,411
Speaker 0: You know you paid their appearance fee and now people are gonna buy tickets to cover that fee to come to your convention because they want to see this famous Person.

190
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:11,990
Speaker 0: if you're not as famous a convention isn't going to want to pay you a lot of money because you're not really Increasing their ticket sales, but you are still working for them.

191
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,961
Speaker 0: You are providing entertainment to their paying guys.

192
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,390
Speaker 1: You're providing ticket sales for the next year, right?

193
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,870
Speaker 0: You're doing work and giving them your time and effort for them to profit by selling tickets.

194
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:27,510
Speaker 0: You should not be paying them for the privilege of working for them.

195
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:37,996
Speaker 0: That's like if I went to a diner and I said hey let me buy some pancakes and then I went in the back and made the pancakes with ingredients that I brought and sat in the Diner and ate them.

196
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:44,050
Speaker 0: that is not a thing that you do Nor would anyone who common sense would not do that.

197
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,481
Speaker 1: So why I made this news on a Tuesday is one.

198
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:55,007
Speaker 1: it just happened and it's still evolving like apparently Buzzfeed and now Vox media and the verge all said the box is the verge.

199
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:59,490
Speaker 1: Yeah polygon Yeah, but they're like each of them had separate like sets like they're all running panels.

200
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,547
Speaker 1: Apparently they all said they're gonna pull out of the convention and just not perform that.

201
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,370
Speaker 0: they don't need to be there.

202
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,376
Speaker 0: They're not increasing the ticket sales But who's going?

203
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:08,140
Speaker 0: because they're there.

204
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:10,613
Speaker 1: the moral of this is one Pax.

205
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:14,207
Speaker 1: the gaming conventions are the best run fan conventions in the world.

206
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,051
Speaker 1: Like there's lip There's.

207
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,335
Speaker 1: so every.

208
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:21,917
Speaker 1: well every problem that a convention like this has is solved by just looking at packs and doing things the way they Do them and that might not.

209
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:28,129
Speaker 1: that might sound like we've drank some kool-aid But if you've been to a PAX and then been to like some anime con I've been to him.

210
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,821
Speaker 0: We've probably been to more conventions than almost everyone listening.

211
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:39,950
Speaker 1: if not everyone listening, you know better All right, but but number two the Gomer gate nonsense is far from done and is still a huge problem.

212
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,332
Speaker 0: It's not.

213
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:50,150
Speaker 0: it's a very small number of people relatively But they're causing these huge problems because there are morons out there if you're basically taking it.

214
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,169
Speaker 0: It's like when you play a board game and there's one player who's a noob and they don't know what's up.

215
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:57,589
Speaker 0: And if you're the troll player, you can totally just roll them over.

216
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:58,352
Speaker 0: But that's that's.

217
00:13:58,392 --> 00:14:03,150
Speaker 0: what's happening is that South by Southwest is the noob in the board game and Gomer gate is the troll who?

218
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,053
Speaker 0: Just bowled them over.

219
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:09,640
Speaker 1: It's like South by Southwest is the example of because they're unprofessional They have been all of us right all of us.

220
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,650
Speaker 0: We're all the other players in the game going?

221
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,198
Speaker 0: No, you you're one shitty player.

222
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:20,775
Speaker 1: ruin the whole game, you know, it's like guys lock your door Just lock it and they can't get in right.

223
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:24,364
Speaker 0: we have to get everyone's skills up to.

224
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,449
Speaker 0: you know, keep the fortress safe.

225
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:31,970
Speaker 0: So yeah, but there's one of the guards at the one of the draw bridges doesn't have the draw bridge works.

226
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:33,750
Speaker 0: It's like fuck who put you on guard, dude?

227
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,910
Speaker 1: There's a big hole in the wall and the draw bridges can't be drawn up at South by Southwest apparently now, so don't go there.

228
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's an unsafe for it.

229
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:49,578
Speaker 1: But that roiling mess of like basement dwelling gamer gate morons is there and if you let the shields down They do still come in and cause problems.

230
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you got any news Tuesday.

231
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,465
Speaker 0: I don't have any news because I mean there's a whole bunch of little gaming.

232
00:14:56,506 --> 00:15:00,930
Speaker 0: news is like for example Fallout 4 is like imminent and they finish all the cute little videos.

233
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,870
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and I really want to play it but I'm waiting for the game of the year edition for 10 bucks or whatever.

234
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,353
Speaker 0: That's gonna be in steam sale 2016 Money.

235
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:11,430
Speaker 0: why would I pay 50 bucks now for the same exact thing next year for 10 bucks?

236
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I learned that lesson with Fallout 3 and then like the way three was literally the game where I learned the lesson.

237
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:18,450
Speaker 0: So there's no way I'm making the mistake on follow.

238
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,889
Speaker 0: If anyone though wants to give me a copy early, I would play it now.

239
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:25,287
Speaker 0: I'm down with that, but I'm not paying.

240
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:29,509
Speaker 1: wait Wait, you don't want people to donate money to our patreon, but you want them to just give you games.

241
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,101
Speaker 0: Giving me a game is not a waste of money because I would get your.

242
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,330
Speaker 0: you know, fallout review real early.

243
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:42,387
Speaker 0: Oh You know some other games like doom is coming real close and some other stuff.

244
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,789
Speaker 0: Oh the The Blizzard tf2 clone overwatch is like bleeding.

245
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:51,210
Speaker 0: now Alright, it's because it's holiday season all the games are coming out of the woodwork.

246
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,623
Speaker 0: Mario maker got a big update that adds the important checkpoint feature.

247
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,610
Speaker 0: Yeah a little flag in the middle of the level.

248
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,269
Speaker 0: So if you get through my really hard part, I don't make you do it again because I'm not that evil.

249
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,164
Speaker 0: Anyway, but I don't have any significant gaming news.

250
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:08,690
Speaker 0: I can do some geek bite on a game I played that rim did not play and I'm gonna play soon if I do a full video.

251
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:16,343
Speaker 0: So we saw this game at PAX Prime in the mega booth on The last day of facts and we did some video of it though.

252
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,910
Speaker 0: I think some of that video may have been lost.

253
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,476
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

254
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't gone through all that Briefly.

255
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:25,990
Speaker 0: we briefly discussed it in an episode of geek nights But I want to talk about it a lot because I played it a lot in that game.

256
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:31,370
Speaker 0: It's called sub level zero and this game was pitched to me as dissent plus roguelike.

257
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,570
Speaker 0: If you don't know what dissent is, it's an old DOS game.

258
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,450
Speaker 0: There's also descent to descent three descent free space and I think free space too, but it was a game.

259
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:41,305
Speaker 0: It was the first game and only game that I played.

260
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:41,848
Speaker 0: that wasn't VR.

261
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:50,415
Speaker 0: They gave me some kind of motion sickness though It also cured my motion sickness because I just forced myself to play it for five ten minutes And then I was fine with it.

262
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,202
Speaker 0: and I haven't been motion sick playing a game since.

263
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:57,358
Speaker 0: and the thing with descent is Basically an FPS except the zero gravity.

264
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,835
Speaker 0: so you can rotate in any direction pitch yaw Etc left right.

265
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:06,250
Speaker 0: you can translate in every direction up down left, right?

266
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:15,150
Speaker 0: You can barrel roll in both directions to a barrel roll and you can thrust forward Reverse go straight backwards and also after burning a super fast forward.

267
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,249
Speaker 0: So you basically have complete 360 control and most people can't handle this.

268
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:21,950
Speaker 0: But it was an awesome game.

269
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:33,446
Speaker 0: It was a lot like doom and that it was the kind of FPS where you go around a maze fight bad guys get keys Open doors find secrets that sort of thing And had the best music descent to especially I just freaking rock music.

270
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:34,270
Speaker 0: it was fucking awesome.

271
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:34,833
Speaker 0: It was just.

272
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,545
Speaker 0: you could just take the CD and put it in a CD player and listen to it because it's you know DOS game.

273
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:46,310
Speaker 0: But this game sub level zero is does descent, you know that same full free space movement inside a maze.

274
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:47,839
Speaker 0: But it's a roguelike.

275
00:17:47,859 --> 00:18:01,216
Speaker 0: So that maze is procedure lie Generated and bad guys are inserted into it and you get loots and if you die The whole game over again, just like there's definitely been a like roguelike plus X-trend.

276
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,384
Speaker 0: and let me tell you half or two now.

277
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,394
Speaker 0: so let me tell you about this game.

278
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:12,256
Speaker 0: first of all, right the controls in this game the most important thing are Better than any descent game I ever played.

279
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:15,525
Speaker 0: they really they polished those fucking controls.

280
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:18,313
Speaker 0: How you playing it mouse keyboard Okay, right.

281
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,183
Speaker 0: They polished the fuck out of it so hard.

282
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:24,636
Speaker 0: It is so smooth is Like there's.

283
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:28,230
Speaker 0: no I have no control complaints whatsoever in any way, right?

284
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:37,556
Speaker 0: Number two the difficulty ramps up quite a bit The way that you know, it's like once.

285
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,042
Speaker 0: basically I can't get past.

286
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:42,646
Speaker 0: you start on sub level zero then one two Three four five and that's the end.

287
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:48,750
Speaker 0: I the boss of sub level two just like kicks my ass and there's some bad guys that are just really fucking nasty.

288
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:52,161
Speaker 0: I wonder if they're gonna adjust them or it's a roguelike.

289
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,185
Speaker 0: It's supposed to be nasty.

290
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,289
Speaker 0: Just fucking deal with it.

291
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, either way or but yeah, there's some guys that are really hard to deal with.

292
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:08,662
Speaker 0: you can get into tight situations And especially like you'll have a guy come at you and it's like for example You'll you'll be in a narrow hallway because it's procedurally generated.

293
00:19:08,702 --> 00:19:10,750
Speaker 0: you get into bad, you know luck times, right?

294
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,315
Speaker 0: You open the door at the end.

295
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,285
Speaker 0: There's a kind of guy who charges at you.

296
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,290
Speaker 0: It's like oh fuck.

297
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:15,916
Speaker 0: So what do you do?

298
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:16,744
Speaker 0: You're not gonna go forward?

299
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:22,230
Speaker 0: Yeah You mean you can't ram them right back, but you're gonna take serious damage and there's not a lot of health.

300
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,546
Speaker 1: So you're feeling this already cuz I'm thinking about like playing doom and like the kind like when I was good at.

301
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:27,690
Speaker 1: FPS is single-player.

302
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,462
Speaker 1: FPS is in the old days and even to send part of it came down to.

303
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,623
Speaker 1: I'd memorize and learn patterns And I'd know my way around maps.

304
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:38,995
Speaker 0: No, no It's like you go reverse.

305
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:39,658
Speaker 0: It's like, okay.

306
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,087
Speaker 0: He's coming down the hallway at your reverse is real slow.

307
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:46,830
Speaker 0: It's like, alright You can shoot but then cause explosions right near you because he's charging in.

308
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,430
Speaker 0: You can end up with like a lot of bad choices.

309
00:19:49,551 --> 00:20:01,749
Speaker 0: sometimes your only choice like this guy's run into that room as fast as you can and then just try to take them all out with a lot of movement to avoid getting hit and There's just too many gives more guys in that room than you thought and they're all coming at you now.

310
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:08,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, and some of them are really dangerous tiny and hard to hit and it's like god damn it Man this sounds really good.

311
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,830
Speaker 1: I feel like I really do need to play.

312
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,210
Speaker 0: There's four different kinds of ammo and it's like you have to combine weapons together to craft them into better weapons.

313
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:21,469
Speaker 0: And it's some kind sometimes like you'll have a whole bunch of one kind of ammo But you'll have a really shitty weapon that uses that ammo.

314
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:29,290
Speaker 0: it's like you can't get the ammo for the weapon you want to use and You just try to find a bad guy to kill or a treasure chest to open or just something so you can get some.

315
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:33,930
Speaker 0: You know energy or some ammo or some health, you know a lot of resource managing going on there.

316
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:38,090
Speaker 0: You know and there's like a lot of tricky things that you know.

317
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:46,218
Speaker 0: You upgrade your engine or do you use that thing to craft, you know at the end of a level you collected enough nanites Do you want to spend them to.

318
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,470
Speaker 0: you know, which upgrade do you want to choose?

319
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:56,470
Speaker 0: And it's like there are a lot of things to choose like you can make all your bullet based weapons better But it'll make all of the not bullets based weapons weaker.

320
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:57,976
Speaker 0: Do you want to do that?

321
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,005
Speaker 0: And it's like I have a really strong bullet based weapon.

322
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,523
Speaker 0: Yes, and the next level They're just like, you know what fuck you on bullets.

323
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,861
Speaker 0: No bullets for you No, no bullets this time.

324
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:08,170
Speaker 0: You just run into ammo for that gun.

325
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:08,936
Speaker 0: You're like fuck me.

326
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:10,730
Speaker 1: some people will complain about that kind of thing.

327
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,499
Speaker 1: But thought for me like a roguelike like I play.

328
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,410
Speaker 1: I still play crypt of the necro dancer like I like that game a lot Okay, and sometimes you just get completely fucked.

329
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,918
Speaker 1: That's kind of the point of a roguelike like.

330
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:30,490
Speaker 0: it might be bad news behind that door But this roguelike because it's descent is not just bad decision bad luck bad procedural business.

331
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,490
Speaker 0: This it's if you have skills.

332
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,750
Speaker 0: It really doesn't matter if you have super descent skills even better than me because I'm not the greatest.

333
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:45,296
Speaker 0: You could probably just dominate the whole game because by dodging and moving and shooting and you know Cuz like if you don't get hit well You don't have to worry about not getting health.

334
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,883
Speaker 0: and if you kill guys quickly then you know We can get with really accurate shots.

335
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:50,849
Speaker 0: You're not gonna run out of ammo.

336
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,510
Speaker 1: So yeah, well, I mean crypto the necro dancer if you just remember are good at patterns.

337
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,884
Speaker 1: Don't mess up like everything's easy and you'll just win.

338
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:00,888
Speaker 1: just move right?

339
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,989
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm pretty sure the descent games themselves are on GOG.

340
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,358
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend you play those.

341
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:10,534
Speaker 0: if you haven't and you don't and you can overcome the motion sickness I could play those again.

342
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,999
Speaker 1: Maybe we could do a show on dissent.

343
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:18,030
Speaker 0: I mean, okay dissent is exactly what I just said Not procedural not procedural.

344
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,609
Speaker 0: The the plot of dissent is actually really awesome.

345
00:22:22,831 --> 00:22:42,377
Speaker 0: it's sort of like this terrible secret of space situation where you're like this dude material defender and all the robots that work in all the space mines and asteroids and things have all gone crazy and You basically are sort of a bounty hunter who's been hired to like go and fix all the broken mines To restore the galactic economy.

346
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:45,305
Speaker 0: I don't know but it's like there's plenty of terrible secret of space going on.

347
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:45,907
Speaker 0: It's really weird.

348
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:56,604
Speaker 0: Yeah But because the descent levels are handcrafted there's secrets and things and the levels is really amazing Especially in descent - and the music anyway sub level zero.

349
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,129
Speaker 0: play that game on steam.

350
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:05,720
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day.

351
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:07,988
Speaker 1: This is just a fascinating little video that I saw.

352
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:17,547
Speaker 1: It's a rundown from a gun expert on five overly complicated guns and It's how did a gun be overly complicated?

353
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:24,327
Speaker 0: you put in bullet this revolver bolt action automatic Open bolt or closed bolt.

354
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:25,792
Speaker 0: I'm just saying none of the.

355
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,800
Speaker 0: none of these kinds are overly complicated.

356
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:28,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, what?

357
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:29,065
Speaker 1: what do you mean?

358
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:29,888
Speaker 1: one of these kinds?

359
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:33,020
Speaker 0: what constitutes an example of an overly complicated gun?

360
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:38,657
Speaker 1: These five guns in this video and if you watch tell me about one of them, they're over engineered like what.

361
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:49,706
Speaker 1: like some of them have see, I'm not an expert on guns to this degree, but like one of them has this complicated mechanism of loading the cartridges up into the gun.

362
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:56,124
Speaker 1: is this pistol, but as a result you actually load them backwards into the Clip Not the clip.

363
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,931
Speaker 1: you load them backwards into the magazine.

364
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,980
Speaker 0: Does it reverse them when you get to the top?

365
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:01,593
Speaker 1: I've I don't know.

366
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:02,120
Speaker 1: I didn't watch that.

367
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,891
Speaker 0: It's like a little ferris wheel or the bullet turns around.

368
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:06,258
Speaker 1: one of them just takes a base forward.

369
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:07,787
Speaker 1: This one just takes weird.

370
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:08,371
Speaker 1: or do you?

371
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:09,860
Speaker 0: or does it just shoot yourself when you shoot?

372
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:14,722
Speaker 1: Some of them just have like really complicated Stuff.

373
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,991
Speaker 1: that makes them cool and awesome guns like the guy.

374
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:21,200
Speaker 1: basically all these guns are awesome according to the guy Like really well designed really awesome.

375
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:32,660
Speaker 1: They're just way over complicated and a less complicated design that did a similar thing would be a lot more Reliable in the long run and there's a reason why I would actually be able to fix it.

376
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:37,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there's a reason why these guns were not widely used as Technology got better.

377
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:43,464
Speaker 0: if you can't take apart a gun if you can't practice taking apart a gun and putting it back together really fast It's not a practical gun.

378
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:47,840
Speaker 1: Well the or like they have a lot of interesting features that just aren't in other guns.

379
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,220
Speaker 1: He talks a little bit about like why they don't do that even though it's super nice to have it.

380
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:52,594
Speaker 1: Why do guns just don't have it?

381
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,550
Speaker 1: Those are really well shot like the lightest.

382
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,194
Speaker 1: It's a good video.

383
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:56,919
Speaker 0: All right.

384
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:01,051
Speaker 0: So this guy he made some kind of program.

385
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:14,780
Speaker 0: I can't fully understand how he did this technologically speaking But what he did is he took real music specifically that the number one example uses staying alive by the Bee Gees Right that song and he converted into a MIDI file.

386
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,989
Speaker 0: It's like well this MIDI files.

387
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,280
Speaker 0: of that you can make a MIDI file.

388
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,859
Speaker 1: I have some applications that did shit like that in the past, right?

389
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,045
Speaker 1: They were really bad at it.

390
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:27,541
Speaker 0: Sure, but he didn't make a MIDI file that just sort of like Results with like the score, you know The same.

391
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:32,322
Speaker 0: if you took the score of the song you bought a copy of it or printed a copy of it out and typed It into.

392
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:35,800
Speaker 0: you know, one of those songs you can just score music and then it plays it back with me.

393
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,390
Speaker 1: He'll cakewalk studio, right?

394
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:37,671
Speaker 0: It's like.

395
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:38,758
Speaker 0: that's not what this does.

396
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:52,940
Speaker 0: yeah, what it does is it uses various piano instruments, I think as many as a MIDI file can handle and by playing notes on the piano Actually plays the freaking song and you can even hear the vocals.

397
00:25:53,862 --> 00:26:05,203
Speaker 0: But it's like it's this weird psychological trick We're like if you listen to it just sounds like a mess, but if someone tells you Oh, by the way, this is staying alive by the Bee Gees and you know the song and you start listening to it It's like you.

398
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,638
Speaker 0: suddenly you hear the vocals and I go my god.

399
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,520
Speaker 0: Suddenly you hear the song and it's really just a ton of freaking piano.

400
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:24,674
Speaker 0: No, it's like if you had freaking Mario Paint but they let you use as many friggin swans as And you can stack up the swans and squeeze them as close together and it unless I'm just doing one MU for swans it's like sub pixel rendering.

401
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:25,920
Speaker 1: It's using your brain tricks.

402
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,920
Speaker 1: It's like rendering part of the song in your brain based on your memory, right?

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,460
Speaker 0: So he does a bunch of songs in this video, but you only need to hear the first one and it is freaking.

404
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:34,398
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

405
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,879
Speaker 0: And he really pushes MIDI to the limit and it's like why is MIDI even still a thing?

406
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 1: Cuz MIDI is useful because it's basically a command-and-control architecture for controlling remote instruments.

407
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:48,707
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was useful when we didn't have PCM enough memory to miss.

408
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:49,831
Speaker 0: do everything with PCM.

409
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:52,804
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not because of the PCM as much It's it's not.

410
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:55,400
Speaker 1: it's basically what you're saying is it's a mechanism.

411
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,924
Speaker 1: You can chain a bunch of real instruments together and send digital abstract signals that say play this kind of note But the instrument does it.

412
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:03,707
Speaker 1: while however, it knows.

413
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:08,709
Speaker 0: but whatever that instrument is is gonna be a synthesizer And you could have just plus.

414
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:13,848
Speaker 1: there's a lot of existing technology Like our mixer like firewires already way obsolete.

415
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:18,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't need our mixers firewire because that's you know, this mixer is perfectly good.

416
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,236
Speaker 0: It'll be good for 20 years to come tell you let's just make a company that makes audio equipment.

417
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:23,080
Speaker 0: It's only modern.

418
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:26,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of stuff supports MIDI though, right?

419
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,604
Speaker 0: We could start by.

420
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,448
Speaker 0: I mean we just start by selling it to like all you know Like those guys at concerts in the middle.

421
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,055
Speaker 1: I could do a show on MIDI.

422
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:33,240
Speaker 1: I could tell you guys how that works.

423
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,246
Speaker 0: Nobody cares about this dead technology.

424
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:39,560
Speaker 1: I used to have a lot of expenses used only for making quirky YouTube videos.

425
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used it to back before mp3s.

426
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:59,360
Speaker 1: I had a piano that had MIDI like a really nice digital piano and I would actually download MIDI files Mess with them to make piano like mixes of songs And then play them through the piano because that sounded better than the synthesizer in my sound blaster for playing a piano.

427
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,649
Speaker 0: So your keyboard had a better sound card than your.

428
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:03,999
Speaker 1: my keyboard had a really expensive sound card.

429
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,080
Speaker 0: effective Yeah, oh, but this is not the thing of the day.

430
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,722
Speaker 0: But we did a thing of the day a while back where there's a guy who told you how like the graphics and old computers Worked.

431
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,079
Speaker 0: he did a video more recently that tells you how the sound and old computers work.

432
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:17,520
Speaker 0: You should watch that because it's related to this discussion.

433
00:28:18,161 --> 00:28:21,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the moment the booklet book was and still is the wheel of time.

434
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:22,640
Speaker 1: We did book one.

435
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,293
Speaker 1: We did a whole show on it.

436
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:25,040
Speaker 1: You know, listen to it.

437
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,740
Speaker 0: I started book five a little bit, but then I'm reading comics now.

438
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:29,444
Speaker 1: So yeah I just also.

439
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:33,898
Speaker 1: I basically just finished book four for real so I could start book five any day.

440
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,364
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I haven't really yet.

441
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:35,827
Speaker 1: Hmm.

442
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:37,013
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll just pause there.

443
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,440
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do a mid mid show on it.

444
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:40,713
Speaker 1: As I said, we launched our patreon.

445
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:44,971
Speaker 1: So if you give us Any amount of money you'll get a bunch of content in there.

446
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:50,169
Speaker 1: if you give us five bucks Like I said, and it's super dumb.

447
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:53,320
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say your name at the end of every show after the credits.

448
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,689
Speaker 1: Dave and Joel do that actually with the t-shirts.

449
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:57,853
Speaker 1: anytime you buy a t-shirt from them.

450
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:58,716
Speaker 1: They say your name on the show.

451
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,493
Speaker 0: I Highly recommend you do not pay for such a stupid thing.

452
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:03,276
Speaker 0: This is nothing.

453
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:04,140
Speaker 0: I didn't plan this.

454
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,427
Speaker 1: I also promised that I'm gonna do.

455
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:08,072
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do ultra dumb stuff.

456
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:10,520
Speaker 0: Why didn't you clear this with me first during that part?

457
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:14,940
Speaker 1: So dumb stuff and names of people will happen after the credit.

458
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 1: So if you already gave us money, you can listen for that.

459
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,454
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say your name.

460
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:21,818
Speaker 0: if you give me ten bucks I will make fun of you.

461
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,337
Speaker 0: So guys we're being so dumb as to give me ten dollars a month when you probably need it more than I.

462
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,453
Speaker 1: there are several People backing us at ten dollars a month right now.

463
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:30,459
Speaker 0: What is wrong with you?

464
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,398
Speaker 0: But also unless you're really if you're really rich.

465
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 0: first of all If you're rich enough, you can spend ten dollars a month on geek nights.

466
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,303
Speaker 0: I mean that is half.

467
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,392
Speaker 0: that is almost the cost of Hulu.

468
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is 12 bucks a month Are you crazy?

469
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,960
Speaker 0: But we think about what Hulu gets you the greatest movies and some of the greatest TV shows to ever exist.

470
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,793
Speaker 0: So guys with no commercials, I'll skip me.

471
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,460
Speaker 0: just geek nights only ten bucks.

472
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:58,380
Speaker 0: You must either be fabulously wealthy or dumb and if you're fabulously wealthy Give me a lot more than ten bucks you cheap ass.

473
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,060
Speaker 1: So one Scott's really making the hard sale here.

474
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,519
Speaker 1: But more importantly we do have a one of our milestones at the top here.

475
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:08,700
Speaker 1: If you guys scrape together 20 grand a month, we'll do geek nights full-time and quit our jobs.

476
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,856
Speaker 1: So yeah, probably but I'll give it to it.

477
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:12,700
Speaker 1: that'll happen.

478
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:13,709
Speaker 0: If you're so rich.

479
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,799
Speaker 0: they have 20 grand a month.

480
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:16,427
Speaker 0: Just hire me.

481
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:21,609
Speaker 1: if we had 20,000 fans who gave us a dollar a month We could quit if we had 20,000 fans.

482
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:23,496
Speaker 0: We wouldn't need even them to have patreon.

483
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:24,540
Speaker 0: We could just sell things.

484
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:28,836
Speaker 1: Valuable things won't like our geek night's t-shirts that we're also selling now.

485
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:29,980
Speaker 0: It's not a valuable thing.

486
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,960
Speaker 0: I guess it's better than patreon.

487
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,620
Speaker 1: Let's look I did the thing on the back that we couldn't do before because we were cheap.

488
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:38,716
Speaker 0: But like we could just make you know a product and sell it to them.

489
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,780
Speaker 1: or maybe we'll make that forum.

490
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:50,180
Speaker 1: Anyway Yeah, that is enough talking about things that aren't subterfuge because this is a game that we kind of all decided to play in the.

491
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:54,312
Speaker 0: So there was a game and it's still around actually has a sequel.

492
00:30:54,332 --> 00:30:54,995
Speaker 0: we've never played.

493
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:56,580
Speaker 1: Oh Neptune's pride Neptune's pride.

494
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,326
Speaker 0: We might have done an episode on this game.

495
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,193
Speaker 1: I did not play it.

496
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:01,337
Speaker 1: I just didn't play it.

497
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:02,865
Speaker 1: No, I didn't get into it I was busy.

498
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,272
Speaker 1: Oh, so Neptune's pride know about it I just didn't play.

499
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:12,524
Speaker 0: it was a game We played online and it had an interesting business model or you'd like almost pay for play like one person would pay and everyone Would get to play.

500
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:15,600
Speaker 0: it's like if I put a quarter in the arcade machine and everyone gets to play gauntlet.

501
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:28,185
Speaker 0: all right, but the idea of Neptune's pride was that you're in space and You spawn yet some planets and you could order ships to fly from planet to planet in groups of however many number and it wasn't Complicated like Master of Orion.

502
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,972
Speaker 0: customizing ships is just how many ships.

503
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:38,794
Speaker 0: so you would say like oh I'll send a hundred ships from here to there and Obviously if there was uninhabited you would take it over and it would start producing ships.

504
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:44,038
Speaker 0: and if there was inhabited by you It just like okay you docked at your base and it was inhabited by someone else.

505
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:48,280
Speaker 0: you fought And never had more ships won and then the remaining ships would still be there.

506
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,458
Speaker 1: But anyway, so think of these is like RTS is but distilled to their fundamental elements.

507
00:31:53,559 --> 00:32:00,826
Speaker 0: right now The thing is with Neptune's pride is that the ships moved not in real time But also in real time.

508
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,032
Speaker 0: not in real time as in.

509
00:32:02,193 --> 00:32:03,760
Speaker 0: this is how fast ships move in space.

510
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:09,600
Speaker 0: But as in it would say on the screen It will take three hours and 40 minutes for those ships to get there.

511
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,980
Speaker 1: No one thought you were saying they move in real real time in space like real spaceships.

512
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,140
Speaker 0: But in three hours and 40 minutes, that's when those ships will get there.

513
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,342
Speaker 0: so you're basically checking this game 24/7 or every once in a while to make sure Nobody like.

514
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:33,380
Speaker 0: because if somebody springs an attack on you and it takes five hours for those ships to get there and you didn't check The game in those five hours, you just got blowed up without realizing it.

515
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,760
Speaker 0: So you have to check at least so, you know You have to say okay if anyone attacks me the soonest they can hit any of my planets is an hour.

516
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,659
Speaker 0: So I have to check hourly to make sure there's no sneak attack.

517
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:51,170
Speaker 1: But anyways, so this subterfuge game that we got into very similar even more distilled But it fixes all the problems of Neptune's pride.

518
00:32:51,290 --> 00:33:04,317
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell it is described as a week-long Game of strategy and diplomacy because the time frames are like if I want to move guys From one of my bases to another outpost the time might be like 40 hours.

519
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:05,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a lot longer.

520
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,733
Speaker 0: So so here's what subterfuge differs from Neptune's pride and how it fixes it.

521
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:14,660
Speaker 0: number one and Neptune's pride It was in space so you might be positioned at the start of the game like on the edge.

522
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:16,810
Speaker 0: So you're only facing like one person.

523
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:23,450
Speaker 0: it's like the left of you if you're on the right side Maybe someone below you and or above you But someone's in the middle and it's someone else's off.

524
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:23,611
Speaker 0: like.

525
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:25,740
Speaker 0: it's like the positions are very bad subterfuge.

526
00:33:26,282 --> 00:33:28,891
Speaker 0: It's a planet made of water and you all live in submarines.

527
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:31,300
Speaker 0: it instead of outer space, but it's the same goddamn thing.

528
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,249
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter but everyone is surrounded.

529
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,595
Speaker 0: the planet is dark.

530
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:35,800
Speaker 0: The planet is round.

531
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,569
Speaker 0: You can wrap around like pac-man in every direction.

532
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,060
Speaker 0: So everyone is equally surrounded on all sides by everybody.

533
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:44,840
Speaker 0: There's no bad positions really, right?

534
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,400
Speaker 0: The other thing they fix is that it's not just a numbers game, right?

535
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,153
Speaker 0: A lot of times Neptune's pride was like, well, I have more guys than you.

536
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:52,776
Speaker 0: deal with it.

537
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:53,420
Speaker 0: You're gonna lose.

538
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:03,819
Speaker 0: You know here that every once in a while everyone no matter what gets a specialist and if you get us yeah, you can choose from among three and you know, which three are coming up next to choose from.

539
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:06,410
Speaker 0: and Specialists are really powerful.

540
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:11,335
Speaker 0: like there's some specialists They're just like worth 20 ships in a battle, but they keep fight.

541
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,223
Speaker 0: as long as they don't die They keep giving up.

542
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:13,824
Speaker 1: They're all.

543
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:14,568
Speaker 1: you're powerful.

544
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:15,511
Speaker 1: They're really power.

545
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:18,080
Speaker 1: This ship just moves twice as fast three times as fast.

546
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,600
Speaker 0: What one that extends my sonar range?

547
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,592
Speaker 0: It's like I can really don't have any fog of war really anymore that anywhere.

548
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:29,518
Speaker 0: that matters for me because I can see so much Further than everyone else who doesn't have that specialist already.

549
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,563
Speaker 1: But the biggest change in that regard to make it not a numbers game is that it's if I just say what this game is Most like.

550
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:37,576
Speaker 1: it's most like the board game.

551
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:42,634
Speaker 0: diplomacy Yes is most like diploma fixes diplomacy too because really this is a vote.

552
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,199
Speaker 0: who wins game in the end, right?

553
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,487
Speaker 0: Neptune's pride had some flaws in the vote.

554
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:46,909
Speaker 0: who wins?

555
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:50,665
Speaker 0: because your votes were limited by your you know Numbers or your position.

556
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:52,995
Speaker 0: now you can pretty much vote for almost.

557
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:54,199
Speaker 0: I can't vote for the one person.

558
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,286
Speaker 0: I can't get near the person.

559
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 0: I want to vote against so you need to vote against that person.

560
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:00,491
Speaker 0: Anyway, I want to vote against them so badly, but I can't do.

561
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,334
Speaker 0: they're so far away.

562
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:02,378
Speaker 0: I can't do anything about it.

563
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:10,139
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll give you a base near that person and you can send your fleet there and then Reconnoise and leave my bases open for you to take back that I took from you.

564
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,025
Speaker 1: I need that.

565
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:12,616
Speaker 1: I need that factory back real bad.

566
00:35:12,636 --> 00:35:22,938
Speaker 1: No So the game has a very clever chat thing where you can start a chat with between you and any combination of other players.

567
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,346
Speaker 1: so I started.

568
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:30,853
Speaker 1: at one point someone started a chat with Everyone except one player and that was the war room of.

569
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:32,700
Speaker 1: how do we get this player out of the fucking game?

570
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,749
Speaker 1: I have a chat with just one person.

571
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,954
Speaker 0: I have a lot of chats.

572
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:42,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone's chatting me up But like I have a chat of one Alliance I have a chat with another Alliance and they're not the same people.

573
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:50,265
Speaker 1: I have two chats one with four people and one with three people because that fourth person's danger is luckily They're about to be eliminated.

574
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:50,888
Speaker 1: I think so.

575
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:52,535
Speaker 1: I have to worry about them as much anymore.

576
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:53,540
Speaker 0: I have a lot of chats.

577
00:35:54,282 --> 00:36:02,349
Speaker 1: so the game comes down to not checking every few hours and doing stuff so much but Making deals and just doing the diplomacy game.

578
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,129
Speaker 0: right you want to attack someone you're basically gonna have to leave something Undefended to someone else because you're surrounded.

579
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:08,932
Speaker 0: everyone's surrounded.

580
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:14,200
Speaker 0: So if I attack rim on the right I'm leaving myself open from the north because it's my northeast place.

581
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,627
Speaker 0: I'm evacuating to say because if you have a guy in a in a in an outpost They're defending that place.

582
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:29,480
Speaker 0: if they leave to attack that place is now less Defended and it can be if you move your Queen which provides many shields and super defends one outpost.

583
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,120
Speaker 0: What if it gets hit mid movement?

584
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Speaker 0: It's not providing shields when it's in between outposts if you just get blowed up.

585
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,839
Speaker 0: So yeah, you can only move it when you're sure nobody's gonna take advantage of that.

586
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:42,859
Speaker 0: But the final times you have to trust people and though yeah, and you know what?

587
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:55,747
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I have a list now of the people I can trust because I've been trustworthy for real and the people that I will never Trust in this game again ever Never trust me again because I blew your shit up.

588
00:36:56,048 --> 00:37:01,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't specifically say you wouldn't so I guess that but anyway.

589
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:07,500
Speaker 0: But the other reason I mean, I basically just saw that you left this place completely because I was helping row out.

590
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,830
Speaker 0: I mean, I saw a completely undefended place.

591
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,280
Speaker 0: I had a super strong position in that area and I needed a factory.

592
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,570
Speaker 0: So I'm like, it's rim.

593
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,739
Speaker 0: I don't want rim to win.

594
00:37:17,283 --> 00:37:21,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I'm not winning actually because so I mean that's good But I mean it's like the game we played.

595
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:26,272
Speaker 1: with the exception of like one or two people Everyone in the game messaged me.

596
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:27,460
Speaker 0: It's a vote who wins game.

597
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:30,491
Speaker 0: I have the ability to cast a vote against someone.

598
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:32,498
Speaker 0: I have to cast at least one vote against rim.

599
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:33,669
Speaker 1: Yes So how could I?

600
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,540
Speaker 0: why would he vote for rim?

601
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:43,837
Speaker 1: I get all these messages from all the other players one by one over the first few hours or setting up the game saying Yeah, Scott formed a chat of everyone but you it is trying to get everyone to gang up on you.

602
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,271
Speaker 0: Lol No, I basically all I said in that chat was look guys.

603
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:47,753
Speaker 0: Remember?

604
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:53,613
Speaker 0: This is the vote who wins game And I just I don't care if I lose just don't vote for it.

605
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:54,556
Speaker 1: It was interesting.

606
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:55,540
Speaker 0: That's what I said.

607
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,384
Speaker 0: It was interesting.

608
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,012
Speaker 1: who told me about that chat?

609
00:37:58,474 --> 00:38:02,160
Speaker 0: when they told me about it I should have just included you in the chat because I told you about the job.

610
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:05,528
Speaker 1: But other people told me about the chat on their own.

611
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,499
Speaker 1: one two people sent me screenshots of it in case I didn't believe them.

612
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:19,654
Speaker 1: And I just want to point out there was one person who specifically did not tell me about the chat attacked me immediately And yeah, someone fell for the vote against rim.

613
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,240
Speaker 1: Yeah So great, that's interesting.

614
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:29,119
Speaker 1: But the other game design thing it does to make the diplomacy stuff happen and make it fun is the way you win.

615
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,905
Speaker 1: is there's A resource you can mine?

616
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:31,547
Speaker 1: you have to.

617
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,614
Speaker 0: oh, that's the other thing it does.

618
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:35,300
Speaker 0: That's much fixes Neptune's pride.

619
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:40,940
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, so basically you can mine the stuff neptunium and if you hit 200 you just win game over.

620
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,808
Speaker 0: I like to call this the Gandhi strategy.

621
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:44,214
Speaker 1: the first person to get 200 just wins.

622
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:47,940
Speaker 0: So you don't have to go conquering everyone.

623
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,914
Speaker 0: you can just hold up and defend yourself and spend all of your extra subs making mines.

624
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:56,104
Speaker 0: and if you can defend those mines and No one can take them from you.

625
00:38:56,485 --> 00:39:00,679
Speaker 0: You can get enough points to just win the game just by defending.

626
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:07,447
Speaker 0: now If you might think it's in order to build a mine you just sacrifice Lots and lots of submarines every time you build a mine.

627
00:39:07,668 --> 00:39:16,040
Speaker 0: that place you just built a mine is now super undefended because you know There's way more - there's way more to it than that on a sub from a design standpoint.

628
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:21,498
Speaker 1: So if you attack someone else's mine and take it from them you get that mine.

629
00:39:21,598 --> 00:39:23,631
Speaker 1: you get the mine You don't get any neptunium.

630
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:29,531
Speaker 0: You just get the mine Hundred stuff from a mine and rim takes that mine.

631
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,900
Speaker 0: He starts mining stuff, but I still have my hundred.

632
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:37,455
Speaker 1: No, so if you lose a mine you lose 20 neptunium only 20.

633
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's basically it'll.

634
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,973
Speaker 0: So if you mine less than 20 you lose it all.

635
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:44,460
Speaker 0: but if you mine 50 you keep 30.

636
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:53,732
Speaker 1: But the point of all this is that you if you take out someone's mine Literally remove victory points from them without gaining them directly yourself.

637
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,699
Speaker 0: So it's not a zero-sum game.

638
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:55,759
Speaker 0: it

639
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:17,654
Speaker 1: facilitates deals and diplomacy and planning to take down the leader and that also fosters opportunities for backstabbing and shady dealings because Anyone who is beating another player in terms of actual or all neptunian mind By 20 or more can choose to check a box and start funding that player.

640
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,560
Speaker 0: now, you'd be like, oh who's gonna do that?

641
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,918
Speaker 1: So thus Everyone gangs up on say Scott because Scott's got the most neptunium and he's winning and we got.

642
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:28,260
Speaker 0: have you know?

643
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,088
Speaker 0: I have no neptunium by the way, so they don't.

644
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,500
Speaker 1: you might don't do fund to other players.

645
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,980
Speaker 0: I actually sort of want to lose the game.

646
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,620
Speaker 0: That's like a tiny part that wants me to just lose the game so I can stop checking my stupid goddamn phone.

647
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:43,360
Speaker 1: Well, I can't check it that much now knowing I got to go into full defense mode because you've motherfuckers all fucked me.

648
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,352
Speaker 0: But it's like it's so annoying to check the game.

649
00:40:46,453 --> 00:40:47,880
Speaker 0: It's like I almost just want to lose and quit.

650
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,900
Speaker 1: We're just the way the game is designed the the not to get into all the details.

651
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:55,340
Speaker 1: You can just watch the tutorial videos and see how the game fully works with shields and everything.

652
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:04,009
Speaker 1: But it is cleverly designed to make all the things that you expect to happen if you play diplomacy happen Without all the not funness of diplomacy.

653
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:09,411
Speaker 0: You don't have to have the stupid rules order resolution in diplomacy And you don't have to have the stupid now.

654
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:13,580
Speaker 0: We're gonna deploy diplomacy now We're gonna take actually play the game diplomacy not that alternating.

655
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,133
Speaker 0: It's like because it's slow and real time.

656
00:41:16,214 --> 00:41:17,420
Speaker 0: things take hours to happen.

657
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:20,820
Speaker 0: You can just constantly diplomacy and move and shake without stopping.

658
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:25,322
Speaker 1: So the other thing to note is the specialists like the people in the game It is.

659
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:32,000
Speaker 1: I'm pleased that it is a widely varied in terms of gender age and skin color cast.

660
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,151
Speaker 0: I haven't paid attention to that at all.

661
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:35,960
Speaker 1: It stood out because it's so rare.

662
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:43,305
Speaker 0: Okay, that's that's the point I mean I guess when you live under the sea then a submarine Everyone's got to get along and to.

663
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:47,700
Speaker 1: the game is technically free to play but oh, that's the one bullshit.

664
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,462
Speaker 1: No, it's not though.

665
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:49,786
Speaker 1: Cuz really the game cost 10 bucks.

666
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:54,720
Speaker 1: Sure, and I enjoy it enough to where like I'm glad I paid.

667
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,220
Speaker 0: But so what do you get for 10 bucks?

668
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,064
Speaker 1: So you can just.

669
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:59,940
Speaker 1: you can join any public game and you can join any private game.

670
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,132
Speaker 1: But if you pay 10 bucks once then forever you can start Private games that you invite only your friends to.

671
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:07,834
Speaker 1: okay.

672
00:42:08,176 --> 00:42:15,504
Speaker 1: and two you can issue unlimited numbers of orders in the future because the game has this really Beautiful UX

673
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:26,480
Speaker 0: where Neptune's pride did not have this as effectively but basically the UX and all of the the System of giving orders giving orders in the future rolling time forward and back to see what's going to happen.

674
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I can roll.

675
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,948
Speaker 0: according to your current information I can issue orders.

676
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:37,640
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna issue a contradictory order It warns me like up that's and you can always cancel things before the last second.

677
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,179
Speaker 1: Yep.

678
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:48,117
Speaker 1: So y'all like send all my ships over the horizon and then I find out once I get closer and get more Intel That the shields on Scott's battle station are fully operate.

679
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:49,923
Speaker 0: That's the other way I'm making this game more fun.

680
00:42:49,963 --> 00:42:52,530
Speaker 0: is I'm basically doing Emperor Palpatine role-playing.

681
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:56,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so far I've had both situations.

682
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,072
Speaker 0: I've had my fleet on the far side of the Centauri moon.

683
00:42:59,153 --> 00:42:59,655
Speaker 0: that happened.

684
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:00,819
Speaker 1: that rim didn't know about.

685
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:01,884
Speaker 1: no I didn't know about that.

686
00:43:01,904 --> 00:43:03,109
Speaker 1: I know about that.

687
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,455
Speaker 0: And then I had he.

688
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:12,500
Speaker 0: you know, he attacked He counter-attacked after I took his factory and I'm like, oh by the way, the shields will be fully operational when you arrive.

689
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:19,760
Speaker 0: You can't recall Sure enough 20 minutes before he lands the Emperor lands just where he was going and the shields go.

690
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:21,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was bad news.

691
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:27,328
Speaker 0: I could have even chosen a specialist to get the shields even bigger But I realized I would win even without it.

692
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:29,477
Speaker 0: So I chose the long-term specialist instead.

693
00:43:29,497 --> 00:43:34,060
Speaker 1: Yep But that UX is so well done.

694
00:43:34,141 --> 00:43:44,720
Speaker 1: So like little stuff like I can pick another Outpost like an enemy outpost and just drag forward from it and in real time as I drag my finger It's showing me what the game state will be at every point.

695
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,509
Speaker 0: You can even measure with a ruler how how long like I can go to rims factory and drag a line over to my factory And it'll say aha it will take rim.

696
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:59,283
Speaker 0: if he gives the order now this instant It will take him 14 hours to reach me State.

697
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:00,266
Speaker 1: I can attack.

698
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:05,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I can measure with my own thing and be like well if I attack that now Leaving this spot open.

699
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:10,498
Speaker 0: I can then move these guys into position to defend my open spot before 14 hours.

700
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:12,003
Speaker 0: So rim can't.

701
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,850
Speaker 0: if he tries to attack when I leave it open.

702
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,760
Speaker 0: He will run into a fully operational shield.

703
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,939
Speaker 0: He didn't know it's gonna be there.

704
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:21,008
Speaker 1: So it's a free-to-play game.

705
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,795
Speaker 1: it's just on smartphones, that's the other thing.

706
00:44:22,815 --> 00:44:23,840
Speaker 1: you can just play it all the time.

707
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,247
Speaker 0: And rim has an Android phone.

708
00:44:25,308 --> 00:44:25,850
Speaker 0: I have an iPhone.

709
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,876
Speaker 0: We're all playing together.

710
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:27,520
Speaker 0: It totally works.

711
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,387
Speaker 0: We don't even know what other people are using.

712
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:29,848
Speaker 0: It's great.

713
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,120
Speaker 1: So oh and the other thing is only Neptune's pride.

714
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:35,400
Speaker 0: We had to check like on our PCs all the time here.

715
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,706
Speaker 0: Everyone's checking all the time.

716
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:39,740
Speaker 1: if you pay you can join multiple games at the same time, which I would never do.

717
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,822
Speaker 0: I don't want to do that.

718
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:42,827
Speaker 0: No unless you have literally no life.

719
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:48,949
Speaker 1: I Fun like.

720
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:50,039
Speaker 1: I'm actually kind of into this.

721
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:51,206
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play.

722
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,580
Speaker 0: everyone else's seems like they're way more into it than I am.

723
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,947
Speaker 0: I'm just sort of like playing my game.

724
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,400
Speaker 0: So I will commit to running to be the Emperor.

725
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,113
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pretty much continuously.

726
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:05,060
Speaker 1: each time a game ends I'll start a forum game and I'll invite you guys and we'll just keep playing this.

727
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,827
Speaker 1: I'll play table future.

728
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:09,119
Speaker 0: I'll play it during times of the year when I have time for it.

729
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, once once summer comes again We're not gonna play this much but the game is fun and you can play it for free.

730
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,213
Speaker 0: So I do recommend you check it out and it sends you notifications which it's happening.

731
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:21,664
Speaker 1: so you could actually if you just ominous I'm laying there I was about to go to bed.

732
00:45:21,724 --> 00:45:26,020
Speaker 0: if you basically only look at it when you get a notification you will do very well.

733
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,309
Speaker 1: But suddenly my phone buzzes a whole bunch of like what the fuck.

734
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:40,451
Speaker 1: so I go look and it's all these notifications of 40 Drillers appeared on your horizon aimed at I'm like, oh no Yeah, but sometimes the notification like I got one today.

735
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,613
Speaker 0: that's like you can see.

736
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:46,547
Speaker 0: someone has 30 drillers and a specialist that you just never saw before.

737
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:51,646
Speaker 0: you can see now and I open it up and it's like it's so far away going To their own planet.

738
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:54,940
Speaker 0: It's like, alright, but I didn't need a notification for that.

739
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,660
Speaker 1: I take that information and give it to certain people who then act on it and things like in someone's internal territory.

740
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:02,002
Speaker 0: Were you?

741
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:05,800
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, cuz I saw a martyr hanging out somewhere.

742
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:07,006
Speaker 1: That's some scary shit.

743
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,460
Speaker 1: cuz martyrs can destroy entire outposts permanently.

744
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,486
Speaker 0: Yeah How does that work?

745
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:16,045
Speaker 1: if they're in a combat everything within a radius is destroyed No matter what it is.

746
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,340
Speaker 0: see the martyr coming and just abandon the outpost.

747
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:18,804
Speaker 1: So what?

748
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:19,812
Speaker 1: if so, here's the thing.

749
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:20,780
Speaker 1: say I had sent a ping.

750
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:32,855
Speaker 1: I got one shit one sub going toward a place and that place had sent a martyr at me earlier unbeknownst Wherever they collide whatever is nearby which might be an unrelated outpost.

751
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:34,883
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah.

752
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,808
Speaker 0: So wherever the martyr gets killed explodes.

753
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:42,258
Speaker 1: as soon as I found out there was a martyr and someone warned me.

754
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:42,760
Speaker 1: it was there.

755
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:57,160
Speaker 1: I sent a single submarine with one driller From every one of my places that had guys to every one of that players places just to make sure there's no way it could Come after me and if it blows up somewhere because of that that's gonna be so fucking hilarious.

756
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,285
Speaker 1: The game is super fun.

757
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:02,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should have sent those one sub pings at the game start.

758
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,945
Speaker 1: Yeah Now I know a lot more.

759
00:47:04,965 --> 00:47:11,120
