1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,747
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, March 23rd, 2016.

2
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:09,968
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:13,760
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,585
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:19,880
Speaker 0: Tonight, we fully review Gravity Falls now that it's fully done.

6
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,979
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:43,000
Speaker 0: So one of the reasons way back when Emily and I moved into the building where the Geek Nights studio is and everything, we picked it because it had a good view, and a nice roof, and the apartment was nice, and it had bike parking in the building, which in New York City is a really, really important thing.

8
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 1: I have bike parking in my building.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,740
Speaker 0: Well, you put it out on your balcony.

10
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:46,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,483
Speaker 0: Eh.

12
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:47,780
Speaker 1: What do you mean eh?

13
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,000
Speaker 0: Eh, it's moisture and it's outside and I gotta carry it up the elevator every day.

14
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:53,649
Speaker 1: You don't carry it in an elevator.

15
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:54,614
Speaker 1: The elevator does the carrying.

16
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:55,520
Speaker 1: That's what an elevator is.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,080
Speaker 1: Also, if it's rainy or wet, I just bring it inside.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's a pain.

19
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,100
Speaker 0: I like to reduce clutter.

20
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,019
Speaker 1: Oh, such a pain.

21
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:26,640
Speaker 0: It's more of a pain than just having a bike parking room, but we were some of the first people to move into this building, and as time went on, the bike room got more and more crowded to the point that it is filled with bikes, like all tangled with each other, and as far as I can tell, there's only like four people in the building who actually fucking ride their bikes, and the rest of them just sit there unmoving forever, in the way, being a pain, and there's some racks you can hang the bikes from on hooks.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:27,338
Speaker 1: No one does it.

23
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:39,640
Speaker 0: No, they're all full with people who staked out a spot by writing their apartment number in Sharpie on the thing, and if anyone else puts their bike up there, they take it down with a passive-aggressive angry note.

24
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:45,660
Speaker 0: Even though the people who hang their bikes on that thing, I don't think have ever ridden them.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,066
Speaker 1: But this is another good reason.

26
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:50,020
Speaker 1: Just keep it in your apartment, because then you have to deal with the shared space drama.

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:00,600
Speaker 0: See, I didn't have to, because so few people rode their bikes that I basically just put my bike and Emily's bike right in the front of the room, in the middle of the room, blocking everything, because it didn't get in anyone's way.

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,699
Speaker 0: The other few people who rode their bikes also just put them in the front, and basically everyone else was completely screwed if they wanted to ride their bikes, which I don't think they've ever tried to do.

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,879
Speaker 1: If they didn't try to ride their bikes, wouldn't you steal their bikes or destroy them?

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,300
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I could steal most of the bikes in there, and no one would have noticed.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,659
Speaker 0: I probably could have made a lot of money selling all those bikes.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,759
Speaker 1: Just sell all the bikes that you don't see get used ever.

33
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,898
Speaker 1: So anyway, my building- And they'll be like, "Why did these bikes not get

34
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,039
Speaker 1: stolen?".

35
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,980
Speaker 0: I imagine someone complained, because now we have real bike parking.

36
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,840
Speaker 0: They took a giant room in the basement.

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,280
Speaker 1: That used to be an illegal apartment.

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,687
Speaker 0: It used to be an illegal apartment.

39
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:36,439
Speaker 0: Those people got kicked out, and now it is a giant- There's still an illegal apartment on the roof.

40
00:02:37,603 --> 00:02:38,048
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

41
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,020
Speaker 0: I haven't been up there to check.

42
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,660
Speaker 0: It has a big- I mean, it was an illegal apartment.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,120
Speaker 1: Okay, it has a sign on the front that says, like, "Storage Room" or something, but you can clearly see that there's an air conditioner.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,639
Speaker 1: Why would you have an air conditioner storage room?

45
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:54,060
Speaker 1: And why would there be a kitchen sink behind the air conditioner in a storage room?

46
00:02:54,641 --> 00:03:00,560
Speaker 0: So, I am saying I have not peeked in that window to confirm if it is still an illegal apartment in the last few months.

47
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,201
Speaker 1: Sure.

48
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,980
Speaker 1: I'm willing to bet it's still an illegal apartment.

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,700
Speaker 0: And actually, they do usually, in buildings like this, put air conditioners and heating in the weird storage rooms that are outside of the normal space of the building.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that was a utility sink.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,271
Speaker 1: With Dawn soap?

52
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:15,040
Speaker 1: With dishes?

53
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,439
Speaker 0: But no, yeah, someone was definitely living in there.

54
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:23,040
Speaker 0: But since I last confirmed that someone's probably living in there, I have not gone back to reconfirm.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,405
Speaker 0: So, it's possible.

56
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 0: in the last few months it is no longer an illegal apartment.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,644
Speaker 1: It's possible.

58
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,672
Speaker 1: I'm not betting on it.

59
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:29,640
Speaker 1: It's an illegal apartment.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,220
Speaker 1: I think it's actually two illegal apartments, one on top of the other.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,919
Speaker 0: Well, the runner on the back, I wish I could move into that thing.

62
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,980
Speaker 0: That weird, like, top house.

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,800
Speaker 1: Go to the illegal apartment in a different building.

64
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,537
Speaker 0: I just go knock on the door and be like, "Hey, what are you paying in

65
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:40,759
Speaker 0: rent?".

66
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:46,079
Speaker 0: "I'll sublet it from you for 100 bucks more a month and just get extra rooms in our apartment up

67
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,240
Speaker 0: there.".

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Speaker 1: But they're not going to be able to find a cheaper place than an illegal apartment.

69
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,220
Speaker 0: I'm sure that the - I mean, how do you even go about getting the illegal apartment?

70
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,219
Speaker 1: You find some commercial space and live in it.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's not what they did here.

72
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,200
Speaker 0: This is just a residential luxury building.

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,960
Speaker 1: They knew somebody.

74
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,400
Speaker 0: How do you - yeah, so I gotta know somebody.

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,530
Speaker 0: I'll just ask the landlord - no, I'll ask the handyman, the super.

76
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,558
Speaker 0: I'll be like, "Yo, you got any illegal rooms I can rent for, like, a

77
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:07,839
Speaker 0: friend?".

78
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,379
Speaker 0: Just straight up.

79
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,460
Speaker 0: So anyway, we got a new room in the basement and they put - you know those nice, like, wall mounts?

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,839
Speaker 0: You put your bike up, there's, like, a lock built into it.

81
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,519
Speaker 0: They put a bunch of them down there.

82
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,119
Speaker 1: I wonder where the money for that came from.

83
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:21,286
Speaker 0: I guess people complained.

84
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaker 0: Like, a while ago, there was no hot water in the morning if you got up after, like, 8 o'clock for a couple weeks.

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,028
Speaker 0: Really?

86
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,916
Speaker 1: And then, I guess - Whoa, I've never seen a large building run out of hot water.

87
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:33,540
Speaker 0: I guess people bitched because - Even hotels don't run out.

88
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,935
Speaker 1: Because I've been in hotels that ran out.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,654
Speaker 1: In the United States.

90
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,799
Speaker 0: I've been in hotels in the United States that were not quality inns where it ran out.

91
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:39,480
Speaker 1: What?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,087
Speaker 1: Yeah.

93
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,520
Speaker 1: Like a Marriott or something?

94
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,339
Speaker 0: Uh, the Zenkai Khan Hotel last year.

95
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,299
Speaker 1: The Marriott one or the Jank one that we were in?

96
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,438
Speaker 0: I think the Jank one.

97
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,339
Speaker 1: The Jank one is, you know, it wasn't the one that the Khan is in.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:05:00,718
Speaker 0: But anyway, so they have this new thing down there, and I see they put a sign in both elevators and in the stairways that said, "Hey, move your bikes to the new bike

99
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:00,919
Speaker 0: room.".

100
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:01,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw that sign.

101
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,636
Speaker 0: So I saw that sign, and I thought, "Oh,

102
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:03,979
Speaker 0: fuck.".

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,100
Speaker 0: So immediately, I went down there with our bikes.

104
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,299
Speaker 0: And of course, no one had put their bikes down there yet.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,900
Speaker 0: So I took two of those nice bike parking spaces, and I wrote our apartment number on them.

106
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,159
Speaker 0: in a way it cannot be removed.

107
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,419
Speaker 0: And I locked our bikes to them, and they're ours.

108
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,940
Speaker 0: Because if other people are going to play that game, I'm going to play that game.

109
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,219
Speaker 1: See, I just avoid the games.

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,060
Speaker 0: Tragedy of the commons, I will always win.

111
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,140
Speaker 1: I just avoid the games entirely.

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,180
Speaker 0: But no, it's convenient.

113
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,620
Speaker 0: It's a nice room, and it's giant.

114
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,499
Speaker 0: Like, bigger than our living room.

115
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,120
Speaker 0: So there's plenty of space for bikes down there.

116
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,658
Speaker 1: Which is living it then.

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to be an illegal apartment.

118
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, with weird steps.

119
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:45,564
Speaker 0: It actually has a stepped area with carpet, a lot like the thing in that lounge we used to play D&D in in Peterson 3.

120
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 1: So the bikes and buildings lie, I found something out.

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,340
Speaker 0: The fact that it's actually completely toothless?

122
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,620
Speaker 1: No, it's way more, for real, toothy than I ever imagined.

123
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:54,280
Speaker 0: Really?

124
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,540
Speaker 0: Because I know of some loopholes that are guaranteed.

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,680
Speaker 1: No, so apparently, here's a true story.

126
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,640
Speaker 1: You ready for this true story?

127
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,037
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaker 1: Somebody was working in a midtown, large office building.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,080
Speaker 0: Wow, you're starting like a horror story.

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Speaker 0: Someone was working in a large midtown office building.

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,654
Speaker 1: Okay, they tried to do some bike action, and the building was like, "Mm-mm, we're gonna be jerks and not make this

132
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:18,018
Speaker 1: happen.".

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 1: Right?

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,899
Speaker 1: So they were parking their bikes outside and tying them up.

135
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,979
Speaker 1: And one of them got stole.

136
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:28,980
Speaker 1: They went to the small claims court against the building.

137
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,459
Speaker 0: That's the way to do it.

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,499
Speaker 1: And they won, like, boop, you win.

139
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,859
Speaker 1: Here's enough money for your bike.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,060
Speaker 0: Now that's not, the law doesn't help with that, because the loophole, how they get out of the law, is actually real easy.

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,777
Speaker 0: The building has to say, "Yes, we recognize your

142
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,140
Speaker 0: request.".

143
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,355
Speaker 0: And then they say, "You have to use the service

144
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:44,798
Speaker 0: elevator.".

145
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:51,560
Speaker 0: And then they make the service elevator hours be slightly after when everyone has to get to work, and slightly before everyone has to leave work.

146
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,420
Speaker 1: Apparently, you can avoid that bullshit also.

147
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,182
Speaker 0: Oh?

148
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:03,360
Speaker 0: 'Cause I actually called the city way back with my old company asking about that, and the clerk lady I talked to said, "Yeah, that's how everyone gets around the law.

149
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,057
Speaker 0: There's really no way to fix it unless you sue

150
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:05,198
Speaker 0: 'em.".

151
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,740
Speaker 1: Well, apparently, the thing is, I think if you sue 'em, you can win on that.

152
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,060
Speaker 0: I think they're not- No, I would sue.

153
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:11,917
Speaker 0: Don't you?

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,270
Speaker 1: Right?

155
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we'll see what happens at my current building.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,860
Speaker 1: Me and Jose, we're gonna push.

157
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,100
Speaker 1: He's tying his bike up outside every day.

158
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:22,119
Speaker 1: I'm not doing that.

159
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:27,560
Speaker 0: I would, but I'd get my boss to give me in writing that if my bike gets stolen, they'll buy me a brand new bike of equivalent quality.

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,407
Speaker 1: No, my bikes ... My, I guess, I don't know, two bosses up was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna work on this like a

161
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:34,874
Speaker 1: project.".

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,820
Speaker 1: So, I emailed him the story that I saw, and all the infos, 'cause apparently it's much stronger than I suspected.

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,128
Speaker 1: No.

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,140
Speaker 1: Apparently, not only can tenants ask for it, but also subtenants.

165
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,939
Speaker 1: Subtenant doesn't mean employee of a company.

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,957
Speaker 1: Subtenant means one person's renting out the whole floor, and you're renting a piece from them.

167
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,320
Speaker 1: That's a subtenant.

168
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,579
Speaker 1: If you're a subtenant, you can do it.

169
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,360
Speaker 0: See, I'd go further.

170
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,864
Speaker 0: I say the law should stipulate that buildings that have elevators have to let you use bikes in them.

171
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,040
Speaker 0: full stop, no exceptions.

172
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,516
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

173
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:05,539
Speaker 1: I agree.

174
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,299
Speaker 1: That's what I would do if I have this law also.

175
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:07,529
Speaker 0: Yup.

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,740
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the bike room's there.

177
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:21,339
Speaker 1: I got my bike in, and over the next week, pretty much all the bike parking spots- Stolen bike part is found in your bike shop?

178
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,679
Speaker 0: They shoot you.

179
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

180
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Speaker 1: Also, if you're caught stealing a bike, death.

181
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:26,800
Speaker 0: We should just make death bikes.

182
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:35,220
Speaker 1: Oh, also, before death, we have a bunch of cyclists who just volunteer every day, and we put you in a room with them for like 10 minutes.

183
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,339
Speaker 0: We could just have death bikes.

184
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,820
Speaker 1: And then if cyclists are bored one day, they can bike over and volunteer.

185
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,947
Speaker 0: You just put bikes around the city randomly.

186
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,839
Speaker 0: that, if taken and ridden more than 20 feet- The seat explodes with spikes.

187
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,358
Speaker 1: Yes.

188
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:56,639
Speaker 1: Anyway, so- What if someone takes- It's an emergency, and everyone's trying to escape the city, and someone just grabs one and goes- Well, you know what?

189
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,820
Speaker 0: That sucks, Mad Max.

190
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,479
Speaker 0: That's how Mad Max goes.

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:08:59,813
Speaker 0: Okay.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:13,629
Speaker 0: So, like 12 people put their bikes down there, and the bike room that we're supposed to leave is still completely full of all the bikes that no one rides, and the deadline is basically within a week- Are there any way?

193
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,519
Speaker 1: nice bikes in there?

194
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:15,559
Speaker 0: Way nice.

195
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:18,540
Speaker 0: There's a lot of really expensive bikes, but they're not really good bikes.

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,060
Speaker 0: All the good bikes are the people who ride them, and they're downstairs.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,160
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no real nice ones that you would want.

198
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,894
Speaker 0: No, but there's bikes you could sell for like 700, 800 bucks.

199
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,060
Speaker 1: I'm sure the building is going to take care of that.

200
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:28,515
Speaker 0: Yup.

201
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,099
Speaker 1: The same way they take care of stuff when you leave your apartment and leave all your stuff in it and don't come back.

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:47,219
Speaker 0: It's just interesting to me how many people own bikes in New York, who went through the effort to put them in the bike room in the building that has a bike room, and then have a slightly further away room.

203
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,219
Speaker 0: I wonder what's going to happen when that deadline comes and goes and none of those people have moved their bikes.

204
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,099
Speaker 1: I wonder what they're going to do with the room they're moving the bikes out of.

205
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,238
Speaker 0: Probably just make it storage.

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,016
Speaker 1: I don't know.

207
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,199
Speaker 0: I mean downstairs, nothing but storage and boilers and stuff down there.

208
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,900
Speaker 1: There used to be someone living down there.

209
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,240
Speaker 0: There's also a whole bunch of scary industrial shit down there because it's a big building.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,860
Speaker 1: Dude, the downstairs in my elementary school, it's like whenever I think of a downstairs that's scary- You want to compare downstairs scary elementary schools?

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:21,459
Speaker 0: I went to an ancient elementary school with a Catholic church, like an old one, like one of the older ones in the US attached to it, with tunnels connecting them to each other and all this crazy shit.

212
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,140
Speaker 1: There was a giant super bank safe in the bottom.

213
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,698
Speaker 0: Ooh, that's where all the dead kids are.

214
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:32,279
Speaker 1: I went in it once or twice, I forget why.

215
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:42,379
Speaker 0: I remember once I was breaking into, I was bored at RIT and I was busting into the tunnels and then the sub tunnels and all the places you're not supposed to go.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,340
Speaker 0: Because RIT has tunnels everywhere, but there were tunnels under those tunnels.

217
00:10:46,780 --> 00:11:01,477
Speaker 0: So I found a stairway that was always locked that went down from one of the sub tunnels and there was a tiny window and I could see that it went way down and it's already a full floor below the tunnel, which itself is like a floor and a half below ground.

218
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,759
Speaker 1: So it was at the bottom.

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:18,440
Speaker 0: So I opened the thing because it was just unlocked one day and I start creeping down and I get about halfway down and the doors kind of prop behind me and there's a little bit of light coming in and I realized I couldn't find any way to turn on any lights down there and there were scary noises coming from the bottom.

220
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,418
Speaker 0: So I went back up and I resolved to come back with a flashlight and it was locked.

221
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,959
Speaker 0: every time I checked again for the rest of my time at RIT.

222
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,077
Speaker 1: Why don't you just unlock it?

223
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,807
Speaker 0: How?

224
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:27,980
Speaker 0: I'm not a lock pick.

225
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,459
Speaker 1: You could YouTube that shit.

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I could have made a bump key, but I didn't care that much.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,680
Speaker 1: But actually, did YouTube exist?

228
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,919
Speaker 0: No, YouTube appeared while we were at RIT.

229
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Speaker 1: You still could have gotten eLockPicking things from the library.

230
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Speaker 0: In fact, the first videos we uploaded to YouTube, you can only upload 10 minutes at a time.

231
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,739
Speaker 0: So a lot of our early panels are in 10 minute chunks.

232
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:46,659
Speaker 0: That's how old we are.

233
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,939
Speaker 1: But you could still go to the school library and get info.

234
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,520
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, go to the special collection?

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,959
Speaker 1: I'm just any library.

236
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,260
Speaker 1: Even a public library has a book on lock picking.

237
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,180
Speaker 1: And if you don't have a book on lock picking, they have a book on locksmithing because you want to be a locksmith.

238
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:04,440
Speaker 1: And I'm sure at RIT, there are many kids who have practiced lock picking.

239
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:05,258
Speaker 1: You could find one.

240
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:11,240
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's anime day, and Monica in comics day, and we got to talk about that kind of stuff.

241
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,780
Speaker 0: Do you got any news?

242
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,719
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

243
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:27,459
Speaker 1: So we're doing at Anime Boston, one of the panels we do there is the judge book anime by its cover, and we review one of the upcoming anime seasons, and the spring season is literally like about to start, and it had more interesting stuff, so I chose that one instead of the summer one for our panel.

244
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,558
Speaker 0: I haven't looked at this at all.

245
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:47,299
Speaker 1: Right, so one of the things on the list was, normally we're supposed to judge by the cover and not know anything about any of these shows, but there was one that I had seen the trailer for because someone posted it in our forum, and this show looks like it's going to be a great, terrific, amazing show that everyone should see.

246
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,920
Speaker 1: So I can't judge it by its cover because I've seen this trailer.

247
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,580
Speaker 0: Well that trailer is part of the cover, you know, because we talk about it in the panel.

248
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,179
Speaker 0: Sometimes you do the Google image search.

249
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:59,240
Speaker 1: But anyway, this show is called Sakamoto Desuka.

250
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,597
Speaker 1: It's about this kid named Sakamoto, and he is like Mr.

251
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,700
Speaker 1: Perfect of school, basically, right?

252
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,620
Speaker 1: Like everything he does is perfect.

253
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,879
Speaker 1: If you try to prank him, you can't.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,780
Speaker 1: He like gets good grades and he's super athletic and just like he's perfect at everything.

255
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,759
Speaker 1: He cannot be fucked with at all.

256
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:25,260
Speaker 1: Right, but he's also like so nice and it's just like he's like infuriatingly good at everything, but also awesomely good at everything.

257
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,540
Speaker 1: The way that like One Punch Man or Go Go 13 or any of those people are just so good and being badass and always winning.

258
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,040
Speaker 0: I'm always a fan of the infuriatingly good protagonist genre.

259
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:45,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's also well animated, so it's, you know, it's like, well, you know, it's not super well animated like Ghibli level, but it's like better animated than the closest equivalent we can think of.

260
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,240
Speaker 1: It's not a modern animation.

261
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:49,700
Speaker 1: It is modern animation.

262
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:50,499
Speaker 1: It's not some garbage.

263
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,520
Speaker 1: So this show is the show to watch in the spring season.

264
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,900
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens in the summer season.

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,440
Speaker 0: So Escaflowne now, so many people emailed me about this.

266
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,226
Speaker 1: That's your show.

267
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,559
Speaker 0: Read it at me about this.

268
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,203
Speaker 1: That's your thing.

269
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,380
Speaker 0: I haven't talked to in four or five years.

270
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,080
Speaker 1: I mean, your Twitter handle is Shazar.

271
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,903
Speaker 0: That is true.

272
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,600
Speaker 0: Named after Cliff Shazar from Trigon.

273
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,960
Speaker 1: No, not named after Cliff Shazar from Trigon.

274
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:19,260
Speaker 0: That is the other anime Shazar though.

275
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:19,984
Speaker 1: Sure.

276
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:23,040
Speaker 1: You had that name, though, before Trigon was even a thing.

277
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,939
Speaker 0: That is, in fact, true.

278
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,640
Speaker 0: But because of Alan Shazar, who is in Escaflowne and also kind of a not great person.

279
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:45,580
Speaker 1: If you watch the show is exactly like rim, but Escaflowne was intentionally made his own life and he manually crafted his own personality to be a combination of Captain Tyler and Shazar on purpose.

280
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,148
Speaker 0: It's more like 90 percent.

281
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:50,820
Speaker 0: Tyler is mostly Tyler.

282
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,618
Speaker 1: That's what you like to think.

283
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:52,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,855
Speaker 0: I never really learned how to use swords.

285
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:55,339
Speaker 0: that well.

286
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,200
Speaker 1: You had more.

287
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,500
Speaker 1: You're lucky that you didn't have money.

288
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,400
Speaker 1: But that is the right time.

289
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Speaker 0: I would have Alex's fucking sword hanging around somewhere.

290
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,425
Speaker 0: It's real good.

291
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:11,180
Speaker 0: I never got into the wheel of time when I was young and had money because there's a lot of replicas of all the things in that.

292
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,105
Speaker 1: Well, no, that would have been good.

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:16,854
Speaker 1: You would have spent your money on books and not on some garbage for like 300 bucks.

294
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 0: You get the Heron blade.

295
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:19,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

296
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,460
Speaker 0: It was always in the museum replicas catalog.

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,360
Speaker 0: And I always look at it and be like, whoa, that's a really cool.

298
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:24,639
Speaker 1: So you can have all the Heron.

299
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,960
Speaker 0: But it's got a full tang, Scott, a full tang.

300
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,199
Speaker 0: It's battle worthy.

301
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,060
Speaker 1: Rim, you can have the Heron blade if I have Kalindar Heron spear.

302
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:34,750
Speaker 0: All right.

303
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:35,200
Speaker 0: You know what?

304
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,959
Speaker 0: You have the Heron spear.

305
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,999
Speaker 0: I'll take oh, what is it?

306
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:41,180
Speaker 0: The song real nonsense that they use those giant statues.

307
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Speaker 1: You're not beating my Heron spear.

308
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,420
Speaker 0: I think those statues beat the Heron spear.

309
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:49,360
Speaker 1: Heron spear is just some like Heron spear can destroy the no god.

310
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaker 1: Not you know what I can't.

311
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,686
Speaker 0: It's so powerful.

312
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,740
Speaker 1: Not only can destroy God, just like whatever.

313
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,098
Speaker 1: It can destroy the absence of gods.

314
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,039
Speaker 0: That book's coming.

315
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,959
Speaker 1: But giant tornado with a scary coffin in the middle.

316
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,460
Speaker 0: Escaflowne was one of the anime that I like, you know, I was in high school.

317
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,279
Speaker 0: I was really into anime since I was like eight years old.

318
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,320
Speaker 0: But Escaflowne was an anime that I was aware of when it was in Japan and was desperately trying to see for a long time.

319
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,499
Speaker 0: And then when it got released in the U.S.

320
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Speaker 0: on VHS, I basically watched it as fast as I possibly could.

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:31,240
Speaker 0: I tried to get fansubs and actually failed because the people who were fansubbing it wouldn't distribute it to me because I didn't run an anime club.

322
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,200
Speaker 0: And they didn't believe me when I lied and said that I did run an anime.

323
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Speaker 1: But you did eventually run an anime club.

324
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck you guys who fansub Escaflowne.

325
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,700
Speaker 1: But anyway, it I didn't realize until just now.

326
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:45,420
Speaker 1: Escaflowne had never been dubbed.

327
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,660
Speaker 1: We had a VHS set that was all subs.

328
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:51,559
Speaker 1: I thought that there was a set you could have gotten with dubs and we were just smart enough not to buy that.

329
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:52,854
Speaker 0: But no, there was also subtitles.

330
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,460
Speaker 1: There was also a DVD box set that I believed had dub on it and it did not.

331
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:58,999
Speaker 1: And there was a dub on Fox.

332
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,219
Speaker 1: But that's not Escaflowne.

333
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,960
Speaker 0: The dub and that's not even complete.

334
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,500
Speaker 0: The Fox box or whatever dub basically cut the show up and kind of gave it the Warriors of the Wind treatment.

335
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,839
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure if they finished dubbing the entire show.

336
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,380
Speaker 0: But that dub was a disaster.

337
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,999
Speaker 1: It's also not Escaflowne basically.

338
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Warriors of the Wind 2.

339
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,363
Speaker 1: It's like it's.

340
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,339
Speaker 1: I mean, people want to talk about Macross.

341
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,457
Speaker 1: I mean, Robotech isn't Macross, which it isn't.

342
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,499
Speaker 1: But really, the Escaflowne on Fox is even worse than that.

343
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,860
Speaker 0: But Escaflowne is actually one of my favorite anime.

344
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,479
Speaker 0: And it is a really good show.

345
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,915
Speaker 0: There aren't shows like it.

346
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,580
Speaker 0: Partly because there's a lot of reasons.

347
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:35,680
Speaker 1: Isaac Newton spoilers.

348
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,520
Speaker 0: I feel like I should watch it again because I don't know if it warrants its high placement on my list of my favorite anime ever.

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,913
Speaker 1: It's no Evangelion.

350
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:45,439
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

351
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,699
Speaker 0: Of course, it's not an Evangelion, but it's a good show.

352
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,740
Speaker 1: Why not watch it?

353
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,139
Speaker 1: It's better than like almost all the shows coming out right now.

354
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,718
Speaker 0: I mean, if it came out today, it's got new.

356
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,460
Speaker 0: It would do really well.

357
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,678
Speaker 0: I think it's got those musics.

358
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,360
Speaker 0: It moves real fast.

359
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:00,752
Speaker 1: It's got good characters.

360
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:01,580
Speaker 1: It's got cliffhangers.

361
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,880
Speaker 0: This is where I think Maya Sakamoto basically got her start.

362
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:10,500
Speaker 0: This is where this is where a lot of people got like their sort of starts in anime.

363
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:14,857
Speaker 0: So the dubs coming on Kickstarter there.

364
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,240
Speaker 1: So why would you kickstart a dub?

365
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,320
Speaker 1: You could just buy the DVD box set that's legally available with subs.

366
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,620
Speaker 1: Why would you pay more money than that to help them make a dub that we don't?

367
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,103
Speaker 1: World does not.

368
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:26,640
Speaker 0: That is, in fact, what I don't get.

369
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:33,910
Speaker 0: Now, I could see them making a dub if they were going to try to do what I always say they should do and give you might.

370
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,199
Speaker 1: you might be a blind person who does not know Japanese, in which case this dub would be very good for you.

371
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:40,238
Speaker 0: That is true.

372
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,919
Speaker 1: But other than that, why do you want this?

373
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:54,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if I were like if I had the rights to the show, you'd only dub it if you were going to put it on like Crunchyroll or Hulu or whatever and then promote it and try to get Normies to watch it like or you're going to put it on TV.

374
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:59,480
Speaker 0: You're going to do something with it for a like not insider anime audience.

375
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:09,000
Speaker 0: But the people who are going to preorder this are almost entirely people who know the show exists and have already seen it probably several times.

376
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,337
Speaker 1: Why do they want to see it again with English language?

377
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:16,600
Speaker 0: There's no evidence that it's going to be a better dub than any average anime dub is.

378
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,820
Speaker 0: And I feel like this is just a preorder for it.

379
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,559
Speaker 0: I don't need to feel like because they say straight up.

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,189
Speaker 0: This is just a preorder because obviously one hundred and fifty grand is not enough to dub a show, right?

381
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,580
Speaker 0: I mean, one hundred fifty grand is maybe enough to dub one episode of a show if you do it low rent.

382
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,306
Speaker 0: But that's not.

383
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:38,820
Speaker 1: they seem to be doing it at the usual rent level.

384
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,585
Speaker 0: Yeah.

385
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:47,715
Speaker 0: So they pretty much straight up are like, yeah, this is just a pre preorder for all of you who want this and that'll make.

386
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 0: we'll only do the dub if we know there's enough interest because this is a preorder.

387
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:58,939
Speaker 0: So they're basically saying we're going to pay to dub it, but only if a bunch of you actually commit with money to buy it once we release it.

388
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:03,698
Speaker 0: But I think the actual reason people are excited about this, they don't.

389
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:11,700
Speaker 0: I don't think any of these people care about the dub because the five thousand dollar tier is gone, the four hundred dollar tier is gone.

390
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,094
Speaker 1: What do you get?

391
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:14,379
Speaker 1: Is five thousand the highest tier?

392
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:15,210
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

393
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,779
Speaker 0: What do you get?

394
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,960
Speaker 0: OK, the star.

395
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,358
Speaker 0: They're all named after tarot cards.

396
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:26,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, a one of a kind Escaflowne experience will fly you out to the Funimation office where you'll get a tour.

397
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,519
Speaker 1: No one wants to do that.

398
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,699
Speaker 0: A bag of Funimation goodies, garbage, and you'll get to do voice work that will appear in the dub.

399
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,740
Speaker 0: So you're going to do some random background.

400
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,080
Speaker 0: You're going to be that guy in that awful Gasaraki dub who says, what's wrong, you sure?

401
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,459
Speaker 1: Oh, you're going to be like some knight that gets stabbed and goes, oh, I'll bet you'll get to say a word.

402
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,220
Speaker 0: And it's going to because you remember that guy in Gasaraki, right?

403
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,140
Speaker 1: It's going to be some guy gets cut down by fun or something.

404
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,391
Speaker 0: You remember that guy in Gasaraki?

405
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember that guy.

406
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,060
Speaker 0: That guy stands out like a wound to this day in my soul.

407
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,380
Speaker 0: We want to go get everything in the lower tiers.

408
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:12,240
Speaker 0: So the four hundred, three hundred, two hundred dollar tiers, which are pretty much like all crazy subscribed, are basically just giant boxes of nonsense for the show.

409
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,288
Speaker 0: Nothing about the dub.

410
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:14,479
Speaker 1: Who needs any of this garbage?

411
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,026
Speaker 0: Collectors, people who want the perfect edition of Escaflowne.

412
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,700
Speaker 1: I didn't think there were this many collectors.

413
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,999
Speaker 0: These are the people who are who, like me, were obsessed with Escaflowne.

414
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:27,080
Speaker 0: But unlike me, still want to spend a lot of money on getting things like a poster signed.

415
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:30,520
Speaker 1: The existing DVD box here for four hundred bucks.

416
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:39,720
Speaker 0: You get the box set with all the fancy art and stuff and you get a poster signed by the director, the original creator and the character designer.

417
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,544
Speaker 0: Nobutaru Yuki.

418
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,540
Speaker 1: OK, but I mean, I saw Nobutaru Yuki at Otakon.

419
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

420
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:45,060
Speaker 0: So you basically.

421
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,940
Speaker 1: So why do I need a thing that he wrote on to get their signatures?

422
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,939
Speaker 0: And it's that kind of crap.

423
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,600
Speaker 0: It's the dub doesn't even need to be a part of this.

424
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,620
Speaker 0: I'll bet if they just said Escaflowne re-released without a dub, they would have raised almost the exact same amount of money.

425
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,247
Speaker 0: So maybe they're going to.

426
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:06,320
Speaker 0: they're doing the dub just because they're going to get the interest from this and it'll sort of break even.

427
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,060
Speaker 0: And then they're going to try to push Escaflowne to the mainstream audience.

428
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:18,080
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just the anime voice actors like kind of upset because there's less dubs lately because everything is going pretty much straight to the Internet streaming with subtitles.

429
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,739
Speaker 1: And they're like, let's you know, we want to make money doing this again.

430
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,460
Speaker 0: Except most anime voice actors who are good also just do voiceover work and they're great.

431
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,717
Speaker 0: And that other work, they're only bad in anime dubs.

432
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:30,490
Speaker 0: I mean, they're not.

433
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,460
Speaker 0: they're not hurting for though.

434
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:41,318
Speaker 0: Actually, I've seen a few voice actors we know who are friends with me on LinkedIn in the last year updating their statuses to things to the effect of, yeah, I really would like some work.

435
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:44,638
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

436
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:48,479
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any reason to back this unless I mean, if I was going to.

437
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,280
Speaker 1: We should find something that like no one will ever dub ever and dub it.

438
00:22:53,962 --> 00:23:01,617
Speaker 1: Just like as best we actually try as best as we can ourselves, which is to offend us, saying it's got to offend us, people we know, right?

439
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,820
Speaker 1: Just do the best that we can do, which is not that great.

440
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,396
Speaker 1: But just do the best we can do honestly and see what happens.

441
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,319
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm like Zazen Jotaro.

442
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,249
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

443
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:11,080
Speaker 0: Well, wait.

444
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,499
Speaker 0: Most of these low tiers don't even get you Escaflowne.

445
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,400
Speaker 1: How much do you have to pay to actually get the DVD box set of the full series?

446
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,260
Speaker 0: Fifteen bucks just gets you a certificate.

447
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Speaker 0: Thirty bucks gets you a preorder of the movie.

448
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,980
Speaker 1: Oh, I was about to ask if you get the movie and any of these tiers.

449
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:27,026
Speaker 0: Thirty five.

450
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:28,379
Speaker 1: Are they dubbing the movie too?

451
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:30,258
Speaker 0: I assume so.

452
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,280
Speaker 1: So they're going to dub the movie and the TV show.

453
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,400
Speaker 1: That makes me kind of okay.

454
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,160
Speaker 0: For sixty five dollars, you get all that nonsense above.

455
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:45,040
Speaker 0: You get a preorder of the Escaflowne TV series, part one featuring episodes one through thirteen.

456
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:45,866
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

457
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:45,968
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:50,019
Speaker 1: This Kickstarter, that's the biggest rip off I ever heard.

459
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:50,645
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:51,359
Speaker 1: The whole box.

461
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,339
Speaker 1: How much is the whole box set on Amazon, the one that we already have?

462
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,487
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

463
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:56,938
Speaker 1: I'm going to go look right now.

464
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,780
Speaker 0: But so it's interesting.

465
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:14,339
Speaker 0: Well, Scott's looking that up because I had to make a new version of foreign anime openers because, you know, I want to have two hours of material so I can do the panel with different audiences, even though you people keep coming to it and watching the same Captain Harlock thing over and over and over again.

466
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:29,326
Speaker 0: It's real hard to find foreign anime openers because even pretty much everywhere in the world, except for Russia and Korea, they just use the Japanese songs and they just subtitled stuff because no one cares anymore.

467
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,459
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that.

468
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:30,761
Speaker 1: Okay.

469
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:33,100
Speaker 1: So, Rem, do you still have that Escaflowne DVD box?

470
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,060
Speaker 0: Actually, for various reasons, I have two of them.

471
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,641
Speaker 1: All right.

472
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,912
Speaker 1: But so on Amazon, it's one of the.

473
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:42,051
Speaker 1: it turns out it's one of those things that they didn't make that many.

474
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:42,959
Speaker 0: And now it's rare that.

475
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

476
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,566
Speaker 1: So they're selling.

477
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:47,580
Speaker 1: I mean, they're being priced on Amazon at one fifty.

478
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:50,300
Speaker 1: But no one seems to be buying at one fifty.

479
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,575
Speaker 1: But I'm sure if you put it up at one hundred, maybe someone would buy or even seventy five.

480
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:54,820
Speaker 1: Right.

481
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:57,560
Speaker 0: Thing is for one hundred and twenty five.

482
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:57,925
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

483
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:58,660
Speaker 0: One hundred twenty five.

484
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,780
Speaker 0: You still only get part one and part two.

485
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,600
Speaker 0: OK, so you have to pay one hundred and twenty five bucks to actually get Escaflowne in this preorder.

486
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:08,159
Speaker 0: And that is a limited tier.

487
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,798
Speaker 0: There's only five hundred of those.

488
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:12,700
Speaker 1: But I have a feeling we go to anime Boston.

489
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,260
Speaker 1: We'll be able to find this box that cheap if we see it here on eBay.

490
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,980
Speaker 1: It looks like a legit ones on eBay.

491
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,839
Speaker 1: You know, it could be bootleg ones that just stole the art from the legit ones.

492
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,480
Speaker 1: But these look like legit ones to me selling for twenty on eBay.

493
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,282
Speaker 0: All right.

494
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:27,625
Speaker 0: All right.

495
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,760
Speaker 0: So there's no reason to buy it at anime Boston.

496
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,159
Speaker 1: This is Escaflowne a complete collection, eight, this set brand new.

497
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:38,560
Speaker 1: The image in the picture here looks like it's the image from the real thing.

498
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,079
Speaker 1: It could be so bootleg, though.

499
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,660
Speaker 0: So I did a control F on the Kickstarter.

500
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,600
Speaker 0: The word remaster doesn't appear anywhere.

501
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,940
Speaker 0: So I don't think you get any thing beyond that.

502
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:50,474
Speaker 0: I mean, they're saying HD.

503
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,539
Speaker 0: Pretty sure it's just DVDs.

504
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,440
Speaker 1: Here's one that's definitely legit because it's the box with the lid that comes with the robot and stuff and either even showing the DVD cases spread out.

505
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,519
Speaker 1: And it's definitely been watched and they're selling it for seventy five.

506
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,280
Speaker 1: So whatever.

507
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:18,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I'm so I'm excited that this might cause a renaissance of Escaflowne watching because I think a lot of kids who watch anime today, their minds would be blown by this show because there aren't a lot of shows like it.

508
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,736
Speaker 1: Well, there's not a lot of fantasy adventure.

509
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:24,372
Speaker 1: that's somewhat serious, but there's plenty of main character.

510
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,320
Speaker 1: magical girl goes to another the universe.

511
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:33,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like full on high fantasy, like all the slayers kind of stuff, but actually serious and not just no comedy.

512
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Speaker 1: Escaflowne exit the cat girl for like five minutes.

513
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,158
Speaker 0: There's comedy at times.

514
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just it.

515
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,560
Speaker 0: definitely not like the comedy gets shed away.

516
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, El Hazzard is about 40 percent comedy overall.

517
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,819
Speaker 1: El Hazzard is Escaflowne plus a lot more lols.

518
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot more weird fan service.

519
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:49,819
Speaker 0: Cat armor.

520
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,816
Speaker 0: Cat armor is great.

521
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,239
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

522
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,820
Speaker 0: So, Scott, have you ever wondered why we have butt hair?

523
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,980
Speaker 1: You mean hair on your butt or hair in the crack?

524
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,765
Speaker 0: In the crack.

525
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,400
Speaker 0: Like you ever wonder why there's hair in there?

526
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,980
Speaker 1: Because there's more hair there than everywhere else.

527
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,740
Speaker 1: I've heard stories of people removing that hair and then having a butt that gets sealed shut and is a disgusting result.

528
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,056
Speaker 0: Ah, you were thinking of the story that I remember that we learned about at RIT, the pass out and vomit story from the yes.

529
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:36,380
Speaker 0: So someone apparently in the Crash Course videos and SciShow and all that has when they have a they have a one punch man avatar and they ask anyone of the one punch man avatar they posted legit.

530
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,820
Speaker 1: So someone today with a one with a Saitama avatar posted the images of what's almost definitely pretty legit.

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Speaker 1: The Nintendo NX controller.

532
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,720
Speaker 1: You can always trust Saitama avatar.

533
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Speaker 1: So that is the only anime anime.

534
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,980
Speaker 1: It's like the exception to anime avatars, not all anime avatars.

535
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,640
Speaker 1: Saitama avatars are like the exact opposite of all anime avatars.

536
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,875
Speaker 1: If someone has one, they're basically just follow them because whatever they say is great.

537
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:13,100
Speaker 0: Lido Johnny with the Saitama avatar has posted a comment that gets upvoted a lot on every single video they have ever uploaded asking quotes in all caps.

538
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,980
Speaker 0: Why is there hair on my anus?

539
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:20,480
Speaker 0: So they decided to do a special and they answered that question.

540
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,639
Speaker 0: So the do you want to know the answer?

541
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,279
Speaker 0: Scientists don't know.

542
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,318
Speaker 0: It's actually a mystery.

543
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,218
Speaker 0: What?

544
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:28,137
Speaker 0: No, for real.

545
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:29,360
Speaker 0: There are some theories.

546
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,633
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just right now.

547
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is just not to be a reason.

548
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:37,680
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but the reason because people kept screwing people who had butt hair.

549
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:37,743
Speaker 0: No.

550
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:39,440
Speaker 0: So they're the butt hair.

551
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,060
Speaker 1: Maybe you had butt hair or not didn't affect whether people made babies with you.

552
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,040
Speaker 1: So some people, you know, it might have.

553
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,500
Speaker 0: So actually what they come up with in the videos, one, they talk about all the theories and also didn't affect whether you lived or died.

554
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,460
Speaker 0: So one that I could add long, long enough to screw and actually may have.

555
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,819
Speaker 0: So one of the theories has to do with there was no evolutionary pressure for hair there to go away.

556
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,579
Speaker 0: But hair went away everywhere else.

558
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:04,219
Speaker 0: So why not there?

559
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:08,040
Speaker 0: It's not tied to pubic hair, secondary sex or anything.

560
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,860
Speaker 0: It's completely independent.

561
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,858
Speaker 1: Hair didn't necessarily go everywhere else.

562
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,757
Speaker 0: Well, man.

563
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:16,439
Speaker 1: Exhibit A, Scott Johnson.

564
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Speaker 0: Did you see the font someone made that is pictures of their shoulder hairs?

565
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,060
Speaker 1: I got shoulder hairs.

566
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Speaker 0: It's pictures of individual shoulder hairs on their body that form the shapes of letters.

567
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,199
Speaker 0: It's a font you can use.

568
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,040
Speaker 0: It's horrific.

569
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,019
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't have that.

570
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:31,839
Speaker 0: You don't have words up there?

571
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:32,196
Speaker 0: No.

572
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:38,879
Speaker 0: One of the theories involves that without hair there, you'll have warm, moist skin rubbing against warm, moist skin.

573
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,140
Speaker 0: And it implies that that story we read at RIT might be a legitimate concern.

574
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, I totally believe that.

575
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,699
Speaker 0: But there's no evidence of that.

576
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,720
Speaker 1: Well, at RIM you're just going to self-experiment.

577
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,060
Speaker 0: So he proposes at the end of the video an experiment that would determine.

578
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:09,080
Speaker 0: And apparently getting rid of the hair down there and forcing someone to see is not a valid experiment because the shaving or, quote, whatever method you use to remove the hair is equally likely to be the source of irritation.

579
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:13,820
Speaker 1: So this video, if you wax your butt, that's going to be pretty irritating.

580
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,387
Speaker 0: Yeah.

581
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:21,358
Speaker 0: So this video goes into the science of why we don't actually know why there's hair in our butt.

582
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:23,180
Speaker 1: You can also put Nair in your butt.

583
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,400
Speaker 0: No, I will never let Nair touch my body in my entire life.

584
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,040
Speaker 1: I'm going to take some Nair and throw it at you.

585
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,659
Speaker 0: No, you're not.

586
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,900
Speaker 1: Fun fact, I'll just slip some onto your keyboard and be like typing and be like, there is a I have my fingers.

587
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,400
Speaker 0: A lot of men in America at least get injured by Nair.

588
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,258
Speaker 1: What?

589
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,739
Speaker 1: And it's because why are they touching it?

590
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,340
Speaker 0: They use it for, you know, balls or whatever.

591
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:55,400
Speaker 0: No, but they being stupid assume that man branded Nair is stronger than woman branded Nair.

592
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,520
Speaker 1: It's the same shit in a different bottle.

593
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:57,017
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

594
00:30:57,261 --> 00:31:00,540
Speaker 0: So they buy female branded Nair and use that.

595
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:09,260
Speaker 0: But on average, Nair that is made for a woman to use for the kinds of places that women use it is actually way stronger than what they make for men.

596
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,120
Speaker 0: I mean, I know that men are little babies.

597
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,600
Speaker 1: In high school, I knew kids who put like Icy Hot on their nuts.

598
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:14,708
Speaker 1: Right.

599
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,960
Speaker 0: So that's that's a yeah, whatever.

600
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:18,280
Speaker 0: I'm not touching Nair.

601
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,920
Speaker 1: That's high school level material.

602
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:25,560
Speaker 0: Actually, I wonder if we'll find out more about Nair's child in the upcoming Nair.

603
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:32,600
Speaker 1: Anyway, so for anyone who doesn't know, Nair is like this hair removal cream that burns your hairs off, basically.

604
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, so you've heard the phrase like milk toast, right?

605
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,397
Speaker 1: It's like milk toast is like usually an insult to someone because they're so boring and plain.

606
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:40,879
Speaker 0: Yeah.

607
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,499
Speaker 0: I mean, if you think and basic, if I imagine the word milk toast, I imagine a perfect picture of Milhouse Van Houten.

608
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, but milk bread, milk toast is actually a real thing.

609
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:50,919
Speaker 1: that is delicious.

610
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,860
Speaker 1: You'll often buy it at the Japanese bakery or whatever.

611
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how do you make that?

612
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,417
Speaker 1: How do they make that?

613
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:07,219
Speaker 1: Apparently, in order to make that and the reason it's not really a thing in most countries is because you need an ingredient that I don't even know the real name of.

614
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:09,099
Speaker 1: It's known as bread improver.

615
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,438
Speaker 0: Bread improver.

616
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,140
Speaker 1: That's right.

617
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,815
Speaker 1: So you can get...

618
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,419
Speaker 0: That sounds ominous.

619
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,296
Speaker 1: If I would say in Japan, I could just go to the grocery store and buy some bread improver.

620
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,540
Speaker 1: But in the United States, it's not so easy to get bread improver.

621
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,120
Speaker 0: Whole grain bread improver from King Arthur Flour.

622
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:23,918
Speaker 1: Oh, how about that?

623
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:24,917
Speaker 1: There you go.

624
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,579
Speaker 0: It looks like it's just flour.

625
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows?

626
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you can't get the bread improver, because it's not like the grocery store.

627
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Speaker 1: Find me a grocery store that actually has that, right?

628
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,500
Speaker 1: They don't have it a stop and shop.

629
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,680
Speaker 0: I'm going to check my fresh direct.

630
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,199
Speaker 1: OK, but anyway, if you can't get the bread improver, which you probably can't unless you buy it on the Internet or something, right?

631
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,000
Speaker 1: What do you do if you want to make some some milk bread?

632
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:52,720
Speaker 1: So there's this Chinese lady and she has a website, Christine's Recipes.

633
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:59,838
Speaker 1: And here's this other website, Kirby's Cravings, who made Christine's recipe for the milk bread.

634
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:07,460
Speaker 1: And apparently the secret thing that they do is they use something known as the Tang Zong method, which I probably pronounced wrong because it's a Chinese word.

635
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:24,560
Speaker 1: And in this method, you basically sort of take some flour and some water and like you warm it up and like you cook it like sixty five Celsius to basically make this other stuff, this Tang Zong, this like flour paste, huh?

636
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:32,320
Speaker 1: And then you use that instead of using bread improver or any kind of preservatives or fluffing agents or anything like that.

637
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,077
Speaker 0: It's got to get on it.

638
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:41,660
Speaker 1: Maybe it's it's work, but you can make what looks appears visually in these photographs to be delicious milk bread.

639
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,660
Speaker 0: Watch it's a trap.

640
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,020
Speaker 0: It's like the anarchist cookbook, fake recipes for bombs.

641
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,859
Speaker 0: It just makes like terrible bread.

642
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,119
Speaker 1: If warming up flour in a pot is going to make a bomb.

643
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:53,680
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a problem in the moment.

644
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,680
Speaker 0: The next book club book will be Margaret Edwards, Oryx and Crake, because I'm going to pause the Wheel of Time books at the end.

645
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 1: You can't pause the Wheel of Time.

646
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,748
Speaker 1: It's never ending because it's in the third age.

647
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,020
Speaker 0: So it's a Wheel of Time.

648
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,820
Speaker 1: It's a Wheel of Time.

649
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,277
Speaker 1: Not easy.

650
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,179
Speaker 1: It's not the line of time that has a beginning and an end.

651
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,839
Speaker 1: It's not the line segment of time.

652
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:13,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, the wheel.

653
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:22,818
Speaker 0: There are so many characters that hit a point where there is a name of one of the And then that as to die ended up in a conversation that involved another.

654
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:29,543
Speaker 0: as to die that I thought for most of the previous four books were the same person because their names are.

655
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,540
Speaker 0: they differ by one letter and they just never been in the same area before.

656
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,500
Speaker 0: And they're very different.

657
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:36,938
Speaker 0: And I didn't realize that.

658
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,000
Speaker 0: I just thought I just thought this one wizard was really erratic in her behavior.

659
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 0: OK, so we're going to be at Anime Boston this weekend.

660
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,820
Speaker 0: On Friday, role playing anime.

661
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:56,300
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about what role playing systems to use if you want to role play anime, because I'll tell you what, the anime branded role playing systems are hot garbage.

662
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:59,260
Speaker 0: Judge anime by its covers Friday night.

663
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,060
Speaker 0: That's the main event.

664
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,600
Speaker 0: That's our like big ass anime Boston tradition.

665
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,160
Speaker 0: We do this every year and it will not disappoint.

666
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,799
Speaker 1: Is this the third or fourth time we've done this?

667
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do it every year since that first year in 2013.

668
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:13,358
Speaker 0: And we're going to keep doing it every year.

669
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:21,480
Speaker 0: Saturday, how to run an anime club more for an anime openers, which is almost all new content and a motivational anime.

670
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Speaker 0: We're talking about like, you know, a pedal and why it pumps you up to bike the weekend right after that at Zank icon.

671
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,259
Speaker 0: I will be there.

672
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,059
Speaker 0: Scott will not.

673
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,198
Speaker 0: And on Saturday, I'm doing how to run an anime club with the other Scotts.

674
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,780
Speaker 0: I'm doing analyzing anime utenna because that's a good crowd for that kind of panel.

675
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:40,439
Speaker 0: And I'm doing practical game theory.

676
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,005
Speaker 0: Yeah.

677
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,420
Speaker 0: Got anything else?

678
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,379
Speaker 0: We'd talk about not really ourselves on the Internet.

679
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:49,960
Speaker 1: Go go on the Internet and look at our things that we make besides this.

680
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,882
Speaker 0: Like we have YouTube channels and Twitter's and Patreon's going strong and real close to that goal.

681
00:35:56,085 --> 00:36:01,647
Speaker 0: Five people have revealed that they found several of the beta episodes of Geek Night.

682
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:02,360
Speaker 0: It's not hard.

683
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,920
Speaker 1: People are just trying harder recently.

684
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,680
Speaker 0: So it was explaining to me how the most recent person found it.

685
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,660
Speaker 0: And basically it was typing too fast.

686
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,460
Speaker 0: Hit enter before they finished typing something in a in a browser bar and it hit one.

687
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,405
Speaker 0: He was like, what?

688
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,100
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not hard.

689
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:19,309
Speaker 1: It's just guessing URLs with.

690
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,699
Speaker 1: they're not like obfuscated in any way.

691
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:22,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:26,620
Speaker 0: But that no one appears to have found all of them.

693
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:37,614
Speaker 1: But I'm actually not sure if all of them are actually still on the Internet because all the ones that we shared with our friends only in that PHP back in 2005 are on the Internet.

694
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,399
Speaker 0: I might have direct shared.

695
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:48,159
Speaker 1: And if you type if you type the correct URL in your browser, the Web server that they are on will send the MP3s to you free of charge.

696
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:55,040
Speaker 0: I can't tell or remember if the episodes from before that point, we just never shared with anyone because we thought they were bad, maybe.

697
00:36:55,341 --> 00:37:05,764
Speaker 1: But if I direct shared them with people, the reason they are hard to find is because there are no HTML or otherwise other documents on the Internet with a links pointing at these URLs.

698
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,200
Speaker 1: You know what I want to figure them out is to just type them in.

699
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:16,280
Speaker 1: And I'm curious how much content is available on the Internet only in this form that you can't Google search for because it's not indexed.

700
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,400
Speaker 1: But if you type in the right URL, imagine what kind of wonderful things are out there.

701
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,226
Speaker 1: Like, are there?

702
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,240
Speaker 1: like entire movies that like no one's ever seen?

703
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,080
Speaker 1: But there's an MP4 like hosted somewhere.

704
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,458
Speaker 1: And if you guessed it right, you could get it.

705
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:31,020
Speaker 0: I'll bet the A people Gaga is out there somewhere in some directory on a Unix server.

706
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,582
Speaker 1: Right.

707
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,539
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, how do you even search for that?

708
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:34,340
Speaker 0: Gaga.

709
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:36,500
Speaker 1: You can't even search for that, right?

710
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,679
Speaker 0: You know how you search for it?

711
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,760
Speaker 0: The way you search for stuff in the 90s, you search to find like places that reference something that doesn't appear to exist anymore.

712
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:48,760
Speaker 0: And then you start poking around with URLs and directory explorers.

713
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,799
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make a search engine specifically for this kind of search.

714
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,540
Speaker 0: Oh, lost Web or something.

715
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:56,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

716
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,600
Speaker 1: It only indexes like Apache index pages.

717
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:00,064
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:01,859
Speaker 1: Actually, you know, you search by file name.

719
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,140
Speaker 0: That's something we could make.

720
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,560
Speaker 1: I don't think you can search by like domain and file name and extension type and file size and things and date date because the dates are on there.

721
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,758
Speaker 1: So you can be like old stuff only.

722
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:17,626
Speaker 1: So I want to find MP3 before the year 2010.

723
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:17,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

724
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:19,479
Speaker 0: Well, you have to uncook them when you download them.

725
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:21,295
Speaker 1: That'll be an option.

726
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read the other day, I randomly found a script that I used to use to uncook MP3s, but I download.

727
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:31,880
Speaker 1: someone brought up some other stuff that they found while searching.

728
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:33,124
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

729
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:39,199
Speaker 0: That we played a forum, Forgotten Realms, Dungeons and Dragons game on a PHP BB a long time ago.

730
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:39,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:43,540
Speaker 0: And there is some amazing descriptive text in there.

732
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,239
Speaker 1: I was a mind player.

733
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:47,393
Speaker 0: I was the typical.

734
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,840
Speaker 0: Alish is our looking elf dude.

735
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,104
Speaker 0: Yeah.

736
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:49,919
Speaker 1: You should have been a skeleton.

737
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,559
Speaker 0: I like my elf dude.

738
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,522
Speaker 1: Mind Flayer.

739
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,640
Speaker 0: So Scott finally watched the end of Gravity Falls.

740
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,501
Speaker 1: Yep.

741
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:58,820
Speaker 0: And we can now review it fully.

742
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,260
Speaker 0: I assume you've all seen it.

743
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,360
Speaker 0: If you haven't, I guess you should.

744
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:10,180
Speaker 1: I realized, though, when like, you know, watching all the remaining episodes I hadn't seen yet, which is right, which was a lot because you had left off before Mad Max.

745
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,781
Speaker 1: Sure.

746
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:16,565
Speaker 1: That I don't remember a lot of stuff from earlier because this was a show that I didn't like.

747
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:17,539
Speaker 1: marathon all at once.

748
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,580
Speaker 1: It's a show that, like, I watched over a long period of time.

749
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,979
Speaker 1: Like, I watched it in chunks, like maybe four or five chunks.

750
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,341
Speaker 0: Yep.

751
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:26,280
Speaker 1: And so within each chunk, I remembered everything.

752
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,604
Speaker 1: But like, you know, from one chunk to the next is hard to remember everything from the previous chunk.

753
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:39,126
Speaker 0: Well, it's interesting because I watched like we were both watching it about the same time and then remember it like in season one, it stopped and then it started again.

754
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:40,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did that a few times.

755
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:45,020
Speaker 1: There's a time where it stopped after that Halloween episode at the convenience store.

756
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,650
Speaker 0: After the Halloween episode, I didn't like.

757
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,903
Speaker 0: I like the show, OK, but I didn't like it that much.

758
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:51,606
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

759
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:56,679
Speaker 1: it wasn't one of those shows at any point where I was like, oh, my God, got to watch an exhibit them again.

760
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,759
Speaker 0: So I didn't pay attention to it.

761
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,141
Speaker 1: Right.

762
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:02,420
Speaker 1: So even when new episodes came out again, I didn't rush out to get them.

763
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,279
Speaker 1: I sort of waited and then eventually saw them.

764
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,000
Speaker 0: But then there was a point that inspired me and Emily to start watching it again was you started watching it again for some reason.

765
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:15,001
Speaker 0: And you got through the end of season one with Bill and like that stuff started to happen.

766
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,700
Speaker 0: And you were like, oh, Bill Triangle Guy and I saw Triangle Guy around.

767
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,120
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, I guess Gravity Falls went somewhere.

768
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:25,879
Speaker 0: So I went back and started watching it and now we're done with it.

769
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,480
Speaker 0: So I guess we'll try to save spoilers for the end.

770
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,940
Speaker 0: But if I had to fully review this show, it is a perfectly adequate kids cartoon.

771
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:33,984
Speaker 0: It's good.

772
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,220
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest show in the world.

773
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,760
Speaker 1: The thing is, yeah, it's definitely not the greatest show in the world.

774
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,539
Speaker 1: But I think it's it's one of those things where, you know, it doesn't really have too many flaws in itself.

775
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,202
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:47,579
Speaker 1: Just looking at it on its own.

777
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,440
Speaker 0: It had potential flaws that it actually addressed satisfactorily.

778
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:51,982
Speaker 1: Right.

779
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,240
Speaker 1: But it also didn't have anything that like made it incredible.

780
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,295
Speaker 1: There wasn't like some masterful thing that it did.

781
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,063
Speaker 1: that was like, oh, look at this amazing thing.

782
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:06,234
Speaker 1: It's just like, you know, really good, really well done, you know, unique in a lot of ways.

783
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:06,640
Speaker 1: Right.

784
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,700
Speaker 1: You know, it did things that other things didn't do.

785
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,660
Speaker 1: It was a kid's story wise, character wise, art wise, pretty unique.

786
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,022
Speaker 1: Right.

787
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:17,003
Speaker 0: It's a kid's show that set up some kinds of relationships and then had them not work out.

788
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:19,919
Speaker 0: It's also a kid's show that got real scary.

789
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,681
Speaker 1: Sure.

790
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:26,740
Speaker 1: And also, it's better than a lot of its, you know, contemporary works.

791
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,447
Speaker 1: It's not the best.

792
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,520
Speaker 1: It's not Adventure Time good.

793
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:29,344
Speaker 1: Right.

794
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:31,040
Speaker 0: It's not even Avatar good.

795
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 0: Avatar is still like a full tier above.

796
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:35,678
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that, but you should watch.

797
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,507
Speaker 1: It's better than like a lot of the garbage you watch, like the kid who's a fish or whatever.

798
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:41,200
Speaker 1: It's better than that.

799
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,560
Speaker 0: The Amazing World of Gumball is an amazing kid's show.

800
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,751
Speaker 1: And it's better than Teen Titans.

801
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,160
Speaker 0: Go is also an amazing kid's show.

802
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,906
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that.

803
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:49,060
Speaker 0: Actually, it's an amazing adult show.

804
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,180
Speaker 0: You should watch the hell out of it.

805
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,687
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's better.

806
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:54,140
Speaker 0: Do you hate all the DC stuff that's dumb?

807
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:56,884
Speaker 1: Mostly, yeah.

808
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:59,543
Speaker 0: Then you'll like Teen Titans because it's nothing but making fun of that crap.

809
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still dumb DC stuff.

810
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'll put it this way.

811
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:06,559
Speaker 0: People who actually like DC really don't like Teen Titans and everyone else likes it.

812
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:11,520
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah, it's there's a lot of things that Gravity Falls is better than.

813
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:16,882
Speaker 1: And that's why, even though it's not like, oh, my God, the greatest thing ever, you have.

814
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:19,440
Speaker 1: you're done watching like Adventure Time and a few other things.

815
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,863
Speaker 1: It's like.

816
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:20,166
Speaker 1: this is the.

817
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,500
Speaker 1: this is the next thing on list.

818
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:25,880
Speaker 0: It's a good show to watch, like while you're eating dinner, like watch an episode while you're doing stuff when you get home.

819
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,820
Speaker 1: Like, well, I think I'll sort of write because it's it's got so much going on.

820
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,820
Speaker 1: I think you really got to pay attention to it closely.

821
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,023
Speaker 0: I mean, like eating dinner, not like playing a game or doing something else, like distracting.

822
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:41,659
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm one of those weirdos who always gives everything I'm watching full attention if I'm actually going to watch something.

823
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,384
Speaker 0: I the only splitting attention I'll do these days is I will watch some things while I'm eating dinner.

824
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:50,139
Speaker 0: But those are things like Last Week Tonight or The Daily Show.

825
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,350
Speaker 1: Pretty much running, man.

826
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:51,898
Speaker 1: That's about it.

827
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

828
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:55,900
Speaker 0: Or like a Simpsons episode, which Simpsons is pretty good lately.

829
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,780
Speaker 1: I haven't watched the Simpsons episode.

830
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,280
Speaker 0: I've been watching a lot of old Simpsons.

831
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,740
Speaker 1: I can't even remember the last time I watched the Simpsons.

832
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:02,767
Speaker 0: Some recent ones.

833
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:04,700
Speaker 0: Pretty good, actually.

834
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:05,749
Speaker 1: Anyway.

835
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:06,220
Speaker 0: Anyway.

836
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:15,002
Speaker 0: But Gravity Falls is I don't want to even compare it because there's some kid shows like The Amazing World of Gumball that are mostly comedy and they're kind of a separate space.

837
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:17,168
Speaker 0: Gravity Falls is in that space of.

838
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:26,660
Speaker 0: it's a kid show that has a plot and continuity and has serious moments and a serious story that resolves itself in a serious way.

839
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,324
Speaker 1: You know what I think?

840
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:29,260
Speaker 1: I think it's at the same level as Bravest Warriors.

841
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,920
Speaker 1: That's a level.

842
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:30,983
Speaker 0: Hmm.

843
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,280
Speaker 0: So I like Bravest Warriors.

844
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,459
Speaker 1: And it's real similar to Bravest Warriors in a lot of ways, too.

845
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,480
Speaker 0: A lot more than I like Gravity Falls.

846
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,420
Speaker 0: But I don't think I can disagree with you saying that they're similar, like average quality.

847
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,080
Speaker 1: But I mean, even the plots of similar kind of things going on, right?

848
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:57,800
Speaker 1: Even though Gravity Falls is more of a present day and deals more fantasy aesthetic and Bravest Warriors as a future space aesthetic, it's more unicorns and shit.

849
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, magical realism is like the real world.

850
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,760
Speaker 0: And then wait, wait, wait.

851
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,660
Speaker 1: I mean, there are aliens and stuff in Bigfoot.

852
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:04,861
Speaker 1: Right.

853
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:08,980
Speaker 1: But well, that's still a situation of in Bravest Warriors.

854
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:09,342
Speaker 1: Right.

855
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:11,520
Speaker 1: It's this mystery of like, oh, what's going on?

856
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,060
Speaker 1: There's this emotion lord guy and weird shit.

857
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,382
Speaker 1: Right.

858
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:15,659
Speaker 1: And Gravity Falls like, oh, this town.

859
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,430
Speaker 1: Weird shit.

860
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:16,900
Speaker 1: Right.

861
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:25,742
Speaker 0: What's interesting is if you watch season one until like they have the mystery of the book, but they don't really push it like it's like X-Files, like it starts with like there's a mystery.

862
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:34,140
Speaker 1: And then for most of the Gravity Falls has a I think a too high proportion of a Nami episodes that don't deal with the plot of the book.

863
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,622
Speaker 1: Yes.

864
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:39,120
Speaker 0: Most of season one is entirely forgettable, like they're OK episodes.

865
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,596
Speaker 1: But like if you even want even late near the end of the show, there was one episode that was oh, which one was the one?

866
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:47,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, the DMD one.

867
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:47,984
Speaker 1: Oh, screw that.

868
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:49,292
Speaker 0: DMD episode was really.

869
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:50,580
Speaker 1: that was a bad episode.

870
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,580
Speaker 0: You can tell when a show that might be the worst episode in the show, the DMD one, because it does that thing of, hey, let's spoof a genre.

871
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,620
Speaker 0: And clearly did not know anything about that genre at all.

872
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,078
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean, clearly the people who, you know, had played D&D.

873
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,100
Speaker 1: But the point is that Dexter's Lab already did the D&D episode.

874
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:11,280
Speaker 1: So there's no reason for anyone else to ever attempt to do that again.

875
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,385
Speaker 1: You're only going to do worse than that, because that is like one of the best episodes of Dexter's Lab.

876
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:18,020
Speaker 1: That says a lot about Dexter's Lab versus Gravity Falls.

877
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,940
Speaker 1: Not that those are related to each other.

878
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:22,190
Speaker 0: Dexter's Lab is more against.

879
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:31,960
Speaker 1: the D&D episode of Dexter's Lab is one of the best episodes of Dexter's Lab, except for maybe like Action Hank and Omelette du Fromage and yeah, the high concept one.

880
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,481
Speaker 1: Right.

881
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:38,680
Speaker 1: But the D&D episode of Gravity Falls is like the worst episode of Gravity Falls.

882
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,380
Speaker 0: But if like when season one, until Bill showed up, I was getting a little bored.

883
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:46,980
Speaker 0: And I was like, if I missed an episode, I wouldn't have noticed.

884
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,520
Speaker 1: I think, well, because the the one thing in Gravity Falls is they have many plot lines.

885
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:52,822
Speaker 1: Right.

886
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:55,460
Speaker 1: Every character has like a plot that's got to resolve.

887
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,789
Speaker 0: Well, every character has their arc.

888
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,120
Speaker 0: That's obviously going forward.

889
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:01,000
Speaker 0: That got incrementally pushed in some episodes, but not others.

890
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:01,422
Speaker 0: Right.

891
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:04,379
Speaker 0: There was the overall plot of the book and what's going on with that.

892
00:46:05,122 --> 00:46:07,700
Speaker 0: And then there was the local mystery of that episode.

893
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:08,182
Speaker 0: Yes.

894
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,880
Speaker 1: But the thing is, it's some of these plot lines are really interesting and cool.

895
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,679
Speaker 1: And some of the characters and some are not.

896
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,041
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:19,340
Speaker 1: So the whole like Wendy Dipper thing is like it's there for the whole fucking show.

898
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,759
Speaker 1: And it gets way more attention than it deserves because it's one of the plot lines that are like the not good one.

899
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am so uninterested.

900
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:35,560
Speaker 0: And I think the audience of the show is, too, in that typical trope of the protagonist guy really likes this girl and a bunch of teen bullshit happens.

901
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:40,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, there should have been way more Stan, replace all that with more Stan stuff.

902
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,580
Speaker 0: But to their credit, they took that.

903
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,200
Speaker 0: And then when they started getting serious, they basically just stabbed that relationship to death and had a.

904
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,040
Speaker 1: But they still kept, you know, the existence of that plot line didn't leave.

905
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,678
Speaker 1: Even in the final episode, they kept, you know, giving it some that.

906
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,891
Speaker 0: No, they resolved it.

907
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:58,460
Speaker 0: It was friendship.

908
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,081
Speaker 1: Sure.

909
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:09,180
Speaker 0: But they still kept, you know, it was more that there were too many episodes that had a primary driver of Dipper wants to get with this girl and does stupid crap because of it.

910
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:09,601
Speaker 1: Yep.

911
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:15,560
Speaker 0: And actually, no, if I was to say the worst episode of the show, it's the one where Dipper tries to pick up girls.

912
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:16,743
Speaker 1: That's a bad one.

913
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:24,200
Speaker 1: That's probably the worst one, because the problem is that episode is saved by all the other stuff that goes on and all the day where they're pranking all the different.

914
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is that concept is great.

915
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,320
Speaker 1: And I wish they would have given that more screen time.

916
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,499
Speaker 0: I like how the pranks were all just crimes.

917
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,740
Speaker 1: Well, like, yeah, well, like he said he was basically going to turn the mountain upside down.

918
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,007
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, man, let's see.

919
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,260
Speaker 1: And he didn't really, you know, do much.

920
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,062
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, come on.

921
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:49,300
Speaker 0: But in that episode, the moral of it was basically if you're a guy and you ever talk to a girl in any friendly way, you're clearly trying to date her and she'll give you her phone number if you're confident.

922
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,540
Speaker 0: But then if you talk to a second girl ever, you're cheating.

923
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, that episode just was not missed the mark.

924
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,523
Speaker 0: It's like the.

925
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:59,640
Speaker 0: it's like the episode of My Little Pony in season one where the moral was basically a leap of faith.

926
00:47:59,840 --> 00:47:59,982
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

927
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,680
Speaker 1: Gravity Falls is not as good as My Little Pony.

928
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:04,620
Speaker 1: And actually, I get there's a parallel between these two shows.

929
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:13,120
Speaker 1: And that parallel is the parallel between Diamond Tiara and Principia, whatever her name is, lives in the castle.

930
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,520
Speaker 0: Both had plots that resolved similarly.

931
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:17,187
Speaker 0: Right.

932
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,355
Speaker 1: The same exact character.

933
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,160
Speaker 1: Right.

934
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,823
Speaker 1: Basically.

935
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:20,206
Speaker 0: Yeah.

936
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:22,260
Speaker 0: Pretty sure her and Dipper eventually date.

937
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:23,568
Speaker 0: That's my guess.

938
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:24,959
Speaker 0: They set that up nicely.

939
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:32,580
Speaker 1: You know, if you're wondering about the show, the point the point I wanted to make about that, though, is that the girl in Gravity Falls, whatever her name is.

940
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,241
Speaker 1: Right.

941
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:33,963
Speaker 1: It's like.

942
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:41,239
Speaker 1: it seems like when she resolves you, she actually like goes from like, you know, the start, which is I hate you die to.

943
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:43,437
Speaker 1: Are you actually like you now?

944
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:43,680
Speaker 0: Yeah.

945
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,629
Speaker 0: You're awesome character.

946
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:45,598
Speaker 1: Diamond Tiara resolves.

947
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,031
Speaker 1: And it's like you're still a bitch.

948
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:47,698
Speaker 1: I hate you.

949
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,431
Speaker 0: Diamond Tiara did OK, though.

950
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,540
Speaker 1: I still hate Diamond Tiara.

951
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,693
Speaker 0: Her parents made her that way.

952
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:52,119
Speaker 0: Yeah.

953
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,760
Speaker 1: Also, she can still dine to fire.

954
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,773
Speaker 0: Her fucking cutie mark made her the way she is.

955
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:57,879
Speaker 0: Can't escape that.

956
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,029
Speaker 1: She can still dine to fire.

957
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:00,139
Speaker 1: Get her out of here.

958
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,400
Speaker 1: If she's she's on screen, I don't want her to be on screen.

959
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,699
Speaker 1: If the other girl's on screen, I'm like, yeah, all right.

960
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,340
Speaker 0: We got to wear that llama sweater.

961
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:15,840
Speaker 0: I'd rather have had an episode where maybe her toadies should have betrayed her in some epic Nanami style fashion.

962
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,082
Speaker 1: Maybe.

963
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:18,245
Speaker 0: But anyway, so.

964
00:49:18,866 --> 00:49:24,220
Speaker 0: but Gravity Falls just was OK until Bill came and they started following the plot.

965
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,620
Speaker 0: It's like the opposite of the X-Files.

966
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,920
Speaker 0: The X-Files was only good when it was Monster of the Week.

967
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:30,620
Speaker 0: And then when they started actually following the plot, it was stupid.

968
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,808
Speaker 1: Well, the other problem with X-Files is that they didn't.

969
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,980
Speaker 1: they kept when they followed the plot, they didn't really follow it.

970
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,014
Speaker 1: They just said, oh, remember, there's a plot that's.

971
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:40,160
Speaker 1: that's not stopping.

972
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:48,780
Speaker 1: And we're never actually going to reveal that moment where anything about it, when Scully just finds a UFO, that's the last episode of X-Files I ever watched.

973
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,920
Speaker 1: The second last episode X-Files ever watched because I was like, oh, my God, they found a UFO just like on the beach.

974
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,180
Speaker 1: It's got like runes on it or something.

975
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,860
Speaker 0: Part of it like flies across the room and hits the Bible and points at something.

976
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,301
Speaker 1: Right.

977
00:49:59,321 --> 00:49:59,643
Speaker 1: It's like.

978
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:01,937
Speaker 1: it's like literally like you found the shit like.

979
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:02,480
Speaker 1: here it is.

980
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,445
Speaker 1: I'm standing next to it.

981
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:06,120
Speaker 1: And the next episode was like something completely unrelated.

982
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,300
Speaker 0: And she's like, I don't think anything supernatural is going on here, Mulder.

983
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,460
Speaker 1: And then they never go back to that ever.

984
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:19,500
Speaker 1: And I don't think it like I didn't watch all X-Files, but it's like Gravity Falls takes the plot to the end.

985
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,901
Speaker 1: Yep.

986
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:25,340
Speaker 1: It's like imagine if X-Files finds the UFO and then they go in it and Gravity Falls, they find the UFO and they go in it literally.

987
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,464
Speaker 0: Only warning, guys.

988
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:29,100
Speaker 0: I'm just going to spoil the shit out of the show because it's also final thoughts.

989
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,358
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about what actually happened.

990
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,300
Speaker 1: There's not that much to spoil.

991
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,140
Speaker 0: But I'm assuming you have seen the entire show at this point.

992
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,960
Speaker 0: If you haven't, stop or we're just going to ruin everything.

993
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:39,160
Speaker 1: It's not going to be ruined if you actually enjoy it more.

994
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:41,660
Speaker 1: If you believe what I say and that spoilers don't spoil things.

995
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,082
Speaker 0: I'll do it.

996
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:44,099
Speaker 0: I'll do a counterpoint to that on the Patreon.

997
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,926
Speaker 0: All right.

998
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:45,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.

999
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:50,440
Speaker 0: So the I actually was wrong about the six finger thing for most of the show.

1000
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:54,933
Speaker 0: I thought they were setting up that it was like aliens or wizards or something like like.

1001
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:57,300
Speaker 0: it was something more supernatural.

1002
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:01,040
Speaker 0: And the fact that it literally just was his brother next to her finger was really cool.

1003
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:02,314
Speaker 0: Actually, I like that.

1004
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:02,739
Speaker 0: That's OK.

1005
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,863
Speaker 0: I like that.

1006
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:08,760
Speaker 1: it ended up that I thought the author was just like some long dead person related to the town or something.

1007
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't really think too hard about it.

1008
00:51:10,721 --> 00:51:21,380
Speaker 0: And I also kind of enjoyed how the like the story ended up being simpler than I'd expected in a lot of ways, like what he was trying to do to get his brother back.

1009
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,340
Speaker 0: Like it was all actually pretty straightforward.

1010
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, until the until the only thing that was a mystery then was what does Bill want?

1011
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,280
Speaker 0: Like what's his actual motivation?

1012
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:42,300
Speaker 0: And I like how his motivation was, let's just be like all those background ghosts in the Ghostbusters, pretty much like he was dangerous and scary.

1013
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:43,600
Speaker 0: And I really like that.

1014
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,780
Speaker 0: And I was also I did not expect them to in a show where the second season at the same opener is the first season.

1015
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:54,659
Speaker 0: I enjoyed how suddenly the opener is different and the whole show is just 100 percent different all the way to the end.

1016
00:51:55,921 --> 00:51:58,594
Speaker 0: Not many kids shows, not many shows do that.

1017
00:51:58,614 --> 00:51:58,996
Speaker 0: many episodes.

1018
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:00,880
Speaker 1: They could put in the extra effort.

1019
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,340
Speaker 1: Remember, they put the extra effort to put like the secret codes at the end of all the episodes and even in the episodes.

1020
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,337
Speaker 1: And you can read it.

1021
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,679
Speaker 1: Don't bother trying to decode them.

1022
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,479
Speaker 1: You can just read them all on the wiki.

1023
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,380
Speaker 1: I was looking at about five minutes.

1024
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:12,540
Speaker 0: I was looking around.

1025
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,859
Speaker 1: There's nothing really interesting in there.

1026
00:52:14,304 --> 00:52:15,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just drink your Ovaltine.

1027
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:15,780
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1028
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,860
Speaker 0: But when I was looking for that, I did find something interesting.

1029
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,391
Speaker 0: The fandom of the show, surprisingly, like it's not surprisingly heavily.

1030
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:26,020
Speaker 0: ships, Princess, Princess, what's-her-face and Mabel, not Dipper.

1031
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:27,340
Speaker 1: Wait, Princess.

1032
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:28,100
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

1033
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:28,349
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1034
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:30,440
Speaker 0: That's like the number one ship.

1035
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,159
Speaker 1: Are you going to ship Applejack and Diamond Tiara, too?

1036
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:34,780
Speaker 1: No, because Applejack.

1037
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,440
Speaker 0: I was about to say, Scott, one of them is an adult.

1038
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,915
Speaker 0: That's fucked up.

1039
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,280
Speaker 1: Apple Bloom.

1040
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,700
Speaker 1: I haven't watched the show in a while.

1041
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:43,480
Speaker 1: That is- It's not pony season.

1042
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:45,480
Speaker 1: Apple Bloom, right?

1043
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:45,838
Speaker 1: Yes.

1044
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,289
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1045
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,632
Speaker 1: Yes.

1046
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:47,312
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1047
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:48,077
Speaker 1: You're not doing that.

1048
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
Speaker 1: No, but actually- That's the same thing.

1049
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:56,740
Speaker 0: Ah, but I think that's a little- That could be more rationalizing Gravity Falls than your synthetic example from My Little Pony.

1050
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:05,160
Speaker 0: Because the Princess, Princess girl is kind of weirdly obsessed with Mabel in a way that none of those ponies are really in Pony.

1051
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,196
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1052
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:10,739
Speaker 0: So, the end was kind of a cop out.

1053
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:24,940
Speaker 0: I mean, it was a kid's show, so I guess, sure, you got to have the happy ending, but even in a kid's show, I feel like it's not the greatest idea to have a sacrifice that resolves the plot.

1054
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:28,219
Speaker 0: And then, within five minutes, undo that sacrifice.

1055
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,780
Speaker 1: That's what bothered me about it the most, was not that it did it, because it's sort of obvious, like, oh yeah, you know, they're just, right?

1056
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,700
Speaker 1: It was that they basically got his memory back within like a minute.

1057
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,799
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, uh, shouldn't that take more time?

1058
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:44,140
Speaker 0: If I were them, I would have done the show slightly differently.

1059
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:53,059
Speaker 0: The entire show would be 100% the same, except the two episodes they get rid of that we talked about, but in that moment, like, he'd wake up and there's a scene where, like, they're trying to make him remember and he doesn't.

1060
00:53:53,861 --> 00:54:05,399
Speaker 0: I would have then cut to, like, the forward flashbacks or whatever, and the last scene of the show would have just been, like, forwarding him off on the boat doing their thing, and he's suddenly like, "Something, something,

1061
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:05,599
Speaker 0: Seuss!".

1062
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:08,196
Speaker 0: And then, he's like, "Wait, who's

1063
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:08,519
Speaker 0: Seuss?".

1064
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,620
Speaker 0: And he's like, it's like, hint that he's starting to remember and leave it at that.

1065
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,397
Speaker 0: But no, they literally had the, "Come on,

1066
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:15,800
Speaker 0: remember!".

1067
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,069
Speaker 0: He's like, "Okay, I remember everything.

1068
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:17,997
Speaker 0: It's

1069
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:18,218
Speaker 0: over.".

1070
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it only took a minute.

1071
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:32,820
Speaker 1: It would have been cool, though, maybe, like, if you want to do the memory-losing thing, you could have done it earlier and then had some episodes, you know, in between, like, dark times where he doesn't remember and they're dealing with that, and then it comes back later.

1072
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:33,519
Speaker 1: That would have been okay.

1073
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:38,519
Speaker 1: Or you could have just had him beat the bad guy without making a sacrifice, just like, "Aha, we got

1074
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:38,680
Speaker 1: you!".

1075
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:40,319
Speaker 1: Just make something up, and then that's fine.

1076
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, but victory without sacrifice is often also a boring story.

1077
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,040
Speaker 1: You could have made a different sacrifice that you wouldn't have had to undo.

1078
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:49,920
Speaker 0: They could have killed, like, Mabel or something, just let the internet go crazy.

1079
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:59,660
Speaker 1: No, you don't have to do something like that, but you could have, you know, I mean, you could have killed a less important character, but you also could have just, like, lose an arm, lose a leg.

1080
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,436
Speaker 0: You know what I expected?

1081
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,874
Speaker 1: You could have also lost a non-person, right?

1082
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:03,880
Speaker 1: You could have lost the shack.

1083
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:05,500
Speaker 0: I expected...

1084
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,000
Speaker 1: Right, the shack explodes, even though I really like the Seuss Gets the Shack, I like that part.

1085
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:14,139
Speaker 0: I expected that maybe if they'd fixed everything, the sacrifice would have been, "None of them would remember all the weird

1086
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:14,420
Speaker 0: stuff.".

1087
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,080
Speaker 1: Maybe, they could have lost the whole town.

1088
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but instead, notice how the end was basically, "This town is now literally Springfield,".

1089
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:24,757
Speaker 0: because they're like, "Let us all never talk about it again.

1090
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:26,360
Speaker 0: Let's just not talk about

1091
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:26,420
Speaker 0: it.".

1092
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:29,680
Speaker 1: So there's one plot hole in the show that I'm trying to figure out, right?

1093
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:30,240
Speaker 0: What's your plot hole?

1094
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,020
Speaker 1: So it's not the biggest plot hole in the world, but it is slightly questionable, right?

1095
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,900
Speaker 1: So their parents send them to this town to live with their uncle, right?

1096
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:50,358
Speaker 1: But if you notice, when he leaves home, presumably, I guess it's the kids' grandparents, because he's great Uncle Stan.

1097
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:51,400
Speaker 1: He's not regular Uncle Stan.

1098
00:55:51,920 --> 00:56:02,180
Speaker 1: So his sister, who's only shown in the show as a tiny baby for a frame or two, is Mabel and Dipper's grandma, right?

1099
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:02,657
Speaker 0: I guess.

1100
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:10,356
Speaker 1: So her children are Dipper and Mabel's parents, right?

1101
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:11,740
Speaker 1: You never see their parents.

1102
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:20,676
Speaker 1: But Stan left home and never went back home, so he didn't even know Mabel and Dipper's grandma, his sister.

1103
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:21,397
Speaker 1: He didn't even know her.

1104
00:56:21,637 --> 00:56:22,900
Speaker 1: He never met her his whole life.

1105
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:26,279
Speaker 0: I guess they must have just un-estranged at some point.

1106
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:28,185
Speaker 1: They didn't show it in the show.

1107
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:30,634
Speaker 1: In fact, it's highly suggested.

1108
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,400
Speaker 1: he never went home ever, right?

1109
00:56:32,701 --> 00:56:34,587
Speaker 1: So he was estranged from that person.

1110
00:56:34,888 --> 00:56:38,440
Speaker 1: How did he even know Mabel and Dipper's parents, right?

1111
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:44,340
Speaker 1: And how did Mabel and Dipper's parents know to send him there?

1112
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,980
Speaker 0: Maybe Dipper and Mabel's parents died in a horrific accident.

1113
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,839
Speaker 0: The kids are, like, in denial, like they can't believe it.

1114
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,780
Speaker 0: And the state tracked down their nearest living relative and just fucking shipped him there.

1115
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:01,760
Speaker 1: But they had to go back home to California when the summer's over.

1116
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,100
Speaker 0: Rarely until they got a foster home because he was clearly unfit to raise them.

1117
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,339
Speaker 1: Anyway, you're really going on a limb.

1118
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:08,560
Speaker 0: I don't think that's that much of a limb.

1119
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,420
Speaker 1: So anyway, especially since they say in the show, "Oh yeah, there's so much and such as kids," right?

1120
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,749
Speaker 1: It's like, right?

1121
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, and they mention their parents.

1122
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:20,589
Speaker 0: Maybe they're going through a messy divorce.

1123
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,577
Speaker 0: They tracked him down, like, "Look, take care of the kids.

1124
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,679
Speaker 0: We gotta sort our shit

1125
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:24,880
Speaker 0: out.".

1126
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,423
Speaker 1: They're on summer break.

1127
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,660
Speaker 1: Okay, so then here's the other less-but-still-existing plot hole, right?

1128
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:34,280
Speaker 1: So their parents send them to live with their great-uncle, who they thought was the different great-uncle, but that doesn't really matter that much, right?

1129
00:57:36,022 --> 00:57:38,560
Speaker 1: For the summer, and they would come back home when the summer was over.

1130
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:41,685
Speaker 1: It's at the end of the show.

1131
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:45,740
Speaker 1: It's highly assumed next summer they're gonna go back to Gravity Falls, like it's their summer camp.

1132
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,339
Speaker 1: But their uncle don't live there no more.

1133
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:54,420
Speaker 1: Are they gonna send them to live with Seuss, this guy their parents don't even know, to live for the summer, right?

1134
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,749
Speaker 1: That doesn't make any fucking sense at all.

1135
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,497
Speaker 1: They're not gonna go on the boat in the summer, right?

1136
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,679
Speaker 1: So if they go back to Gravity Falls in the summer, sure, they have a ton of friends there and people they could live with.

1137
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,060
Speaker 1: But are our parents really gonna send them to live with these complete strangers?

1138
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,523
Speaker 1: Some people they knew.

1139
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:12,995
Speaker 1: When you go somewhere for the summer, you're only there for eight to twelve weeks.

1140
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:14,460
Speaker 1: Tops, right?

1141
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,193
Speaker 1: That's how long they know these people.

1142
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:16,959
Speaker 1: Eight to twelve weeks.

1143
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,278
Speaker 0: They're smart enough to just lie and be like, "Yeah, we're gonna go back to Grunkle Stan's

1144
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:21,620
Speaker 0: house.".

1145
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:23,373
Speaker 1: And their parents are gonna call Grunkle Stan.

1146
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,239
Speaker 1: He's not gonna be there.

1147
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,960
Speaker 0: Their parents did not call at any point in the entire show to find out.

1148
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,164
Speaker 1: That's also fucked up.

1149
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:34,340
Speaker 1: That is also something that was on my mind the whole time, is they have telephones.

1150
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,153
Speaker 0: That's why I think there's some merit.

1151
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:37,140
Speaker 0: It's not that much of a limb.

1152
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:49,080
Speaker 1: There is something, that is the strange thing that is going on, is like, not the fact that like they don't, the parents are out of the picture, you know, which happens in a lot of shows, but like, what, how was this arranged to begin with?

1153
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,160
Speaker 0: So that's why I'm suspecting, like them being dead is a stretch.

1154
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,371
Speaker 1: Your explanation is really off on a limb.

1155
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,200
Speaker 1: There's gotta be a more reasonable explanation.

1156
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, them being dead is a stretch.

1157
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:02,540
Speaker 0: Home problems, or them not being great people, much more reasonable.

1158
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:10,320
Speaker 1: How do they even know Grunkle Stan, this person who's estranged from their family and never met their grandma, the only person who they would have met in their family?

1159
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:11,054
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1160
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,780
Speaker 1: It makes no sense.

1161
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,779
Speaker 0: Gotta think about this.

1162
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,979
Speaker 1: That's the part that makes no sense.

1163
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,740
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the show brought back the giant Time Baby, and then that Time Baby got wrecked.

1164
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:27,600
Speaker 1: I know, the Time Baby came back, so first of all, in one of the codes, it says Time Baby's like, gonna reconstitute himself, it's gonna take a long time, so he's not dead.

1165
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:30,240
Speaker 1: And he's gonna be pissed when he comes back.

1166
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:38,199
Speaker 1: Also, when the Time Guy came back, and the Time Baby came back, I remembered, oh right, they existed, I knew those characters, I recognized them.

1167
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:48,300
Speaker 1: I didn't remember any of the episodes they were in, so I looked on the wiki, Time Guy, who's named, his name is like, I forget what his- Jason Alexander?

1168
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:55,760
Speaker 1: No, the Time Guy, his name is basically like, it suggests that he's a background, like, not noticed person or something.

1169
00:59:57,001 --> 01:00:04,279
Speaker 1: And Time Baby, like, they were in a bunch of episodes, not just like one, they were in a few, and I totally forgot anything that happened in those episodes.

1170
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,140
Speaker 0: You know, you really don't, oh well, Blendin Blandin.

1171
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, Blendin, that's his name, he blends in.

1172
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,259
Speaker 0: He just, he reminded me of a George Costanza.

1173
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:13,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda.

1174
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,919
Speaker 0: He's kinda just a shitty, vindictive person.

1175
01:00:16,342 --> 01:00:24,340
Speaker 0: Though, to be fair, he was right, Dipper and Mabel were just little shits, they got him in trouble, and that Time Baby future is not a great future.

1176
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:24,693
Speaker 1: Nope.

1177
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,800
Speaker 0: That's a terrible future.

1178
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,560
Speaker 0: The world ends in a terrible future, regardless of what they did.

1179
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,097
Speaker 1: The town ends, the world doesn't end.

1180
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,120
Speaker 0: Time Baby shit happens in the future.

1181
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:34,979
Speaker 1: Oh right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1182
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,780
Speaker 0: Time Baby happens, the world is fucked, nothing they did matters, because the Time Baby future is terrible.

1183
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,377
Speaker 0: That's right.

1184
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:46,680
Speaker 0: So yeah, I guess if they do another show, they could be like the War Against Time Baby.

1185
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:50,840
Speaker 1: So what episodes did you like the most?

1186
01:00:52,501 --> 01:01:09,178
Speaker 0: Honestly, I really enjoyed the episodes inside Mabel's head, like that whole crazy side story of them trying to assemble the team, and I enjoyed the first couple episodes of When Mad Max Happened, because it's rare that a show will take such a hard swerve in tone.

1187
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:20,440
Speaker 1: See, it was the swerve where it comes to the portal, I actually liked more the swerve where they were dealing with the stone cutters in the town, and McGucket, that earlier part there.

1188
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,714
Speaker 0: The mystery had so much potential, you're like, "Whoa, what's going on?

1189
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:24,659
Speaker 1: What's the

1190
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:24,960
Speaker 1: story?".

1191
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,279
Speaker 1: It was almost like a hot fuzz with the people in the town, no.

1192
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,340
Speaker 1: And that part was way more interesting than the other, right?

1193
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,940
Speaker 1: And there were some of the side episodes that didn't have plot, I still liked.

1194
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,135
Speaker 1: So I liked the one with the Love God.

1195
01:01:38,176 --> 01:01:39,939
Speaker 1: for some reason, Love God character was just really...

1196
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 0: I also enjoyed the Love God, I liked the Multi-Bear.

1197
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:43,159
Speaker 1: Multi-Bear was okay.

1198
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,860
Speaker 0: I think someone is obsessed with the Multi-Bear.

1199
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,879
Speaker 1: The Unicorn episode, which actually was a plot episode, I liked the unicorns.

1200
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:56,717
Speaker 0: I thought that episode was going a certain way until the reveal of, "No, that unicorn's just an asshole, for

1201
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:57,018
Speaker 0: real.".

1202
01:01:57,867 --> 01:01:58,777
Speaker 1: I liked the unicorns.

1203
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:02,200
Speaker 1: The Street Fighter one, not so much.

1204
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,600
Speaker 1: I mean, it sort of felt pandery, but maybe that's just because I'm a nerd.

1205
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:08,780
Speaker 0: The one where Mabel has the boy band.

1206
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:09,539
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

1207
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,000
Speaker 0: That might be my favorite regular episode of the show.

1208
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:23,160
Speaker 1: Oh, and I can't be neglected to mention one of the biggest characters in the show, which is the stupid kid who's all southern cowboy hick, whatever his name is.

1209
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:25,116
Speaker 1: The bad guy.

1210
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gideon.

1211
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,920
Speaker 1: He's just mad annoying.

1212
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:30,420
Speaker 0: That's the point.

1213
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,320
Speaker 0: He's basically... There's some Eric Hartman buried inside of his genteel.

1214
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1215
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,120
Speaker 1: He's Eric Hartman, for sure.

1216
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,493
Speaker 1: He's Eric Hartman plus the KKK.

1217
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:46,558
Speaker 1: Not that Eric Hartman isn't in the KKK, because he totally is, complaining about Jews all the time.

1218
01:02:50,022 --> 01:03:03,840
Speaker 0: But if I had to name my favorite weird character side thing, other than Giffany, which was pretty good, that whole bit, I enjoyed the demon that's just a head with an arm that's walking around trying to eat people.

1219
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:05,297
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a funny side bit.

1220
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:07,879
Speaker 0: Because that's a very Rick and Morty kind of monster.

1221
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:15,360
Speaker 0: And that also signifies the tone shift where the show really avoided talking about killing or death and was always very kid show friendly.

1222
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,760
Speaker 1: People got turned to stone.

1223
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:21,880
Speaker 0: Yup, but then at the end of the show, when the final swerve happened...

1224
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,440
Speaker 1: They killed the mayor.

1225
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:28,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, but remember that scene where Bill is like, "I think I'm just gonna kill one of

1226
01:03:29,078 --> 01:03:29,319
Speaker 0: them.".

1227
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:33,860
Speaker 0: And I think that might be the first point anyone referenced actual killing in the entire show.

1228
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:39,632
Speaker 0: That scene was really well done, because it shifted from kid show to, "Oh shit, now it's

1229
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:40,098
Speaker 0: serious.".

1230
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,420
Speaker 0: Eeny, meeny, miny, and that.

1231
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:54,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does feel a bit at times, even though it's obviously loaded with fantasy and magic, and your suspension of disbelief is in full effect when you see gnomes peeking rainbows.

1232
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, they make a lot of noise in places where they're trying to be quiet, and somehow no one notices.

1233
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:11,160
Speaker 1: Right, but stuff like, even towards the very end, they're shot out of the cannon of the robot arm, and then parachute into the thing, and it's like they're falling great distances off the bridge and then land.

1234
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:17,334
Speaker 1: It's hard to believe when they use a non-magical thing.

1235
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:19,460
Speaker 1: that's ridiculous, right?

1236
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:25,439
Speaker 0: Well, especially because that did not happen in the earlier episodes of the show, and it happened more and more as the show went on.

1237
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,539
Speaker 1: Right, if you're using shrink rays and stuff, it's kind of like, "I can deal with

1238
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:29,680
Speaker 1: that.".

1239
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:33,800
Speaker 1: Then it really stands out when you use something non-magical, and it's still ridiculous.

1240
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,039
Speaker 1: You should have just used magic for the whole thing.

1241
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:42,860
Speaker 0: Some of those bits did bother me, but the only excuse I have is, Gravity Falls is in that weird bubble, so it just made the world more cartoony there.

1242
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,496
Speaker 1: Sure, maybe.

1243
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:51,319
Speaker 0: Or it could be like that crack show where they talk about the Simpsons, and they have a theory as to why the Simpsons town is the way it is.

1244
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,299
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good theory, but it could be a situation like that.

1245
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:59,400
Speaker 1: This could be how Springfield was actually- I gotta do some laundry before Anime Boston.

1246
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,020
Speaker 0: Yep, Gravity Falls is totally worth watching, but- It's not a waste of your time at all.

1247
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,560
Speaker 0: It's a kid's show, and it's good for a kid's show.

1248
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,840
Speaker 1: It's not world-changing, right?

1249
01:05:09,002 --> 01:05:09,958
Speaker 1: It's like 20 years from now.

1250
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:16,056
Speaker 1: It's like right now, it's probably near the top of your list, but 20 years from now, it'll just be like, "One of those shows you can watch,

1251
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:16,519
Speaker 1: whatev.".

1252
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,640
Speaker 0: Yep, I think things like Ponies, Adventure Time, Avatar, actually.

1253
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,460
Speaker 0: If you want to watch something next, that's a show to watch.

1254
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,879
Speaker 0: We could review each of the four seasons of it, even.

1255
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:26,939
Speaker 1: That's too many seasons.

1256
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:28,420
Speaker 0: It's worth it, Scott.

1257
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:34,078
Speaker 0: I'm going to say that Avatar as a whole is as good as Escaflowne.

1258
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:35,499
Speaker 0: All right.

1259
01:05:35,982 --> 01:05:36,538
Speaker 0: Straight up.

1260
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,360
Speaker 1: I just watched Evangelion again.

1261
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:38,959
Speaker 1: Watch that again.

1262
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,300
Speaker 0: Neither one's as good as Evangelion.

1263
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:41,639
Speaker 1: Evangelion is- Just watch it again.

1264
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,259
Speaker 1: We could talk about it a whole bunch more.

1265
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,340
Speaker 1: There's very little- We've talked about it, but why not talk about it some more?

1266
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,979
Speaker 0: I'll just do what we should do.

1267
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,779
Speaker 0: I'll watch it again.

1268
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,720
Speaker 1: Well, finish some with Tena.

1269
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,083
Speaker 1: We can do.

1270
01:05:50,103 --> 01:05:51,440
Speaker 1: Geek Dance Presents Evangelion.

1271
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,520
Speaker 0: Let's just do it.

1272
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,020
Speaker 0: Let's review.

1273
01:05:55,323 --> 01:06:01,699
Speaker 0: Let's talk about Evangelion again, and then go back and listen to the last time we talked about Evangelion and see if anything's changed.

1274
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:09,275
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, there has been things that have changed in that there were still things in Evangelion.

1275
01:06:09,315 --> 01:06:14,580
Speaker 1: I still didn't understand, but now after my ex watching, there's nothing in that show.

1276
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,220
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

1277
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:15,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1278
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,957
Speaker 0: It's like, "Why did Kaji have that

1279
01:06:16,997 --> 01:06:17,139
Speaker 0: thing?".

1280
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,980
Speaker 1: Well, duh, because- I know exactly what everything is at every moment in the show.

1281
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:21,351
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1282
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:29,360
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.

1290
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,270

1292
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,010
Speaker 0: So as many of you are wondering, we love Anime Boston.

1293
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:31,069
Speaker 0: It is our favorite anime convention, both to attend and to perform at, but basically this year, they didn't just automatically comp our badges, and we ended up buying badges just because we didn't want to deal with a hassle at the con, and they are going to reimburse us, but basically we don't attend any conventions that make us buy badges and then get reimbursed.

1294
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:50,189
Speaker 0: It's just partly a hassle thing, like we go to enough conventions already, and basically no conventions we've ever performed at have asked us ever to buy a badge, and then get reimbursed, but Anime Boston had never done that until this year, and it appears it was in fact just a clerical error, and everything's fine for next year, so have no fear.

1295
01:08:50,550 --> 01:09:12,676
Speaker 0: We will, assuming no date conflicts or anything weird happening, we will be returning to Anime Boston next year in 2017, and actually I'm kind of glad because we have a lot of anime content, and we really only go to one anime convention, so I guess the one interesting thing is that MAGFest sort of invited us to do our anime content there, so maybe

1296
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:13,180
Speaker 1: we'll make even

1297
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,209
Speaker 0: more anime content now.

1298
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,850
Speaker 0: But anyway, I leave you now with something kind of weird.

1299
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:27,786
Speaker 2: German chemists created it in 2010 with the help of the US Army in an effort to develop more energetic compounds, and their first report on the discovery.

1300
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:33,890
Speaker 2: they said, and I quote, "The sensitivity of C2N14 is beyond our capabilities of measurement.

1301
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:38,862
Speaker 2: Even the smallest possible loadings in shock and friction tests led to explosive

1302
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:39,729
Speaker 2: decomposition.".

1303
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:44,170
Speaker 2: To give you a list of how touchy this stuff is, here's a list of things that make ZYTOazide explode.

1304
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:57,750
Speaker 2: Moving it, touching it, dispersing it in solution, leaving it undisturbed on a glass plate, exposing it to bright light, exposing it to x-rays, putting it in a spectrometer, turning on the spectrometer, and my favorite, absolutely nothing.

1305
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:03,490
Speaker 2: They had it in a shockproof explosive case in a dark climate control room, and it blew up.

1306
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:11,270
Speaker 2: I think somebody said something mean about it somewhere, and it was like, the lead scientist on the team that synthesized it called it a very exciting discovery.
