1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,217
Speaker 1: It's Monday January 16th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:20,660
Speaker 1: tonight We start talking about how to build and maintain a website, but then we get off into a rant about myspace and live journal.

3
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,118
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:27,030
Speaker 1: So we spent the better part of Saturday test driving cars.

5
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:27,752
Speaker 0: Yep.

6
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,377
Speaker 0: I think I already discussed.

7
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,360
Speaker 0: I need a new car for work.

8
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:31,826
Speaker 0: Let's see what do we drive?

9
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:37,224
Speaker 1: We drove Mazda 3 Mazda 3 Mazda 6 Chevy Aveo.

10
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,235
Speaker 1: yeah, I never heard of the Chevy Aveo before.

11
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:44,496
Speaker 1: we saw it and I Got a lot near us, and we went over and drove it and we saw this Chevy.

12
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,480
Speaker 0: We drove the Chevy Cobalt.

13
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,527
Speaker 1: That's the worst car ever.

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:47,614
Speaker 0: that's not the worst car.

15
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:48,380
Speaker 0: It was pretty terrible.

16
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:49,645
Speaker 1: It's pretty pissed for.

17
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:55,711
Speaker 0: but the more and more I look around at cars The more and more the Mazda 3 looks like the car to get.

18
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,780
Speaker 0: I just know.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,064
Speaker 0: Telescoping steering wheel.

20
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:02,933
Speaker 0: yeah, what can I say I mean?

21
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,117
Speaker 0: It's a little car.

22
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,080
Speaker 0: It's a hatchback.

23
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,168
Speaker 0: The price is right.

24
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:08,920
Speaker 0: It's got the right features.

25
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:11,925
Speaker 0: It's got the right everything You know.

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:12,467
Speaker 0: no other.

27
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:13,291
Speaker 0: every other car.

28
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:15,280
Speaker 0: I've looked at always has something about it.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,728
Speaker 0: That's not quite right.

30
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,779
Speaker 0: You know for what I need and what I want.

31
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:30,240
Speaker 1: So it'll be fun when we actually go into the dealers to purchase because many of you may not be aware, but we're assholes And When it comes to car dealers we pull no punches.

32
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:34,660
Speaker 0: I even feel kind of bad because the guy I talked to at the Mazda dealer would seem like this nice young guy.

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,640
Speaker 0: It was kind of cool whatever, but I'm just gonna go and be like all right.

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,256
Speaker 0: I might be an asshole to you, but if you don't stick around we'll get along better.

35
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:51,177
Speaker 1: so in the news Major.com is reporting something that most people who are familiar with designing websites know But this is a nice recent article that talks about it.

36
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:55,120
Speaker 1: Do you realize that most people when they see a website?

37
00:01:55,802 --> 00:02:04,760
Speaker 1: They judge whether or not that website is worth looking at in a fraction of a second based on the initial impression Whatever it looks like and nothing you do after that point really matters.

38
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:16,058
Speaker 0: I judge websites in a fraction of a second somewhat consciously and So I completely believe this study especially because nature is like a real scientific journal of realness.

39
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:29,600
Speaker 1: yep I mean basically the study they did is they take people and they'd show them a website for Less than a second and then they show a bunch of websites like this and ask them to rate each one based on various factors And then they use the same groups and different groups.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:38,710
Speaker 1: And they also had them set websites they could see for a whole second two seconds a minute a half hour Like various times basically no matter how much time you gave them.

41
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:53,519
Speaker 1: They always rated certain websites highly in certain websites lowly and basically all this comes down to is that if your website is poorly designed to The point that someone looking at it for a fraction of a second can't tell what it's about You've already lost the web game.

42
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:57,828
Speaker 0: Typography is important Readability clean design.

43
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,319
Speaker 0: don't put too much clutter all over the place.

44
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,596
Speaker 0: I mean come on no one has to tell you what a good website looks like.

45
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,500
Speaker 0: you go around the internet And you can tell just looking at sites.

46
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,413
Speaker 0: Hey, that looks like a real professional site that has useful stuff on it.

47
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,505
Speaker 0: Hey that looks like a crappy store I would never buy anything from.

48
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,640
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like come on and there's a nice quote here.

49
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 1: This is from the actual article these days and lightened web users who want to see a want to see a Puritan approach.

50
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,660
Speaker 1: It's about getting information across in the quickest simplest way possible.

51
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,591
Speaker 1: So I know a lot of people like to have very flashy sites.

52
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:39,219
Speaker 1: They like to have well flash Animated things and big logos, and you know what that doesn't work in the modern way.

53
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,209
Speaker 0: notice Google's number one and Google doesn't have any of that crap.

54
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,200
Speaker 0: if you're having all that crap you might think you're cool.

55
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,599
Speaker 0: That's just because you're not reading your own website because you made it.

56
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,587
Speaker 0: Now you want people to read your site.

57
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:54,980
Speaker 1: you got to be like Google, but of course we're talking about You know websites that are there to convey information.

58
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:02,126
Speaker 1: I mean if your website is in itself art or you're an artist or a webcomic dude or anything like that It doesn't apply as much.

59
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,240
Speaker 1: This is really two sites that are trying to provide information.

60
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:13,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're creating a website You know as art you know you can show it to people as you would show people a painting or a drawing or any other Art you know.

61
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,760
Speaker 0: or maybe like you're a photographer or something you have your little photo site.

62
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:26,894
Speaker 0: But if you're trying to give them information like say you know your resume or something You know that might not be the most effective way to use all kinds of fancy stuff.

63
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:33,766
Speaker 0: speaking of websites Someone did another Firefox Market share study.

64
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,520
Speaker 1: the results might be surprising mostly to people who don't use Firefox.

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:52,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is actually a real real research study of I can't tell it says X capital X lowercase I capital T lowercase I. I Don't know who they are, but they're supposedly like they're up.

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,920
Speaker 1: They're a research institute in France, and they're like all the research institutes in the US.

67
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:59,431
Speaker 1: They just happen to be in France and do things in French.

68
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:05,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, they monitor markets Okay, but anyway They're real reliable and trustworthy.

69
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,986
Speaker 0: and they made a little map of Europe And they also did the US.

70
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:12,136
Speaker 0: of what percent of web people use Firefox.

71
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:15,550
Speaker 1: as opposed to anything else It's up to 15% in the US and 20% in Europe.

72
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at some of these European countries.

73
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:25,347
Speaker 0: in Finland, which is the highest percent of usage that I see 38.4% of people use Firefox.

74
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,426
Speaker 0: That's a lot of people really.

75
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:34,899
Speaker 1: the only ones who are behind the curve are Ukraine the UK and Spain.

76
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,906
Speaker 1: Oh Italy Italy is not doing so great.

77
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:38,589
Speaker 0: Well.

78
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,076
Speaker 0: He's doing all right now.

79
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:43,024
Speaker 1: They're below the u.s Yeah, but u.s.

80
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:44,729
Speaker 0: Lithuania is not doing so good either.

81
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,394
Speaker 1: I find it interesting that the u.s.

82
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:50,425
Speaker 1: Is actually fairly low on Firefox Usage compared to Europe.

83
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:50,947
Speaker 1: hmm.

84
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:59,711
Speaker 1: I wonder why I mean are Europeans actually more web astute Or does this have to do with the fact that The internet isn't such a big deal in Europe.

85
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,700
Speaker 1: So the people who use it are people who know more about it already.

86
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:12,199
Speaker 0: It could be that I noticed that when you look in like open source communities like you be looking like Where gen 2 developers are from?

87
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,896
Speaker 0: It's like about half of them are from the US and about half of them are from Europe and that's a lot more percentage than you see in other web places.

88
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:25,660
Speaker 0: like if you go to like Like World of Warcraft you can't say half the players are in the US not the players here in Europe.

89
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:26,145
Speaker 0: You know it.

90
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,767
Speaker 0: there's a whole lot More US players than any other country.

91
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:34,603
Speaker 1: I mean even just technical documents and for open source software everything I see that's good.

92
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:35,907
Speaker 1: It always comes from Europe.

93
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,720
Speaker 1: mostly you know Nordic countries, but mostly Europe.

94
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, whenever you look at like forums You can always see like they have special European language sections like the German section of the forums and the French section of the forums.

95
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:54,780
Speaker 0: You only really see that when in the you know places where they're talking about computery stuff.

96
00:06:55,742 --> 00:07:02,108
Speaker 0: So maybe just as a whole lot of computer nerds in Europe that aren't over here But regardless I mean Firefox.

97
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:06,700
Speaker 1: back when it hit 10% a lot of naysayers were saying that yeah, you know what?

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,526
Speaker 1: It's gonna Peter out.

99
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,624
Speaker 1: It'll never get more than 10%.

100
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:14,427
Speaker 1: Well, it's already at 15% and it's been Not even a year since the 10% mark.

101
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,655
Speaker 1: so Firefox is on the rise.

102
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:20,860
Speaker 0: Oh Here's a pictures of all the different continents.

103
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,352
Speaker 0: So Europe is 20%.

104
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:24,420
Speaker 1: how's Antarctica doing?

105
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,585
Speaker 0: Zero zero.

106
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,080
Speaker 1: you're telling me that everyone who's actually in Antarctica with the computers use an IE.

107
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,308
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually have an article listed.

108
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,552
Speaker 1: What the hell.

109
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:46,151
Speaker 0: what kind of study is this, but here's something crazy Asia including Russia and such Africa 9.4% huh.

110
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:55,443
Speaker 0: South and Central America including Mexico is 5.79% and Oceania Not.

111
00:07:55,544 --> 00:08:02,109
Speaker 0: it doesn't look like includes Indonesia or the Philippines, but 18.6% in Australia.

112
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,098
Speaker 1: those numbers are actually kind of surprising and not what I expected.

113
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:09,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Apparently not everyone's even upgraded to one and a half.

114
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:13,370
Speaker 0: yet 61% of Firefox users are still using Firefox one.

115
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:14,614
Speaker 1: Honestly at work.

116
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,520
Speaker 1: I'm using one and all those me.

117
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:19,779
Speaker 1: I built 300 or so machines and they're using one.

118
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,477
Speaker 1: You know, well I have my reasons because I heavily modified the Zuul for certain reasons.

119
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:36,054
Speaker 1: in the ones I did at work the Zuul is the thing that controls how Firefox looks and works and They change the Zuul in 1.5 and I just haven't gotten around to rewriting it.

120
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:47,796
Speaker 0: It always Amazes me like when they upgrade Firefox how They actually change it in a way that I couldn't imagine but I still want really badly.

121
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:47,836
Speaker 0: I

122
00:08:49,120 --> 00:09:02,436
Speaker 1: Would just like to note that while Scott was talking there I witnessed something hilarious as he accidentally pulled the plug out of his laptop and then like Slid along the floor trying to reach out and plug it back in while maintaining the microphone in front of his face.

123
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:09,940
Speaker 0: It worked No, but like every time they upgrade Firefox, I'm like, what could they possibly add to make this better?

124
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:11,049
Speaker 0: What can they possibly do?

125
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:19,514
Speaker 0: and then up it's always better It's always better and it's so much better that I can't even like Like 1.0 was great when I had it and now I got 1.5 and 1.0 is crap.

126
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:22,079
Speaker 0: How did that happen?

127
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:42,280
Speaker 1: Like for anyone who hasn't upgraded one little example and this is something that existed in 1.0 But didn't really work and cause some problems, you know, sometimes a link opens in a new window or something stupid You can tell it with a nice little gooey to either Open links like that in new tabs or open them in the same window or whatever you want them to do

128
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:43,107
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

129
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:52,060
Speaker 1: That's actually really useful because a lot of sites are designed in the old web way and they have all their links to external sites Popping new windows which takes me off immeasurably.

130
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:55,889
Speaker 0: And a side note bug me not was fixed today.

131
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:56,772
Speaker 0: So it works again.

132
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,839
Speaker 0: So everyone update your bug me not.

133
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,632
Speaker 1: extension Oh bug me not for those of you don't know is fantastic.

134
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:07,440
Speaker 1: You know those sites like New York Times Washington Post and they want you to register.

135
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,439
Speaker 1: Well, uh, there used to be the convention slashed out two thousand slashed out two thousand worked on any site because people just set that up.

136
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,387
Speaker 1: but bug me bug me not.

137
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:21,347
Speaker 1: basically people sign up for accounts on these things and They give their account to the world.

138
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:28,319
Speaker 1: and if you use bug me not when you go to one of those sites It just automatically logs you in with a random account so you can see the content without having to say who you are.

139
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:33,453
Speaker 0: Yep, if you hate registering at all the news sites get the bug me not.

140
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:44,020
Speaker 0: extension for Firefox and all you do is when you Get to the site and it says login You right-click on the login box and say bug me not and it just logs you in and you see your article now.

141
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:47,560
Speaker 1: Surprisingly not all but a lot of pay websites.

142
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:53,560
Speaker 1: People actually put working user IDs into bug me not and you can often get a lot of content that cause money for free.

143
00:10:54,402 --> 00:11:02,219
Speaker 1: I'm not officially advocating that but it's something to poke into because I've discovered some interesting things that way Occasionally, it works well in porn sites.

144
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,242
Speaker 1: I'm just saying yeah, I know you're just saying I never.

145
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,830
Speaker 0: you know, honestly, I never actually tried to use it on a porn site.

146
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:15,214
Speaker 1: I'm sure yeah.

147
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, CYA.

148
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,743
Speaker 0: No, seriously, though.

149
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:18,687
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

150
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:19,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

151
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:31,319
Speaker 1: So More than once I've picked a thing of the day.

152
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,222
Speaker 1: That wasn't cool.

153
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:37,949
Speaker 1: It's just something that in some way pissed me off and This is one of the things that it's really a hot-button issue for me.

154
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:45,914
Speaker 1: But I brought this up partly because more than one person has asked me recently what I have against chiropractors everything.

155
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:57,818
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean, I'm very much anti flim-flam anti quackery and Despite anyone who says anything to the contrary, there's no evidence that Chiropractic provides any benefits whatsoever.

156
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:01,490
Speaker 1: In fact, there's only evidence that at best it's dangerous.

157
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,769
Speaker 0: Chiropractic is not doctor.

158
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:20,110
Speaker 1: It was made up a long time ago by a crazy quack Like literally this guy was just some crazy quack who believed in magnetic energy Holy magic quack healing and he started a school called chiropractic and he made a lot of money and then he died.

159
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:29,580
Speaker 1: and for some reason chiropractic still around and the fact that people believe it and study it or respect it in any way is mind-boggling to me.

160
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:38,372
Speaker 0: I mean There's a real problem in this country where there are doctors who can kind of heal you but not perfectly You know.

161
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:44,870
Speaker 0: because well no matter what we'll probably never able to heal people perfectly until we have a perfect understanding of biology.

162
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:54,446
Speaker 0: And that's the way it is, you know and a lot of times, you know people are hypochondriacs or people think there's something wrong with them and there isn't.

163
00:12:54,466 --> 00:13:04,257
Speaker 0: or You know the the only medicine we can have is horrible side effects or There's just no way to cure what you've got.

164
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:13,870
Speaker 1: and people in these cases, you know will turn to Chiropractor or someone who will tell them oh I can fix you do this magic thing and you'll be fine.

165
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll go to anyone who says that they can heal them in some way.

166
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:23,545
Speaker 0: crazy herbal medicines Crazy homeopathy medicines, but you know, none of these things are medicine.

167
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,030
Speaker 0: They're all just made up bullshit.

168
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,359
Speaker 0: You might as well go to the witch doctor who will wave a stick over you and say, you know, walla walla Washington You're healed.

169
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:46,105
Speaker 1: now There are a lot of ways I could prove to you or show you at least the specific reasons why I'm so adamantly opposed to chiropractic and Luckily the other day I ran across this video and it's a video of a lecture done by dr.

170
00:13:46,145 --> 00:13:47,950
Speaker 0: William Kin singer a real doctor.

171
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,988
Speaker 1: he's a real doctor is not a chiropractor.

172
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:59,336
Speaker 1: and basically, it's a nice concise summary of everything that's wrong with chiropractic and why you should Avoid them at all costs.

173
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:07,510
Speaker 1: and if you know anyone who is going to a chiropractor and you consider them a friend Show them this video or at least talk to them and try to convince them that it's not helping.

174
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:11,943
Speaker 1: Now a lot of people make the argument that chiropractic at least feels good.

175
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,910
Speaker 1: or it's a nice back rub or it can do anything.

176
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,227
Speaker 0: Your physical therapist can just go to one of those Asian ladies who gives you a back rub.

177
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:17,710
Speaker 0: It's cheaper.

178
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:27,310
Speaker 1: Or I mean the fact chiropractic is just bullshit That even if you just go for the back rub, it's actually very dangerous and it can kill you.

179
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,655
Speaker 0: Well, there's the adjustments.

180
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:29,458
Speaker 0: or what can kill you?

181
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,543
Speaker 0: just rubbing you?

182
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,370
Speaker 1: does you realize all they give you are adjustments?

183
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:46,374
Speaker 1: Basically what chiropractors do is they massage you but they massage you along your spine Which I've taken massage therapy classes and the first rule was you never touch the area around the spine ever Ever ever ever.

184
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:49,043
Speaker 1: they drill that into your head every single day.

185
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:50,347
Speaker 1: It's terribly dangerous.

186
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,969
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

187
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:55,990
Speaker 1: So if you have any doubts as to what I've said about chiropractic watch this video.

188
00:14:57,176 --> 00:15:00,514
Speaker 0: Yep, it'll Hopefully change your mind.

189
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:08,488
Speaker 0: and well if you keep going to the chiropractor and you know better and you get hurt You get notably about yourself.

190
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,329
Speaker 1: Now Scott's thing of the day is much more fun.

191
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:18,450
Speaker 0: Well, you might remember my previous thing a day with the Japanese Super Nintendo Zelda commercial.

192
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:25,970
Speaker 0: You can consider this part two of Scott's ongoing old Nintendo commercial thing of the day series.

193
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,803
Speaker 1: I remember seeing this one on TV when I was a kid.

194
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:34,409
Speaker 0: Yeah so far, you know There have been quite a few Nintendo commercials go around the net but this one I remember quite well.

195
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:42,120
Speaker 1: it's the original NES Tetris commercial and The one with the singing opera lady and the exploding building.

196
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:44,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one.

197
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:54,580
Speaker 0: so if you remember it, it should nostalgia you and if you don't well Then now you can be a little more old-school instead of being a loser lemur.

198
00:15:54,721 --> 00:16:01,034
Speaker 1: Now the one thing that always bothered me about this commercial and I was reminded of it when I saw it They they show all these shapes in Tetris.

199
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:08,810
Speaker 1: They're like square Rectangle blah blah blah and at one point He says trapezoid and it shows a picture of a trapezoid.

200
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,400
Speaker 1: and yet in no way does the trapezoid ever appear in Tetris.

201
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:18,740
Speaker 0: He wasn't trying to show Pieces that appear in Tetris, but you can't even make a trapezoid in Tetris.

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,629
Speaker 0: No, no, you didn't get that part of the.

203
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,734
Speaker 0: the bit is that he was.

204
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,467
Speaker 0: he was like, this is a square This is a rectangle.

205
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:25,793
Speaker 0: This is a trapezoid.

206
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,220
Speaker 0: He wasn't saying that they're in Tetris.

207
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,121
Speaker 0: He was just showing you some shapes and then the last shape he showed you is a Tetrisoid.

208
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:33,905
Speaker 0: you see.

209
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,712
Speaker 1: but why is the trapezoid?

210
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:37,400
Speaker 1: I think that's intellectually dishonest.

211
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:44,320
Speaker 0: They were just trying to be silly saying look a Tetrisoid is a new type of shape, you know, it's Tetris.

212
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,649
Speaker 0: Ooh, the other things weren't in Tetris.

213
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:47,191
Speaker 0: They know that.

214
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,219
Speaker 1: no, I don't like it.

215
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:52,632
Speaker 1: I think you should have done some research maybe presented some sort of evidence.

216
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:53,616
Speaker 0: I think you're just nuts.

217
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,959
Speaker 0: I Think you need to let it slide.

218
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:02,723
Speaker 1: All right, then you should let a chiropractic slide You first All right.

219
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:06,955
Speaker 1: Tell you what, I'll try to make a trapezoid in Tetris and you go to a chiropractic.

220
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,240
Speaker 0: No, you don't get it at all.

221
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,978
Speaker 0: There are no And they're not trying to say they are either.

222
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:34,220
Speaker 1: God yeah, so Today being Monday in science and tech day and considering that we just in about an hour Designed an entire web community for a local group around here We decided we talked about what it takes to actually make a website or a web community.

223
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,418
Speaker 0: Well, the first thing you need to know is how website works.

224
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:51,498
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna try to avoid horrible technical details as much as I can But you might have to suffer and if I say something you don't know and I don't explain it Wikipedia is your friend and so was Google.

225
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:56,679
Speaker 1: So so you have HTML and CSS and blah blah blah blah blah patchy posterior e.

226
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that you need to look up.

227
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,992
Speaker 0: So the way the web works is you have a web server.

228
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:11,559
Speaker 0: It's basically you have a computer and it just sits there and it has a bunch of web pages sitting on it and it just sits.

229
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:22,135
Speaker 0: and If someone wants to visit the website, they open up their browser and they type in the address of the web server The web browser goes and says hey web server give me this page.

230
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,520
Speaker 0: the web service is okay.

231
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:33,332
Speaker 0: it gives them the page and then your web browser takes that page which is just a bunch of text and It turns it into the website that you see on your screen.

232
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,035
Speaker 1: simple.

233
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,039
Speaker 0: Very simple.

234
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:54,980
Speaker 0: So standard web browsers are like Firefox Internet Explorer Opera and web servers are like Apache Is whatever but almost everyone uses Apache as it's the way to go and The text that gets sent across from the browser from the server to the browser is the HTMLs that everyone talks about.

235
00:18:55,822 --> 00:19:01,500
Speaker 0: It's really like if you right-click in your browser on any page and say view source, you'll see what HTML looks like.

236
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:02,799
Speaker 0: It's not really that scary.

237
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:08,360
Speaker 0: It's just text with some little tags in it to say like hey, this text is bold.

238
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,461
Speaker 0: This is a paragraph.

239
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:13,287
Speaker 0: put a picture here make a table here that sort of thing.

240
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,208
Speaker 0: It's it's really.

241
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:15,510
Speaker 0: it's brain dead.

242
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,888
Speaker 0: and That's how website works.

243
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:32,179
Speaker 0: Now that you know that The next step is to make those fancy websites where you can actually do stuff, you know, like a forum website a blog blog you know anything a shopping site that sort of thing.

244
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:45,770
Speaker 1: now we can use geek nights as an example because we made geek nights and Despite the fact that it's fairly polished and looks pretty good and has a lot of complex functionality It took almost zero effort on our part to build it in about five minutes.

245
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:50,590
Speaker 1: Basically, you just read a thing and if you follow the directions, you'll get something like what we have.

246
00:19:51,592 --> 00:20:01,729
Speaker 0: Well starting with the way it works is with the normal web page I first described is you just have HTML and it's just a file and When you ask the browser for a page it sends you that file.

247
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:07,785
Speaker 0: Now, let's say with with these other sorts of powerful websites that are different all the time.

248
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:09,470
Speaker 0: They're called dynamic websites.

249
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,290
Speaker 0: And that's because well the there is no page just in a file on the web server.

250
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:26,139
Speaker 1: Yep When my browser asks for a file the server says he asked for this file and then the server looks into a database figures out what it needs to make the page you Asked for and then sends HTML that will recreate that page.

251
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,420
Speaker 0: Yep.

252
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:30,155
Speaker 1: So the page itself doesn't actually exist until you try to view it Yep.

253
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:39,935
Speaker 0: So there's a program on the web server and you you send either in the URL or in a form Information to the web server.

254
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:48,490
Speaker 0: the web server takes that information and runs a program and the Result of that program is that the program prints out HTML?

255
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:56,933
Speaker 0: So you can write like a program that says if someone visits one if someone visits a page named one print out the number one.

256
00:20:56,973 --> 00:21:04,162
Speaker 0: if someone visits a page name to print out the number two and You know, it'll print out that and send it back.

257
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:05,968
Speaker 0: and that's that's how that works.

258
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:13,989
Speaker 0: So The good news is you don't have to learn how to program crap Because people have already programmed everything cool for you.

259
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:24,708
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess the point we're trying to make through this whole show here Is that it's really easy to make really professional looking websites, even if you don't know anything about web publishing.

260
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:28,690
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Especially since a lot of hosts just take care of this stuff for you.

261
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:38,589
Speaker 0: I mean with the way we do is we have like, you know a host or we actually have to administer a Linux computer Sort of yeah, we have our own computer in the sky and we can basically do whatever we want with it.

262
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:38,903
Speaker 1: Yeah

263
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:54,130
Speaker 0: But a lot of hosts just already set up Apache PHP my SQL all these sorts of things that you need these acronyms that you need to have available in order for these things to work and all you have to know is that You have to figure out what you want to use and you have to figure out what?

264
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,309
Speaker 0: Acronyms you need to have in order to make that work.

265
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,557
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about what the acronyms are anything.

266
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:02,930
Speaker 0: So the one thing that I I like a lot is WordPress.

267
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:06,129
Speaker 1: It's really the only good free one out there.

268
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:11,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of them but WordPress it really especially since WordPress 2.0 just came out.

269
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,640
Speaker 0: It really takes the cake.

270
00:22:12,882 --> 00:22:13,388
Speaker 0: It's hot.

271
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:19,167
Speaker 1: basically You download it and you just follow the instructions on how to make it work on whatever server or hosting.

272
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:19,669
Speaker 1: you're using

273
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,171
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

274
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:34,129
Speaker 1: and it gives you a little page and you administer the entire website from the website you can you log into the site and it gives you a little like editor boxes and things and you just make pages and Put them around your site and it'll just glue everything together on its own.

275
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:50,770
Speaker 0: Yeah once it's installed anyone who has the mind enough to be able to use something like Microsoft Word can use WordPress to make an awesome blog and stuff and enter all their content and make blog posts and categorize blog posts and post comments and all that sort of good stuff.

276
00:22:51,405 --> 00:23:01,790
Speaker 1: I mean It's real extensible and real flexible and you can get down into the nitty-gritty and alter the style sheets or do whatever you want But if you don't know any of that stuff you still get a lot of power.

277
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:05,985
Speaker 1: You can change a lot of things really easily just by pointing and clicking and following directions

278
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:17,330
Speaker 0: and to install it All you really do is download it go to the web server Unzip it and then point your web browser at it and you go to like install that PHP.

279
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:24,609
Speaker 0: You just visit the install website That you set up and then it just says click next click next do this do that and then it's set up.

280
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:27,390
Speaker 1: You basically do everything through the web browser.

281
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:34,543
Speaker 1: It's just like it's a website where when you visit it you see your cool administrator stuff and when everyone else visits They see your cool website.

282
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:41,330
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You don't actually have to write a single HTML or a style sheet or a PHP or anything.

283
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:47,168
Speaker 0: Of course, it does require you have a MySQL and a PHP and an Apache.

284
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,359
Speaker 0: of course You don't have to have an Apache technically, but you need a my.

285
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,853
Speaker 0: you need a database and a PHP That's for sure.

286
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,404
Speaker 1: Of course, if you don't have any of that.

287
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:57,750
Speaker 1: you don't want to pay for hosting or whatever.

288
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:00,603
Speaker 1: There are a million places various blog type places.

289
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:01,970
Speaker 1: That'll just give you all that already.

290
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:07,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think they even set up like wordpress.com or something like where you get WordPress blogs now.

291
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:09,498
Speaker 0: They just came out with that now.

292
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:10,000
Speaker 1: We'll have to look.

293
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:18,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there are other places you can go to like Google with their blogger calm blog spot type thing and Microsoft has one.

294
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,241
Speaker 0: You know when they're not WordPress these other ones.

295
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:24,429
Speaker 0: but you just visit them and you say hey I want a blog and they say here's a blog.

296
00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:26,944
Speaker 0: You know, you don't get to do all sorts of.

297
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:34,007
Speaker 0: you know You don't have as a hundred percent freedom as if you had your own web server, but for 90% of people it's plenty.

298
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:40,103
Speaker 1: I mean basically Making a website or a forum or anything like this the technical part of it.

299
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,164
Speaker 1: a lot of people say oh, I'd make a website I just don't know how.

300
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:51,149
Speaker 1: Knowing how is probably the least of your worries because making the getting the website up and getting it to work is Trivial in most cases.

301
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:53,637
Speaker 1: So, I mean the real problem.

302
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:56,450
Speaker 1: the real issue is do you actually have a reason to make a website?

303
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:57,716
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do with it?

304
00:24:57,857 --> 00:24:58,924
Speaker 1: Why would people visit it?

305
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:08,938
Speaker 0: Mmm They're 90% of websites out there just completely useless or no one updates them or whatever you know when They just don't get visited and there's no purpose.

306
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:12,470
Speaker 0: a lot of people put a lot of effort into making them and it just doesn't.

307
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,354
Speaker 0: They don't mean anything.

308
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:16,268
Speaker 0: It's like they're just taking up space somewhere.

309
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:16,650
Speaker 0: Who knows?

310
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:20,084
Speaker 0: So if you're gonna make a website don't just be like.

311
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:20,848
Speaker 0: I want to make a website.

312
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:23,096
Speaker 1: yeah Think about why you're doing it.

313
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:24,923
Speaker 1: Do you care if people look at it or not?

314
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:26,510
Speaker 1: Well, do you need to make money?

315
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,534
Speaker 1: Do you want to make money?

316
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,965
Speaker 1: Do you not care about losing money on it?

317
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:30,668
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm?

318
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:34,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, only make a website if you have a purpose, you know.

319
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,050
Speaker 0: I mean you're free to make one if you don't have a purpose.

320
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,358
Speaker 0: But you know don't put too much into it if you have no reason for doing it And you're not getting anything out of it.

321
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,270
Speaker 1: I mean we made geek nights for fun.

322
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:50,030
Speaker 1: We don't expect to make money off of it Even if it gets crazy crazy crazy popular with millions of listeners.

323
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:57,258
Speaker 1: We really would continue doing it for free forever because we enjoy it, but we are You know making a website for a purpose.

324
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:58,906
Speaker 0: We're not just oh, let's make a thing.

325
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:04,392
Speaker 0: Whatever There's a reason for it to exist and that's what's important now it.

326
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:07,004
Speaker 1: that doesn't mean that it has to be a reason for other people to visit it.

327
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:19,709
Speaker 1: if you make a website just for You and maybe a few of your friends and you're happy with that Don't feel bad if you only get like five hits a day or five hits a year or whatever Because as long as you got the enjoyment out of making it and it's serving its purpose you win.

328
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:25,787
Speaker 0: Now if you want something like a forum or something you do it pretty much the same way.

329
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:30,950
Speaker 0: you install WordPress You just install a forum software instead of a blog software.

330
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:34,059
Speaker 1: I mean, I wish we were exaggerating but no it's that simple.

331
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,436
Speaker 1: you just go into Google and type like free forum software And you'll find a bunch of sites.

332
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,386
Speaker 1: you pick one you download it you follow the instructions and it just works.

333
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,061
Speaker 0: the most popular one You've probably seen around the internet is PHP BB.

334
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:49,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, we run some game forums with it A lot.

335
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:51,139
Speaker 1: a lot of blogs use it as their forum.

336
00:26:51,340 --> 00:27:02,967
Speaker 0: Yep, but I've decided for the for the front row crew geek nights forum to use Lucemo vanilla, which well you said ah like six times there damn it.

337
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:05,198
Speaker 0: Yeah Fine, I'll say it again.

338
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:10,198
Speaker 0: I Decided there for the geek nights front row crew forum.

339
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:20,789
Speaker 0: I would use Lucemo vanilla, which is much more modern much more hot Doesn't have is the same sort of old-school web 1.0 ness of PHP BB.

340
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,198
Speaker 0: It's like a web 2.0 forum.

341
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,825
Speaker 1: And now that I've upgraded it with the avatars and such And yeah, yeah, I got to admit Scott you he has a real nice boo avatar.

342
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:31,090
Speaker 0: I love my boo avatar.

343
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,462
Speaker 0: That's the best avatar ever had.

344
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:37,650
Speaker 1: my toga is okay But I'm thinking about changing it to some sort of Mario or maybe a dry bones maybe a boo.

345
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:49,110
Speaker 1: Now basically, you'll notice that we didn't really go into a lot of detail on the specifics like download this then do this then do This, you know put it in this directory or any really any kind of specific technical details.

346
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,697
Speaker 1: now I'd say the main reason for that is that it really is that simple one.

347
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:58,799
Speaker 1: if you just go to a site and Google around you'll find all the information you need.

348
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,482
Speaker 1: if you really get stuck just ask us and we could show you because we We've done it so many times.

349
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:07,095
Speaker 1: It's just trivial and Basically, you have no.

350
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:19,468
Speaker 1: if you want to make a website or you have something to say to the world you can't use not understanding technology or Not knowing where to begin or not knowing how to make a website as an excuse not to do it.

351
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:22,590
Speaker 1: Because seriously, it's that easy to just make a website.

352
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:27,870
Speaker 1: So if you've got something to say go out and do it make a website and it'll be awesome.

353
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:32,519
Speaker 0: And don't make one of those scary myspace websites or anything.

354
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:40,455
Speaker 1: because God I mean honestly this is just what we're switching from Technological advice mode to rant mode.

355
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:46,429
Speaker 1: but to me myspace and live journal are pretty much the cesspool of the internet.

356
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:53,290
Speaker 1: There I consider them one step above 4chan which itself is only a scant step above the style project.

357
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:59,370
Speaker 0: I mean the technology behind live journal and myspace is really nothing wrong with the technology itself.

358
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:00,235
Speaker 1: It's a culture.

359
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:00,959
Speaker 0: it did.

360
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:09,090
Speaker 0: the culture behind those sites Means most of the people using that technology are making bad bad websites.

361
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:13,130
Speaker 1: I mean if you had bad way have you ever seriously looked around myspace?

362
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:20,270
Speaker 1: Because the first time I actually ever went to a myspace site was when we met this cool band at Otacon.

363
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,400
Speaker 1: We've talked about him before.

364
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,389
Speaker 1: what were they called?

365
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,878
Speaker 1: Entertainment entertainment system and the guy who ran the band is really cool And we want to know what their website was.

366
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:30,750
Speaker 1: and they had some high space or myspace site.

367
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, not high space.

368
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:47,790
Speaker 1: high space is actually awesome high space But it's just this horrible cesspool of like early 90s era Geocities type sites with like horrible pictures and cam girls and drugs and it's just a mess.

369
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:49,803
Speaker 0: It's really frightening.

370
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:57,190
Speaker 0: I mean I It the backgrounds the tiled backgrounds of blinking colors.

371
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,607
Speaker 0: I haven't seen those in like 10 years.

372
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:05,209
Speaker 1: now I'll be tiled blinking backgrounds, but tiled blinking backgrounds that aren't the right size to begin with.

373
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,641
Speaker 1: Wow, what are these people thinking?

374
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,309
Speaker 1: do they think these sites look good?

375
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,637
Speaker 0: It's like they look at their web.

376
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,970
Speaker 0: They they must not look at their own website or try to actually read it.

377
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,750
Speaker 0: It's like they just use as many things as they can use like oh I can make things blink.

378
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,694
Speaker 0: I'll make things blink.

379
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:24,210
Speaker 0: Oh, I can use lots of colors and make text big and different fonts.

380
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:29,894
Speaker 0: I'll do as much different stuff as I can possibly do and put a graphic in every single spot I can possibly put.

381
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:33,230
Speaker 0: oh, I found a cool picture on the internet like a little funny animated gif.

382
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,153
Speaker 0: I'll put that on my site.

383
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:39,289
Speaker 0: Also, it just God it makes completely useless and painful things to look at.

384
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,918
Speaker 0: Don't make any more of those sites, please.

385
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:50,410
Speaker 1: Yeah and live journal while it's a lot more tasteful I just I have some a lot of friends who I mean I refuse to use live journal.

386
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:58,290
Speaker 1: I don't even go to it unless people like really make me Which actually one time was funny because I found out that a friend of mine was a father because I went to his live journal.

387
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,370
Speaker 1: I hadn't talked to him in a while.

388
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:06,189
Speaker 1: But it seems that I know a lot of people who use the live journal as a way to communicate with their friends.

389
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:15,866
Speaker 1: in lieu of actually talking to and continuing to be friends with their friends I Mean I'll talk to someone I haven't talked to a while like hey, how you doing?

390
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:16,530
Speaker 1: What's up?

391
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,828
Speaker 1: and they'll say oh, do you read my live journal?

392
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:21,468
Speaker 1: and I say no.

393
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:30,830
Speaker 1: And then I end up trying to have a real conversation with them where they try to actually explain these events to a person Because they've they're used to just having people read the live journal then they never have to talk to anyone.

394
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:48,547
Speaker 0: It makes this sort of scary like Sub world communication like People say things or they write things down and other people read them But they didn't actually say them directly to that person, so it's kind of like there's information.

395
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:56,649
Speaker 0: That's known Like to some people who read it and it makes really weird situations when you hang out with a lot of live journal people

396
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,889
Speaker 1: Because I mean we've had friends who post something in a live journal and then get absolutely pissed when other people are talking about it.

397
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean hello.

398
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,480
Speaker 1: You posted it to the internet.

399
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:12,151
Speaker 1: That's the equivalent of standing on rooftops and shouting at 24/7.

400
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:17,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's the other thing where people will put it in their live journal, and then when you don't know it.

401
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:20,266
Speaker 0: They're like You didn't read my like.

402
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:26,699
Speaker 0: no And they're like you don't care about me like Get away from me.

403
00:32:27,265 --> 00:32:27,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, Gary

404
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:40,030
Speaker 1: Or I had a friend not too long ago who I talked to this person off and on But I talked to someone else and I mentioned this person's name and the other guy was like well I haven't heard from her and like ages is she dead or something?

405
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:45,604
Speaker 1: I was like what I talked to her like two days ago and then the guy was like oh, but she hasn't updated a live journal in months.

406
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:51,909
Speaker 1: I figured something happened and The I did really took all my effort to not say and maybe she got a life.

407
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:53,887
Speaker 0: You know what?

408
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,506
Speaker 0: Maybe she got a life.

409
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:00,198
Speaker 1: Now Highspace on the other hand that's quality.

410
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,805
Speaker 0: highspace should be a thing of the day.

411
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:06,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Was highspace a thing of the day, or did we talk about it back in the like?

412
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,321
Speaker 1: Pre-production beta geek nights that aren't on the internet anymore.

413
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:12,870
Speaker 0: I don't know, but highspace recently updated, so it's still going.

414
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:25,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know you can find it pretty easily, but highspace is a funny completely fake knockoff of myspace with all the characters from every Zelda game in them It.

415
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:28,047
Speaker 0: some of them are really hilarious, especially old man.

416
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,979
Speaker 1: I don't know I'm a big fan of error.

417
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:31,670
Speaker 0: old man is still the best one.

418
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:37,890
Speaker 1: See if this sort of thing sounds hilarious to you then you're gonna love this site.

419
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:42,330
Speaker 1: And if you have no idea what we're talking about don't worry because you're not missing anything you care about.

420
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:46,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to we're not gonna tell you how to get to highspace now in the podcast.

421
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,149
Speaker 0: But if you visit front row crew calm there'll be a link in today's post.

422
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,970
Speaker 1: Oh, well there that means I have to put a link in today's post.

423
00:33:53,010 --> 00:34:02,750
Speaker 0: That's already done means I have to go in and edit and then yeah great Yeah, but it means that people have to visit our site, and then hopefully also join our forum.

424
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:11,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I gotta say once again We see how many of you are out there listening to this and it's a lot more than the number of people who are visiting the site on a regular basis.

425
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:21,790
Speaker 1: And also, this is a complete aside because we've kind of gone off topic anyway But someone is listening to geek nights on a regular basis on their PSP.

426
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:23,534
Speaker 0: Alright,

427
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:39,099
Speaker 1: whoever you are come forward I'm curious because I don't know anyone who owns a PSP and I'd really like some first-hand accounts as to how cool It is or not because I'm I'm basically firmly in the DS camp at this point and so is everyone I know in the world and

428
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,434
Speaker 0: they saw DS is sold out in Japan and PSP's are plentiful.

429
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:49,634
Speaker 1: so well what they sold 15 million DS's so far, and I think four or five million PSP's Like that worldwide.

430
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:59,119
Speaker 1: there won't even be DS DS's in Japan until February, but like I'm not knocking you I think it's cool that you're listening to geek nights on a PSP But I want to know who you are and I want to.

431
00:34:59,682 --> 00:34:59,944
Speaker 1: I want to.

432
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,805
Speaker 1: I mean if you live near me Can I try your PSP out?

433
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:03,410
Speaker 0: Yeah?

434
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,481
Speaker 0: I don't know what you're using to download geek nights on the PSP.

435
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,870
Speaker 0: you have like an RSS reader on there a podcatcher.

436
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,830
Speaker 1: I read somewhere that because it looks like from as far as feed burner tells me It's a built-in pot or podcast thingy or a built-in RSS thingy for the PSP.

437
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,465
Speaker 0: I really like to see You know geek nights on there.

438
00:35:21,606 --> 00:35:22,070
Speaker 0: That'd be cool.

439
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:26,214
Speaker 0: So like I take like a picture of it or something because I mean It's also.

440
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:30,650
Speaker 1: it'd be a nice test for us if the site doesn't work so well on a PSP or a little screen like that.

441
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:36,550
Speaker 1: Let us know because if there's a demand we'll definitely make a portable mobile version of the site on a separate feed or something.

442
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:42,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm definitely I'm not really too happy with the current theme on the website.

443
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:43,770
Speaker 0: You know I change the theme on the forum.

444
00:35:44,372 --> 00:35:48,350
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna try to change the theme on the actual website to something more custom.

445
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:52,342
Speaker 0: Maybe looks more like the forum or at least has better typography.

446
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:55,210
Speaker 0: That's more readable and you know just better overall.

447
00:35:55,451 --> 00:36:02,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, so since we've moved into meta bits expect the website look to change a little bit as we fiddle with it Yeah, but still visit it often.

448
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:14,120
