1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,859
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, March 14th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,601
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,383
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:16,149
Speaker 1: And this is the Geek Nights Book Club.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,648
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about 2001 A Space Odyssey the book.

6
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:24,708
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,058
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty warm today.

8
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:29,390
Speaker 1: It's weird that it's warm today.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,050
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not cold to the point where I'm gonna go woman, it's cold, but it is not warm today.

10
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:36,075
Speaker 1: It is warm enough.

11
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:37,844
Speaker 0: It is like 52 degrees fahrenheit.

12
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:46,076
Speaker 1: When we were at RIT It is warm enough to where I would be wearing shorts and a t-shirt But that's RIT, that's not the real world.

13
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:54,260
Speaker 1: But two, it is warm enough to where I smell the smell way earlier than I expected to smell it.

14
00:00:54,321 --> 00:01:05,315
Speaker 1: There's this particular smell that I'm very nostalgic for and it only occurs in large old cities like New York or at amusement parks.

15
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:09,388
Speaker 1: It is that smell in the, like it's a smell you get in the morning.

16
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:09,950
Speaker 0: The peanut cart?

17
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:17,778
Speaker 1: It's the combination of peanut cart diesel exhaust and oil slick.

18
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:32,619
Speaker 1: that comes in like early May if you go to like Cedar Point or Six Flags and in the morning when there's still all the like winter residues hanging out in like late spring before it's quite summer there's this like particular kind of smell you get in the morning.

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,494
Speaker 1: You really only get that smell in big cities or amusement parks.

20
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:43,829
Speaker 0: Usually that happens not just in the first warm morning, but in the first like morning after it rains and it's warm.

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:02:02,589
Speaker 0: Because basically all this stuff cakes onto the street and then you get that first spring rain in like March-April and in the rain and the heat combined right the rain and the heat combined clean the street right and then all that filth that was built up on the street from the winter goes away.

22
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,750
Speaker 0: and but it's that along with like that mow the lawn smell only for asphalt instead of grass.

23
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:16,106
Speaker 1: but it's that coupled with the peanut cart and that like diesel exhaust and nuts for nuts isn't peanuts.

24
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:16,748
Speaker 0: It's like other kinds.

25
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like Whatever it is.

26
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,020
Speaker 1: Don't eat it.

27
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:19,543
Speaker 0: Of course.

28
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:20,106
Speaker 0: I don't eat it.

29
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:20,750
Speaker 0: Are you crazy?

30
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:23,376
Speaker 1: So I smelled that smell.

31
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,242
Speaker 1: but it's weird to smell that smell in March.

32
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,330
Speaker 1: So it got me nostalgic.

33
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:30,803
Speaker 1: I got to get back to Cedar Point, but no news tonight.

34
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,550
Speaker 1: I don't really want to talk about Brexit.

35
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:43,379
Speaker 1: I hope Brexit fails because it's time for Things of the Day.

36
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:53,609
Speaker 1: So we go to PAX South every year among the many PAXes we go to and one of the bands that performs at PAX South every year is Super mess super mariachi entertainment.

37
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:54,030
Speaker 0: They have.

38
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:57,480
Speaker 0: they have been a thing of the day in the past before we even saw them at PAX.

39
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:01,093
Speaker 1: Oh, yep, so I'm not talking about them because I like mariachi music.

40
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,860
Speaker 1: I've always enjoyed mariachi music.

41
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,986
Speaker 1: This is just a tweet.

42
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:14,878
Speaker 1: I stumbled upon it is a mariachi band Singing Bohemian Rhapsody on the street in a mariachi style and it is most enjoyable.

43
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:15,240
Speaker 1: That is it.

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,407
Speaker 1: That is my thing of the day.

45
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,112
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:22,680
Speaker 0: So Here is a video of a thing that I'm surprised was not at magfest.

47
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,792
Speaker 0: It is at clearly some magfest ish event somewhere else.

48
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,800
Speaker 1: We got a kickstart bringing this to magfest.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,671
Speaker 0: This could be a gaming room in an anime con.

50
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,100
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know where this is.

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,497
Speaker 1: This looks like the kind of thing that this looks like the anime gaming nights.

52
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:37,991
Speaker 0: We used to have Oh, it says in the description.

53
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:42,088
Speaker 1: This is a little beach Rhythm national rhythm game tournament.

54
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:44,535
Speaker 1: Oh storm 14.

55
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:45,057
Speaker 1: Damn.

56
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:47,908
Speaker 1: I gotta go there dude It's in Daytona Beach every year in May.

57
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,892
Speaker 0: Oh sweet.

58
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,580
Speaker 1: We don't have any make-ons anymore.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,509
Speaker 0: But anyway, it says this is in 2014.

60
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,353
Speaker 0: So I guess we missed it.

61
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,679
Speaker 0: Maybe there might doesn't exist anymore.

62
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,480
Speaker 0: How come I didn't know there was a rhythm game convention?

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,053
Speaker 0: But anyway, what this is is the world's largest DDR pad.

64
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,040
Speaker 0: if this is in 2014, how come I didn't see it before?

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,664
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's five years old.

66
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,939
Speaker 1: The video was uploaded like four days after this event.

67
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:19,500
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, what happened apparently five years ago and I didn't hear about it was somebody took nine DDR pads Put them all together in a grid to make an a DDR pad.

68
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:24,440
Speaker 0: It is nine times the size of a normal DDR pad and each pad is an arrow.

69
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:30,247
Speaker 1: The best part about this video is watching this dude who clearly knows how to play DDR Struggling right.

70
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:37,620
Speaker 0: play DDR on this pad here You have one dude playing it, but I think it'd be much more fun to have four people one per arrow playing this game.

71
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:47,329
Speaker 1: so, uh, I actually scrolled down a little bit and the amazing thing about this video is that Every YouTube comment just seems to be gold.

72
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:48,172
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

73
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:50,440
Speaker 1: So when I was five, that's how I felt.

74
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,728
Speaker 1: Imagine doing crossovers on that thing.

75
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:56,819
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm should have put nine more pads together to play doubles.

76
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,052
Speaker 1: Little four people play each get on an arrow.

77
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:01,715
Speaker 1: That's right.

78
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 1: That looks painful.

79
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,967
Speaker 1: Should have gotten nine pads to play doubles.

80
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,551
Speaker 1: starts to repeat itself.

81
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:08,637
Speaker 0: nine should have gotten 81 pads.

82
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,087
Speaker 0: Yeah No, 81 times two 162 pads.

83
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:18,854
Speaker 1: Play doubles make one just giant DDR pad.

84
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:24,949
Speaker 1: That's in like a park in nine cities Spread out around the United States.

85
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:32,396
Speaker 0: take eight arrows hide them around the world Put them have cell phones attached to them and then have the game somewhere else remotely.

86
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:37,012
Speaker 1: I Love this like there's cursed rhythm game controllers.

87
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:49,048
Speaker 0: This is I set that up as an installation at Right where you basically have you're standing on the thing and there's a while just a light in front of you or just a serum a strip of LEDs and there's.

88
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,172
Speaker 0: they lit up and you have to.

89
00:05:50,312 --> 00:05:59,800
Speaker 0: you have to step when the light hits the bottom or the top right and then Combined you are playing DDR, but you can't see the other three arrows or anything else.

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,638
Speaker 0: You have no context.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,720
Speaker 0: But people watching the group of you jump in place can see the arrows and how well you're doing any bad.

92
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:14,667
Speaker 0: So if you someone was watching from afar then you would look like you were all Individual feet or whatever.

93
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:22,894
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment because we want to get right into the book club We will be live at PAX East if I finally just posted this on the website.

94
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:24,859
Speaker 1: the real harm of games.

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,012
Speaker 0: It's like icon is an anime con in Lancaster.

105
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,320
Speaker 1: It's not an anime con.

106
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,428
Speaker 1: It is a generic on much like kinetic on.

107
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,376
Speaker 0: zenkai is a Japanese.

108
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,359
Speaker 0: What do you think?

109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,493
Speaker 1: zenkai con Mean stands for the etymology of that word.

110
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,719
Speaker 1: It is not what you think it is.

111
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,087
Speaker 0: I thought they actually stole.

112
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,351
Speaker 0: it wasn't like another convention.

113
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 1: Thank God has never been an anime convention.

114
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:14,865
Speaker 1: it is.

115
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:18,583
Speaker 1: it has about as much anime content as Kinetic on.

116
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:22,857
Speaker 0: it was like another anime convention that died and zenkai come came from the ruins of it.

117
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:23,540
Speaker 0: Thank icon.

118
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,303

00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:35,459
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you all how to run a panel like do it, right?

123
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:40,635

124
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:52,320
Speaker 1: this con is actually Got a heavy tabletop presence like tabletop is bumping there But there's not a lot of tabletop content because people like us don't tend to go to small cons.

125
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,075
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna be there doing that and then play dirty to win on Sunday morning.

Speaker 1: 2014 we did wool and I daughter 2013 player of games the great gasps about to a year.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is it's been a long time since we did this book because we've been even though this book was tiny.

154
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 0: So finally did it and thanks to my new read on the subway strategy that I've recommitted to fully I will proceed to finish the future book clubs very very quickly.

155
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:40,737
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah now that I'm not playing race for the galaxy when I'm but the only thing that will prevent me from doing this plan is Biking to her kids that yeah, I think I read 2001 a Space Odyssey in about five days once I actually started.

156
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:41,760
Speaker 0: not take me long.

157
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,200
Speaker 0: It was like I think I estimated like eight subway rides or something.

158
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,590
Speaker 0: I think it took one less than my when I started reading it.

159
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:57,000
Speaker 1: Kindle was like it'll take you six hours to finish this book And by the time I finished the second like mini chapter It was like it's gonna take you four hours to finish before we talk about the actual book rim.

160
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,349
Speaker 0: Did I chose 2001 a Space Odyssey?

161
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,517
Speaker 0: Did you choose the next book club book?

162
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:02,240
Speaker 0: That is your choice.

163
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,320
Speaker 1: So I'm nearly chosen.

164
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,684
Speaker 1: I've thought about this a lot.

165
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:16,960
Speaker 0: on one hand Luke Burrage has suggested a book that seems very much up my head Burrage of the sci-fi Book-review podcast which has probably put up more book episodes than we have put out book club episodes ever.

166
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:22,192
Speaker 1: So he suggested nine Fox Gambit, which I want to read.

167
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,760
Speaker 1: the description of this because it might be good.

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,593
Speaker 0: I just I just you know personally.

169
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,298
Speaker 0: it's not my choice It's all your choice.

170
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:32,576
Speaker 0: But if someone pushes me to pick something that makes me not want to pick it even if they're see.

171
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:35,509
Speaker 1: I look for Suggestions from people I trust like.

172
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,639
Speaker 1: I don't want Scott Johnson to tell me what to read.

173
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:39,925
Speaker 0: But Luke Burrage is again.

174
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,675
Speaker 1: Luke knows the kind of books that I might like.

175
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:43,438
Speaker 0: it's probably.

176
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,013
Speaker 0: he's probably right But I still would don't want to be pressure.

177
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,502
Speaker 0: if you problem pressures me I'm gonna.

178
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:57,438
Speaker 1: but this cover looks like a culture book and it just says to win an impossible war Captain Cal chairs must awaken an ancient weapon and a despised traitor general.

179
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,100
Speaker 0: That sounds good.

180
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:06,088
Speaker 0: Yeah I still wouldn't pick it if someone forced me to try was trying to push me is disgraced for using an Unconventional method again in a battle against heretics.

181
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,116
Speaker 1: it there's this needle fortress in space.

182
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,847
Speaker 1: this just based on this This feels like you know fortress.

183
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,980
Speaker 0: that sounds a little bit like the the strike.

184
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:15,568
Speaker 1: It does this.

185
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:23,600
Speaker 1: this just looking at this surface value It looks like it's Horatio hornblower Grand Admiral throne and Larry and also once a book club.

186
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:28,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, but another way I could go is to reread a book.

187
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,660
Speaker 1: I haven't read since I was in high school.

188
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,884
Speaker 1: That is Odyssey adjacent Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:42,660
Speaker 1: That is technically a pay licensed Dungeons & Dragons Planescape book, uh-oh, which means it is technically in the same universe as forgotten realms.

190
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:58,938
Speaker 1: but I recall actually being good and Being very Greek mythology like Theseus not Odysseus, but Theseus ship of Theseus, yeah, and Anyboat.

191
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,575
Speaker 1: Multiple people who have read it more recently cuz I last time I read it was like high school Read it more recently than me and said words to the effect of wow.

192
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,859
Speaker 1: That was actually a book.

193
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:12,858
Speaker 1: Did not expect that.

194
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:18,411
Speaker 1: People I trust have said these words Mm-hmm, so it's gonna be one of those two.

195
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,340
Speaker 1: probably do I reread a book?

196
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,565
Speaker 1: I read once in high school.

197
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:27,569
Speaker 1: that might actually be good, but might just be trash Might just be good, but in the guise of trash.

198
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,540
Speaker 1: or do I read a book that might be trash?

199
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:34,543
Speaker 1: But I haven't read it and it looks like the exact kind of trash I fucking love.

200
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:38,479
Speaker 0: it could just be alright, but so much better than you expect that it you know right?

201
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:39,462
Speaker 0: yeah It's like.

202
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:44,520
Speaker 0: oh, it's it's like those uh those Star Wars ones that everyone likes that I read the Thrawn ones.

203
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

204
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,310
Speaker 0: I don't think they were good.

205
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,298
Speaker 0: get mad Star Wars people get mad as you want.

206
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,380
Speaker 0: I don't care They're not good.

207
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,780
Speaker 0: I don't think they were good, but you know what they were just better than the other Star Wars.

208
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,552
Speaker 0: But I remember when I read Troy Dennings how bad the other ones are.

209
00:12:57,873 --> 00:12:58,756
Speaker 0: those are the best.

210
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:07,959
Speaker 1: when I read Pages of pain when I was in high school what I remember thinking at the end of it was wow that was a really good book.

211
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:15,497
Speaker 1: Like it made me think a lot about what it like what it meant mm-hmm, but that was 1996 rim.

212
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:28,819
Speaker 1: so 1996 rim had also read Every Forgotten realms elves doing their elven bullshit book and thought wow fucking elves are just fucking like best elves.

213
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,905
Speaker 1: man moon elves Sun elves.

214
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,089
Speaker 0: let's run them drow.

215
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,972
Speaker 0: Drow me up.

216
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:34,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, try.

217
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:35,016
Speaker 1: There's some.

218
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,467
Speaker 1: so Elaine Cunningham Also, did write a drow book.

219
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,954
Speaker 0: that give me some drow and some mind flayer.

220
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:39,577
Speaker 0: That's all I need.

221
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:49,420
Speaker 1: so Scott There is a book by someone who wrote pretty good fire out in realms book that is about a drow Who is not drizz it and is actually.

222
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker 0: This was a drow until just now.

223
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,836
Speaker 0: wow wow I just knew driss was the name of some D&D guy.

224
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:57,296
Speaker 1: driss is the drow Who is?

225
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,853
Speaker 1: Doing evil things, but it's not evil and comes around and does good stuff now.

226
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:03,335
Speaker 0: I know more.

227
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,589
Speaker 1: yeah, okay, driss I never want to know any.

228
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,532
Speaker 1: I never want to read any.

229
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:11,017
Speaker 1: I never want to hear driss name again those british garbage Just.

230
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:17,057
Speaker 1: But there's another drow that Elaine Cunningham wrote books about.

231
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:17,640
Speaker 1: that.

232
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,206
Speaker 0: better probably You're not inspiring confidence.

233
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,767
Speaker 1: I don't think those books are in the same class as pages of pain, okay I'm gonna pick one of those two books.

234
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:48,837
Speaker 1: unless someone in the next like by Sunday night this week tells me about a book that I have not thought about and Convinces me without talking to me like if you email me or tweet I mean be like read this book and you're able to convince me with that single interaction I'll pick your book instead odds are pretty low alright,

235
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:55,117
Speaker 0: so 2001 a space odyssey is a famous movie directed by Stanley Kubrick one of the best movies there ever was.

236
00:14:55,177 --> 00:15:02,866
Speaker 0: I've seen it several times Including recently in 70 millimeter for the first time in a theater At the Museum of the moving image.

237
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:06,336
Speaker 1: so full disclosure I have seen 2001 a space odyssey.

238
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:18,157
Speaker 1: I Last saw it when I was in elementary school Elementary school, but I saw before you read pages of pain Yeah And I remember loving the hell out of it.

239
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:26,612
Speaker 1: And I remember thinking wow this movie is really really really really really really really really really really long And it's a little bit long.

240
00:15:26,653 --> 00:15:31,837
Speaker 1: It's not Lawrence of Arabia No, but for someone in elementary school this movie is a thousand hours long.

241
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:32,620
Speaker 0: Hey get your money's worth.

242
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but it wasn't.

243
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:34,608
Speaker 1: oh my god.

244
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:35,311
Speaker 1: This movie's long.

245
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,636
Speaker 0: I think it's my favorite kind.

246
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 0: quiet in space.

247
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,849
Speaker 0: I think it was the first quiet space best movie.

248
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,440
Speaker 1: I think it was the first long quiet space thing I ever encountered.

249
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,748
Speaker 0: It's my first long quiet space thing.

250
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:53,945
Speaker 0: period like I saw quiet space thing was there before 2001 a space odyssey when I not not Express.

251
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:55,880
Speaker 0: so I saw not not a galactic rare.

252
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,372
Speaker 1: I saw the Empire Strikes back and then they came after this too.

253
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:04,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then later I saw 2001 a space Odyssey like in the TV.

254
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:07,860
Speaker 1: remember that channel on TV that showed what was gonna be on next.

255
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:22,619
Speaker 1: On all the channels like scrolling by I saw 2001 a space Odyssey and my kid brain said space Odyssey fuck yeah some more Star Wars and It was not Star Wars But I really liked it.

256
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:24,706
Speaker 1: I never encountered that kind of thing before.

257
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:30,791
Speaker 0: so I always knew that there was a book for this movie because I had been to Many libraries and I still went to live.

258
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,240
Speaker 0: I mean I should still go to libraries.

259
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:37,071
Speaker 0: But you know as a kid I went to a lot of libraries Before the internet was a thing and I saw the book there on the shelf.

260
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:38,577
Speaker 0: I even saw sequels like 2010 and whatnot.

261
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I just never read them.

262
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:42,680
Speaker 0: when I was a kid.

263
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,148
Speaker 0: I know I thought I should.

264
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:49,660
Speaker 1: I just never did and I'd always sort of assumed Like I just like my vague idea was cuz I knew sci-fi authors.

265
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:50,633
Speaker 1: I read a lot of Bradbury.

266
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:56,360
Speaker 1: when I was a kid I just assumed that Arthur C Clark had written this book and Stanley Kubrick had made a movie based on it.

267
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,130
Speaker 0: That's of course what you think cuz that's what happens is people write books or comics Which are easy to make at least production wise.

268
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,420
Speaker 0: not the story telling is still just as hard.

269
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, production of a book is easier, right?

270
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,334
Speaker 0: So that's where you know, just like with tabletop games.

271
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:11,359
Speaker 0: The production is easier.

272
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,810
Speaker 0: So your idea ideas get into the world faster and then someone who has got more production resources Will make a video game right now same thing.

273
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:24,420
Speaker 0: someone with low production resources But good storytelling and ideas will make a book and then someone else with a lot of resources will make a movie or TV show.

274
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,920
Speaker 0: So that's what I thought happened, but that is not what happened.

275
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:32,403
Speaker 0: Just when I started this book club a year ago Almost a year ago.

276
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:46,178
Speaker 0: I learned that what actually happened is Arthur C Clark the author and Stanley Kubrick the screenplay writer and director Worked together hand in hand and created both of these works at the same time.

277
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:46,739
Speaker 0: together.

278
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:52,463
Speaker 0: There are differences between them but much fewer than in the usual Adaptations.

279
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:55,072
Speaker 0: you see like say Lord of the Rings or what have you?

280
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:58,524
Speaker 1: and to be fair most of the differences once we get into This are more around.

281
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,133
Speaker 1: you get some context to a scene.

282
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:06,540
Speaker 1: That was much shorter in the movie Like that's most and the other differences are mostly a material, right?

283
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:17,320
Speaker 0: So like the biggest difference like story wise is that they go in the book they go all the way to Saturn yep, and in the movie they just go to Jupiter and it's like.

284
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:22,540
Speaker 0: That seems like a big difference, but really not it doesn't matter.

285
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,112
Speaker 0: It sounds like the exact same story is just in the book.

286
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:33,680
Speaker 0: The journey has like this extra chapter of Traveling from Jupiter to Saturn which is sort of like a chapter or two, which I think it's not a long book.

287
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:41,626
Speaker 1: So before we go any further I just want to say if you for whatever reason if never it didn't read the book because This is the geek nights book club.

288
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:51,155
Speaker 1: Meaning we're gonna talk about 2001 a Space Odyssey the novel Assuming that the listener you have read it or see we're not gonna same story.

289
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,760
Speaker 1: We're not gonna explain the plot.

290
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,523
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

291
00:18:53,804 --> 00:19:04,258
Speaker 1: So I think the reason the book had it this way is that it really it's part of the fact that Humans couldn't move that quickly in space.

292
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:12,422
Speaker 1: yet They had this pre-existing mission planned and then the few people who knew about the TMA-1 and the aliens were like Oh shit.

293
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,470
Speaker 1: Is there any way for us to get to Saturn?

294
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:16,740
Speaker 1: What if we use that mission that's already planned?

295
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,812
Speaker 1: Like I think that was the story that was implied by the.

296
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:26,127
Speaker 1: no we're actually going all the way out to Saturn But it doesn't matter to the space baby story.

297
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:34,092
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Simply by the nature of the medium.

298
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:44,050
Speaker 0: right in the movie The storytelling is often done through quiet not you know me this music this sound and audio But there is not necessarily dialogue.

299
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,300
Speaker 1: like you don't know what the monkeys are thinking, right?

300
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,661
Speaker 0: It's like.

301
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:50,300
Speaker 0: it's like the whole beginning of the movie is just monkeys doing stuff.

302
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,086
Speaker 0: You just watch them and all you hear them know it.

303
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,052
Speaker 0: the only there's no language.

304
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:55,658
Speaker 0: There's no written words.

305
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:01,119
Speaker 1: All you get is But the book is like Moonwatcher is doing this, right?

306
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,040
Speaker 0: You see what's happening with your eyes and a lot of times what you see with your eyes is explicit.

307
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:06,403
Speaker 0: You can.

308
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:14,320
Speaker 0: there's not a lot of room for interpretation But other times especially the end of the movie there's incredible room for interpretation because it's a lot of psychedelic imagery.

309
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,600
Speaker 1: There's basically no room for interpretation in the book.

310
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,492
Speaker 0: The book is like here's what happened in the book because it is words and there's no pictures.

311
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:35,266
Speaker 0: It has no choice, but too often Explicitly tell you what is happening in the story and You can just take that interpretation and apply it to the movie Which I really enjoyed.

312
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:42,888
Speaker 0: that aspect of literally every part of the movie that is like open to interpretation Exactly matches some words in the book.

313
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,780
Speaker 0: so you can remove your own interpretations if you want to accept the books.

314
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,620
Speaker 0: Interpretation for example the way it will match up 100% the way like if you're saying what was that monkey thinking just look in the book.

315
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:54,261
Speaker 0: Oh, that's what the monkey was thinking Like.

316
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,787
Speaker 1: for example the movies sort of like.

317
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:59,120
Speaker 1: it kind of shows the monkeys basically discovering violence and now humans.

318
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:00,910
Speaker 1: the book is much more like.

319
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:01,735
Speaker 1: it's very specific.

320
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:14,800
Speaker 1: the Monolith just tweaks the brains like it tests them figures out like tweaks It can make to give them a shot in D And it goes into a lot of detail about exactly what it did to these monkeys right in the movie.

321
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:18,332
Speaker 0: You can if you only see the movie you can go away like wondering like alright.

322
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:20,500
Speaker 0: clearly the monolith is some sort of alien thing.

323
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:28,602
Speaker 0: But you could go away thinking as I thought at various times Yeah is the monolith the aliens itself like they are monoliths or They something?

324
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:30,429
Speaker 0: is it something they made or both.

325
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,160
Speaker 0: or like you know it's like and why did they put them there?

326
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:41,139
Speaker 1: You could come up with lots of varying ideas or like the movie moves right into like Violence, but the book is it shows much more.

327
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:47,920
Speaker 1: The humans the proto humans are starving amid abundance because they don't know they can use tools to kill animals and eat them.

328
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:51,820
Speaker 1: It's not just kill the other monkeys like the movie kind of implies.

329
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:52,437
Speaker 1: It's more.

330
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:57,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, you you're looking at the problem the wrong way because you can't think.

331
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,564
Speaker 0: yet in the book it is explicit What the monoliths are.

332
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:05,139
Speaker 0: the aliens came and set a sort of trap in a way and that they?

333
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,900
Speaker 0: Sparked intelligence in new life forms and then intentionally right they saw some new life on Earth.

334
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:18,240
Speaker 0: They poked it intentionally to try to you know spur it along the path of being more intelligent.

335
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:36,540
Speaker 0: And then they explicitly set a trap on the moon and also on Saturn Yeah, such that if and when that life that they sparked right ever You know finally became intelligent enough to go to the moon and find the trap that it would then be carried away.

336
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,988
Speaker 0: You know and discovered.

337
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:50,726
Speaker 0: you know brought to the aliens place so that they would know yep Much in the way that like I would turn on a fire under some water and then have a thermometer that would beep when it Reached boiling.

338
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:55,608
Speaker 0: so what I really like it walk away from it It would boil and I could come back where all the like.

339
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:59,479
Speaker 1: very specific details of what the monolith did to the monkeys.

340
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,739
Speaker 1: that Section is actually pretty long in the book yep.

341
00:23:02,301 --> 00:23:17,351
Speaker 1: And the detail there is interesting because it reminds me a lot of the culture books and the effectors like I can see a lot of echoes of how the monolith interacted with the monkeys and how culture shifts interact with meat.

342
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:17,812
Speaker 1: people.

343
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:23,739
Speaker 1: in terms of the effectors like Messing with brain signals to make things change and something's brain Yeah.

344
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,185
Speaker 0: So what's really interesting about this?

345
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:36,338
Speaker 1: because it also implies that the second monolith might have done the same thing to the Scientists who dug it up on the moon and might have even potentially done that to the AI's right.

346
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:51,368
Speaker 0: so in The movie right I sort of when I when I only saw the movie I sort of viewed it as this whole work because it presented as a whole work right in one cohesive story even though it has These chapters that are so far apart from each other.

347
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:52,532
Speaker 0: right, but the book.

348
00:23:52,973 --> 00:24:01,277
Speaker 0: I was told that the book was Slightly adapted stuff from some of other of Arthur Arthur C. Clarke short stories, which I didn't read.

349
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:02,119
Speaker 0: so I don't know about them.

350
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:16,455
Speaker 0: But in the book you can clearly see that like this is actually Separate short stories that were then Sort of like very cohesively tied together like the monkey monolith story.

351
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,100
Speaker 1: That's a fine story by itself.

352
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:23,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really good by itself right if you never read about TMA one and everything after that.

353
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,326
Speaker 0: Right and it's like the.

354
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:31,081
Speaker 0: you know the the main story that everyone thinks of which is only one part of 2001.

355
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:39,816
Speaker 0: You know the how Odyssey spaceship part right is a computer goes wrong Story, which is the most classic sci-fi story of all.

356
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:54,079
Speaker 1: right, but it's also Yep, it's definitely like well butler in jihad Because like that little note when they reestablish communication and earth is like yeah one of our two house Also went crazy.

357
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,345
Speaker 0: Now the most right.

358
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:58,312
Speaker 0: so you know what reading the book.

359
00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:00,540
Speaker 0: I now see how it's these separate stories.

360
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,440
Speaker 0: It's almost like if you were able to take four different Twilight Zone episode Episodes together and sort of make them all the same thing.

361
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:14,760
Speaker 1: It's it's so there's one bit that happens in the monkey part that you really love the monkey part.

362
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,396
Speaker 1: well I thought about this a lot because it was stated directly like here is what happened here.

363
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,660
Speaker 0: Did you just read the monkey part?

364
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:33,919
Speaker 1: So beginning I thought about the monkey part a lot because there's a moment with the leopard where like an aspect of it I'll get to in a second is explained explicitly like here is why this went down the way it did.

365
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:39,048
Speaker 1: And as soon as I read that part I thought about what happened to hell.

366
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,417
Speaker 1: and then when you see in the book what happens with hell I think a parallel is intended to be drawn there.

367
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:56,067
Speaker 1: so When the humans like the proto humans start to figure some shit out one thing that moon dance or moon watchers does is Drat is like he has this idea.

368
00:25:56,127 --> 00:25:56,368
Speaker 1: wait.

369
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,860
Speaker 1: We don't have to just eat the thing we killed out here.

370
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:04,300
Speaker 1: I'm gonna drag it into my fucking house, and that's a big deal.

371
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:18,932
Speaker 1: But then the book makes it very clear that moon dancer had a good idea But was not yet fully equipped to understand the unintended consequences and unknown Dangers or non obvious dangers that would come from this good idea.

372
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:25,859
Speaker 1: the unknown danger was the leopard Will now smell dead meat and definitely come into his house that night.

373
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:29,148
Speaker 1: It was almost a test of him.

374
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:33,440
Speaker 1: can he deal with the unintended danger of a technology?

375
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,726
Speaker 1: He is using that he isn't fully yet understand.

376
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:44,200
Speaker 1: fast forward to hell humans made AI a tool that was Necessary for them to evolve and to have this space mission.

377
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,545
Speaker 1: But they did.

378
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:54,880
Speaker 1: they use the technology before they fully understood the ramifications of it And they had to overcome that danger to use the technology to get to the next stage.

379
00:26:56,403 --> 00:27:01,935
Speaker 0: Funny is how 2010 which we're not gonna talk about completely changes like the house story.

380
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:04,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, right anyway.

381
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:30,439
Speaker 0: So something else that's really fascinating about 2001. as you watch this movie or read this book Right and if you don't know just like try to guess like when it was written Right or when when the movie was made and you will never guess that this movie and book which the movie still looks better Than any movie that's made even today, right and it was made in 1968. yeah before we were on the moon.

382
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:34,589
Speaker 0: Yeah The one on the moon and this is about a moon base.

383
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:54,360
Speaker 1: the forward talks a lot about a spaceship that goes to Saturn like Look go figure out like what humans like what we knew about space and the solar system in 1968. a lot of thing a lot of concepts that you just know today from like Astronomy class or like science class in high school.

384
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,686
Speaker 1: We did not know in 1960.

385
00:27:56,686 --> 00:28:05,553
Speaker 0: some of the scientific things in this book are just straight-up wrong because we didn't know which were which Were clearly based on research of the you know, the knowledge we had in 1968.

386
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:12,620
Speaker 0: They were true then You know true as in the the best to human knowledge in 1968.

387
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,500
Speaker 0: But for an example is this stuff in there about the age of Saturn's rings?

388
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like we know the age of Saturn's rings now a lot better than we did in 1968 Right and the makeup of them and such and such right?

389
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:28,440
Speaker 0: So the information in there about it sounds correct, but is not we learn better?

390
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:36,199
Speaker 1: Yep, but at the same time it is really fascinating how plausible all of this seems right.

391
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,789
Speaker 0: remember It's 2001 the Space Odyssey right.

392
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:39,090
Speaker 1: now is 2019.

393
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:50,571
Speaker 0: It's way in the past But they were what they were doing, you know Kubrick and and Clark is they were like well Look at the rate of change in in space technology so far.

394
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:53,860
Speaker 0: We'll be on the moon soon ish, hopefully, right?

395
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,740
Speaker 0: They didn't know if we would or wouldn't but they thought they would soon.

396
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,389
Speaker 0: Hey, they made a lot of stuff.

397
00:28:58,409 --> 00:28:59,836
Speaker 0: We keep progressing in space.

398
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:06,200
Speaker 0: at this rate We should be going to Saturn with difficulty around 2001 and we'll have better computers.

399
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:15,291
Speaker 1: So it is interesting to know I have an AI by then to know the Commodore 64 now like the specific I don't want to say in acronyms like the things that were really wrong.

400
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,800
Speaker 1: and they come down to the casual sexism.

401
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,747
Speaker 1: Mmm, the like.

402
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:21,737
Speaker 0: yeah, how many women are even in this book?

403
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:26,080
Speaker 1: Yep There's the design talks about like office ladies and secretaries with typewriters a lot.

404
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:36,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much the only women in this book are like wives The stewardesses on the space plane And the office ladies typing on typewriters.

405
00:29:36,968 --> 00:29:40,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not much typewriters despite advanced AI computers.

406
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,900
Speaker 1: Typewriters are all in the same world, right?

407
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,660
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's what happens with everything right?

408
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,851
Speaker 0: It's like the futuristic stuff we're thinking of now.

409
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,520
Speaker 0: people will look at and laugh in the same way.

410
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,620
Speaker 1: Yep, well like all the old sci-fi still assume we'd have these big CRTs everywhere, right?

411
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:56,087
Speaker 1: like in Information.

412
00:29:56,107 --> 00:29:57,880
Speaker 1: take it's interesting all sci-fi.

413
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,274
Speaker 1: there seems to be this trend that the main thing everyone got wrong is.

414
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:09,240
Speaker 1: they assume that like Material science and AI stuff would get way advanced, but they didn't anticipate information technology.

415
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,880
Speaker 0: I think I don't think that's the thing that he didn't anticipate it.

416
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,600
Speaker 0: I think it's like, you know, I always tell people when you're making a game, right?

417
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,985
Speaker 0: There's a thing that your game does.

418
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:19,655
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you should focus on that and everything else.

419
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:20,840
Speaker 0: just do what's normal, right?

420
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:24,900
Speaker 0: So if you're making a sci-fi, maybe your sci-fi is about time travel.

421
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:30,256
Speaker 0: So you focus on that time travel part and that's the stuff that you really develop the lore around.

422
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:32,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all the other stuff It's like you don't have time to.

423
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:41,460
Speaker 0: it's really hard to also Futuristically think about all the other parts of the society because the the time travel central to your time travel story.

424
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:51,680
Speaker 0: So that part is like super fleshed out and is futuristic but like Really someone time travels and there's computers and it's like well, there's just computers.

425
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:52,946
Speaker 0: You can't really.

426
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:55,880
Speaker 0: how much effort can you put into bringing that full?

427
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:09,280
Speaker 1: I think it partly shows because it's specifically with information technology like information technology head is the one science that really has grown at a Terrifying exponential rate like it was information technology that grew not space.

428
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,201
Speaker 0: So the how part was right and the space part was wrong like in 2019.

429
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:17,920
Speaker 0: It didn't have to be wrong if we would have invested, you know properly and continued to invest.

430
00:31:18,763 --> 00:31:20,510
Speaker 0: We would be better than I'll bet.

431
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:26,000
Speaker 1: not because the main difference is that information technology Isn't as tied to physical.

432
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,480
Speaker 0: Laws of physics are in the way.

433
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,383
Speaker 0: But yeah We would.

434
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,972
Speaker 0: we could be further along than we are now.

435
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:43,159
Speaker 1: like we always say with ghost in the shell We the meme warfare and I say that seriously like I'm not joking Meme warfare in 2019 is already more advanced and more terrifying than what happens in ghost in the shell.

436
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,826
Speaker 1: yet We don't have cybernetic bodies.

437
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:45,831
Speaker 0: Oh, damn it.

438
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,478
Speaker 1: Like why do I part?

439
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,840
Speaker 1: I want Why do we get the worst parts of these dystopian cyberpunk futures, but now I want the good parts only.

440
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,229
Speaker 1: That's why do we have Russian like meme warfare?

441
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,920
Speaker 1: shit posters, but I don't have an awesome sexy cyber body.

442
00:31:58,061 --> 00:31:59,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, give me that sexy server.

443
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:06,040
Speaker 1: Yeah So, uh, the other thing is I wish the book had not mentioned specific dollar amounts of things.

444
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,319
Speaker 1: I feel like that's an easy trap to avoid because they talk a lot about.

445
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:12,455
Speaker 1: yeah How many hundred thousand dollar a year people made?

446
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:17,429
Speaker 1: this is like wow $100,000 a year does not hire advanced people.

447
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:25,779
Speaker 0: Yeah an actual discovery trip to you know Would cost trillions I guess to go to Saturn.

448
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,830
Speaker 0: I imagine the amount of fuel.

449
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,540
Speaker 0: you would need the size of the ship the moon But they're space stations.

450
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:39,041
Speaker 1: They had all those aspects track with like modern sci-fi like the space docks are all right Like.

451
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:40,770
Speaker 1: all that stuff is actually pretty.

452
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:41,072
Speaker 1: it's like.

453
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:42,540
Speaker 0: that is how we do it.

454
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:44,930
Speaker 0: Focus a lot on you know, the fact it's like.

455
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,954
Speaker 0: well, there's no gravity.

456
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:47,280
Speaker 0: That means it's got to be like this.

457
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,545
Speaker 0: You got a tether like that.

458
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:54,451
Speaker 0: You got all these things that you know, they're not making up Stuff like magic right out in space.

459
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,300
Speaker 0: So it's all the other thing.

460
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:57,664
Speaker 0: I don't know if it.

461
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:01,556
Speaker 0: you know, people always argue about what hard sci-fi means but it's hard sci-fi enough.

462
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's hard enough.

463
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:06,960
Speaker 1: and also I made maybe I miss remember to the movie.

464
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,967
Speaker 1: but the other thing that really stood out to me is that there's one little chapter in the book that is like Here's where the aliens came from.

465
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:15,416
Speaker 1: Here's exactly what they were thinking in detail.

466
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:16,460
Speaker 1: Here's the reality.

467
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:17,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.

468
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,019
Speaker 1: it just explains it like oh they did this.

469
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,304
Speaker 1: This is their space.

470
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:25,805
Speaker 0: when he's on his journey right after he goes into the the full of stars monolith Yeah, it's like.

471
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:29,865
Speaker 0: oh he went to outer space Grand Central terminal Yeah, and then he's here's this.

472
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:34,238
Speaker 1: here's a precursor technology that they abandoned because they became energy lifeforms like you do.

473
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:36,599
Speaker 0: right You know, he's now he's in this room.

474
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,412
Speaker 0: It's basically some sort of prison slash zoo thing that the aliens made on purpose.

475
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:42,073
Speaker 0: clearly

476
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:57,613
Speaker 1: the aliens made like the thought Willed this space around him into existence to have him safe long enough to prepare him for what they were about to do to him Which was turn him into one of them send him back to earth and say alright You know enough about humans and now you're a space.

477
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,199
Speaker 1: You're a baby version of us.

478
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:02,320
Speaker 1: Make humans turn into us, right?

479
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,209
Speaker 1: Make humans have a chance to do whatever it is.

480
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:06,474
Speaker 1: They're gonna do in the cosmos.

481
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:07,780
Speaker 0: Oh go be the god of humans.

482
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,632
Speaker 1: Yep, you're you're a and I love that.

483
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:17,632
Speaker 1: the a lot of people who don't Get things like they watch a movie like the kinds of people in this in 1968.

484
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:19,799
Speaker 0: my interpretation of the movie was not far off.

485
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,585
Speaker 0: No, it was not exact.

486
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:28,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like you can tell the kind of person who says oh, yeah It's a space baby in the end and didn't get it.

487
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,960
Speaker 1: cuz clearly space baby is just a metaphor.

488
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:46,543
Speaker 1: He sees himself like a baby because he is a baby of this other race now with human memories and human ideas and that's the way to bridge the Gulf of space and time between what these beings became and What like.

489
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:51,518
Speaker 1: what is necessary to help humans get to the next level because they're benevolent aliens.

490
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,510
Speaker 0: They're nice They want to help you but they made humans.

491
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:54,920
Speaker 0: Yeah effectively, right?

492
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,677
Speaker 0: Well, they helped monkey become human and beat leopard and now they you know, they're.

493
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:01,927
Speaker 0: they're not evil They're not like Independence Day.

494
00:35:02,129 --> 00:35:02,330
Speaker 1: Yep.

495
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:04,000
Speaker 0: They want good stuff to happen.

496
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,446
Speaker 1: I like that story a lot.

497
00:35:05,526 --> 00:35:15,639
Speaker 1: it the book has a lot of echoes of Specific things in the culture series that the culture series clearly based on this book and books like it.

498
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:19,379
Speaker 0: What's really great about this story as a whole in in both forms?

499
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:23,676
Speaker 0: Is that it is not a story of heroes and villains?

500
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:24,560
Speaker 1: Oh at all.

501
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:32,740
Speaker 1: Like our may our protagonists like the hell Situation is resolved and not that many pages and he just does it and he feels bad about it.

502
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:34,659
Speaker 1: He does what he needs to do the to me.

503
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:41,319
Speaker 0: You know all the main characters of every part are extremely confident and not stupid or any way.

504
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, right how isn't even evil?

505
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:50,102
Speaker 0: or you know hell just panics Which is how was just messed up for reasons that are explained in 2010.

506
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:57,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in this book in a vacuum hell had a crisis of conscience because he was made by humans who didn't fully understand How a I work.

507
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:58,169
Speaker 1: you mean you.

508
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,260
Speaker 1: it tells you very clearly how hell's are made.

509
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:07,275
Speaker 1: They're made by making this crazy AI and then just teaching it Like growing like it grows up like it's.

510
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,240
Speaker 1: there's a baby hell.

511
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:11,240
Speaker 0: I was just like, you know erode basically not evil.

512
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:15,420
Speaker 1: Hell had a crisis of conscience because he was told to lie to people and didn't know how to handle that.

513
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,427
Speaker 1: So we tried to like he messed up.

514
00:36:17,728 --> 00:36:20,417
Speaker 1: Yep, like it's sad like he's programmed poorly.

515
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:21,260
Speaker 0: so there's any villains.

516
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:26,140
Speaker 0: You know, it was the ones who programmed how to lie or raised poorly.

517
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:29,553
Speaker 0: Well, that's he was according to 2010 his program for according to 2001.

518
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:29,895
Speaker 1: He was raised.

519
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:35,580
Speaker 0: He was raised but people who raised him weren't the ones who told him to lie.

520
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:39,513
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is the government was but the government wasn't malicious in doing so.

521
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,640
Speaker 0: they thought they were doing it for a good reason.

522
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:46,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so it's like there wasn't anyone with evil or malicious intent anywhere in the story.

523
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:51,674
Speaker 0: not the aliens not humans like even like a little bit of Cold War conflict.

524
00:36:51,995 --> 00:37:02,279
Speaker 0: because but it's 1968 but they've seemed to have written it such that yeah, they're still sort of competing but not really, you know evil nuclear war.

525
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:11,563
Speaker 1: competing like it implies that humans are much are very unified and that the Cold War is becoming a legacy thing because it makes a mention of the Russia Soviet bloc.

526
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:22,488
Speaker 1: like Russia and the USSR and the US are basically allies now and China is like the quote-unquote adversary But in a more cooperative way like it's.

527
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,820
Speaker 1: it implies that humans are close to having a unified government.

528
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:28,147
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but that's backstory.

529
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:32,484
Speaker 0: Yeah, he meets, you know, the Russian dude in the space station and they're friendly and he's like, hey How you doing?

530
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,420
Speaker 0: They're all still separate because of the space station.

531
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,080
Speaker 0: They stole this immigration stuff all the separate but it makes that clear point of you go through.

532
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,534
Speaker 0: They're not sharing all their secrets with each other, but yeah hearing some.

533
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:45,163
Speaker 1: but like you go through immigration spying But they're not.

534
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:49,260
Speaker 0: like he doesn't come back to earth to see that it's been destroyed in nuclear warfare.

535
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:59,195
Speaker 1: well in fact when he comes back to other stories when he comes back to earth a Unified earth government launches nukes at him because they're scared and he's just like oh they're nuking.

536
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,960
Speaker 1: I guess I'll just turn the nukes off.

537
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,464
Speaker 1: Sorry guys.

538
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:03,929
Speaker 1: You're not gonna nuke me.

539
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,520
Speaker 1: I came out of a literal Sun like just now.

540
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:15,134
Speaker 1: I Like the book a lot and I feel like the book is required reading material.

541
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:22,520
Speaker 1: if you've watched the movie and vice-versa Mmm, because I want to watch the movie again shouldn't have gone so long without reading that book and see it.

542
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, I should.

543
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,180
Speaker 1: I should have read this book when I was in elementary school.

544
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,540
Speaker 0: 2010 is a lot, you know as a movie is a lot less.

545
00:38:32,822 --> 00:38:34,369
Speaker 0: You know, it's not directed by Kubrick, right?

546
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,796
Speaker 0: So it's 2010 is still a good movie.

547
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:39,309
Speaker 0: That's the Europa one Right, but it doesn't have.

548
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:42,440
Speaker 0: it's not a lot of interpretive imagery and stuff like that.

549
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,001
Speaker 0: It's much more straightforward like people doing this people doing that people do and this people doing that It's.

550
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:48,202
Speaker 0: it's.

551
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:49,949
Speaker 0: it's more like reading this book.

552
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,640
Speaker 0: Very just explicit what happens, you know?

553
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,197
Speaker 0: Not a lot of metaphors or symbologies or anything like that.

554
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,725
Speaker 0: So symbolism, I wonder if both.

555
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:07,379
Speaker 0: I wonder if the 2010 book how that differs from the 2010 movie which I've seen the 2010 movie within the past year.

556
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:16,175
Speaker 1: I saw it when we were at RIT because we kept we we were right where for whatever reason we were all Referencing Europa so much that I watched.

557
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,040
Speaker 0: that was probably my fault.

558
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I. so I just like.

559
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:22,398
Speaker 1: I downloaded it from the Direct Connect and watched it again just randomly.

560
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,651
Speaker 1: Mmm I remember I watched it in that one has a lot.

561
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:27,860
Speaker 0: 2010 is a lot more Cold War action.

562
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, right then 2001 does.

563
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:35,500
Speaker 1: the good news is 2001. the book and the movie like just stand alone very powerfully.

564
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:39,776
Speaker 1: You don't need to read or watch any more to get a lot out of them.

565
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,103
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I'm really.

566
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:47,124
Speaker 1: I really wish I'd read this book back in elementary school instead of waiting until 2019 to read the 2001 book from 1968.

567
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:53,652
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Is there anything else we should point out?

568
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:54,299
Speaker 1: I think we're good.

569
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,400
Speaker 0: I'm sure you know.

570
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,259
Speaker 0: This is the kind of book where people much smarter than us have much more smarter things to say about it.

571
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:04,154
Speaker 1: I mean the the main thing I got out of.

572
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:10,021
Speaker 1: the only two things I really got out of it that I didn't get out of the movie were One.

573
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:16,080
Speaker 1: the pair like that you could not get out of the movie is the parallel between the leopard and hell.

574
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:19,160
Speaker 1: Like that is something I could not have gotten out of the movie.

575
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,273
Speaker 1: I don't think and I think that is a very important theme.

576
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,060
Speaker 0: I remember if the leopard was even in the moon.

577
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:26,785
Speaker 0: I don't think it was I died.

578
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:31,400
Speaker 0: some other small differences in the movie are like like the monolith is a different color for reasons.

579
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,792
Speaker 0: Well, no, the monolith is black in the book except at the beginning of it's.

580
00:40:34,993 --> 00:40:36,478
Speaker 0: it's it's clear sometimes in the.

581
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,360
Speaker 1: well Because it did the monolith that's clear is doing shit.

582
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,320
Speaker 1: The monolith is black is a black body so you won't detect it until you're ready and so it could absorb energy.

583
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,122
Speaker 1: You know, there's.

584
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,031
Speaker 1: and then there's like there's sci-fi reasons why it's black.

585
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:56,999
Speaker 0: when the doctors on the space station in the movie He talks to the Russian guy and like these two women and I think on the space station in the book It's just the Russian guy.

586
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think the discussion he has with his daughter on earth is different and some you know It's really small stuff.

587
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:14,120
Speaker 0: That doesn't matter for the big picture the actual message book or the core It's all this like this side ancillary stuff that you really literally could be anything and doesn't mean much.

588
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:20,503
Speaker 1: Yeah like you get out of the book a hundred percent that the monolith is a black body like Vantablack or whatever.

589
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:25,339
Speaker 1: like it is black for a reason a sci-fi reason.

590
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:36,134
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, if you listen to all this and you didn't read the book just read the book Like even if you've seen the movie even if you haven't seen the movie this book is.

591
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,660
Speaker 1: there's a reason why?

592
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,680
Speaker 1: 2001 a Space Odyssey is so important and so remembered and so referenced.

593
00:41:42,523 --> 00:41:46,297
Speaker 1: The book is really good and it takes like three hours to read.

594
00:41:46,357 --> 00:41:49,530
Speaker 1: It's not long It's super sure like I mean.
