1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,701
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 17th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,590
Speaker 1: Tonight, we rant and rant about tech support.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,508
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,755
Speaker 1: So we had another awesome weekend.

5
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:22,666
Speaker 1: We had a Katsu out here, played some new board games.

6
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:23,509
Speaker 1: we've gotten and such.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,830
Speaker 0: Crazy new board games that take way too long to play.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, goddamn.

9
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:28,886
Speaker 0: Got-damn.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,269
Speaker 1: Though, uh, we ran afoul of what I can only assume are punk kids.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,950
Speaker 1: Now we've lived here for a while, and we've never had any sort of incident with any of the people around here.

12
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:39,389
Speaker 0: No trouble with the law.

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

14
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:47,709
Speaker 1: Now, uh... Our friend Katsu, you may know him from the forums as that guy who hates everyone and everything that lives and breathes.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,890
Speaker 1: Well, he parked his car in front of our house, and we got hung out all weekend.

16
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,309
Speaker 1: And Saturday night, his car alarm starts going off.

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,510
Speaker 1: He looks out the window, doesn't see anything wrong, turns it off, and goes back to sleep.

18
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:04,647
Speaker 1: In the morning, he discovers that his car has been egged.

19
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:12,750
Speaker 0: Now, um, my only logical conclusion can be random acts of punk kids.

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:23,750
Speaker 1: I mean, for those of you who don't know where we live, and we live in Beacon, New York, and we have a nice big house, but right across the street from us is a giant car dealership full of cars.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,187
Speaker 1: Brand new nice ones.

22
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:30,966
Speaker 1: And our cars were both parked in our driveways with funny license plates.

23
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,150
Speaker 1: We both have vanity plates.

24
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:40,690
Speaker 1: And the area in the front of our house is extremely well-lit and barren, and it's rather, um, difficult to hide.

25
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,670
Speaker 0: The only thing I can guess is that it was Easter, so they had eggs.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,360
Speaker 1: Yep.

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,725
Speaker 0: And also, it, uh, Katsu's car was from out of state, so they figured, "Ha ha!

28
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:53,427
Speaker 0: Out of

29
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:54,129
Speaker 0: state."

30
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:55,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

31
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:59,310
Speaker 1: Now, for those of you who don't know also, eggs basically can ruin a car.

32
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:02,290
Speaker 1: So if you ever get the urge to egg someone's car, don't.

33
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,870
Speaker 1: Because one, if they catch you, they'll kill you, and two, you're just a damn punk kid.

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,130
Speaker 0: Unless, of course, um, they're a fucker, in which case, egg their car all you want.

35
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,074
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

36
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:19,130
Speaker 1: You never get revenge or any sort of thing like that in such an underhanded, stupid way.

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,450
Speaker 1: Uh, word of the movie quote, you don't mess with a man's car.

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,420
Speaker 0: Well, you do it in a clever way.

39
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,709
Speaker 0: See, you don't just egg their car.

40
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,650
Speaker 0: What you do is you set their car in a precarious position with uncracked eggs.

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:37,170
Speaker 1: Um, you know, much better is to just ignore them, or if they did something bad, call the police on them.

42
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,717
Speaker 0: Well, depending on what they did.

43
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,329
Speaker 1: Sometimes... If someone's just an idiot or a jerk, just let 'em be.

44
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,310
Speaker 1: I mean, we have some people we know who are idiots and jerks, and we just ignore 'em.

45
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do.

46
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:47,969
Speaker 0: But, uh, you know...

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,529
Speaker 1: Sometimes we make fun of 'em when we're sitting around alone and we're bored, but that's about it.

48
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:59,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if someone, like, came to fuck with us, but they didn't... They fucked with us, but they didn't cross the line to breaking the law, we just fucked with them back, you know?

49
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:02,129
Speaker 1: Ah, you say that, but we've never done that.

50
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,170
Speaker 0: Because no one's ever come to fuck with us, they know better.

51
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

52
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:05,409
Speaker 1: That's true.

53
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:06,816
Speaker 0: You know?

54
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,269
Speaker 0: It's because they know.

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,147
Speaker 1: In actual news, anyway, it's Tech Day.

56
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:11,650
Speaker 1: It's Monday.

57
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:21,270
Speaker 1: Actually, this Friday, we're driving out to Rochester for Toracon, which, while we've been to many cons as geek nights, this is the first con we were officially doing a panel at.

58
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,670
Speaker 1: It's going to be followed by Katsucon and Otacon and all that sort of thing, but that's what we're doing.

59
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,248
Speaker 0: So if you're anywhere within, uh, going distance to Rochester, New York, come see us.

60
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,788
Speaker 1: Yep, we're putting on a show.

61
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:41,215
Speaker 1: Anyway, in the news, um, Patrick Moore, who is one of the co-founders... Yeah.

62
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,409
Speaker 0: Bloody Lupins.

63
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,469
Speaker 0: Dennis Moore.

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,849
Speaker 1: He's one of the co-founders of Greenpeace.

65
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:51,750
Speaker 1: And he has recently come out as being a staunch, staunch supporter of nuclear power.

66
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,470
Speaker 1: I find this incredible, wonderful, and fantastic.

67
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:06,490
Speaker 1: He has basically decried the bullshit that Greenpeace comes to stand for today, and he now talks real environmentalism, as in logical environmentalism.

68
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,809
Speaker 0: Well, at least on one issue.

69
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,198
Speaker 1: Yeah.

70
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,559
Speaker 0: Who knows about all the rest?

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,610
Speaker 0: He's probably still batshit.

72
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,775
Speaker 1: He doesn't seem to be.

73
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:14,909
Speaker 1: Most of his opinions seem very, uh, coherent now.

74
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,228
Speaker 1: Which is a far cry from what Greenpeace seems to stand for these days.

75
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, Greenpeace is just a tool that's bought and sold by crazy hippies and whatnot, so...

76
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,910
Speaker 1: But basically he wrote this long thing, and he's been a staunch etiquette now of just nuclear power.

77
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,970
Speaker 1: He goes to great lengths to dispel many of the myths about nuclear power.

78
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,830
Speaker 1: Namely, that it's dangerous, or that it's inefficient, or that it's expensive.

79
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:41,348
Speaker 0: Sounds like the people paying Greenpeace to hate nuclear power didn't pay up.

80
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:44,016
Speaker 1: I mean, really.

81
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,410
Speaker 1: Nothing bothers me more than an environmentalist who is also against nuclear power.

82
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:50,943
Speaker 1: Coal power plants.

83
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:51,490
Speaker 1: One coal plant.

84
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,884
Speaker 0: Nothing bothers you more than that?

85
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:53,450
Speaker 0: Nothing at all?

86
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,829
Speaker 1: Uh, no, that's pretty much one of the biggest things that bothers me.

87
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,561
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,509
Speaker 1: It's at least tied with many of the other things that bother me.

89
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,429
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things.

90
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but many things don't bother me that much, because most things I just don't care about.

91
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:06,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

92
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,350
Speaker 1: This is something I care about, because in the very least, nuclear power means that there'll be less pollution around me, and my electricity will be cheaper.

93
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I care about the cheaper electricity.

94
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,770
Speaker 0: Don't really so much care about pollution, whatever.

95
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,650
Speaker 1: Well, that's because you lead a sedentary lifestyle sitting inside the house.

96
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,270
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

97
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,766
Speaker 0: Yes, you do.

98
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,324
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

99
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,720
Speaker 0: What's with you and the sedentary lifestyle?

100
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,230
Speaker 0: It's like the only words you know anymore.

101
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,025
Speaker 1: Ah, you lead a sedentary lifestyle.

102
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:29,530
Speaker 1: What can I say?

103
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,130
Speaker 0: You lead a sedentary lifestyle.

104
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:32,888
Speaker 1: Uh, but I don't.

105
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,070
Speaker 0: You lead a sedimentary lifestyle.

106
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:39,950
Speaker 1: Uh, yes, as opposed to an igneous sedimentary lifestyle.

107
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,464
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, if you all out there can't tell, we're tired today.

108
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,690
Speaker 1: I promise a better show tomorrow.

109
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,161
Speaker 0: Geology jokes.

110
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:46,829
Speaker 0: A new low.

111
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,590
Speaker 1: So anyway, nuclear power good.

112
00:05:51,251 --> 00:06:01,570
Speaker 1: I could go into great detail about nuclear power and why I'm an advocate of it and why I really dislike people who are opponents of it, mostly because many of them are very ignorant of the benefits of nuclear power.

113
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,510
Speaker 1: But I'll save that for an entire Monday episode of The Future.

114
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, just so everyone knows, if you're one of those idiots, nuclear power not equal nuclear bomb.

115
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,010
Speaker 1: Yes, nuclear power equal equal awesome.

116
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,254
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

117
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,247
Speaker 0: Alright, I got two little newses.

118
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:23,930
Speaker 0: The first news, uh, only really crazy, smart technology people understand or care.

119
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:31,009
Speaker 0: MySQL, which is a database that everyone uses to run forums and things, I mean, and blogs and all that, we use it.

120
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,950
Speaker 0: Um, it has a storage engine.

121
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,330
Speaker 0: Actually, the way MySQL is written is you can choose which storage engine you want.

122
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:48,090
Speaker 0: And there are all kinds of storage engines, but, uh, InnoDB or InnoBase is, uh, perhaps the most full-featured storage engine.

123
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,530
Speaker 0: It's what comes with MySQL nowadays and it's what everyone uses because it's awesome and it makes things work well.

124
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,050
Speaker 0: It works a lot better than, say, I don't know, a file.

125
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:03,190
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm not going to explain the details of how it works and the advantages and whatnot because no one cares.

126
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,808
Speaker 1: We'll do a Monday episode on that.

127
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a little bit, that's way too complicated, actually, for an episode of Geek Nights.

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,262
Speaker 0: But anyway, Oracle bought InnoDB.

129
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,187
Speaker 0: Ooh.

130
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,590
Speaker 1: Now, obviously, they're probably not going to want people to be using the thing they bought for free.

131
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:30,030
Speaker 0: Well, you see, the thing is, InnoDB had, uh, there's a proprietary version of it, but the version MySQL is using is, like, a GPL version.

132
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,330
Speaker 0: The thing is, InnoDB, like, the company kind of worked on it and now they're not going to do that anymore.

133
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:43,030
Speaker 0: So MySQL is like, crap, now we're stuck with this, like, stagnant, you know, storage engine.

134
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:54,170
Speaker 0: So now they're getting SolidDB to help them out and the company SolidDB is going to make a GPL version that can be plugged into MySQL so everyone can stop using InnoDB.

135
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,350
Speaker 0: The situation here is that there are, uh, thousands and thousands of databases out there using InnoDB.

136
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:14,833
Speaker 0: If anyone ever finds a problem with InnoDB and, you know, we need InnoDB to fix it and, you know, no one can fix it, find a way to fix it or patch it or whatever, there could potentially be a trouble.

137
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:31,230
Speaker 0: Like, there's a very slim chance, or at least a probability, that every MySQL database in the world will either have to, you know, go through a lot, a lot of trouble to switch storage engines, which is not easy or painless.

138
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, though I do imagine that people, there would be a brisk market in people making things that would somewhat automate that.

139
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not something you do lightly.

140
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,604
Speaker 0: But anyway, Oracle's a fucker.

141
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, talk about being evil.

142
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually work with Oracle stuff quite a bit in my job and I'm not a fan.

143
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, they can't make better technology so they just buy the technology that the other guy's using.

144
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,732
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't care about that.

145
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:04,450
Speaker 1: The only thing I really care about is the fact that I don't think any of you out there who don't work for large corporations realize how much Oracle database costs.

146
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:05,950
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

147
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,517
Speaker 1: It's unfathomable how much money it costs.

148
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:13,690
Speaker 1: And it's really not significantly better than other offerings on the market.

149
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,370
Speaker 0: It's not much better than MySQL, which is free.

150
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:17,430
Speaker 0: Yeah.

151
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,270
Speaker 0: So, oh, I can buy Oracle for a hajillion dollars and it's a tiny bit better than free MySQL.

152
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,389
Speaker 1: Hell, even DB2 isn't so bad.

153
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:26,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

154
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:27,333
Speaker 0: Alright.

155
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:37,790
Speaker 0: So, also, there's a whole bunch of news lately with Apple Records, which is the Beatles record label, suing Apple Computer and all this bullshit.

156
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,770
Speaker 1: This has been going on for a long, long time.

157
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, who cares, whatever.

158
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,630
Speaker 1: Well, for anyone who doesn't know, the basics of it is simply that a long time ago, Apple Computer, you know, comes into existence.

159
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,654
Speaker 1: And Apple Records already existed.

160
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:58,690
Speaker 1: And after a long fight, the agreement was basically that, alright, Apple Computer can be called Apple, as long as they don't ever make a record label.

161
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,910
Speaker 0: As long as they don't do anything with music.

162
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,511
Speaker 1: Yeah.

163
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,822
Speaker 1: And Apple said, fine, we would never do anything with music.

164
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,430
Speaker 1: And fast forward to the years.

165
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,333
Speaker 0: iPod, iTunes, dun dun dun.

166
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,596
Speaker 0: Anyway, who cares about that story?

167
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:21,034
Speaker 0: The story is that finally, after not doing it for a zillion years, the Beatles, someone's digitally remastering the Beatles music and they're gonna put it online for sale somewhere.

168
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:31,630
Speaker 0: Now, the only thing I want to point out here is that, why is the big story that the 40-year-old music is finally going to be available online for purchase?

169
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:37,263
Speaker 0: Well, one- Where no one's making a story out of the one-year-old music, or perhaps not even the five-year-old music.

170
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,950
Speaker 0: No, the big important music is the 40-year-old music.

171
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,010
Speaker 1: Well, one, the Beatles were one of the most popular bands ever.

172
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:48,097
Speaker 0: The point is, is that no one's been good enough since then to be better than they are.

173
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:57,170
Speaker 0: Basically, by the fact that this story is bigger than all the other stories, shows that a band with half of its members is dead.

174
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,522
Speaker 0: Well, it could also be- Is more popular than every band since.

175
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,960
Speaker 1: It could also just be the fact that now this music is available digitally, in a better format, even though it's old.

176
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:12,610
Speaker 1: And it's not news that other music is available that way, because it's always been available that way.

177
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:18,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that other music, no one's- there's a lot of music out there that is also not available digitally.

178
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,245
Speaker 1: I think you're reading way too much into this.

179
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,886
Speaker 0: The 40-year-old band is more popular than any band since then.

180
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:25,730
Speaker 0: That's the point.

181
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:28,097
Speaker 1: Eh, nah, maybe not.

182
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,550
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a lot of kids today who don't know or care about the Beatles.

183
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true, but those kids don't really count.

184
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,390
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

185
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,930
Speaker 0: Because those kids don't pay for music.

186
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,532
Speaker 1: Okay.

187
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:42,964
Speaker 1: I just don't think you're reading way too much into this.

188
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,090
Speaker 1: I don't think it's news at all.

189
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,011
Speaker 0: Whatever.

190
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,257
Speaker 0: I just think it's interesting.

191
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:49,009
Speaker 0: Like, oh, the old music is the one they make a big deal out of.

192
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:49,485
Speaker 0: Eh?

193
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,029
Speaker 0: It shows about the music industry sucking and such.

194
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:55,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, the music industry sucks, but there's still a lot of good music out there.

195
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but their 40-year-old music is like their ace in the hole.

196
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:18,220
Speaker 0: So, you may or may not be aware, there is an activity that British punk kids, uh, not punks as in, you know, real punks, but punk kids partake in, known as happy slapping.

197
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,240
Speaker 1: It's pathetically stupid.

198
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Speaker 0: Right, so basically the idea of happy slapping is you go down the street, or in a public place or wherever, and you find someone who looks, uh, unsuspecting, and you slap them in the face and then you run away or something.

199
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:38,539
Speaker 1: Now, it's slowly evolved until it's basically happy punch a guy in the face as hard as you can.

200
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, that seems to be.

201
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:50,200
Speaker 0: what happens pretty often is, uh, you know, they'll just walk down the street, hit someone and run, because they think it's funny, and it's like this popular thing to do, and it's kind of stupid.

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,776
Speaker 0: So, there's a video I've linked to here, and it's hilarious.

203
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:06,718
Speaker 0: You see this punk kid who looks, you know, like he's pretty tough, doesn't look too wussy, and he's all excited and British, and he's like, "Alright, we're gonna, I'm gonna be a happy slapper today,

204
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,199
Speaker 0: alright!".

205
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:09,339
Speaker 0: The next guy who comes out of there, right?

206
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,600
Speaker 0: Then it looks like they, the camera moves over, it looks like a video arcade with a bunch of crane machines out front.

207
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:21,760
Speaker 0: And the guy walks, a guy walks out, and our happy slapper walks over and slaps him and runs.

208
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,620
Speaker 0: Now, the happy slapper goes off camera, but soon you realize he hasn't gone very far.

209
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:33,360
Speaker 0: And the guy who got slapped turns around, comes over, and punches him in the face.

210
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,460
Speaker 0: And he gets knocked out immediately.

211
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,900
Speaker 0: And it's, it's quite satisfying, especially when the guy kicks him while he's on the ground.

212
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:48,119
Speaker 1: Yep, I love the stream of British profanity that comes all, to me it just sounded like, "Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar,

213
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,300
Speaker 1: roar!".

214
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then the guy's like, "Fuckhead, or

215
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:50,657
Speaker 0: something.".

216
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:55,259
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest video quality, but the content more than makes up for it.

217
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,079
Speaker 1: He lays the guy out.

218
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy's just like laying on the ground motionless, and he kicks him, and then he leaves.

219
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,219
Speaker 1: That's about how I'd react if someone tried to happy slap me.

220
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,560
Speaker 0: If someone slapped me, I would kick them squat in the nuts.

221
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:08,599
Speaker 0: In the nuts!

222
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:09,380
Speaker 0: In the nuts.

223
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:10,519
Speaker 0: Right.

224
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,740
Speaker 1: So, uh, Jack Thompson.

225
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:14,417
Speaker 0: Great.

226
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:15,557
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,419
Speaker 0: When's the last time we mentioned Jack Thompson?

228
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,579
Speaker 1: Uh, last year, I think.

229
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how many times did we mention him?

230
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:22,259
Speaker 1: At least three.

231
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:22,799
Speaker 0: Alright.

232
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:29,239
Speaker 1: Now, at least two of the last times we mentioned him, I said, "Well, we'll probably never have anything funny to say about him

233
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,460
Speaker 1: again.".

234
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,639
Speaker 1: He'll never be in the news again.

235
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:33,518
Speaker 1: He's in the news again.

236
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,088
Speaker 1: Great.

237
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:44,460
Speaker 1: Um, he's suing the Florida Bar Association, claiming that they harassed him by investigating the fact that he's a total douche.

238
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:49,379
Speaker 0: You can't sue a bunch of lawyers.

239
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,220
Speaker 1: He sued the Florida Bar because they investigated him and found him to be very incompetent.

240
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,100
Speaker 1: They found that he has violated many of the standards and practices of the bar.

241
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:07,040
Speaker 1: If they haven't already, they're gonna disbar him, but now he's suing, saying that this is all crap and that it's some sort of vendetta against him.

242
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,320
Speaker 0: Trying to sue lawyers, it's like...

243
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,600
Speaker 1: But he is a lawyer.

244
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 0: I know, but you're trying to sue the lawyer group, even though you're a lawyer.

245
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,940
Speaker 1: Well, apparently, he's sued them before.

246
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,200
Speaker 0: It's like trying to burn down the firehouse if you're a fireman that no one likes.

247
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,940
Speaker 1: But he sued them a while ago.

248
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,000
Speaker 1: I think it was settled out of court as something to do with the fact that they investigated him possibly being insane.

249
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,159
Speaker 0: He is insane.

250
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now we have proof.

251
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,860
Speaker 1: I can't wait for this lawsuit to get resolved.

252
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Speaker 0: I hope the bar doesn't puss out and actually puts him in his place.

253
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,481
Speaker 1: You know what?

254
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:43,500
Speaker 1: If they do, and he still gets to practice law, we'll just get more fodder for geek nights.

255
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:54,338
Speaker 0: I think it'd be much more humorous if he couldn't be a lawyer anymore and he had no way to get money and he turned into a homeless bum and then gamers would go and he'd be like, "Five bucks hit me in the

256
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:54,658
Speaker 0: face.".

257
00:15:55,781 --> 00:16:00,493
Speaker 0: You know like those guys who sit in the street with a sign like, "Pay one dollar, then curse at

258
00:16:00,513 --> 00:16:00,774
Speaker 0: me.".

259
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:01,616
Speaker 0: You know?

260
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:02,920
Speaker 0: You see those guys?

261
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 1: No, I've never seen those guys.

262
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,478
Speaker 0: Oh, they're guys like that.

263
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:06,198
Speaker 0: Okay.

264
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,432
Speaker 0: They'll have a sign that'll say something like, you know, "Pick on me.

265
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,074
Speaker 0: Five bucks.

266
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:12,238
Speaker 0: Tell me off.

267
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:12,458
Speaker 0: Two

268
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:12,880
Speaker 0: dollars.".

269
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,796
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of guys who have the signs that they think are clever like, "I'm going by smokes and beer.

270
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:19,858
Speaker 1: Least I ain't shitting

271
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:19,999
Speaker 1: you.".

272
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:20,843
Speaker 0: Yep.

273
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:22,900
Speaker 0: Everyone's got a little shtick.

274
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,225
Speaker 0: They live on that shtick.

275
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:29,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, if Jack Thompson became one of those guys, that would be a lot funnier.

276
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,904
Speaker 1: I just can't believe he's back in the news.

277
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:32,971
Speaker 1: I couldn't make it a news.

278
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,960
Speaker 1: I just didn't feel right, so I made it my thing of the day because I just couldn't believe it.

279
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:36,958
Speaker 0: I can believe it.

280
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,624
Speaker 1: When will it end?

281
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,267
Speaker 1: This time, I'm gonna say that I'll bet I'll talk- He is an old man.

282
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:43,520
Speaker 0: It will end in our lifetimes.

283
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Speaker 1: I bet I'll talk about Jack Thompson at least two more times within the next two years.

284
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:50,179
Speaker 0: I can guarantee that.

285
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:54,928
Speaker 1: So it's Tech Day, and today we decided we were going to talk about tech support.

286
00:16:55,369 --> 00:17:01,380
Speaker 1: Mostly in terms of doing tech support for friends or family or other associated malcontents.

287
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:09,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not talking about the job of actually being a tech support guy because that's not a good job and we never had that job on purpose.

288
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,321
Speaker 1: I almost did.

289
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:10,983
Speaker 1: I kinda did.

290
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:15,980
Speaker 1: I mean, technically, I was supposed to look at the problem queue when I worked for ITS at RIT.

291
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:16,739
Speaker 0: Yeah.

292
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,028
Speaker 1: But I never did.

293
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,439
Speaker 1: I usually just did other fun work.

294
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:20,048
Speaker 0: Yep.

295
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:20,839
Speaker 0: Good idea.

296
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,680
Speaker 1: Like sleep in my office or wander around campus.

297
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,319
Speaker 0: Much safer that way.

298
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:25,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

299
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:29,000
Speaker 1: Maybe snoop through a professor's email because they had trouble with their email.

300
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,720
Speaker 0: Mhm.

301
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:41,018
Speaker 0: Well, but, you know, as intelligent computer guys we are, other people who aren't so computer intelligent often ask us, you know, "How do you do this?

302
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:41,739
Speaker 0: Help me with that,".

303
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:42,180
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

304
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,484
Speaker 1: Now, it isn't just a problem for us.

305
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:48,151
Speaker 1: It's a problem that I think all computer geeks out there have run into.

306
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:52,260
Speaker 1: Your family decide they get a new computer and they bother you to help them with it.

307
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,969
Speaker 1: Your grandma calls you at four in the morning because their internet's broken.

308
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:59,980
Speaker 1: The lady who lives next door keeps asking you to fix your VCR.

309
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,701
Speaker 0: Mhm.

310
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:05,311
Speaker 0: I mean, it happens to a lot of people, you know, in some professions more than others.

311
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:09,620
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're a generic unskilled businessman, no one asks you any questions.

312
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:17,300
Speaker 0: But like, you know, if you're a tax lawyer, like my friend's dad, everyone always asks him around tax season, you know, questions and stuff.

313
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,692
Speaker 0: And my uncle's a dentist, so once in a while someone will come up to him and be like, "Can you look at my

314
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:21,993
Speaker 0: teeth?".

315
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,658
Speaker 0: And he always says, "Make an appointment at my

316
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:24,059
Speaker 0: office.".

317
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:36,178
Speaker 0: But when you're a computer guy, you don't, you know, unless you're someone who's like a PC doctor who people call up and you go to fix computers, then no one can really call you because it's not your job.

318
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,260
Speaker 0: You're working for someone else.

319
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:42,251
Speaker 1: But yet, people always seem to bother us about getting tech support.

320
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:42,752
Speaker 1: Mhm.

321
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:46,360
Speaker 1: I mean, it's getting to be a real problem in the geek industry.

322
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,648
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there are actual people who do that for a living.

323
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,232
Speaker 0: You can call them and ask them questions.

324
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:54,380
Speaker 0: You can go on the internet and ask questions and someone will answer them for free.

325
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:02,260
Speaker 1: I think the real problem I have is that many of the people who ask for help really get very kind of angry if I don't help them.

326
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:05,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't get angry at my uncle if he says, "Make an

327
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:05,989
Speaker 0: appointment.".

328
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:10,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't get angry at the doctor friend who refuses to take your appendix out for you on his weekend.

329
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you want to get your appendix out, go to the hospital.

330
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,140
Speaker 0: There's a doctor there who's going to do it because he's getting paid.

331
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,091
Speaker 1: I mean, the idea came up and we decided to do the show because a while back, there's a lady who lives downstairs.

332
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,519
Speaker 1: There's a basement apartment on our house and an old lady lives in it.

333
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:30,688
Speaker 1: And she said her DVD player didn't work and she wanted me to go, like, fix it.

334
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,180
Speaker 1: And I wander into her house and I'm poking around and she just doesn't have the remote control for the TV.

335
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,479
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, she found it.

336
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,259
Speaker 1: Oh, she did?

337
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,487
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:39,940
Speaker 0: Oh.

339
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:45,048
Speaker 1: So I can't set up the input on the TV, so I can't make the DVD player work.

340
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:53,360
Speaker 1: And she's mad because I can't help her and I'm kind of ticked because I was going to go somewhere and instead I'm roped into helping someone do something that I really don't care about.

341
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:58,058
Speaker 1: And then I can't even do it because I don't have the equipment and they can't give it to me.

342
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:06,154
Speaker 1: People seem to just forget that computers are just like any other profession and it's my job.

343
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:09,120
Speaker 1: When I'm not doing my job, I often don't want to be doing my job.

344
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is I don't do my job at my job.

345
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,149
Speaker 1: Yeah.

346
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:16,104
Speaker 0: But my job isn't helping other people with computers.

347
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,627
Speaker 0: It's making computers do things they don't already do.

348
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:19,508
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

349
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:20,750
Speaker 0: You know, I can't.

350
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:28,200
Speaker 0: I have the knowledge and ability to help you with computer problems because I have to know those things in order to make computers do things they don't already do.

351
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean, a lot of times we love to just help someone with a computer, help someone with technology on their own.

352
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,800
Speaker 1: The only problem comes is that a lot of people seem to expect that no matter what, like at any time.

353
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,839
Speaker 0: Or a lot of people make it very difficult to help them.

354
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,003
Speaker 1: That's probably the worst one.

355
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:48,376
Speaker 1: I mean, if someone asks me, like, on aim, "Uh, my video card doesn't work, blah, blah, blah.

356
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:48,696
Speaker 1: What do I

357
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:48,897
Speaker 1: do?"

358
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:49,659
Speaker 1: I'll say, "Oh, do

359
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:49,879
Speaker 1: this.".

360
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:56,000
Speaker 1: If they don't do what I told them and then they bother me again, that's not cool.

361
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't like the answer I give you, uh, I got two words.

362
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:00,218
Speaker 0: "Tough

363
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:00,459
Speaker 0: shit.".

364
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:06,852
Speaker 0: You know, the worst is, see, I don't like to just tell people things or do things for people.

365
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,020
Speaker 0: I like to make sure that they know what I'm doing for them.

366
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott, we're all aware of that.

367
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to make sure you learn how to fish.

368
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:16,920
Speaker 0: You know, teach a man to fish and all that.

369
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,930
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is... Teach a man to build a fire and he's warm for a few days.

370
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,440
Speaker 1: Set a man on fire and he's warm for the rest of his life.

371
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,358
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

372
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:33,659
Speaker 0: No, but, uh, when I go up to you and you say, "Man, I really wish I had some fish," I go, "Here, I'll show you how to catch

373
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:33,799
Speaker 0: them.".

374
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,800
Speaker 0: And if I try to hand you the rod and you just refuse to take hold of it and demand that I catch fish for you, I'm just going to push you in the fucking lake.

375
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:44,740
Speaker 0: And then if you're indignant, fuck you, I'm going to piss on you while you're down there.

376
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:45,214
Speaker 1: Okay.

377
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,840
Speaker 0: I don't know, I just tried to think of something you would do to someone while you're standing on a dock and they're swimming in the lake crying for help and you want to kind of put them down even more.

378
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,478
Speaker 1: Just laugh.

379
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, laughing is good.

380
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,099
Speaker 1: And then when they try to climb back up into the dock, push them off and then laugh again.

381
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:00,520
Speaker 1: Repeat, add infant item.

382
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,640
Speaker 0: So, let's see, what kind of things make me pissed off at people when I try to give them tech support?

383
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,260
Speaker 1: Well, the main thing is that most people will... Well, not most people, because actually at least none of our friends seem to do this.

384
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,439
Speaker 1: It's mostly relatives and people who are, like, business acquaintances who do this to us.

385
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,899
Speaker 1: But, like, someone will say, "Hey, I'm having trouble with my computer, can you help

386
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:23,020
Speaker 1: me?".

387
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,477
Speaker 1: And I'll say, "Yeah, sure, what's

388
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:24,720
Speaker 1: wrong?".

389
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,859
Speaker 1: And they'll say something so vague, like, "Well, the internet doesn't

390
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:29,080
Speaker 1: work.".

391
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:35,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you cannot describe to me the problem specifically enough, I can't help you.

392
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
Speaker 1: Now, you don't have to be a technologist.

393
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,440
Speaker 1: You don't have to say, like, "Yeah, well, UDP is being blocked on this port and blah blah blah, but I know my blah blah blah

394
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:43,540
Speaker 1: blah.".

395
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,200
Speaker 0: Because if you know that already, you probably don't need my help and you're smart enough to find the answer on Google.

396
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:53,520
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, or either that or they actually have a difficult problem and my expertise might be able to help them.

397
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, they might.

398
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,040
Speaker 1: The problem is when people... It's like, for some reason, people treat computers completely differently the way they treat anything else.

399
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:05,219
Speaker 1: If some guy has a toaster and toast is stuck in it, he sticks a fork in there and just digs it out.

400
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,900
Speaker 1: But if his computer stops working, he doesn't actually look at the screen and read the error message or look and see if it's actually plugged in.

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,151
Speaker 1: He just immediately throws his hands in the air, then he comes to us and says, "Hey, my computer doesn't work.

402
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,135
Speaker 1: It's obviously not my problem.

403
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:21,699
Speaker 1: I didn't cause

404
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:21,900
Speaker 1: this.".

405
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:27,349
Speaker 0: I think it's largely something caused by AOL and Microsoft and Dell.

406
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:36,440
Speaker 0: is that for so long, somehow, computers got this air of difficulty around them, which I can understand from the DOS days when they were kind of difficult to use.

407
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,300
Speaker 1: Computers are complex devices, and I think the problem is just that people try to treat them as though they're just in a dumb appliance.

408
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,674
Speaker 1: It should just do what I want it to do, but it's a multi-purpose device.

409
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,360
Speaker 1: It can do anything, like Zombocom.

410
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:57,089
Speaker 0: Yes, anything is possible, which is why it's not easy to use something that, you know... It's the old tool versus device thing, you know?

411
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,980
Speaker 0: I learned about this in some tech class at some point in RIT.

412
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked about that in one of our tech classes, too.

413
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:09,620
Speaker 0: It's like a tool is something you have to know how to use, and there are different ways to use it, and it's a complex thing.

414
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,620
Speaker 0: A device is like you push a button and something happens, you know?

415
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,466
Speaker 0: Like, you look at a saw.

416
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:18,800
Speaker 0: You don't just push the button on the saw and then the wood is cut.

417
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,420
Speaker 0: You have to know how to use the saw properly and all that stuff.

418
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,644
Speaker 1: Now, I could make a computer.

419
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:24,427
Speaker 1: that was a device.

420
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,915
Speaker 1: In fact, I did for IBM where I work.

421
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:28,260
Speaker 1: I made hundreds and hundreds of them.

422
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:34,640
Speaker 1: I could make a computer that is so simple and it can't break and it just has, like, there's a big desktop with five buttons.

423
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,040
Speaker 1: There's the email button, and there's the game button, and there's the web browser button, and it'll always work perfectly.

424
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,739
Speaker 1: Problem is, you can't do anything other than the buttons I already put in.

425
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:48,712
Speaker 0: By making something easier... Well, I'll explain this after.

426
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:50,518
Speaker 0: There's differences between easy to learn and easy to use.

427
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:53,840
Speaker 1: Yep, VI is a good example in that one.

428
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the easier to use and easier to learn you make something, the... Well, no.

429
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,513
Speaker 0: The easier to learn you make something, the less powerful it is.

430
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,180
Speaker 0: It's just a law of the universe.

431
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,640
Speaker 0: I mean, the easiest thing to learn to use in the world is one button.

432
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,442
Speaker 0: Guess what?

433
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,515
Speaker 0: Something with one button can only do one thing.

434
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:19,740
Speaker 0: At most, it can do a few things if you learn Morse code, but then it's no longer easy to learn.

435
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:23,073
Speaker 1: It's like that easy button they sell from whatever office store.

436
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,719
Speaker 1: You hit the button and it says, "That was

437
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:24,900
Speaker 1: easy.".

438
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no.

439
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,040
Speaker 0: Easy to learn and easy to use are two different things.

440
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:36,580
Speaker 0: Easy to learn means if you know nothing about it, you can figure out how it works and how to use it in a short amount of time, no matter how smart you are.

441
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,008
Speaker 0: Like a toaster.

442
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,658
Speaker 0: It's not hard to learn a toaster.

443
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:39,940
Speaker 0: There's like...

444
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:45,440
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised how many people have been electrocuted by shoving metal objects into toasters while they were plugged in.

445
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:46,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

446
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:52,940
Speaker 0: But the point is, is you get the simple toaster, you put bread in the top and you push the thing down, it's relatively easy to learn.

447
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,500
Speaker 0: It only has one thing you really do, and it's kind of obvious the bread goes in the top.

448
00:25:58,301 --> 00:25:59,820
Speaker 0: Ninety percent of people will get it right.

449
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,028
Speaker 1: I just picture like a guy laying there dead.

450
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:04,740
Speaker 1: There's half of a baby shoved into one side.

451
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:08,860
Speaker 1: There's like a loaf of bread squished in, still in its package on the other side.

452
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 1: It's plugged into a 220 line and it's on fire.

453
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:12,220
Speaker 0: And he's in the shower.

454
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,448
Speaker 0: But easy to use is something completely different.

455
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:22,000
Speaker 0: Something can be hard as hell to learn, but at the same time, easy as hell to use.

456
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,274
Speaker 0: Yep, like a V.I

457
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,662
Speaker 0: V.I.,

458
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:26,509
Speaker 0: if you don't know, is... Well, there's also

459
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,152
Speaker 0: V.I.M.,

460
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:28,999
Speaker 0: which is what people who are sane use.

461
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:29,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:31,765
Speaker 0: But it's basically the same thing.

463
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:33,390
Speaker 0: It's a text editor for the computer.

464
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,300
Speaker 0: It essentially does the same thing Notepad does.

465
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,260
Speaker 1: It's just, it's very... For people who aren't familiar with Linux, it's very obtuse.

466
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:47,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, the way it works is it works on keyboard commands, and it starts off in command mode.

467
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,379
Speaker 0: It has two modes, command mode and...

468
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,180
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we can just simplify this because anyone who knows what we're talking about knows, and if they don't, they don't care.

469
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we could do a show on V.I.

470
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Speaker 1: We could, actually.

471
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good show.

472
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,583
Speaker 1: But here, for those of you who don't know what V.I.

473
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:00,685
Speaker 1: is, I'll say this.

474
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:09,120
Speaker 1: If you want to save the thing you're typing and exit the program, you hit escape, shift, colon, w, q, enter.

475
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:09,882
Speaker 0: Yep.

476
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:13,453
Speaker 0: There's no way for you to learn that just by playing with it.

477
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,617
Speaker 0: It's non-obvious.

478
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:15,740
Speaker 0: Very non-obvious.

479
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,580
Speaker 1: However, it's very easy to use once you know it.

480
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,065
Speaker 0: Once you know it, you can do crazy stuff in V.I.

481
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:31,360
Speaker 0: I can, like, delete every other line in the file that contains the word "the" and paste them all at the end of the file by pushing, like, three buttons.

482
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:37,160
Speaker 0: If you want to do that in Notepad, you have to sit there for hours and hours cutting, pasting, cutting, pasting, cutting, pasting.

483
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,550
Speaker 0: It's hard to do things in Notepad, but it's very easy to figure out how to do them.

484
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:42,091
Speaker 0: In

485
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:42,593
Speaker 0: V.I.,

486
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,560
Speaker 0: it's very easy to do things, but it's hard to figure out how to do them.

487
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,260
Speaker 1: Now, I guess to not stray too off topic, the advice I guess we have for people who are going to ask techs like us for computer help.

488
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,703
Speaker 1: Now, this doesn't apply to people.

489
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,128
Speaker 1: we help because we want to help.

490
00:27:57,168 --> 00:28:00,680
Speaker 1: I mean, we have a lot of fun actually teaching people to do certain kinds of things.

491
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,059
Speaker 0: Especially when they want to learn.

492
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if someone comes up to me like, "I want to learn how to use

493
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:05,831
Speaker 1: Linux."

494
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:08,440
Speaker 1: Like, that's awesome, and I'll sit there for an hour and show them how to use Linux.

495
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:18,100
Speaker 1: But we're directing this mostly at people who ask techies for help with their problems and don't do due diligence.

496
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,225
Speaker 1: This is how to do your due diligence.

497
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:24,500
Speaker 1: so other techies, because all techies seem to want the same thing, don't cry or hit you.

498
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,020
Speaker 0: Number one, vocabulary.

499
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:37,380
Speaker 1: If you don't know what your problem is and you can't describe the problem, you really can't blame the techie when they have no idea what you're talking about.

500
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,720
Speaker 0: My grandma is the worst one with this, because they say, "Close the window," and she doesn't know what a window is and she doesn't know how to close it or what closing means.

501
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,215
Speaker 1: Or they'll call you and say, "The kajigger's

502
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:46,559
Speaker 1: broken.".

503
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that leaves me with the word "the," which basically means if I can't communicate with you, I can't help you.

504
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:53,840
Speaker 0: You're beyond help, go away.

505
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:56,125
Speaker 1: Now, this isn't saying that you have to know the jargon.

506
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:02,960
Speaker 1: It's just that you have to have some sort of cognitive understanding of something about your problem.

507
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,592
Speaker 0: You don't need to know what UDP means for me to help you, but you do need to know what window means and what close means.

508
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:13,966
Speaker 0: and yet, you know, what a menu is and all those sorts of... There's a level that you have to reach.

509
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,412
Speaker 0: that's like the minimum requirement.

510
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,400
Speaker 0: You can know more than that and it's helpful.

511
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,220
Speaker 0: You don't have to know what SATA is for me to help you, though, but you do have to know what the mouse is.

512
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:23,802
Speaker 1: Yep.

513
00:29:24,505 --> 00:29:27,419
Speaker 1: Now, two, know what your problem actually is.

514
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,596
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not saying know, like, 'cause if you know what the problem is, you can fix it, but know how to describe your problem.

515
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,080
Speaker 1: It ties in very much with vocabulary.

516
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,337
Speaker 1: If your screen is black and you just sit there and stare at it and then call me and say, "My computer's broken.

517
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:41,758
Speaker 1: I can't help

518
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:41,899
Speaker 1: you.".

519
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,448
Speaker 1: If you call me and say, "All right, I was using my computer and suddenly it turned off.

520
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:47,551
Speaker 1: The light's not on.

521
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:49,334
Speaker 1: When I hit the button, it doesn't turn back on.

522
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:50,797
Speaker 1: The cable is plugged in.

523
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:51,499
Speaker 1: What do I

524
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:51,639
Speaker 1: do?".

525
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:53,264
Speaker 1: That's a good question.

526
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:53,986
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

527
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,535
Speaker 0: It shows that you tried to do something.

528
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:02,140
Speaker 0: I mean, everyone... There are people with problem-solving skills and people without problem-solving skills.

529
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:12,940
Speaker 0: The thing is, even if you have problem-solving skills, if you don't have knowledge about the thing you're trying to, you know, solve the problem of, you're not gonna come up with a solution.

530
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,380
Speaker 0: Like, if there's a problem with my car, I can kind of figure it out, but I don't have enough knowledge about the inner workings of the car to be right all the time.

531
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:21,765
Speaker 0: Or to fix it.

532
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:25,700
Speaker 1: However, I mean, problem-solving skills has nothing to do with your technological prowess.

533
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:39,000
Speaker 1: If you have problem-solving skills, even if you don't have the knowledge to solve the problem at hand, you have the ability to at least narrow down the problem and then be able to explain to someone what you think the problem is.

534
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,669
Speaker 0: And describe the problem.

535
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:41,859
Speaker 0: Describing the problem is key.

536
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,742
Speaker 1: Like my car.

537
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:47,600
Speaker 1: My car broke down while I was driving to a convention in Indiana, in the middle of nowhere in Indiana.

538
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,575
Speaker 1: I end up going up into Michigan to do a mechanic, and I knew jack all about cars back then.

539
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:53,979
Speaker 1: I know slightly more now.

540
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,578
Speaker 1: And I pulled in, and the mechanic's like, "What's wrong with your

541
00:30:58,619 --> 00:30:58,820
Speaker 1: car?".

542
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:06,819
Speaker 1: And I had no idea what was wrong with it, but I was able to tell him, "Well, whenever I'm idling under 2,000 RPM, it makes a rattling

543
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:07,199
Speaker 1: noise.".

544
00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:13,314
Speaker 1: And the check engine light came on about 40 miles ago, and there's some knocking.

545
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:14,357
Speaker 1: A little bit.

546
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:15,560
Speaker 1: At least I think it's knocking.

547
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:20,380
Speaker 1: And I explained everything I could, and I gave him as much information as I could.

548
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,091
Speaker 1: And then he was like, "Oh, it sounds like

549
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,273
Speaker 1: this.".

550
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:22,900
Speaker 1: And then he went to work.

551
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,780
Speaker 1: And it probably saved me several hundred dollars worth of labor of him sitting there trying to figure out what my problem was.

552
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is why cars have that cool diagnostic thing where they plug the little computer in and it tells them what's wrong with the car.

553
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,188
Speaker 0: But that's not perfect.

554
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,320
Speaker 0: And computers don't have such a thing.

555
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,639
Speaker 1: Though you know what computers do have, and this ties in very well.

556
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,938
Speaker 1: Error messages.

557
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,497
Speaker 0: Read them!

558
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:51,480
Speaker 1: If nothing else, if you have a problem with your computer and you're going to ask someone like us for help, write down whatever the computer told you when the thing broke.

559
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,100
Speaker 1: Because whatever it told you was probably very relevant to the problem at hand.

560
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,420
Speaker 0: That's the worst thing, is people who don't read the screen.

561
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,560
Speaker 0: It's like, people will come to me with what the error message said sometimes.

562
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,359
Speaker 0: And they'll be like, "The error message said 'DVD drive can't read the DVD

563
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:08,600
Speaker 0: drive.'".

564
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:10,356
Speaker 0: And I'll be like, "Oh, what do you think that

565
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:10,759
Speaker 0: means?".

566
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,093
Speaker 0: And they'll be like, "Uh, what did it

567
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:13,556
Speaker 0: say?".

568
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:15,375
Speaker 0: "You can't read the DVD

569
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:15,598
Speaker 0: drive.".

570
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,690
Speaker 0: "So what's wrong with your

571
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,095
Speaker 0: computer?".

572
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:19,337
Speaker 0: "The DVD's

573
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:19,660
Speaker 0: broken?".

574
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:20,370
Speaker 0: "Yes!".

575
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:22,385
Speaker 0: "Yes, that's what it said.

576
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:25,617
Speaker 0: Why did you have to call me to ask me what something

577
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:25,818
Speaker 0: is?".

578
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:27,308
Speaker 0: "Are you illiterate?

579
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,517
Speaker 0: You needed me to read it for

580
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:28,679
Speaker 0: you?".

581
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:29,947
Speaker 1: Read!

582
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:30,639
Speaker 0: Read, read, read!

583
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:43,160
Speaker 1: I blame mostly the fact that many computer programs and many things on the internet, and just many things, especially made for people who don't know much about computers, are set up where they'll give you a lot of text that you can ignore and still use the program.

584
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,320
Speaker 1: So people are so used to just clicking OK on anything no matter what and never actually reading.

585
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,200
Speaker 1: The worst are, like, some applications, Lotus Notes is notorious for this.

586
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:04,620
Speaker 1: When I upgraded Lotus Notes at work, I had to upgrade from version 6 to version 7, it warned me before I started the installer that at several points an error message would pop up, and I should just click OK and let it continue.

587
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,500
Speaker 1: Now, I read that and I understood, all right, those errors must be spurious, something's broken, whatever.

588
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,700
Speaker 1: But that happens often enough where people get used to ignoring errors because they don't think they're useful.

589
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:16,561
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

590
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:21,418
Speaker 0: At the same point, why the hell didn't you just make it so those errors didn't show up?

591
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:21,980
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

592
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,742
Speaker 0: No, don't ask me.

593
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:28,100
Speaker 1: Lotus Notes is... I can't describe to you the depths of my hatred for Lotus Notes.

594
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not, what we're saying here is not 100% the fault of the user.

595
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,540
Speaker 0: Sometimes people who write shitty software deserve just as much of a beating for encouraging the shitty user.

596
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:40,260
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean, case in point, PC load letter?

597
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

598
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:49,820
Speaker 0: If you make a car that explodes and then someone drives it poorly and it explodes, it's not just the poor driver at fault.

599
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,140
Speaker 1: But even in that case, write down whatever cryptic bullshit the computer told you and give it to a techie.

600
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,420
Speaker 1: They'll at least look on Google and try to figure it out.

601
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:02,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can look on Google before you come and ask us.

602
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 1: Yes, that is number three, Google.

603
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:11,340
Speaker 0: If you have looked on Google for your answer before coming to me, I am a thousand times more likely to help you.

604
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,320
Speaker 1: Yes, especially since the first thing I do when someone comes to me is look on Google.

605
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you think?

606
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:18,590
Speaker 0: We freaking know everything about computers?

607
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,360
Speaker 0: Well, no, we only know 99% of a thing about computers.

608
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:26,020
Speaker 0: And that means that your problem, we don't know the answer, Google's where we go.

609
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:28,859
Speaker 1: There are some people at my job, my work, because I'm good at what I do.

610
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:41,560
Speaker 1: And the problem is, I don't know a lot about certain subjects, but people come to me about every technological subject on the earth all the time because I have this reputation in my office for being like the guy who knows everything.

611
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:47,280
Speaker 1: And all I do, quite literally, so if any of my coworkers are listening, I've just revealed my secret.

612
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:54,520
Speaker 1: When someone asks me something, I kind of shrug it off and then I Google it and then I come right back a minute later with the answer.

613
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:55,522
Speaker 0: Yeah.

614
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,164
Speaker 1: That's all I do.

615
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:56,846
Speaker 0: That's it.

616
00:34:57,508 --> 00:35:00,437
Speaker 1: I mean, I had a Cisco switch and it did something weird.

617
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:01,300
Speaker 1: It gave an error message.

618
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,238
Speaker 1: I typed the error message into Google and I found the answer and then I went back and said, "Oh, and then everyone thought I was a Cisco

619
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:06,619
Speaker 1: expert.".

620
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,080
Speaker 0: It's like there's this library in a town and the library has all the answers to everyone's questions in the whole universe.

621
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,566
Speaker 0: But there's only one literate guy in the whole town.

622
00:35:15,088 --> 00:35:19,580
Speaker 0: And everyone just comes to the literate guy and he goes into the library and finds the answer.

623
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,162
Speaker 0: You know what?

624
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:26,580
Speaker 0: If you learn to fucking read, you can go in the library yourself and save that literate guy a lot of trouble so he can get on with his life.

625
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:37,120
Speaker 1: Now, by the same token, if a problem is obtuse or complex enough, you'll Google and you'll find the answer, but the answer won't help you because it's something archaic or difficult to understand or full of jargon.

626
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,765
Speaker 0: Or you actually have to modify.

627
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:43,619
Speaker 0: I mean, there's most problems, some guy will be like, "This is my problem and then this is how I solved

628
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:43,680
Speaker 0: it.".

629
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,032
Speaker 0: And if you were smart, you would realize that doing exactly that won't work exactly in your situation.

630
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:52,580
Speaker 0: You have to modify that procedure for solving your problem in some way.

631
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:01,300
Speaker 1: But even in that case, if you come to someone like us and you say, "Yeah, I looked on Google and it said to do this, but I wasn't sure so I wanted to ask you," that's fine.

632
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you come to me with a procedure and your problem and then all you need to do is modify that procedure to your specific situation, that's terrific.

633
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:10,220
Speaker 0: I'll do that.

634
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:13,140
Speaker 1: Now, if you searched MSN, you can go to hell.

635
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,340
Speaker 1: Just Google.

636
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,720
Speaker 0: If you're searching MSN anyway, then you're the kind of person who is not probably going to be getting help.

637
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,047
Speaker 1: Now, I would have said our fourth thing is read the manual.

638
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:35,180
Speaker 1: However, I will say that the vast majority of documentation for technological things out there these days is pathetic.

639
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:38,660
Speaker 1: So, I don't fault you for not reading the manual.

640
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,706
Speaker 0: I don't fault you for not reading the manual.

641
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:45,080
Speaker 0: I do fault you for not attempting to find or read the manual.

642
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:53,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, my parents gave this to me and they paid like $3,000 or $4,000 for it in the '80s, but it's a VHS camcorder.

643
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,828
Speaker 1: It takes freaking giant lead acid batteries.

644
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,356
Speaker 1: It hurts my shoulder to use.

645
00:36:58,376 --> 00:36:59,540
Speaker 1: It's a giant camcorder.

646
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:07,940
Speaker 1: And it came with a 60-page book that goes into great detail every single bit of this camcorder.

647
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:11,072
Speaker 1: And then in the back, there's like 10 pages worth of troubleshooting.

648
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,940
Speaker 1: And it's a full-on expert system.

649
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:20,360
Speaker 1: If this is the problem, or if you're having this problem, then answer this list of questions and at the end we'll tell you exactly what's wrong.

650
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,012
Speaker 1: And people don't write manuals like that anymore.

651
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,240
Speaker 1: It's really kind of sad.

652
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,603
Speaker 0: No, they write manuals to be shitty.

653
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:35,280
Speaker 0: That way, see, it boggles my mind that companies do everything in their power to reduce the number of people that call tech support.

654
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:42,600
Speaker 0: Because the more people that call tech support, especially under warranty, which is when most people call tech support, costs them money.

655
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:49,480
Speaker 0: It's basically this money sinkhole that they have to have in order to not piss off all their customers and go out of business.

656
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:57,180
Speaker 0: But at the same time, they make things so shitty in the first place that everyone has to call tech support.

657
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:57,921
Speaker 0: You know what?

658
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:08,740
Speaker 0: If you made your stuff less shitty and had better manuals and all that, you would save more money on tech support than by getting Indians to do it and then having long on-hold lines.

659
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,045
Speaker 1: No, I have a lot of theories about that, actually.

660
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:13,772
Speaker 1: Because I put tactical writing in all that on my resume.

661
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:17,220
Speaker 1: I actually have written quite a body of documentation in my day.

662
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:25,540
Speaker 1: And it seems to me that actual good technical writers are few and far between and demand fairly high salaries.

663
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:32,460
Speaker 1: So most people don't seem to see the value in hiring these people to just write a manual for a program.

664
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,207
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll make the intern write the manual.

665
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,260
Speaker 1: Why would we hire someone at $80,000 a year just to write a frickin' book?

666
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:38,262
Speaker 0: Oh, let's see.

667
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:45,940
Speaker 0: If we hire one guy for $80,000 a year, he can write all the manuals for all our products and then decrease our tech support costs by millions.

668
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:52,953
Speaker 0: Oh, the businessmen are stupid and businessmen shouldn't make technology decisions ever.

669
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:56,720
Speaker 0: But they should make business decisions because technology people can't make business decisions for shit.

670
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,016
Speaker 1: Now, my other theory about this... Well, I shouldn't say the word "theory" because people get pissed, but I'm gonna say the word "theory" anyway.

671
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:03,638
Speaker 1: Haha!

672
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:04,340
Speaker 1: Colloquialisms.

673
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 0: What about your hypothesis?

674
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, my conjecture.

675
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:09,920
Speaker 1: My supposition.

676
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:10,960
Speaker 0: Conclusion!

677
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:11,683
Speaker 0: Ah!

678
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:12,194
Speaker 0: Ah!

679
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:12,439
Speaker 0: Ah!

680
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:15,441
Speaker 1: Alright.

681
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:21,980
Speaker 1: I've noticed, and I noticed it today because I got... I can't use any names, but I'm involved in a project right now.

682
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:34,500
Speaker 1: And the guy who's in charge of the routers for the project, you know, like the Cisco routers, sends me an email and the first word in it is "irregardless," which is not a fucking word.

683
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,137
Speaker 0: No, it is not.

684
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:36,521
Speaker 1: Well, no.

685
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,129
Speaker 1: I guess technically it is a derived word.

686
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,259
Speaker 1: However, it does not mean what you think it means.

687
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:42,177
Speaker 0: I don't think that means what you think it means.

688
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,063
Speaker 1: Two, it was not capitalized.

689
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:45,466
Speaker 1: And three, there was no comma after it.

690
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:51,280
Speaker 1: And then, he just pissed broken grammar into my screen.

691
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,091
Speaker 1: And then, at the end, he said something.

692
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:57,540
Speaker 1: And then there was a forwarded message from a tech from Cisco.

693
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,229
Speaker 1: This is like Cisco's external account support.

694
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,555
Speaker 1: This is the face of Cisco talking to me.

695
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,320
Speaker 1: And it was even worse.

696
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,080
Speaker 0: Inconceivable.

697
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:22,220
Speaker 1: And I've noticed this in almost all my professional dealings out there in the corporate world is that the vast majority of people, even people in high-level positions, vice presidents, presidents, CEOs, they can't communicate.

698
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,743
Speaker 1: They can't write for shit.

699
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:24,745
Speaker 1: They don't know how to spell.

700
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:25,667
Speaker 1: They don't know grammar.

701
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:28,213
Speaker 1: They can't communicate their ideas effectively.

702
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:30,899
Speaker 1: If they have a speech to give, someone writes it for them.

703
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:33,542
Speaker 1: I don't know.

704
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:34,765
Speaker 1: It bothers me.

705
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:41,400
Speaker 1: I really can't express to my boss and some of the people just how stupid some of the other people I deal with are.

706
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

707
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:45,867
Speaker 0: I think we've gone on long enough about how people can't communicate their problems to us.

708
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:52,180
Speaker 0: But what's even worse, and sometimes, is when I tell you the solution and then you fail to do what I told you.

709
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:52,963
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

710
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:56,200
Speaker 1: I have a lot of non-technical stories about that in my old club.

711
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:57,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

712
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:10,140
Speaker 0: But I mean, when I tell you to do X, Y, and Z, and then you don't like the answer, or you don't listen to me in some way, or you misinterpret what I told you.

713
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,463
Speaker 1: No, it's not like you screwed up.

714
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:17,074
Speaker 1: Like, if we tell you to recompile your kernel and you do it wrong, or, I mean, that's fine, whatever.

715
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:20,100
Speaker 1: We should have said more detail or it was a difficult thing.

716
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,150
Speaker 1: But if we tell you to recompile the kernel and you say, "What?

717
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:23,772
Speaker 1: Fuck that.

718
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:24,877
Speaker 0: I shouldn't have to recompile my

719
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:25,198
Speaker 0: kernel."

720
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:28,460
Speaker 0: Well, that's what you're going to have to do, like it or not.

721
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,067
Speaker 1: People just don't like getting bad answers.

722
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,920
Speaker 1: Oh, man, there's so many work anecdotes that I really can't relate.

723
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

724
00:41:35,461 --> 00:41:39,549
Speaker 0: It's so weird, though, because if you go to a mechanic and he says, "You need a new transmission," right?

725
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,520
Speaker 0: Sometimes they might be nutty and try to go to a different mechanic and get told the same thing.

726
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:54,738
Speaker 1: It's like the crazy people who, like, their kid has a flu or something, or a cold, and they go to the doctor like, "He has pneumonia, blah, blah, blah," and the doctor says, "He has a cold.

727
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:55,399
Speaker 1: Go

728
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:55,760
Speaker 1: home.".

729
00:41:56,161 --> 00:41:57,025
Speaker 1: And then, "I want a second

730
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:57,346
Speaker 1: opinion.".

731
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,937
Speaker 1: They go to another doctor, and that other doctor says, "He has a

732
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:00,359
Speaker 1: cold.".

733
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:01,861
Speaker 0: Yep.

734
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:09,880
Speaker 0: But then, you know, eventually those people seem to suck it up and, you know, pay the mechanic to get a new transmission, because they have to.

735
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:22,200
Speaker 0: But when people have a computer problem, and I tell them, "You're going to have to, you know, back up all your files and then format your drive," and whatever, you know, no matter how many times they'll do it, they won't do it.

736
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,800
Speaker 0: They'll just suffer with their shit spyware or whatever they've got.

737
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,604
Speaker 0: You know, I'm like, "Fine, you want it that way?

738
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:28,385
Speaker 0: If I have it that

739
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:28,545
Speaker 0: way.".

740
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:33,395
Speaker 0: But then, they come back and they'll complain their computer's slow and shitty, and I'll be like, "What did I tell you before?

741
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,099
Speaker 0: Go away, or I'll kill

742
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:35,199
Speaker 0: you.".

743
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:45,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess the moral of the story is just that, don't, I mean, we're technologists, and we enjoy helping people, but computers aren't special.

744
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:52,920
Speaker 1: I mean, your car needs oil changes and regular maintenance, and you either know how to do it yourself, or you take it to someone and pay him money to do it for you.

745
00:42:53,502 --> 00:42:54,505
Speaker 1: Your computer's no different.

746
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:58,940
Speaker 1: You either have to know how to do the maintenance on it, or pay someone to do it for you.

747
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:15,815
Speaker 0: Yep, those are pretty much your choices, and you should be glad that, you know, mechanics don't work on cars for free, but computer people out there, some of them will help you for free, because it's actually less labor-intensive to work on a computer than to work on a car, and you don't usually need money for parts all the time.

748
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:18,300
Speaker 0: It's mostly software, which is mostly free.

749
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:30,620
Speaker 0: So, you know, you should be very, very thankful that someone will even talk to you for no money whatsoever when it comes to a problem with your computer, instead of just saying, "Give me money or leave," which is what the mechanic will tell you for your car.

750
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:36,160
Speaker 1: Yep, so actually, actually, there was a mechanic friend of my dad's who did a brake job on my car for free.

751
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:36,780
Speaker 0: Awesome.

752
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,959
Speaker 1: He was an awesome dude.

753
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,722
Speaker 0: Yeah.

754
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:41,080
Speaker 0: Did he actually give you brake pads and everything for free?

755
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:46,360
Speaker 1: Uh, I think I bought all the parts, but he did all the labor, and he had some of the parts laying around.

756
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,605
Speaker 0: Alright, yeah.

757
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:54,598
Speaker 0: But I mean, you should be so thankful that you should be, like, kissing feet, and if you fail to communicate...

758
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:56,023
Speaker 1: Okay.

759
00:43:56,949 --> 00:43:58,520
Speaker 1: You just want people to kiss your feet, that's all.

760
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,384
Speaker 0: No, not really.

761
00:43:59,585 --> 00:44:02,200
Speaker 0: Actually, I don't want you to kiss my feet, but that's kind of you.

762
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,059
Speaker 0: But you should get on your hands and knees, that's good.

763
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:05,716
Speaker 0: Okay.

764
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

765
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:07,603
Speaker 0: But, seriously...

766
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,380
Speaker 1: They're not, like, conceited, and they don't want you to be angry, they want to help you, usually.

767
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,020
Speaker 1: But don't take them for granted, because eventually they'll get sick of you and they won't help you anymore, otherwise.

768
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:33,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to show the respect and put in the effort, and whatever they tell you, accept it as, like, the word of God.

769
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:44,355
Speaker 1: I made the mistake when I was in high school, very often, because people knew I was the computer guy, and they would... And I'd always make promises, like, someone would say, "Oh, I'm gonna build a new computer,".

770
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,420
Speaker 1: and I'd say, "Oh, tell you what.

771
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:49,116
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what parts to buy, you order them, and then I'll put it together for

772
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:49,217
Speaker 1: you.".

773
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:53,560
Speaker 1: And I'd say that all the time, because it was just, like, trivial to me, and I like messing around with computer-y bits.

774
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:05,240
Speaker 1: But then I actually had to do it, and I ended up being on the hook, because I'd build a computer for someone, and then a week later it would break, and they'd blame me, and I'd have to explain to them that, "No, it's because you're stupid.

775
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,474
Speaker 1: Don't ever talk to me again, I hate

776
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:06,575
Speaker 1: you.".

777
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:11,502
Speaker 0: And then they don't believe you, of course, because no one ever... That's the thing.

778
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:13,590
Speaker 0: In general, forget tech support.

779
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:20,380
Speaker 0: If someone doesn't blame themselves when something is their fault, and guess what, if there's a problem in your life, 90% of the time it's your fault.

780
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,426
Speaker 1: I don't know about 90%.

781
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:25,280
Speaker 1: I mean, it really depends on who you are and where you live.

782
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:28,840
Speaker 1: If you're living in Sudan or Darfur right now, it's probably not your fault.

783
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,053
Speaker 0: Well, no, because that's only one problem in your life.

784
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:32,160
Speaker 0: It's just a very big problem.

785
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,632
Speaker 0: The other 90% of the problems in your life are your fault.

786
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,240
Speaker 0: They're just all very small problems.

787
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:42,160
Speaker 0: That don't mean anything, because you have this one giant problem.

788
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,520
Speaker 1: I live in a horrible genocidal place, and oh, I didn't floss yesterday.

789
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,824
Speaker 0: Exactly.

790
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,780
Speaker 0: The not flossing is your fault.

791
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,348
Speaker 1: No, because floss wasn't available.

792
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:53,260
Speaker 1: Maybe you wanted to floss.

793
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:55,338
Speaker 0: You could have made do.

794
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,460
Speaker 1: With what, some cr- A string.

795
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,699
Speaker 1: You don't have a string.

796
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,699
Speaker 0: A shoelace, I don't frickin' know.

797
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,238
Speaker 1: They'd kill to have a shoelace.

798
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

799
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:15,399
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, is that when someone doesn't blame themselves for problems that are caused by their own doing or their lack of ability or

800
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:20,220
Speaker 1: whatever- Yeah, barring the fact that you might not realize it was your fault, as long as you accept it when someone shows that it was your fault.

801
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,122
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

802
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:26,540
Speaker 0: Don't go denying it was your fault and continuing to blame it on someone despite, I don't know, a mountain of evidence.

803
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this leads into number what, five?

804
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:29,640
Speaker 1: We're not really number 80s.

805
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,156
Speaker 1: Who cares?

806
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:31,569
Speaker 1: And this is the big one.

807
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:33,060
Speaker 1: Don't lie.

808
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:41,797
Speaker 1: If you say, "My RAM stopped working after I put it in a new computer," and I ask, "Did you put on wool socks and walk across the room with it in your

809
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:42,159
Speaker 1: hands?"

810
00:46:42,622 --> 00:46:44,499
Speaker 1: and you did that, don't say no.

811
00:46:45,923 --> 00:46:47,238
Speaker 0: Because you did, didn't you?

812
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:47,880
Speaker 1: Scott.

813
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, not me.

814
00:46:48,663 --> 00:46:49,367
Speaker 0: The other Scott.

815
00:46:52,862 --> 00:47:01,500
Speaker 1: Our friend Scott Jobs, we always rag on him for this because it was such a coincidence that one day he happened to just walk across a floor in wool socks with some RAM sticks in his hand.

816
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:08,152
Speaker 0: He was walking across a carpeted floor wearing wool socks and a sweater and his permanent sweater carrying RAM in his hand.

817
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:09,180
Speaker 0: What the hell?

818
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,854
Speaker 0: And everyone in the room was like, "Oh, my God!

819
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:12,277
Speaker 1: What are you

820
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:12,679
Speaker 1: doing?".

821
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:15,079
Speaker 0: Of course, that RAM is probably worth two cents now.

822
00:47:15,326 --> 00:47:15,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

823
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:16,779
Speaker 0: Even if it still worked.

824
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,300
Speaker 1: And the RAM actually did work fine.

825
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,065
Speaker 1: But it would amaze you how often I have to go, because I have those Linux terminals at work, or worse, I have them set up.

826
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,520
Speaker 1: So if you try to open the case, this is a good example.

827
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,660
Speaker 1: If you try to physically open the case, which is locked, by the way, it sets off an alarm in the CMOS, and the computer will now not boot.

828
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,149
Speaker 1: In fact, it says on the screen, "Warning!

829
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:44,340
Speaker 1: Computer has been tampered with," and you have to enter a code to unlock it, right?

830
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:44,959
Speaker 1: Awesome.

831
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:56,177
Speaker 1: So I'll get a call to someone's office or a place in the manufacturing floor, and they'll be like, "Yeah, the computer's asking for a password," at which point I say, "Well, I'll be down in a

832
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:56,398
Speaker 1: minute.".

833
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:57,339
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

834
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:03,360
Speaker 1: And I go down, and I see the computer, and I say, "It says the computer's been tampered with,".

835
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,492
Speaker 1: and they say, "I don't

836
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:04,674
Speaker 1: know.".

837
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,736
Speaker 1: And I say, "That can only happen if someone tries to open the

838
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:09,198
Speaker 1: computer.".

839
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:11,875
Speaker 1: "Did you try to open the

840
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:12,259
Speaker 1: computer?".

841
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:13,402
Speaker 1: "No.".

842
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:14,643
Speaker 1: "Really?

843
00:48:14,663 --> 00:48:16,696
Speaker 1: Because you're the only one who has access to this

844
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:16,958
Speaker 1: room.".

845
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:20,274
Speaker 1: "No one else could have done it, and it can't go off by

846
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:20,617
Speaker 1: itself.".

847
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:23,416
Speaker 0: You opened it.

848
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:24,020
Speaker 1: Yeah.

849
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,199
Speaker 0: Say you opened it.

850
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,898
Speaker 1: But they won't.

851
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,660
Speaker 1: I've had conversations just like that where they won't admit it, even though I know they did it.

852
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,880
Speaker 1: I have a log of the time it went off.

853
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,700
Speaker 1: I could look at the badge lock and find out when they were in the room.

854
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,119
Speaker 1: I can prove that it was them, but they won't admit that they did it.

855
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:39,212
Speaker 0: Here's a videotape of you opening it.

856
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:39,978
Speaker 0: Did you open it?

857
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:40,240
Speaker 0: No.

858
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,239
Speaker 1: It's like, people say, like, "I saved the

859
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:43,340
Speaker 1: file.".

860
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:43,987
Speaker 0: That's not me.

861
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:44,978
Speaker 0: It's not you.

862
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:50,180
Speaker 0: Oh, well, that's the person who came into this room with the lock, so they're the only employee here.

863
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,900
Speaker 0: You must not be an employee here if that's not you.

864
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,157
Speaker 1: You know, it's the people who say, "I didn't delete that file," and then, "Yeah, you deleted

865
00:48:56,177 --> 00:48:56,217
Speaker 1: it.".

866
00:48:57,282 --> 00:48:57,966
Speaker 1: Don't lie.

867
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:00,480
Speaker 1: If you lie, it'll only make our job harder.

868
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:04,479
Speaker 0: No, it'll make your life suckier because I'll just kick you and leave.

869
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,019
Speaker 1: All right, let me put it this way.

870
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:16,679
Speaker 1: If you lie to a tech guy who's trying to help you, either one, he won't be able to solve your problem because he doesn't have all the information, or two, he's going to know you're lying, and he might not say anything, but he knows.

871
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,535
Speaker 0: "Oh, you didn't delete that file,

872
00:49:18,677 --> 00:49:18,839
Speaker 0: huh?".

873
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:20,780
Speaker 0: Deletes accounting information.

874
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:21,992
Speaker 0: "I didn't delete that file

875
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:22,194
Speaker 0: either.".

876
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:28,080
Speaker 0: Deletes all your entire MP3 collection in low-level formats that drive three times.

877
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:29,192
Speaker 0: "I didn't erase your hard

878
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:29,476
Speaker 0: drive.".

879
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:31,259
Speaker 1: That's only if you're dealing with the buffer.

880
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,258
Speaker 0: That's fine.

881
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,865
Speaker 1: I guess a closing bit.

882
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:38,940
Speaker 1: If you don't know what the buffer is, we should do a show on that, actually.

883
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:40,739
Speaker 0: A whole show?

884
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,239
Speaker 1: I could do a whole show on that.

885
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:48,580
Speaker 1: I remember when I discovered that when I was young and in Veril and didn't know much about computers, and it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen.

886
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:52,240
Speaker 0: Maybe we should close the show with a little pepcak.

887
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,580
Speaker 1: A little pepcak?

888
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,001
Speaker 0: Yeah.

889
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:58,440
Speaker 0: For anyone who doesn't know, there's a saying that computer guys have called pepcak.

890
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,003
Speaker 0: P-E-B-K-A-C.

891
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:08,160
Speaker 0: And what it means is the problem exists between the keyboard and the chair.

892
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:13,620
Speaker 0: So, most of the time when there's a problem with the computer, the problem is pepcak.

893
00:50:14,642 --> 00:50:16,260
Speaker 0: And, uh, don't be pepcak.

894
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:16,902
Speaker 1: Yeah.

895
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,347
Speaker 1: Just do your due diligence.

896
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,254
Speaker 1: Try to solve your own problem.

897
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:21,278
Speaker 1: At least try a little.

898
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:21,559
Speaker 1: Try.

899
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,603
Speaker 1: Read the message.

900
00:50:23,623 --> 00:50:24,787
Speaker 1: Google.

901
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:29,000
Speaker 1: And if you still can't solve it, ask someone and tell them everything you can, and they'll probably help you.

902
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,153
Speaker 0: Think with that brain thing you have in your skull, between your ears somewhere.

903
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:35,036
Speaker 0: Use it.

904
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:36,600
Speaker 0: At least, it can do stuff.

905
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,298
Speaker 0: Like, RIT.

906
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,180
Speaker 0: It might not be able to do much, but it can do something.

907
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:44,840
Speaker 1: RIT amazes me the most because there would be a professor who, you know, a brilliant professor, who's written, he's a doctor.

908
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,626
Speaker 1: He has this doctorate.

909
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:48,451
Speaker 1: He's written countless papers.

910
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:49,815
Speaker 1: He's participated in research.

911
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,220
Speaker 1: He's lauded around the world.

912
00:50:52,280 --> 00:51:01,040
Speaker 1: And yet, his computer pops up a message saying that drive C is low on space, and he can't figure out what the hell that means, and he freaks out, and then he calls me.

913
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:14,040
Speaker 1: It's like people have skills, and then when they're faced with a computer, they pretend, they just, they forget that they have all those skills, and they just assume that there's nothing they can do, and there's nothing they can fix.

914
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:17,867
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like, sure, let's say a guy's a doctor of mathematics, right?

915
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:19,851
Speaker 0: He still knows how to read.

916
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:22,135
Speaker 0: Reading and writing are essential life skills.

917
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:24,720
Speaker 0: No matter what your profession is, you know how to read and write.

918
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,880
Speaker 1: Reading is fundamental.

919
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:33,253
Speaker 0: The guy who is, you know, the English doctor, you know, he's a professor of literature, he knows how to do math.

920
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:36,800
Speaker 0: Basic math, he knows, because those are essential life skills.

921
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:46,380
Speaker 1: I will point out that many of the people I know who I was talking about how they don't know grammar and they can't write or communicate, they also can't do basic math without a calculator.

922
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,081
Speaker 0: Right.

923
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:48,888
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're talking about the professors here.

924
00:51:48,908 --> 00:51:51,960
Speaker 0: You know, we're not talking about the people who are completely incompetent.

925
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,824
Speaker 0: Computers are a basic life skill.

926
00:51:55,924 --> 00:52:00,855
Speaker 0: If you don't know the minimum about your computers, you're like an illiterate person.

927
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,438
Speaker 0: You're like someone who can't read or write.

928
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:03,420
Speaker 0: Seriously.

929
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:13,973
Speaker 0: Like, if you can't, like, use a computer, like basic functions, visit a website, send an email, et cetera, you're an illiterate person as far as this world is concerned.

930
00:52:13,993 --> 00:52:19,460
Speaker 0: You better catch up or you're gonna be some unemployed bum who's disrespected and not cared for.

931
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,620
Speaker 1: Now, that's directed mostly, well, I guess, our listeners, because, I mean, there are people who were born before this whole computer thing.

932
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,860
Speaker 0: No, if someone's listening to us, that means they know what a podcast is and how to get it.

933
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,444
Speaker 1: That was the point I was just about to make.

934
00:52:29,544 --> 00:52:36,480
Speaker 1: Because anyone who's listening, anyone who falls into the categories of people who really can get away with not knowing about computers is not listening to Geek Nights.

935
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,099
Speaker 0: Or is unable to listen to Geek Nights.

936
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:41,960
Speaker 1: Or is listening because they're a relative or something.

937
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,622
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's true.

938
00:52:43,682 --> 00:52:52,717
Speaker 0: If anyone's listening, like, to this because someone else, like, downloaded it and played it for you and you have no idea what the hell a podcast is, you might be one of these people.

939
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:54,720
Speaker 0: we're talking about who's illiterate.

940
00:52:55,621 --> 00:53:01,960
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're illiterate, like, remember The Simpsons and Krusty the Clown was illiterate and he felt real bad about it because it's not a good thing?

941
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:06,472
Speaker 0: If you're computer illiterate, you should feel just as bad as if you were book illiterate.

942
00:53:07,054 --> 00:53:08,960
Speaker 0: I'm not even joking, this is dead serious.

943
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:12,798
Speaker 0: You should feel just as bad because it is just as bad, perhaps worse.

944
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,400
Speaker 0: Well, I guess one begets the other because if you can't read a language, then you can't read the computer screen, but you get the point.

945
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:25,399
Speaker 1: Anyway, tomorrow is gaming day.

946
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,488
Speaker 1: Woohoo!

947
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:28,459
Speaker 1: And the next day is anime day.

948
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:28,828
Speaker 1: Woohoo!

949
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:32,800
Speaker 1: I was gonna say what we're gonna do and then I realized I don't know what we're gonna do tomorrow.

950
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,905
Speaker 0: No, we have no idea.

951
00:53:33,926 --> 00:53:35,980
Speaker 0: Do we have something pre-recorded or not?

952
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,676
Speaker 1: I think we used it.

953
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,080
Speaker 0: No, I thought we had, like, an extra one.

954
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,987
Speaker 1: We might have one extra.

955
00:53:40,048 --> 00:53:41,540
Speaker 1: I think we have an extra Tuesday, Wednesday.

956
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,379
Speaker 0: We'll have to go check.

957
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:44,178
Speaker 0: Yeah.

958
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,059
Speaker 0: We might do something new.

959
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might do that Fury of Dracula game.

960
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:48,725
Speaker 0: Yep.

961
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:50,259
Speaker 1: That game is fantastic.

962
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,178
Speaker 0: That's a good game.

963
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:56,720
Speaker 1: And of course, once again, we're going to be appearing live and in person at Toricon in Rochester this weekend.

964
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:57,945
Speaker 0: Mhm.

965
00:53:57,965 --> 00:53:58,917
Speaker 0: Which is April?

966
00:53:58,978 --> 00:53:59,120
Speaker 0: what?

967
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,004
Speaker 1: Uh... 22nd?

968
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:06,019
Speaker 1: I usually have no idea what day it is.

969
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, 2006.

970
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:15,399
Speaker 0: Don't listen to this like in 2007 and think we're gonna appear magically and then go somewhere and... That'd be awesome.

971
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:17,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't listen.

972
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:23,439
Speaker 0: I was about to say don't listen to this in 2005 and then show up next year, but... Yeah, it can happen.

973
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:24,919
Speaker 1: We're kind of tired now.

974
00:54:25,424 --> 00:54:25,660
Speaker 0: Alright.

975
00:54:26,283 --> 00:54:26,395
Speaker 1: Yeah.

976
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:35,359
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

977
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,950
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

984
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,770
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

985
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,670
Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
