1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,065
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, July 24th.

2
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:11,827
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,210
Speaker 1: I'm Rin.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,974
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,580
Speaker 1: Tonight, the demise of the dinner.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,478
Speaker 0: Da da da da!

7
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:23,361
Speaker 0: The... Demise.

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:23,963
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

9
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,010
Speaker 1: What's a word that's synonym with demise?

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,933
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

11
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,800
Speaker 1: The something of the supper.

12
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:34,780
Speaker 0: I created somewhat of a modern spectacle on the train home today.

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 1: What could you possibly have done to make a spectacle?

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,171
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, basically, everyone who walked by did a double take.

15
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,280
Speaker 0: Well, you know, because I got on the train, I took a slightly later train.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,479
Speaker 1: I took a way later train.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,466
Speaker 0: So I get on this train, you know, like 20 minutes before it's gonna leave.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:54,220
Speaker 0: So as a result, a lot of people walk past me and almost every single one of them stop and did some sort of double take at me.

19
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,458
Speaker 1: What were you doing?

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,740
Speaker 0: So I had to bring my work laptop back to work to get some stuff done to it before I brought it home again.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,604
Speaker 0: And, you know, I have my normal laptop.

22
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,450
Speaker 0: I do stuff on and the work laptop is bigger.

23
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:08,920
Speaker 0: It's a desktop replacement that I use, like, you know, for work.

24
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,745
Speaker 0: Got this encrypted hard drive.

25
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,700
Speaker 0: It's kind of like if I go on a trip, but it's a business trip or I'm working from home.

26
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:17,714
Speaker 0: I use this thing and, you know, VPNs into the work network.

27
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:18,900
Speaker 0: It's got all the work software.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,244
Speaker 1: I guess that's all right.

29
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:24,220
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're not carrying it too often, then it won't be a physical burden.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:31,080
Speaker 1: And that way you don't have to mess up any of your own computers and you can keep your work computing and home computing perfectly separate.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,029
Speaker 0: Best part is it's got all the work software.

32
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,880
Speaker 0: I've got like the like the full on Adobe in the office and all those things.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know the Oracle, all my server things, everything I could possibly need for work is on there.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,171
Speaker 1: That's good, because, you know, like I know most of my work is Linux.

35
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,400
Speaker 1: All I really need to do is SSH to the work server.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,980
Speaker 1: But if I had some sort of pre-configured separate work machine, that was, you know, a laptop be good, too, because then I could, you know, give it back more easily.

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,471
Speaker 0: Part of that's that, you know, I don't have admin access on it.

38
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaker 0: I just have my normal work access.

39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

40
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:01,326
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:02,975
Speaker 1: Because you're only going to work with it.

42
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:03,840
Speaker 1: You're not going to do anything else.

43
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,199
Speaker 0: But if I need another laptop for whatever reason, I can just boot in Ubuntu CD and rock.

44
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,184
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely.

45
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:10,847
Speaker 0: I already tried that.

46
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,590
Speaker 0: It works just fine.

47
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,554
Speaker 1: Of course, it works just fine.

48
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,760
Speaker 1: It's a normal Dell laptop.

49
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,235
Speaker 0: I had to take it in and I don't have a bag that fits this thing.

50
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:18,380
Speaker 0: So basically I just carried it.

51
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,745
Speaker 0: And on the way in, that's fine.

52
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,800
Speaker 0: I just put it in my lap, went to sleep, you know, listening to some movies you should see.

53
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,805
Speaker 0: They actually did a good show.

54
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,809
Speaker 0: It was very simple.

55
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,620
Speaker 0: It's the kind of thing I'd like to do a week as Thursday about.

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,030
Speaker 1: Man, I like them and I like their show.

57
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:36,220
Speaker 1: And Rich, I am following him on Twitter.

58
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:37,213
Speaker 0: But, but, but.

59
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,713
Speaker 1: I just don't listen to it anymore.

60
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,199
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

61
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,147
Speaker 0: See, I started listening to it again.

62
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:44,440
Speaker 0: And as a result, I started watching a lot of movies again.

63
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,166
Speaker 1: I just sort of saturated with podcasts in general.

64
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:52,460
Speaker 1: I mean, there are podcasts I subscribe to where I just like every episode, like it appears in the thing and I just lead it.

65
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,740
Speaker 0: I actually listen to every single episode of every podcast to which I am subscribed, which is like four.

66
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:07,480
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, is like on the train, you know, it's like I've been I only I've been listening to less podcasts and doing more, you know, book reading and comic reading and video games.

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,847
Speaker 0: See, I'm doing 50/50 now.

68
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,420
Speaker 0: What I'll do is I'll either an anime watching.

69
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,953
Speaker 0: I'll either watch an anime or watch a movie or, you know, work on like a blog stuff.

70
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,598
Speaker 0: I got all these half written articles.

71
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:18,260
Speaker 0: I got to finish.

72
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:24,680
Speaker 0: But the other half the time I'll place it for or something and listen to podcasts at the same time.

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much all my activities are taken aback.

74
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,920
Speaker 1: My podcast listening is taking a backseat to the other thing.

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,950
Speaker 0: I really only listen to movies you should see.

76
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,740
Speaker 0: Dave and Joel and Anime World Order.

77
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,644
Speaker 1: I listen to a few.

78
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:35,951
Speaker 0: Oh, and NPR.

79
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:36,956
Speaker 0: It's all politics.

80
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,740
Speaker 0: I love that show.

81
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,580
Speaker 1: I listen to some more than that, but well, I guess I'm subscribed to more than that, but I'm not listening.

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,586
Speaker 1: And a lot of the ones I'm subscribed to are short.

83
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:45,911
Speaker 0: You know what else I'm subscribed to?

84
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:46,473
Speaker 0: Let's see.

85
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:48,399
Speaker 0: Twelve Byzantine emperors.

86
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have listened to it all again.

87
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,616
Speaker 0: But other than that, great.

88
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 0: There are going to be new ones.

89
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,169
Speaker 0: I hope I hope I hope he does a podcast on Venice.

90
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,740
Speaker 1: Venice is awesome anyway.

91
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:02,453
Speaker 0: So on the way home, you know, I'm awake, I'm not sleeping and I want to do stuff.

92
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:04,240
Speaker 0: So I don't have anywhere to put this laptop.

93
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,440
Speaker 0: So I've got this laptop on my lap and resting on top of it is my other laptop, which is open and I'm using.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,202
Speaker 1: All right.

95
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:17,899
Speaker 0: So people are walking by and they see me with a laptop on my lap closed and another laptop open.

96
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,910
Speaker 0: And they'd stop and look at it like, what the fuck?

97
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:21,793
Speaker 1: Why is it?

98
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:22,295
Speaker 1: what the fuck?

99
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 1: Just to have two laptops.

100
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,021
Speaker 0: I don't know.

101
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,483
Speaker 0: It's kind of.

102
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,492
Speaker 0: it's kind of weird to have two laptops, I guess.

103
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,200
Speaker 1: I don't know what's so weird about it.

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,069
Speaker 1: I know people with a lot more than two laptops.

105
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:31,616
Speaker 0: Yes, but to have two on you.

106
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:32,400
Speaker 1: Why not?

107
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:33,323
Speaker 0: I don't know.

108
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,749
Speaker 0: People looked at me like it was weird.

109
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:36,960
Speaker 0: Everyone who walked by looked like, what's he doing?

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,547
Speaker 1: I saw a guy sitting next to me on the train today.

111
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,731
Speaker 1: He had a Blackberry.

112
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,757
Speaker 1: And then from his pocket, he pulled out a cell phone.

113
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:43,660
Speaker 0: Not weird.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,811
Speaker 0: See, that's not weird at all, though, because most people have like the work Blackberry.

115
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:48,960
Speaker 1: Two laptops is no weirder.

116
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:54,000
Speaker 0: I think two laptops is kind of weirder because there's no possible reason to have two laptops out.

117
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:54,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is.

118
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:55,404
Speaker 1: Why?

119
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,411
Speaker 1: To protect your lab from the other laptop.

120
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:59,840
Speaker 1: That's ludicrous because it's real warm.

121
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,220
Speaker 0: I mean, while I was doing this, I did actually have the Blackberry out because I was transferring stuff from the Blackberry to my laptop with the Bluetooth.

122
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,235
Speaker 0: I didn't pull my cell phone out because I'm not going to call anyone on the train.

123
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:11,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,365
Speaker 1: But there was a meeting at work.

125
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:18,780
Speaker 1: But then like one that one of the bosses who was in on the meeting wasn't there when it was time for the meeting.

126
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,992
Speaker 1: The other one was on the phone and wouldn't get off the phone.

127
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,400
Speaker 1: And so the meeting was late.

128
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,045
Speaker 1: And then it was even later.

129
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,496
Speaker 1: So I took away later train and I got home like 10 minutes ago into my work.

130
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,084
Speaker 0: Made me late all the time.

131
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:30,565
Speaker 0: I quit.

132
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:31,569
Speaker 1: It's not all the time.

133
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,051
Speaker 1: It's one.

134
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is because you get home a lot later than you want to.

135
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,245
Speaker 1: And what can I do about it?

136
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:36,647
Speaker 0: Quit.

137
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,154
Speaker 0: Like you said, you always what are you?

138
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,440
Speaker 0: Are you a Barack?

139
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,322
Speaker 1: Where am I going?

140
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:41,024
Speaker 1: Who am I going to go?

141
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:43,070
Speaker 0: I thought it was easy to get another job.

142
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,400
Speaker 1: I thought your advice is easy to get another job.

143
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,689
Speaker 1: It's not easy to get another job with cool peoples.

144
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:49,654
Speaker 0: I don't know.

145
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:50,959
Speaker 0: I got a job with awesome people.

146
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want your job.

147
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,432
Speaker 1: Your job has other problems.

148
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,400
Speaker 0: What problem could my job possibly have?

149
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:04,120
Speaker 1: I work in a company where, by and large, everyone is smarter than me because the actual work is not something I want to do, which is the most important thing.

150
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:05,644
Speaker 0: My work is awesome.

151
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,168
Speaker 0: I'm not doing.

152
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,332
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be doing I.T.

153
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:08,813
Speaker 1: work there.

154
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:09,756
Speaker 1: If I was doing I.T.

155
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:11,060
Speaker 1: work there, I would take your job.

156
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,244
Speaker 1: That would be just fine.

157
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:12,846
Speaker 1: I could do that.

158
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,091
Speaker 1: Be moving V.M.

159
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,098
Speaker 1: wares and you know, that sort of thing.

160
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:16,720
Speaker 1: I can do that.

161
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,285
Speaker 0: What kind of job do you want?

162
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,107
Speaker 1: I want the head.

163
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:23,160
Speaker 1: Well, my job is slowly becoming the job I want, which is why it's kind of cool.

164
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,193
Speaker 1: We're like we're switching from the PHP to the Jango's and like the things.

165
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,760
Speaker 1: it's like the things that we're suggesting are actually happening.

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,107
Speaker 1: Like we made a wiki for documentation.

167
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:40,260
Speaker 1: And it's like even though we got bought out, it's like now our opinions are somehow mattering more.

168
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,660
Speaker 1: And we're leaning more in the direction of what we the programmers want to do.

169
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,032
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you got to stay late.

170
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,580
Speaker 0: Take a later train.

171
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,532
Speaker 1: Well, maybe, you know, that won't be a problem in the future.

172
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:51,960
Speaker 0: We'll see demand more vacation days.

173
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:57,060
Speaker 1: Well, I already I got more vacation days and we got bought automatically to get more sell.

174
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,600
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is now I can't just negotiate that with my boss because now he's an employee, too.

175
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,275
Speaker 1: We need to negotiate that with people in North Carolina.

176
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,100
Speaker 1: So it's more difficult.

177
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,325
Speaker 0: So you got we'll see.

178
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,912
Speaker 1: I'm not going to work at this place forever.

179
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:11,535
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

180
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:12,740
Speaker 1: I've worked there for two years.

181
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:17,693
Speaker 0: I honestly it's weird, but I worked at IBM and that was really fun.

182
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,100
Speaker 0: But, you know, I had I couldn't just work at IBM my whole life.

183
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,160
Speaker 0: So now I work to the hospital and you all know my opinion of the hospital.

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,340
Speaker 0: There were there were a lot of reasons why I left the hospital and then it was sick.

185
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:42,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was one of the reasons, you know, I can't complain too much about a job where at one point after my third boss quit and they didn't know like they knew they needed me to do work.

186
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,445
Speaker 0: There was a lot of work that needed doing.

187
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:50,720
Speaker 0: So they basically sent me off to do all the kind of weird work that required judgment on the spot, kind of like a ship's captain.

188
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,880
Speaker 0: How in the army, no one's really out on his own because there's supply lines all the way back.

189
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,202
Speaker 0: I'm talking Napoleonic days.

190
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:07,180
Speaker 0: So you could send orders pretty easily to most of the people doing all this stuff, but you could send a ship halfway around the world and you don't know if you're going to make peace or war.

191
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,045
Speaker 0: I mean, how often in Horatio is he out?

192
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,573
Speaker 0: They see a Spanish ship and they're like, shit, are we at war?

193
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:12,375
Speaker 0: I don't know.

194
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:13,679
Speaker 0: Let's see if they shoot at us.

195
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:15,520
Speaker 0: Crap, we're at war.

196
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,918
Speaker 1: Because if you're real close to Spain, then and you're from England or UK, whatever, I guess in those days.

197
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, England.

198
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,909
Speaker 1: Then, you know, you've been away from England for X days.

199
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:30,080
Speaker 1: They've been away from Spain for maybe a few hours, depending on how close to Spain you are.

200
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 1: So there's a good chance they know the most current news, but you don't know the most current news.

201
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,648
Speaker 0: But at the same time, say you think you're at peace.

202
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,352
Speaker 0: They know you're at war.

203
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,433
Speaker 0: But what if you go the other way around?

204
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,616
Speaker 0: They know there's peace.

205
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:43,880
Speaker 0: You think it's still war.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,117
Speaker 0: You're out there and the Spanish ship is coming up and they're yelling, no, no, peace.

207
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:48,860
Speaker 1: No, don't shoot.

208
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:53,474
Speaker 1: They could be faking it, you know, and then pull a surprise attack.

209
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,120
Speaker 1: You could do the same thing.

210
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:55,761
Speaker 0: Yes.

211
00:08:55,781 --> 00:09:00,920
Speaker 0: So ship's captains were given incredible leeway to, you know, make judgment calls back then.

212
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,200
Speaker 1: Of course, if you fucked up, you know what happened.

213
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:03,603
Speaker 1: Yes.

214
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:06,380
Speaker 0: With great responsibility comes great risk.

215
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:07,360
Speaker 1: Comes great hanging.

216
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,806
Speaker 1: Hanging is frequent, pretty much.

217
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:12,009
Speaker 1: If you do this, you will be hanged.

218
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,955
Speaker 1: If you do this, you'll be hanged.

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:26,720
Speaker 0: My favorite part is that if you read the articles of war, it's like, if you are convicted of doing such and such, to be hanged or lesser such penalty as deemed appropriate, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,839
Speaker 0: But then it hits a couple of them like mutiny and it's like to be hanged.

221
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,951
Speaker 1: It's not to be hanged.

222
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:33,960
Speaker 1: It's hanged.

223
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,461
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

224
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,752
Speaker 0: It's to be hanged, but there's none of that or lesser such punishment.

225
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:40,019
Speaker 0: There isn't even the option of doing less to you.

226
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

227
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:50,100
Speaker 1: It's pretty much like, I don't know how many times the ratio, the books and the movies there, they're just like, you know what the penalty is for that hanging.

228
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,740
Speaker 1: There's nothing we can do to save you, even though we know that you did it for a good reason.

229
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,958
Speaker 0: So Horatio does something awesome to get the guy off.

230
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,582
Speaker 1: Yeah.

231
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,894
Speaker 1: It's like, there's no way off the hook, man.

232
00:09:58,935 --> 00:09:59,417
Speaker 1: It's hanging.

233
00:09:59,457 --> 00:09:59,799
Speaker 1: That's it.

234
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,660
Speaker 0: In one of the books, he is obligated to hang someone for disobeying an order.

235
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:13,120
Speaker 0: The order was that he was in the Marine band and he refused to play a B flat because it was the wrong note because the music was written poorly.

236
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,179
Speaker 0: And the order was given by a technically superior officer.

237
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:16,360
Speaker 1: Yep.

238
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,939
Speaker 1: Refusing to play a note, breaking an order, only option, hanging.

239
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,471
Speaker 0: And the funny part is Horatio's like, eh, I got to hang him.

240
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,259
Speaker 0: And his wife is like, what the fuck's wrong with you?

241
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, uh, so back at the hospital, I was kind of like a ship's captain at this point.

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,419
Speaker 0: So they'd send me off like whatever, there was something weird going on.

243
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:39,520
Speaker 0: They'd send me off like, all right, Brandon, you know, cause they didn't, I, that job didn't know my name was rim.

244
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,400
Speaker 0: Cause they, they didn't deserve to know my real life.

245
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,652
Speaker 1: But your real name is Brandon.

246
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:44,539
Speaker 1: Rim is the fake name.

247
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:53,660
Speaker 0: The thing is my, my, my quote unquote fake name is used by more people, both that I know and that know me than my quote unquote real name.

248
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
Speaker 1: Why don't you just then go to the judge and say, change my name?

249
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,659
Speaker 0: Actually, I looked into it and the only reason I haven't is that it's a giant pain in the ass.

250
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:01,765
Speaker 1: It's not that hard.

251
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,120
Speaker 1: You just have to go get a new ID at the DMV.

252
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,260
Speaker 0: No, it's a giant pain in the, I don't think you understand the pain in the ass it is to actually change your name.

253
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,450
Speaker 1: It can't be that hard.

254
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:11,400
Speaker 1: People do it all the time.

255
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,405
Speaker 0: No, no, no, they don't.

256
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,260
Speaker 0: And two, when you do, most people who do it are kind of poor.

257
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:25,208
Speaker 0: If you have a bunch of credit cards and a bunch of investments and all this kind of, you know, economic and all these things around you, they all have to be changed.

258
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,840
Speaker 0: Most people don't have straightforward policies.

259
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,746
Speaker 0: Your mail gets fucked up forever.

260
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:33,060
Speaker 0: Your credit rating gets fucked up until you deal with it at every agency.

261
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,939
Speaker 0: It's this gigantic snafu.

262
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,115
Speaker 1: You just call every single place and say I changed my name.

263
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,100
Speaker 1: I changed my name.

264
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,920
Speaker 0: I did the research and all the research indicates that it's such a pain in the ass.

265
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,120
Speaker 0: And half the time people just, a lot of like people who suck just don't have the capability to deal with your name change.

266
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:55,820
Speaker 1: I can't imagine being, I mean, if it happened to me or if I want to change my name to Joe, I say go get a DMV.

267
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,640
Speaker 1: I got to call my credit card company and the bank and my job and the post office.

268
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,611
Speaker 0: Yes, I have to call all my credit card companies.

269
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:05,000
Speaker 0: I also have to deal with my health insurance.

270
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,569
Speaker 0: I have to deal with my investments.

271
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,259
Speaker 0: There's a lot to it.

272
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,540
Speaker 1: I would just tell my job and the HR person would take care of it.

273
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,669
Speaker 0: No, usually they won't.

274
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,598
Speaker 0: And there's a lot to it.

275
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:13,700
Speaker 1: Oh, they will.

276
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,793
Speaker 0: Also, you've got to make sure your medical records get transferred right.

277
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,340
Speaker 1: Old medical records might just disappear.

278
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,483
Speaker 1: You know what?

279
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:25,300
Speaker 1: If they don't do it, I could just quit, go get a new job and fill out all the new job paperwork with my new name.

280
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,750
Speaker 0: Regardless, I don't know why you're arguing.

281
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:29,920
Speaker 0: Apparently it's a giant pain in the ass.

282
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:35,778
Speaker 0: Plus, in most jurisdictions you actually have to go before a judge and prove a valid reason for changing your name.

283
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:36,500
Speaker 0: They can just say no.

284
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:37,198
Speaker 1: That'd be fun.

285
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:38,940
Speaker 0: Usually it's not.

286
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,676
Speaker 1: Why not?

287
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,719
Speaker 0: From what I read, it's not because the judges don't care.

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,979
Speaker 1: Judges are cool.

289
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:46,060
Speaker 0: Sometimes.

290
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,530
Speaker 1: I'm just going to be friendly with the judge.

291
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,960
Speaker 1: Be like, what's up judge?

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,531
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they'd send me off and they'd be like, all right, drive to this hospital.

293
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,760
Speaker 0: It's like 20 miles away or 30 miles away, like down somewhere weird.

294
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,413
Speaker 0: Oh, go to white planes.

295
00:12:58,433 --> 00:12:59,140
Speaker 0: There's this hospital.

296
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,800
Speaker 0: With the wigs and the robes.

297
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,570
Speaker 0: We don't know what's going on.

298
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,280
Speaker 0: Go figure out where our switches went.

299
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,394
Speaker 0: So I'd go out there and they basically say, report back to us in a week.

300
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,680
Speaker 0: And that was the extent of my orders.

301
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:19,920
Speaker 0: So I'd go and I'd resolve the problem immediately or I'd find out what the problem was and I'd report back and I'd be like, here's the problem.

302
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,857
Speaker 0: What do you want me to do?

303
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,699
Speaker 0: And they'd say, hang on, we'll figure out what we want you to do.

304
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,060
Speaker 0: And then a week would go by and every day I'd doodlefully say, what do you want me to do?

305
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,860
Speaker 0: And they'd say, I don't know, go to the hospital and wait.

306
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,980
Speaker 0: And as I learned, they would never tell me what to do after I got to the hospital.

307
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,259
Speaker 0: And eventually if I kept asking, they'd say, oh, it's like five, go home.

308
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,145
Speaker 0: So I asked what to do.

309
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:39,907
Speaker 0: They'd say, wait.

310
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,240
Speaker 0: And then I would just go somewhere and hang out.

311
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,667
Speaker 0: I had my cell phone.

312
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,700
Speaker 0: If they actually wanted me to do work, they could call me.

313
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,745
Speaker 0: They'd never call me.

314
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,379
Speaker 0: And then I'd go home and then a week would go by without me doing any work.

315
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,799
Speaker 0: That job was awesome, but not in the awesome way.

316
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:55,967
Speaker 1: That was like my job.

317
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:56,691
Speaker 1: Middle of nowhere.

318
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,100
Speaker 0: I go to the middle of nowhere.

319
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,900
Speaker 0: You'd have to drive to that office where there was no one and do nothing and then drive home.

320
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Speaker 1: Well, there was technically a work I was supposed to be doing.

321
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,660
Speaker 1: They were like, they wanted me to basically make a new version of this existing application.

322
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,061
Speaker 1: Right.

323
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,840
Speaker 1: And I'm like, OK, what exactly do you want me to do differently?

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,320
Speaker 1: Like, what are the specifications for this remake of this project?

325
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:20,280
Speaker 1: You know, and they were like, all right, we'll have a meeting about that.

326
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,063
Speaker 1: I'm like, OK.

327
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:27,859
Speaker 1: Occasionally the project I had already completed needed a little bit of maintenance, but that was like once every couple of weeks, a tiny bit of work.

328
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:31,312
Speaker 1: So it was mostly just being like, hey, are we going to discuss?

329
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,420
Speaker 1: And someone's like, oh, well, you can at least do this part.

330
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,547
Speaker 1: We don't need to discuss that.

331
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,371
Speaker 1: I'm like, OK.

332
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:36,820
Speaker 1: I never did that part.

333
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,043
Speaker 1: No one noticed.

334
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,208
Speaker 1: No one talked to me.

335
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,473
Speaker 1: No one cared.

336
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,019
Speaker 1: No one said anything to me.

337
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,332
Speaker 1: No one checked to see what work I was doing.

338
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:45,540
Speaker 1: No one checked on the progress.

339
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,932
Speaker 1: No one noticed this meeting wasn't happening.

340
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:52,079
Speaker 1: Apparently they wanted it done, but they didn't want it done badly enough to actually pay attention to me.

341
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,520
Speaker 1: If I hadn't quit, I probably could have had that middle of nowhere job until now.

342
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,745
Speaker 1: Still just doing nothing.

343
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,580
Speaker 1: And I probably wouldn't have done any more work now than was completed then.

344
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,629
Speaker 0: Didn't you bring your DDR pad out there?

345
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,614
Speaker 0: Oh, I did.

346
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,960
Speaker 1: I had my DDR pad out there.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,291
Speaker 1: And I would just play step mania while instead of working.

348
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:09,796
Speaker 0: Man, that's a good life.

349
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 0: to a point.

350
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,131
Speaker 1: It was OK until I went insane for me in the middle of nowhere.

351
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,460
Speaker 0: See, I don't know if I had a job like that.

352
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,780
Speaker 0: I would consider it a month or two worth of getting everything I needed to get done, done in my life.

353
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:30,080
Speaker 1: And that's the problem is that I, you know, while I was working in the middle of nowhere, I realized too late that I could have just not gone to the middle of nowhere and just stayed home.

354
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,380
Speaker 0: I kept saying every day, I was like, why don't you just get another job?

355
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,956
Speaker 1: Because it was just like, you know, it's sort of like that, eh.

356
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,072
Speaker 0: And you know what, even better, just get another job.

357
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,420
Speaker 0: Don't even say anything.

358
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,388
Speaker 0: Just see how long they keep paying you.

359
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:45,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then there could have been some legal problems later.

360
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,425
Speaker 0: There are ways around that.

361
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:47,793
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

362
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:49,020
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have worried.

363
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:50,764
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

364
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:59,320
Speaker 1: is I worried just a little too much about, you know, cause I kept the CEO of the company lived like around the corner and sometimes he'd drop in like maybe once a month.

365
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
Speaker 0: And if he dropped in and you weren't there, he'd probably say, where were you?

366
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,313
Speaker 0: And he'd be like, eh, I was going out to lunch.

367
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,700
Speaker 0: I had a flat tire and I had to deal with it.

368
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,386
Speaker 0: There's no work to do.

369
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:08,598
Speaker 0: So I didn't bother calling anyone.

370
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:11,278
Speaker 0: And then I'd just show up for the next couple of weeks.

371
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:12,746
Speaker 1: Yeah.

372
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

373
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:14,280
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

374
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:17,220
Speaker 0: Or you put a cardboard cutout of yourself in the distance.

375
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,359
Speaker 0: Like if there's a glass door in the entrance and break the door so it won't open, like his card won't work.

376
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,111
Speaker 1: And it was, it was a bad time.

377
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,520
Speaker 1: I should have, I really regret.

378
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,620
Speaker 1: I could have done a lot of things in that time that I didn't do, but I would have like gone on vacation.

379
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,402
Speaker 0: Seriously.

380
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,376
Speaker 1: I played a lot of video games and I would have made a blog.

381
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:35,500
Speaker 1: I listen to a lot of podcasts.

382
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,084
Speaker 0: You know what you do?

383
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:41,000
Speaker 0: It's like that comic, you damn kid where it's like, so is he going to work?

384
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,225
Speaker 0: He's got a new job.

385
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:44,780
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, the over under is five days before he gets fired.

386
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:51,140
Speaker 0: What you could have done is made a blog called my boss doesn't know I'm not working and doesn't seem to care.

387
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,740
Speaker 0: And have bets on when he finds the blog and what he does when he finds it.

388
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,576
Speaker 1: See, I'm a lot smarter now than I was then.

389
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:03,980
Speaker 1: So it's, you know, back then my best idea was I'll play step mania in the office and say I'm exercising.

390
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:09,680
Speaker 0: If they, you know, that's like the plan of I have found a soda machine that gives free soda.

391
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,479
Speaker 0: I'm going to get one free soda and then never come back and laugh about it for a week.

392
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,060
Speaker 1: Yes.

393
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:17,479
Speaker 0: As opposed to I'm going to make a blog about this soda machine.

394
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:18,122
Speaker 0: Yep.

395
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, I got one hell of a news here, so let's just get any news.

396
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,920
Speaker 1: Oh, he's not a feel like it because I got home late and at work I was actually working.

397
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,370
Speaker 0: It's Geek Nights Thursdays, the lounge.

398
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,374
Speaker 0: We can do whatever we want.

399
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,259
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as.

400
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,819
Speaker 1: Can we just end the show so I can, you know, go eat and go to bed.

401
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,500
Speaker 0: So I want to talk about this because this is one of those crazy things.

402
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,640
Speaker 0: Like what I heard in the news a while, you know, way back that riser as in the guy who made riser.

403
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:46,083
Speaker 0: Yes.

404
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 0: He is charged with murdering his wife in this crazy elaborate scheme is just this crazy court case.

405
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:59,400
Speaker 0: And then the news much later found guilty much later told everyone what he did with the body.

406
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:00,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

407
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:06,040
Speaker 1: It was like when he was just in the first part of that trial where he was just crazy and weird.

408
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 1: It was like, well, there's a lot of circumstantial evidence and anecdotal evidence and character evidence that he probably did it.

409
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,233
Speaker 1: But there's all this weirdness going on and we can't.

410
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 1: we don't really know he did it.

411
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,183
Speaker 1: There's no proof.

412
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,630
Speaker 1: And there was definitely reasonable doubt.

413
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,640
Speaker 1: But he was found guilty because he was crazy.

414
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,120
Speaker 1: And, you know, the jury convicted him because he was a nut job and he didn't know when to keep his mouth shut.

415
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,191
Speaker 1: And then he's like, oh, by the way, the body's here.

416
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,297
Speaker 1: So it's like, oh, you did do it.

417
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:29,940
Speaker 1: Genius.

418
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:33,274
Speaker 0: So this is that times a little bit.

419
00:18:33,294 --> 00:18:34,660
Speaker 1: How could it be times a little bit?

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,587
Speaker 1: OK, I was like, how could it be more than that?

421
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:39,960
Speaker 0: It's on a similar level of just you read the news and go, what?

422
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:41,384
Speaker 0: Is that a joke?

423
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:42,167
Speaker 0: All right.

424
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,069
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess it isn't.

425
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,480
Speaker 0: So the spam king, Edward Eddy Davidson.

426
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,229
Speaker 1: I never heard him, but I've heard of many spam kings.

427
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,080
Speaker 1: Many people have been called this guy was the spam king.

428
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,366
Speaker 0: There were articles about him forever.

429
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,160
Speaker 0: He finally went to jail in April for spamming.

430
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,541
Speaker 1: Really?

431
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:01,479
Speaker 1: I thought they just finally did jail for having them read the news.

432
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,528
Speaker 1: There's that can spam act, but it's so it's so weak.

433
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,351
Speaker 0: All right.

434
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,060
Speaker 0: This guy was the spam king.

435
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,562
Speaker 0: All right.

436
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:11,293
Speaker 0: He was known as the spam king, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

437
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,020
Speaker 0: He was sent to jail.

438
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,299
Speaker 0: Now, when I say jail, basically he was sent to the most minimum security facility there is.

439
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,689
Speaker 1: So it was this like the lock up in the police station.

440
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:25,500
Speaker 1: or was this actually a county jail or prison, not jail?

441
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,780
Speaker 0: Oh, so he was sent to a federal prison camp, a federal prison, which, yes, it was a federal law.

442
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 0: Federal prison camps are basically take cool hand Luke without the psychological torture, without the dying and without the hard labor.

443
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,825
Speaker 0: It's basically summer camp.

444
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:44,870
Speaker 1: Really?

445
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,291
Speaker 1: Yes.

446
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 1: Man, I should become the spam king.

447
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 0: They make you do menial work for nearby prisons that are more security.

448
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,230
Speaker 1: Like what kind of menial work do you do?

449
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,560
Speaker 0: Like, you know, I don't know.

450
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:59,653
Speaker 0: But basically it's like summer camp.

451
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:01,140
Speaker 0: There's almost no guards.

452
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,279
Speaker 0: And he was only supposed to be there for like twenty one months.

453
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,160
Speaker 1: Twenty one months is a long time, but it's not longer than I was in the middle of nowhere, which is basically the same thing.

454
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,759
Speaker 0: They also made him give up all the gold coins that he bought to hide his money.

455
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:19,179
Speaker 0: They didn't pay a seven hundred and fourteen thousand dollar restitution to the IRS.

456
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,166
Speaker 1: Here's a funny side story, right?

457
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,760
Speaker 1: I was talking with a coworker like a week or two ago.

458
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,061
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:30,480
Speaker 1: And he mentioned, you know, I was talking about PayPal and some other stuff and a guy getting screwed on eBay and whatnot.

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,900
Speaker 1: And he's like, yeah, once I paid for something with e-gold and e-gold as a Web site, e-gold is a Web site that's sort of like PayPal.

461
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:44,300
Speaker 1: But the way it works is you give them money, then they give you you know, they that they have gold.

462
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,060
Speaker 1: They actually have gold that is represented by your money.

463
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,739
Speaker 0: Well, and then they give you a picture of your goal.

464
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:50,980
Speaker 1: Right.

465
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,430
Speaker 1: And then they give you know, I guess they don't physically do it.

466
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,820
Speaker 1: But, you know, financially speaking, you're buying gold.

467
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:06,060
Speaker 1: Then there by giving them cash, then they transfer the ownership of that gold to someone else who then can turn it into cash if they want to.

468
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:17,300
Speaker 1: So you are basically buying something with gold, which is really good for the person on the other end of the line who wants to be paid in gold rather than paid in whatever currency you happen to use.

469
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:25,100
Speaker 1: Of course, recently, this is funny because he talked about using e-gold years and years ago and I'd never heard of it before.

470
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,859
Speaker 1: But just like a few days ago, there was a story on the Internet's e-gold mad money laundering going on.

471
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,726
Speaker 1: Ah, big surprise.

472
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:37,359
Speaker 1: Big surprise is money laundering with the with the gold transactions.

473
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,323
Speaker 0: I heard something else.

474
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,420
Speaker 0: So Penn Jillette was walking around and so he said something that offended someone.

475
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:54,580
Speaker 1: Guess I would never would have thought that these instant gold transfers a lot of PayPal type set up our money laundering heaven.

476
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,526
Speaker 0: So the spam king, his wife, visited him in prison.

477
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:03,236
Speaker 1: She's allowed to do and he didn't do the visiting with the wall on the phone.

478
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,859
Speaker 0: that much time left to go.

479
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,065
Speaker 0: Well, it's minimum security.

480
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,235
Speaker 1: So I got to access the park bench out in the grass, something like that.

481
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:10,756
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:11,820
Speaker 1: The fence around it.

483
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:15,760
Speaker 0: So he forces her to take him back to the car and he totally escapes.

484
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,020
Speaker 1: OK.

485
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:21,900
Speaker 0: Thus turning his 21 month prison sentence into, well, you're fucked now.

486
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,125
Speaker 0: So he gets away.

487
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,095
Speaker 0: He escapes from the federal prison.

488
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:27,160
Speaker 0: He's at large.

489
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,859
Speaker 1: All he did was walk to a car, get in and drive real fast.

490
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,041
Speaker 0: Yes.

491
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:31,758
Speaker 0: They didn't chase him?

492
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,040
Speaker 0: He went home to his house, apparently got a change of clothes and then booked.

493
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,726
Speaker 1: How did they not go to?

494
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,140
Speaker 1: why did they go to his house and wait for him there?

495
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,271
Speaker 0: Because they did because he went right away.

496
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,940
Speaker 0: It's like he went straight to his house and got away.

497
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,038
Speaker 1: He must have lived really close.

498
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,333
Speaker 0: Well, they couldn't drive there faster and they didn't know.

499
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,220
Speaker 0: he broke out right away.

500
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:49,559
Speaker 0: But, quote, he jumped in the car with his wife.

501
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,240
Speaker 0: They when they were leaving, he forced her into the car, brought them home and left after a change of clothes.

502
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,859
Speaker 0: He is still at large.

503
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,661
Speaker 1: All right.

504
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:09,680
Speaker 1: Well, you see, now his options are pretty rough because it's like he's got to get a hide somewhere, which, you know, too many places to hide, considering he had gold coins and all this money.

505
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,466
Speaker 0: I'm sure there was more money hidden.

506
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,660
Speaker 0: I'm sure he retrieved that money, perhaps, perhaps.

507
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,557
Speaker 1: But I mean, it can't really cross a border to get away.

508
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:19,100
Speaker 0: Yes, it can.

509
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,200
Speaker 0: Depends if he makes it to the Mexican border, the Canadian border, you can totally just go over.

510
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,798
Speaker 1: Where is he going to go over where there aren't people guarding?

511
00:23:27,802 --> 00:23:29,620
Speaker 0: You ever been to the Canadian border?

512
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:32,333
Speaker 0: There are a lot of places where you can just walk across.

513
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:33,560
Speaker 0: There's no roads, no nothing.

514
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:35,699
Speaker 1: Same with Mexico.

515
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,829
Speaker 1: All right, so now he's in Canada.

516
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,980
Speaker 1: What's he going to do in Canada?

517
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,140
Speaker 0: Use his money, find some mafia, get a fake name, live a life of luxury.

518
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,740
Speaker 0: Possible, possible, but it's still difficult.

519
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,640
Speaker 0: So, so, so, so, so.

520
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,187
Speaker 0: So what do you think happened?

521
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,760
Speaker 0: Because actually there was a fairly speedy update.

522
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,007
Speaker 0: In fact, it was a recent update.

523
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:56,740
Speaker 0: I read this immediately on FARC because I was home, I was working on stuff.

524
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,320
Speaker 0: Scott wasn't home, so we're not doing the show.

525
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,119
Speaker 0: I see news that I did not believe.

526
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:01,838
Speaker 1: All right.

527
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,704
Speaker 0: So, uh, what can possibly be?

528
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:13,420
Speaker 0: AK the spam king who reportedly forced his wife to help him escape from a Colorado prison on Sunday has killed himself, a woman and a toddler.

529
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:14,796
Speaker 1: What?

530
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,573
Speaker 0: Yes.

531
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:19,620
Speaker 0: Earlier Tuesday, Colorado affiliate, nine blah, blah, blah.

532
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,060
Speaker 0: News reported that three people have been found dead at an apparent murder suicide in the area.

533
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:36,400
Speaker 0: He didn't live at this house apparently, but as far as they can tell, he shot himself and his wife and a toddler, but there was another child in the car who he did not shoot in his fine.

534
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,860
Speaker 0: He also shot a young girl who survived and was being questioned by police at the time of this press release.

535
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,427
Speaker 1: Wait, it's the same guy.

536
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,080
Speaker 1: So he escaped from prison to kill people.

537
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
Speaker 0: And then he disappeared for a while and they found him and a bunch of people dead and it looks like he shot them and himself.

538
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,960
Speaker 1: He was prob of my guess based on common sense.

539
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,259
Speaker 1: I have my own guess.

540
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Speaker 1: My guess is that he was somehow, you know, trying to, you know, hide in these people's house or forcing them to help him hide or something like that.

541
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,978
Speaker 1: And of course it didn't turn out well and he gave up.

542
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,640
Speaker 0: Well, my belief is that the wife or someone is trying to talk him down with, look, you didn't have that long to go at summer camp.

543
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,060
Speaker 0: Now you're going to go to a real jail and it's going to suck and you're going to be there forever.

544
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:18,500
Speaker 1: If you get caught.

545
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,900
Speaker 1: I mean, if he was, he wasn't caught yet until he did the killing.

546
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:25,160
Speaker 0: But my imagination is you didn't think you clever plan through.

547
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,139
Speaker 0: You're going to get caught if you turn yourself in now and just let us go.

548
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:30,878
Speaker 0: This is probably going to be OK.

549
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,656
Speaker 1: Here's a here's a here's another guess.

550
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:32,960
Speaker 1: Right.

551
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,292
Speaker 1: OK, so he's out.

552
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:35,020
Speaker 1: Right.

553
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:35,868
Speaker 1: And they haven't.

554
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,180
Speaker 1: they're not on his tail at all.

555
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:37,442
Speaker 1: Right.

556
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,760
Speaker 1: They can't really find him because he had a good job of hiding.

557
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,660
Speaker 1: But he's real paranoid now.

558
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,557
Speaker 1: Super paranoid.

559
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,920
Speaker 1: So he's like, you know, forcing the people, his wife and the other people near to him, you know, to like not do anything and such and such.

560
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,780
Speaker 1: And making life generally miserable and the paranoia of, you know, be watching out and not doing anything because it might get you caught and not knowing what will get you caught.

561
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:03,340
Speaker 1: And such and such eventually drives him nuts over the days.

562
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,299
Speaker 1: And then he's nuts.

563
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,920
Speaker 1: And then, of course, killing people.

564
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,540
Speaker 0: There are reports that he was kind of paranoid and weird before all this.

565
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:18,360
Speaker 0: But I think that what the final straw was probably as his wife is saying and explaining all this, he realizes, oh, wait, I totally fucked up.

566
00:26:19,102 --> 00:26:23,640
Speaker 0: And then he panics and just goes crazy and then possible quote when deputies arrived on the scene.

567
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,205
Speaker 0: It is kind of.

568
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,920
Speaker 0: it is actually really sad what happened.

569
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,239
Speaker 0: We thought we did find an adult male deceased by the driver's door of a silver SUV.

570
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,059
Speaker 0: We did find a female adult deceased by the passenger door of the SUV.

571
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:41,380
Speaker 0: And we did find a seven to eight month old little boy in the backseat who appeared to be uninjured, but was transported by rescue personnel as precaution.

572
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,691
Speaker 1: Where are these their kids?

573
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:43,620
Speaker 1: Where these kids come from?

574
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,180
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, inside the car was also found a little girl who we believe was about three years old and she was deceased.

575
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,140
Speaker 0: We did find another victim who was shot and who managed to run to a neighbor's house.

576
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,400
Speaker 0: She's a teenage girl transported with a gunshot wound, but she was coherent and talking to rescue personnel.

577
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,979
Speaker 0: Davidson had served less than two months of his 21 month prison sentence when he escaped.

578
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,002
Speaker 1: What?

579
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,059
Speaker 1: So whose children were these?

580
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,248
Speaker 0: No one knows.

581
00:27:08,308 --> 00:27:09,580
Speaker 0: This is a developing story.

582
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,740
Speaker 1: No one knows who the children's parents were.

583
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:12,941
Speaker 0: All right.

584
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,006
Speaker 0: So the police show up.

585
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:16,619
Speaker 0: All these people are dead just a little while ago.

586
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:17,867
Speaker 0: What the shit?

587
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:19,339
Speaker 1: Hey, kid, who's your mom?

588
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,061
Speaker 0: Yes.

589
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:21,878
Speaker 0: And they don't tell reporters right away.

590
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,360
Speaker 0: So I'm not going to do the play by play or wait for updates.

591
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,860
Speaker 0: But this got this went kind of crazy out of control in a hurry.

592
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:32,507
Speaker 1: That is pretty crazy.

593
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,860
Speaker 1: I mean, if he escaped from prison, something is not easy to do.

594
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,400
Speaker 0: Even the minimum security prison, even cool hand Luke when they caught him.

595
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,620
Speaker 0: I mean, they caught him and they brought him back and they roughed him up a little bit.

596
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,929
Speaker 0: But that's all that happened.

597
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:45,440
Speaker 0: Even go crazy and kill anyone.

598
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

599
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:47,350
Speaker 0: Cool.

600
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,235
Speaker 0: And Luke was awesome.

601
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:48,839
Speaker 1: He was cool.

602
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,282
Speaker 1: This guy.

603
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,106
Speaker 1: Not cool.

604
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,533
Speaker 1: This guy's this guy was not.

605
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:53,880
Speaker 1: is the guy was not cool hand.

606
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,492
Speaker 1: This guy was spam king.

607
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,480
Speaker 0: Gots to be cool.

608
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,420
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're the king of such bad tasting meat, I mean, that's a bad thing to be a king of.

609
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,438
Speaker 1: I'd rather I'd rather be a spam popper than a spam game.

610
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,142
Speaker 0: Spam.

611
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,352
Speaker 0: Don't dare conflate spam.

612
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:07,778
Speaker 0: The meat with spam.

613
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:08,200
Speaker 0: The spam.

614
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,367
Speaker 1: They both suck equally.

615
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:10,011
Speaker 0: Spam.

616
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:11,460
Speaker 0: The meat is mighty tasty.

617
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,368
Speaker 1: First of all, it's not meat.

618
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:13,759
Speaker 1: Second of all, it's not tasty.

619
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,550
Speaker 1: Basically, you were false on two counts.

620
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,440
Speaker 0: You realize spam is just cured ham.

621
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:19,526
Speaker 1: It's not ham.

622
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:19,949
Speaker 1: It's fake.

623
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,200
Speaker 0: It's just cured ham.

624
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,314
Speaker 1: No, it's artificial ham imitation.

625
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,220
Speaker 0: What is it, Scott?

626
00:28:24,923 --> 00:28:27,119
Speaker 0: I suggest you go to Wikipedia and look up what spam is.

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,185
Speaker 1: Imitation ham.

628
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,459
Speaker 0: I'm going to read an excerpt here.

629
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,140
Speaker 0: Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.

630
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,619
Speaker 0: Wikipedia's, ah, God, there's a million articles.

631
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:42,320
Speaker 1: What about the spam king?

632
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,719
Speaker 0: I, Scott, quote, "Spam luncheon meat is a canned, pre-cooked meat product made by the Hormel Foods

633
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:49,220
Speaker 0: Corporation.".

634
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:50,657
Speaker 1: Yeah?

635
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,538
Speaker 0: It is meat.

636
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe technically it's meat, but it is not real meat.

637
00:28:58,222 --> 00:28:59,188
Speaker 0: What do you define real?

638
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,900
Speaker 0: That's a no true Scotsman argument.

639
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,454
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it could be rats.

640
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:02,939
Speaker 1: That's meat.

641
00:29:03,664 --> 00:29:04,340
Speaker 0: Yes, it is meat.

642
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:06,119
Speaker 0: But you can't say it's not meat.

643
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:07,008
Speaker 1: It is not.

644
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:08,138
Speaker 1: It is and it isn't.

645
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,325
Speaker 0: No, it is.

646
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,800
Speaker 0: What is the definition of meat, Scott?

647
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,739
Speaker 0: Don't pull this no true Scotsman bullshit with me.

648
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:17,273
Speaker 0: You call everyone on no true Scotsman.

649
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,940
Speaker 0: You're not going to get away with that bullshit now.

650
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,699
Speaker 1: Well, you see, the problem is there's multiple definitions of meat, you see.

651
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,820
Speaker 1: The one definition of meat is flesh of animal.

652
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,400
Speaker 1: That is the definition of meat.

653
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Speaker 1: The other definition of meat is edible flesh of animal, you see.

654
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,080
Speaker 1: And it is definitely not edible.

655
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,840
Speaker 0: Spam is perfectly edible.

656
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
Speaker 1: You see, because there's two definitions of edible, you see.

657
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Speaker 1: There's the definition of edible, which is able to be eaten without killing.

658
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,140
Speaker 1: And then there's the other definition of edible, which is good for eating.

659
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,814
Speaker 0: No, you see, what you're doing here, Scott, what you're doing is you're taking the no true Scotsman and you're hiding it behind pedantry.

660
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,469
Speaker 0: You're a pedantic.

661
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:54,980
Speaker 0: no true Scotsman.

662
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,391
Speaker 1: That's fine.

663
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:57,239
Speaker 1: What's wrong with that?

664
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,059
Speaker 1: Alright, anyway.

665
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,380
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the same way that Checkers is a game.

666
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,119
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, it is not a game.

667
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,806
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

668
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,259
Speaker 0: It's a good game, in fact.

669
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,244
Speaker 1: Not that good.

670
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,500
Speaker 1: Well, Checkers is maybe a bad example.

671
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,278
Speaker 1: Perhaps Final Fantasy is a game, but it is not a game.

672
00:30:14,944 --> 00:30:16,340
Speaker 0: No, it's very clearly a game.

673
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,320
Speaker 1: Well, it is a game by the definition of a, you know, a thing that you do to entertain yourself.

674
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:26,480
Speaker 1: As though it's a good game, but it is not a, you know, test of skills.

675
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:27,879
Speaker 1: It is a test of patience.

676
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:38,039
Speaker 0: Anyway, things of the day.

677
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,703
Speaker 1: So check this out.

678
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:44,540
Speaker 1: Back in Rochester, you know, where we went to school, is the place of Kodak.

679
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,940
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's Eastman Kodak, so there's a place called the George Eastman House.

680
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:56,140
Speaker 1: And they have, of course, many old films and photos and things, and it's sort of a museum type of place.

681
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,860
Speaker 1: I could say more about it, but you can find out enough on the internets.

682
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:04,200
Speaker 1: But what they did is they took a bunch of their wicked old photos.

683
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:11,260
Speaker 1: Like we're talking 19 oh something like early 20th century photography and they've put it on the flicker.

684
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,360
Speaker 1: You can go check it out.

685
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,716
Speaker 1: And I'm looking through it and I'm like, wow, that's cool.

686
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:15,320
Speaker 1: Wow, that's cool.

687
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,024
Speaker 1: That's cool.

688
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:17,920
Speaker 1: But then like, hey, that's a famous photo.

689
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,070
Speaker 1: I've seen that before.

690
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,957
Speaker 1: And then now that's cool.

691
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:20,340
Speaker 1: That's cool.

692
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,280
Speaker 1: Oh, that's another famous photo I've seen before.

693
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,020
Speaker 1: And they're all on the flicker and really high quality.

694
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:39,399
Speaker 1: Looking at it in many ways, I realized that, you know, even though things nowadays are way better than things were in the early 20th century, there were a few things here and there they had better than we have now.

695
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:42,960
Speaker 1: Oh, for example, they had houses on trains.

696
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:44,707
Speaker 1: We didn't have.

697
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,079
Speaker 1: we don't have houses on trains anymore.

698
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,880
Speaker 0: Let's because trains don't go everywhere.

699
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,153
Speaker 0: Instead, Scott, we have Winnebagos.

700
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,240
Speaker 0: We have houses on roads.

701
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,434
Speaker 1: They had blimps.

702
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:53,345
Speaker 1: We don't know.

703
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 0: We're coming back, actually, in a big way.

704
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,246
Speaker 1: We don't have blimps, though.

705
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:56,488
Speaker 1: We have.

706
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,260
Speaker 1: we have the MetLife blimp, which doesn't count.

707
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,460
Speaker 0: Actually, cargo blimps are coming back in a big way.

708
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,549
Speaker 1: We'll see about that.

709
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:02,539
Speaker 1: I still haven't seen one.

710
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,039
Speaker 1: I'll believe it when I see one flying over the house.

711
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Speaker 1: You know, I've seen a picture on the Internet does not count.

712
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:09,795
Speaker 0: I got more than just that.

713
00:32:09,856 --> 00:32:10,078
Speaker 0: But anyway.

714
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,461
Speaker 0: Yeah.

715
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,346
Speaker 1: But anyway.

716
00:32:11,527 --> 00:32:11,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

717
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,920
Speaker 1: So it's it's pretty cool checking this shit out.

718
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:24,826
Speaker 1: And, you know, if you've got, you know, 20 minutes, click and look at old photos and you can see what the world looked like in, you know, the early 20th century, over 100 years ago.

719
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:31,810
Speaker 0: So in 1985, at the Grammy Awards, a confluence of awesome occurred.

720
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:36,690
Speaker 0: You know, every now and then, like a bunch of really awesome people get together and do something.

721
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,670
Speaker 0: And then that sort of thing is kind of rare.

722
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:44,010
Speaker 0: Like be like if I don't know, lead singer from the best band in the world and the best writer from the best band.

723
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,490
Speaker 0: It's like the all star game of music.

724
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,190
Speaker 1: The thing is, a lot of times they do that at the Grammy Awards.

725
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:52,650
Speaker 1: It's like, hey, we'll take two famous people, put them on stage at the same time.

726
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,179
Speaker 1: But then they'll be like a lip sync thing.

727
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,890
Speaker 1: And it's all sort of scripted and blend.

728
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,330
Speaker 1: It's not really as awesome as if they actually rocked out together.

729
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,770
Speaker 1: You know, the Grammys is sort of like it's got that the tone of an award show event.

730
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,850
Speaker 1: It doesn't have the tone of like the arena concert of all time.

731
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:08,635
Speaker 1: Let's get it on.

732
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:09,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

733
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,010
Speaker 0: Well, it really depends.

734
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,617
Speaker 0: But this one is pretty cool.

735
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,550
Speaker 0: This is 1985, a musical act at the Grammy Awards.

736
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:20,470
Speaker 0: And the one thing I want to point out is that 1985 was the year when Cyndi Lauper was still pop.

737
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,269
Speaker 1: Well, I was three years old.

738
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,130
Speaker 0: I think she was just becoming popular.

739
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,388
Speaker 1: You know who I'm talking to, old man.

740
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,290
Speaker 0: The thing is, I actually was a big fan of Cyndi Lauper when I was a kid.

741
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,010
Speaker 1: I didn't know who it was.

742
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,174
Speaker 1: She sang the Goonies song.

743
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:35,890
Speaker 0: Good enough for you, good enough, it's good enough.

744
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,350
Speaker 1: I don't know who it is still.

745
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:38,597
Speaker 0: Really?

746
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:39,469
Speaker 1: The Goonies song.

747
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they got Thomas Dolby.

748
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:45,999
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

749
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,370
Speaker 1: Is he the guy from Dolby Digital?

750
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,410
Speaker 0: No, in fact, he was sued by Dolby Digital for using the name Dolby.

751
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,480
Speaker 1: But is that his real name?

752
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,541
Speaker 1: No.

753
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:53,296
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

754
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:54,349
Speaker 1: So then they could sue him.

755
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,399
Speaker 0: Herbie Hancock.

756
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:56,309
Speaker 1: Howard Jones.

757
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,189
Speaker 1: I kind of know who that is.

758
00:33:58,293 --> 00:33:59,809
Speaker 0: Get the hell off my show.

759
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,399
Speaker 0: Howard Jones.

760
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,209
Speaker 1: Don't know who that is.

761
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,301
Speaker 0: And Stevie Wonder.

762
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:03,968
Speaker 1: I know who that is.

763
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,890
Speaker 0: And in 1985, synthesizers were not like they are today.

764
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,889
Speaker 0: So this is a key, taran, vocal, whatever, boxing.

765
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,730
Speaker 1: Stevie Wonder is the master of all synthesizers.

766
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:24,050
Speaker 0: Beyond that, Stevie Wonder, I think my favorite thing about him is the way he smiles when a crowd is cheering for him.

767
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,150
Speaker 0: He always kind of like rears up and then kind of jives back and forth with this big grin.

768
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:30,469
Speaker 0: I love Stevie Wonder.

769
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:31,596
Speaker 1: He's pretty awesome.

770
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, this video is pretty cool.

771
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,110
Speaker 0: And let me tell you, I love the sound of old synthesizers, even though a lot of people, they sound cheesy.

772
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,650
Speaker 1: It depends on how they're being used and such.

773
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,710
Speaker 0: Well, 80s synthesizers sound cheesy partly because of the way they were used.

774
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:52,929
Speaker 0: And as a result, when you hear the sounds they can make, the sounds are automatically associated with cheesiness.

775
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:56,129
Speaker 0: But I think they're pretty cool and I think this is pretty cool.

776
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,910
Speaker 1: I think it really depends with the 80s synthesizers.

777
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:00,649
Speaker 1: They can be cool or uncool.

778
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,469
Speaker 0: So what do you eat for dinner?

779
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,869
Speaker 1: Two chocolate chip cookies and some apple juice.

780
00:35:10,432 --> 00:35:14,090
Speaker 0: Well, I had a bowl of ice cream and four Jamaican beef patty bites.

781
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,169
Speaker 1: Sesame stick.

782
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,089
Speaker 0: Oh, and a handful of sunflower seeds.

783
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,255
Speaker 1: Sesame bread stick.

784
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,060
Speaker 1: Oh, some prunes.

785
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:20,650
Speaker 1: I finished off the bag of prunes.

786
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:24,070
Speaker 0: When I came home, I cut up some smoked Gouda and had it with some Malbatos.

787
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:25,214
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

788
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:27,230
Speaker 1: That's not much of a dinner, really.

789
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,923
Speaker 1: I mean, how many food groups did I cover?

790
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:31,270
Speaker 1: Fruit, fruit and cookie.

791
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,050
Speaker 1: You forgot yellow.

792
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,216
Speaker 1: Oh, and bread.

793
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,990
Speaker 1: So fruit, fruit, cookie, bread.

794
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,528
Speaker 1: I didn't get any vegetable or meat or dairy.

795
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:41,330
Speaker 0: You're missing yellow and grape drink.

796
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,170
Speaker 1: I really need that meat food group.

797
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,503
Speaker 1: Well, I did have two tiny tacos today.

798
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:46,730
Speaker 1: That covered my meat, kinda.

799
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,790
Speaker 0: See, at least I have these four Jamaican beef patties that I cooked and the two ought to eat.

800
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,290
Speaker 0: So they're sitting on the desk next to the microphone right now.

801
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,690
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of the Jamaican beef patties.

802
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,499
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

803
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,490
Speaker 0: They're pure delicious.

804
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:57,749
Speaker 1: Not really, no.

805
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,730
Speaker 0: Delicious in a flaky golden crust.

806
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:03,690
Speaker 1: Well, we tried to make those frozen nachos yesterday.

807
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:04,949
Speaker 0: That was terrible.

808
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,002
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't terrible.

809
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,450
Speaker 1: It didn't taste bad.

810
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,170
Speaker 1: But what it was is the nachi, like the frozen nachi, I boiled them and scooped them out like it said to.

811
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,769
Speaker 1: And they're basically just like tasteless.

812
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,770
Speaker 1: Like it was just tasteless mush ball things.

813
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,890
Speaker 0: Here's what I don't get, right?

814
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,368
Speaker 0: So it seems like a lot of Americans eat.

815
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,050
Speaker 0: Like I see so much frozen food and I see people buying so much of it.

816
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,890
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's really, really convenient.

817
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,470
Speaker 1: Just, you know, take some food, heat it up, eat it.

818
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:32,841
Speaker 1: It doesn't take very long.

819
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,870
Speaker 1: You don't have to do a lot of work.

820
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,029
Speaker 1: You don't make a big mess.

821
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,568
Speaker 0: One, it takes longer than ramen.

822
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,777
Speaker 1: It does take longer.

823
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,090
Speaker 1: Oh, man, we should eat ramen instead.

824
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,027
Speaker 0: We ate it all.

825
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:40,612
Speaker 1: Oh.

826
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,689
Speaker 0: All that's left is the... You should have bought more.

827
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:43,590
Speaker 0: I know, but I didn't.

828
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,490
Speaker 1: Just like I should have bought index cards for our panel.

829
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,610
Speaker 0: All that's left is the emergency ramen.

830
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:48,674
Speaker 1: Is it?

831
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:50,190
Speaker 1: What kind of emergency ramen is it?

832
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,050
Speaker 1: Well, which flavor?

833
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:52,801
Speaker 0: I don't know.

834
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:53,149
Speaker 0: Chicken?

835
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,063
Speaker 1: That's OK.

836
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:55,426
Speaker 1: Ish.

837
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,647
Speaker 0: At least it's not maruchan.

838
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,207
Speaker 1: It's not the ichiban, though, so it's...

839
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the fancy ones.

840
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,750
Speaker 0: But I lost my train of thought, which is kind of awesome.

841
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,770
Speaker 0: All right, so the frozen food, right?

842
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:11,930
Speaker 0: Every time I think, "Oh, let's try one of those frozen meals or frozen dinners,".

843
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:15,570
Speaker 0: they're so awful that they're not worth the convenience.

844
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,470
Speaker 0: I would rather eat nothing or eat garbage than eat those things.

845
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,950
Speaker 0: They're so tasteless.

846
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,590
Speaker 1: Not everything in the frozen aisle is bad.

847
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,529
Speaker 1: For example, you can get the frozen, like, ora-eyed potato things, especially, like, the onion tater tots.

848
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:29,469
Speaker 1: Those are good.

849
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:31,270
Speaker 1: You can also get -- what's the other brand?

850
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,023
Speaker 1: The Alexa potato wedges.

851
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:33,729
Speaker 1: Those are good, too.

852
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:35,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jamaican beef patties.

853
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:40,884
Speaker 1: It's mostly frozen potato chip or French fry type things, tater tots, that sort of stuff.

854
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:41,329
Speaker 1: Those are good.

855
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,870
Speaker 1: Also, a few frozen pizzas are good.

856
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,030
Speaker 1: Most of them are bad, but some are good, like those two Leonard's ones.

857
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:52,790
Speaker 1: I like me an Eggo waffle, but Rym does not.

858
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,450
Speaker 1: But you could make a good frozen waffle.

859
00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,130
Speaker 0: See, I guess what I don't get is that in the time it takes to deal with one of those frozen meals.

860
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:09,209
Speaker 0: that tastes like crap, you could make any kind of egg meal, like, any kind of combination of eggs and butter on a pan.

861
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,050
Speaker 1: Yep, you could definitely make an omelet.

862
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:14,310
Speaker 1: An omelet is just as easy as any, you know, frozen dinner.

863
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,190
Speaker 1: The thing is, Rym, is that we don't realize we don't have the microwave.

864
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,970
Speaker 1: If we had the microwave, then a lot more of those meals would be available to us.

865
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,490
Speaker 1: Have you eaten?

866
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,690
Speaker 1: And it would be a lot more convenient.

867
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,190
Speaker 1: But they're as disgusting, if not more disgusting.

868
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:26,150
Speaker 0: Usually more disgusting.

869
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,830
Speaker 1: Yes, but the convenience level would be there over the omelet that you currently don't have.

870
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,150
Speaker 0: The thing is, though, it's just as convenient.

871
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:37,950
Speaker 0: It takes you five minutes to make an omelet, from start to finish, unless you're incompetent.

872
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,189
Speaker 1: But it's like you gotta chop the stuff up, and you gotta...

873
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:41,679
Speaker 0: You know what?

874
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,109
Speaker 0: You know what?

875
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:45,110
Speaker 1: A microwave dinner, you put it in the microwave, you push a button.

876
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,950
Speaker 0: Scrambled eggs require nothing.

877
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,689
Speaker 1: You gotta scramble, you gotta pour it into the thing, and you gotta move the spatula around.

878
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:56,710
Speaker 1: With the microwave dinner, you put it in the thing, you push a button, that's it, you're done.

879
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,810
Speaker 0: The thing is, the scrambled eggs taste a thousand times better.

880
00:38:58,951 --> 00:38:59,467
Speaker 1: They sure do.

881
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,990
Speaker 1: The only problem with... No, they taste infinity.

882
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:11,690
Speaker 1: Well, they taste an imaginary number better, because what happens is the TV dinner has a negative taste.

883
00:39:12,332 --> 00:39:22,190
Speaker 1: So if you were to divide the flavor rating, which is a very large positive number of the scrambled egg, by the negative number of the flavor of the TV dinner, you will get an imaginary number.

884
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:33,010
Speaker 0: I guess this is kind of, in our eyes, an indictment of the people who eat these frozen dinners on a regular basis, because they're so bad that I would rather not eat dinner than eat them.

885
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:40,310
Speaker 0: And the fact that there's so many of them, and I see people buying them all the time, we wonder why people are fat in this country if you're that lazy.

886
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,469
Speaker 1: Well, it's because they go for the fast food, not for the TV.

887
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,807
Speaker 1: The TV dinner helps, but it's mostly the McDonald's.

888
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:50,210
Speaker 1: But, I mean, there are dinners you can get in a can that are better than the ones that are frozen.

889
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,210
Speaker 1: I mean, even like Campbell's soup, it's all right.

890
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,390
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, great, but it's okay.

891
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,710
Speaker 1: Ramen, it's not great, but it's okay.

892
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,730
Speaker 1: And you can get good ramen, too, for like a few dollars instead of a ten-cent ramen.

893
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,369
Speaker 0: The thing is, I remember back to college thinking, you know, the quick meals.

894
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,309
Speaker 0: Pretty much, what did we eat?

895
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,189
Speaker 0: We made ramen?

896
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,409
Speaker 1: We didn't get a can of chili in it.

897
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:09,470
Speaker 1: Not too bad.

898
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, chili is also super easy to make.

899
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,890
Speaker 1: You can also get like a pre-prepared salad and then put salad dressing on it, and you're good to go.

900
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,510
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

901
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:24,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, our problem is we've been living our college lifestyle again where we basically don't cook a real dinner and then it's late and we're hungry.

902
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,190
Speaker 0: So we eat something convenient and go to sleep.

903
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really, see, this is why I'm really torn about this.

904
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:40,890
Speaker 1: Ideally, what I should be doing with my current, you know, life schedule is eating a humongous lunch and then not eating so much for dinner, but it won't matter because I got my nutrition at lunch.

905
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:47,950
Speaker 1: The thing is, I really don't want to spend money for a big awesome lunch because I save money by making my peanut butter and jelly.

906
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,637
Speaker 1: And I'm torn between.

907
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:56,230
Speaker 1: should I continue this trend of not getting proper nutrition and not eating a good enough dinner?

908
00:40:56,351 --> 00:41:01,170
Speaker 1: or even if I do eat enough good, good enough dinner, it's right before I go to bed, which is really not so great.

909
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,469
Speaker 1: Eating a whole bunch of food, they go to bed immediately instead of using the food.

910
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:11,689
Speaker 1: Or should I break the bank and get proper nutrition and just go out and eat awesome lunches every day?

911
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:20,429
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just a factor of making a lot more money and the amount I care about money is getting really not cool because I'm spending money left and right.

912
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:27,610
Speaker 0: But I've got to the point where I will pretty much eat, at least on the days we do the show, a full dinner at lunch and then a light dinner when I get home.

913
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:41,509
Speaker 1: Maybe that's what I could do, is on the days when we're doing a show, I will go out and get an awesome lunch, but on the days when we're not doing a show, I'll just eat my peanut butter and jelly, still save some monies, and then we'll have to cook, though.

914
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:48,090
Speaker 0: Maybe because I'm running every day and all this stuff now, literally, I could eat a double cheeseburger, a real one.

915
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,810
Speaker 0: I'll go to Good Burger.

916
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:52,970
Speaker 0: I'll eat a double cheeseburger, onion rings, fries, and a root beer float.

917
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,630
Speaker 1: Even in high school, I could never eat a double cheeseburger.

918
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:57,061
Speaker 1: I would eat a single hamburger.

919
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:07,050
Speaker 0: The thing is, a double cheeseburger at the Good Burger isn't like a McDonald's with all the... It's basically two entire hamburgers, like real ones.

920
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:16,630
Speaker 1: That's the thing, for some reason I can eat two hamburgers separate, but the double hamburger, where it's two meats on the same bun, that's just inedible for some reason.

921
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:22,604
Speaker 0: A few days ago, I was like, "All right, I'm really hungry because I've been running and all this, and I'm going to run when I get home, so I'm going to eat a big

922
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:22,867
Speaker 0: lunch.".

923
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,090
Speaker 0: First, for breakfast, I had a sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel, and an orange juice, and a Red Bull, and all that business.

924
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:36,750
Speaker 1: Actually, I was sort of helping out by eating breakfast again, but we ran out of English muffins, and that was my go-to breakfast.

925
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:38,470
Speaker 0: I buy my breakfast every day.

926
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,530
Speaker 0: Sausage, egg, and cheese, with a Red Bull and orange juice for breakfast.

927
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:42,549
Speaker 1: That's great.

928
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:48,170
Speaker 0: Then, for lunch, I went to the Good Burger, and I got a double cheeseburger, onion rings, and a root beer float.

929
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,829
Speaker 1: And a Red Bull.

930
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:50,510
Speaker 0: No, only one Red Bull.

931
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:54,670
Speaker 0: I figured I'd be good between the two, but then I was still hungry.

932
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,490
Speaker 0: Crazy hungry, all day, despite I was full when I ate that.

933
00:42:59,111 --> 00:43:00,609
Speaker 0: Then a few hours later, I was hungry again.

934
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,849
Speaker 0: I went out, got some Beard Pappas, and I ate those.

935
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,070
Speaker 0: Then I was hungry again immediately after.

936
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,149
Speaker 0: So I came home, and I made a big dinner, and I ate it.

937
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,010
Speaker 0: And then I went out running, and I did all my stuff, and then Scott came home, and we watched something.

938
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:18,349
Speaker 0: And I was still hungry, so I made a fried egg before I went to bed.

939
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:25,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just that I'm getting home just an hour later, which is still enough time to do the show, and it's not too bad, really.

940
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:30,470
Speaker 1: But it's sort of that hour was the hour we used to cook dinner.

941
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,790
Speaker 1: And now it's like, get home, we do the show.

942
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:34,670
Speaker 1: By the time the show is over, it's nine o'clock.

943
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,110
Speaker 1: I'm going to eat dinner at nine o'clock.

944
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:36,910
Speaker 1: That's already crazy.

945
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,970
Speaker 1: I mean, I get home at like seven something.

946
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,230
Speaker 1: I'd like to eat dinner at five, six.

947
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,710
Speaker 1: I wouldn't want to eat dinner at seven.

948
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,370
Speaker 1: It's really, it's not good at all.

949
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,449
Speaker 1: It's like the time when dinner should be eaten is the time when I'm on the train.

950
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,670
Speaker 1: And it's unpleasant, to say the least.

951
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,550
Speaker 0: So at least, I mean, on the days we don't do the show.

952
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,110
Speaker 1: And that's the time I want to be eating dinner.

953
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,370
Speaker 1: So the time when I should be cooking dinner is like the last hour I'm at work.

954
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:06,510
Speaker 0: See, the way I do it, at least on the days we don't do the show, I usually come home and I make a dinner that'll be ready right around when Scott and Emily get home.

955
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,450
Speaker 0: And that works pretty well, but I can't make dinner all the time.

956
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:16,050
Speaker 1: Before I was coming home late and, you know, I was actually making dinner like once or twice a week.

957
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,470
Speaker 1: And, you know, I'd make chicken once or twice a week of different varieties and things.

958
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,709
Speaker 1: And I haven't cooked anything in like a couple months and I feel bad about it, but I can't really do anything about it either.

959
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:40,430
Speaker 0: Of course, part of this is we're starting to realize more and more that it almost seems like America, at least outside of like outside of the major cities, outside of major cities, outside of college towns, you know, normal suburban United States, the average town.

960
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:51,190
Speaker 0: It's like there is no way for someone, people like us who are not members of nuclear families and who have jobs to do most of the things that normal people in society are expected to do.

961
00:44:51,610 --> 00:45:01,210
Speaker 1: I mean, the society is really structured in a way to where without a nuclear family kind of situation, things are very can be very inconvenient.

962
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:15,190
Speaker 1: For example, if you had a nuclear family, right, one person goes to work, one person stays home, or maybe one person, you know, even if they commute far away, the other person might work locally, you know, in town somewhere or if they work from home or something.

963
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:26,109
Speaker 1: So if a package comes, the person is home to get someone is home to get the package, or you make so much money, you have like, you know, a nanny or a house cleaner, someone to be home and get the package.

964
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:33,270
Speaker 1: If you want to go eat out, you're home early enough and you can just go somewhere nearby to eat out.

965
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,930
Speaker 1: If, you know, your whole house is full of commuters to get home at seven, everything closes.

966
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,970
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, that's the thing at least.

967
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:41,598
Speaker 0: All the restaurants are open.

968
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,330
Speaker 0: We can just go to a restaurant and eat out and it's great.

969
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,950
Speaker 0: The problem is that does get very expensive eating out at real restaurants every single night.

970
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,230
Speaker 1: It also makes you very fat very quickly.

971
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:51,310
Speaker 0: Not if you're active.

972
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,770
Speaker 1: No, but I mean, you got to, you know, eating out at restaurants too much is not so good.

973
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,136
Speaker 1: You definitely want to be eating in.

974
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,230
Speaker 1: the food you cook in your house is far better in terms of your health.

975
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then go back to college where I cooked most of my meals, but most of my meals consisted of two to four eggs.

976
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,710
Speaker 1: Most of my meals were like a hot dog on a plate.

977
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:18,210
Speaker 0: I remember we'd have dinners where literally like both our plates would have like some scrambled eggs, some cooked hot dogs and like some bread to use as buns.

978
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:18,815
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

979
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:20,070
Speaker 1: It's like I had the best intentions.

980
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,230
Speaker 1: When we got to RIT, I brought my parents' old kitchen table.

981
00:46:23,633 --> 00:46:26,270
Speaker 1: I cooked like a big spaghetti and meatball dinner for everyone.

982
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,270
Speaker 1: We all, you know, grouped up and, you know, then someone tried to cook a stir fry.

983
00:46:30,973 --> 00:46:32,890
Speaker 1: And then that lasted maybe a couple of weeks.

984
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:40,129
Speaker 1: And before you knew it, we put the kitchen table out, you know, side saying, take this, it's free, because he was just taking up space and we weren't using it.

985
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,530
Speaker 1: And the communal cooking real dinners thing totally didn't happen anymore.

986
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:55,730
Speaker 1: And it was game over, you know, and Emily, when she got out of college and started living in Beacon, you know, I saw my past self in her because she was like, you know, let's cook dinner every night.

987
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,669
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, that's what I thought.

988
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:00,550
Speaker 1: And then, you know, she was like, oh, this sucks.

989
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,310
Speaker 1: She was complaining because it wasn't happening.

990
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,290
Speaker 1: And then she was just like, yeah, I see why it doesn't happen.

991
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:07,850
Speaker 0: And it totally sucks.

992
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:11,270
Speaker 0: The thing is, though, she's been having a renaissance of cooking dinner lately.

993
00:47:12,152 --> 00:47:23,050
Speaker 0: And the thing is, the key, the only problem here is that we were doing OK, actually, like before Scott started coming home late, we actually cooked dinner like most five, five nights a week.

994
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,570
Speaker 1: At least at least three nights a week, at least three, usually a good four or five nights a week.

995
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,272
Speaker 0: And we would cook a real.

996
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:32,930
Speaker 1: not all of those meals might have been awesome, but they were OK enough.

997
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,529
Speaker 1: They were better than hot dog on a plate.

998
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,670
Speaker 0: The thing is, Emily is a lot better than us at improvising with, you know, just whatever's laying around.

999
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,130
Speaker 0: She made like collard greens and rice and some eggs and some naan.

1000
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,428
Speaker 0: It was super good last night.

1001
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:48,050
Speaker 1: Of course, I don't like the collard greens, but I love collard greens.

1002
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:48,788
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan.

1003
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:50,750
Speaker 0: But it was great because she's like, I'm going to go dinner.

1004
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,490
Speaker 0: It's like, awesome, because I was basically going to eat the emergency ramen and go to sleep otherwise.

1005
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,409
Speaker 0: So she kind of saved me there.

1006
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,429
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically, Scott, you know what it really boils down to is you get home late and that fucks everything up.

1007
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:05,276
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1008
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:06,789
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll do something about it.

1009
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:07,433
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1010
00:48:07,574 --> 00:48:09,209
Speaker 0: At least we can get through Con season first.

1011
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:09,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1012
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:13,790
Speaker 1: If we see I realize, you know, it would solve everything if we formed a studio.

1013
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:14,510
Speaker 1: No.

1014
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,030
Speaker 0: And lived as a company.

1015
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:16,630
Speaker 1: No.

1016
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:24,930
Speaker 1: If we had a personal chef, we just pay them to come to the house around, you know, five, six o'clock every day, cook a dinner.

1017
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:26,630
Speaker 1: And they didn't even have to stick around.

1018
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:31,570
Speaker 1: They just could leave it in the fridge or something and, you know, or just keep it hot somewhere where we can just come home and eat it.

1019
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:41,670
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing we could do is I could cook more because I was doing this for a while where I'd cook like Swiss steaks or like a little like a mini pot roast or like chili or a bean soup.

1020
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:49,050
Speaker 0: Things that I can start like I get home from work, I put it all together or a casserole and I set it cooking and then around seven it's done and then we eat it.

1021
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:51,930
Speaker 0: And then I save the other half of it and just reheat it the next day.

1022
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:52,636
Speaker 1: There is one.

1023
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:53,950
Speaker 1: There's a guy I work.

1024
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,020
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm not doing that is Con season.

1025
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,769
Speaker 0: We're busy doing stuff like every day now.

1026
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1027
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,270
Speaker 1: There's a guy I work with and he still lives with his parents in Jersey.

1028
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:05,230
Speaker 1: But, you know, he's got they they they all work.

1029
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,410
Speaker 1: You know, they're like he has a twin sister who's also working and his parents are working.

1030
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,330
Speaker 1: So there's like there's no one in the house, but, you know, they got to eat dinner.

1031
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:23,590
Speaker 1: So what they do is actually on the weekend, they cook like four or five dinners and then they set them all up in the refrigerator, you know, and then they reheat them throughout the week for dinner.

1032
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:29,467
Speaker 1: So, you know, one person, someone comes home at eleven and someone else comes home at six and someone else comes home at one a.m.

1033
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,410
Speaker 1: because they went out partying.

1034
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:31,635
Speaker 1: There's something to eat.

1035
00:49:31,675 --> 00:49:34,690
Speaker 1: They can, you know, reheat their portion, a portion of one of the meals.

1036
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,178
Speaker 1: And, you know, by the end of the week, all the meals are out.

1037
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,242
Speaker 1: Then they go out to eat.

1038
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:40,670
Speaker 1: And then on Sunday they cook, you know, five more meals.

1039
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:46,050
Speaker 1: And we could do that, except we use our Sundays because we don't get enough time off work.

1040
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,639
Speaker 1: We need that to do stuff like our geeky endeavors.

1041
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,030
Speaker 1: They're not so much of the geeky endeavors while they're cooking their meals Sunday.

1042
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:54,550
Speaker 1: You know, they're just watching a football or something.

1043
00:49:55,412 --> 00:50:01,170
Speaker 1: We can't do that while we're playing a video game or remember the days when we had this house.

1044
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,321
Speaker 0: We were not podcasters.

1045
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:04,610
Speaker 0: We were just geeks out of college.

1046
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,959
Speaker 1: And we watched Netflix every single day.

1047
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:09,469
Speaker 1: And every weekend we drove up the road to play DDR.

1048
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:17,950
Speaker 0: Of course, the thing is, back then, not only were we not podcasting, no one else lived around, so there was no one else to hang out with.

1049
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,729
Speaker 0: And, like, Scott got out of work earlier and I worked at IBM.

1050
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,230
Speaker 1: I was working in the middle of nowhere.

1051
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:24,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he could leave whenever he wanted.

1052
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:27,570
Speaker 1: Actually, for a while I was working in the city and then the middle of nowhere.

1053
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:33,250
Speaker 0: I worked five minutes away from our house at IBM so I could leave whenever I wanted and go in whenever I wanted.

1054
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,488
Speaker 0: So, I mean, I would come home for lunch half the time because it was right here.

1055
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:39,926
Speaker 0: So we'd come home from work at, like, five.

1056
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:40,490
Speaker 0: We'd be home.

1057
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,890
Speaker 0: We'd watch, like, a Netflix and then a couple episodes of The Simpsons.

1058
00:50:44,352 --> 00:50:47,790
Speaker 0: And then we'd play a board game and then we'd play video games, like, until late.

1059
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,837
Speaker 1: And then it'd be like, "What do we do

1060
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:49,058
Speaker 1: now?"

1061
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:50,689
Speaker 1: And he'd be sitting around going, "I don't know what to

1062
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:50,850
Speaker 1: do.".

1063
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,630
Speaker 1: And then we'd talk for an hour, which would have been a podcast if we had recorded it, but we just talked.

1064
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:56,093
Speaker 0: Yup.

1065
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:58,429
Speaker 0: And then we'd, like, cook a full dinner and then go to bed.

1066
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:58,918
Speaker 1: Yup.

1067
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,030
Speaker 0: Too bad we do a podcast.

1068
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,192
Speaker 1: Too bad.

1069
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,310
Speaker 1: Well, even if we didn't do the podcast, we'd still be screwed in the current situation.

1070
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:14,330
Speaker 1: So at least we're making something, you know, and maybe one day someone will, you know, cook us dinner in exchange for podcasts.

1071
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,009
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do that.

1072
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:21,410
Speaker 1: Hey, guys, if you don't come, if someone doesn't come and cook us dinner five nights a week, podcast is over.

1073
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:22,064
Speaker 1: That's it.

1074
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:28,929
Speaker 1: So if you want this podcast to continue, you should come and move to Beacon and you will get paid ten dollars a day.

1075
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,230
Speaker 1: So fifty bucks a week to cook dinners.

1076
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:36,689
Speaker 0: Well, we could clear out the closet under the stairs, put a little bed in there.

1077
00:51:37,334 --> 00:51:37,821
Speaker 0: That could be it.

1078
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:41,150
Speaker 0: If you cook us dinner five nights a week, you can live in that closet.

1079
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,348
Speaker 1: I think that violates the rents.

1080
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:43,728
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

1081
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:44,339
Speaker 1: At least.

1082
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:44,689
Speaker 1: Whatever.

1083
00:51:46,012 --> 00:51:46,558
Speaker 0: All right.

1084
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:47,690
Speaker 0: I think this Thursday is done.

1085
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:52,270
Speaker 1: It's Thursday is indeed done, but the world sucks for single commuters.

1086
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:54,570
Speaker 1: We were supposed to live in the city, but we don't.

1087
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,488
Speaker 1: So it fucks us.

1088
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:02,990
Speaker 0: But that's fine, because eventually we'll have our own front row crew studio and office space up here and the mansion on that land we're going to buy.

1089
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:03,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, you wish.

1090
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:04,550
Speaker 0: It's coming.

1091
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:05,428
Speaker 1: We'll see.

1092
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,297
Speaker 0: Actually called.

1093
00:52:06,337 --> 00:52:07,470
Speaker 0: It looks like that land has sewer.

1094
00:52:08,314 --> 00:52:09,548
Speaker 0: So I'm looking into buying it.

1095
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,292
Speaker 1: We should go.

1096
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:13,150
Speaker 1: We should walk over this weekend and, you know, poke it.

1097
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll do all the poking.

1098
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:15,788
Speaker 1: I got to take a look at the dirt.

1099
00:52:16,997 --> 00:52:17,529
Speaker 0: It's a good day.

1100
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how you know.

1101
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:20,270
Speaker 1: If it's full of rocks, it's not good.

1102
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,609
Speaker 0: All right, we're done.

1103
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:30,210
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1104
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,830

1107
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:53,179
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

1108
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,570
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1109
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:01,630
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1117
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,530
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
