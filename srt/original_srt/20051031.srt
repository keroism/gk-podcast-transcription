1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,520
Speaker 0: It's October 31st 2005, this is geek nights with rim and sky.

2
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:16,231
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

3
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 0: We should probably put lira in there whatever.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,264
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo?

5
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:24,710
Speaker 0: Oh, I got four.

6
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:27,885
Speaker 0: you start the news like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo But not the noise.

7
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:30,760
Speaker 0: dude me going doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,740
Speaker 1: You want to do that originally?

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:41,060
Speaker 1: We're gonna have the So, uh, I guess we could do that or I could make that sound.

10
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,311
Speaker 0: I think this copyrighted or patented by whatever news.

11
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,397
Speaker 1: No, we'll just make it something else.

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,180
Speaker 1: It's just Morse code.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,608
Speaker 1: We'll make it say something geeky.

14
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:54,288
Speaker 0: Ah Let's do this in Morse code.

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,612
Speaker 1: that's real slick.

16
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,073
Speaker 1: I like it.

17
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:57,317
Speaker 0: All right, we're good.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,953
Speaker 0: Okay, so Scolito Scolito.

19
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,900
Speaker 0: so Personal lawyer didn't cut it to no surprise.

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,314
Speaker 0: So he picks the most conservative judge he could find in all of the appeals.

21
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,860
Speaker 0: course Samuel Alito.

22
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:20,062
Speaker 1: Yeah He's a little conservative Little bit.

23
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:26,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz this I mean the Senate's main gripe at least the Republicans main gripe with Meyers wasn't that they didn't know about her.

24
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:29,960
Speaker 1: It was that she wasn't proven to be conservative and not.

25
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:36,041
Speaker 0: Well, this guy's real conservative, but you know, you look at not real real conservative He's.

26
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,390
Speaker 1: I don't think he's yeah States rights.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,413
Speaker 1: I think he's more.

28
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:39,775
Speaker 1: Yeah.

29
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,024
Speaker 1: Yeah Rovers his way.

30
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:46,160
Speaker 0: they pretty much call him Scolito and his name is Alito because he's scalia, too.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,430
Speaker 0: But if you look at there's a Scalia, however, you're gonna pronounce.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,715
Speaker 0: I don't know how the correct pronunciation.

33
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:56,748
Speaker 0: I've heard both but Scalia I look at his voting record and like and a lot of things he votes the way.

34
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,941
Speaker 0: I want a Lot of things.

35
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:02,272
Speaker 0: he votes horribly and I don't want him to be alive.

36
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:14,718
Speaker 1: Well, I worry because Susanna Sherry She's actually a university law professor at Vanderbilt and she said that he would quote allow a lot more government support of religion than justice o'connor did.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,122
Speaker 0: Yeah That's Not good.

38
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:26,912
Speaker 1: see I'm all down with religion, but I don't think SCOTUS should have any Kind of backing for it.

39
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:27,759
Speaker 1: or you know.

40
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:32,337
Speaker 0: You know that the problem here is if they let in just a little bit of religion and not enough.

41
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:36,680
Speaker 0: if they let in too Much religion because we'll just fly in there with our flying spaghetti monsters.

42
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if the Supreme Court votes against us, there's no one to appeal to.

43
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:52,779
Speaker 0: well No, but the thing is is that if they give someone else some other religion some sort of you know, nudge Then we just run in there and we say we demand the flying spaghetti monster also gets the same nudge.

44
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, then we'll deal with.

45
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:58,879
Speaker 1: they will have the schism the ramanites and the pastafarians.

46
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,806
Speaker 1: But I mean he might not get confirmed.

47
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:07,138
Speaker 1: the Senate might filibuster until the end of the Bush administration, we don't know what's gonna happen.

48
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:14,654
Speaker 1: Hmm oh Speaking of the Supreme Court, they found two more moons on Pluto.

49
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,046
Speaker 0: apparently Isn't Pluto?

50
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:20,339
Speaker 0: they don't even know if it's a planet or a moon or what?

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,432
Speaker 0: There's nobody's decided how big you have to be to be a planet.

52
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:31,720
Speaker 1: Basically what the news is is a tiny Rock that's far away from our planet has rocks a tiny rock floating around.

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,800
Speaker 1: It might have two more tinier rocks floating around it that we couldn't see until recently.

54
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:48,532
Speaker 0: Yeah So now this makes you wonder that like we can see like Jupiter sized planets at like very close stars How do we know they don't have like earth sized rocks around?

55
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:54,250
Speaker 0: and we can't see if we can barely see rocks around Pluto These rocks that are infinitely farther away.

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,199
Speaker 0: Well, not infinitely farther, but many many more times farther away.

57
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,030
Speaker 0: Who knows what's going on out there?

58
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,062
Speaker 1: Pluto was discovered in 1930?

59
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,016
Speaker 1: Fairly long time ago.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,309
Speaker 1: Pluto's moon wasn't discovered till 1978 and Now in 2005 we discovered two smaller rocks.

61
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:18,372
Speaker 0: Well in 2050 we should be discovering the Mountains of Pluto and the mountains on the moons of Pluto.

62
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,137
Speaker 1: I don't think there any mountains on Pluto.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,966
Speaker 1: No, I think Pluto is just a rock.

64
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:23,949
Speaker 0: It's just smooth.

65
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,264
Speaker 1: I don't think it's big enough to where you could qualify as mountain Must.

66
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,871
Speaker 0: it can't be perfectly smooth.

67
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,760
Speaker 0: It has to have some hills and craters and things.

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,419
Speaker 1: Yes, because obviously I was trying to say that Pluto is perfectly smooth.

69
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:41,055
Speaker 1: It is made of cheese and it has people like he's isn't perfectly smooth.

70
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:42,700
Speaker 1: some cheese is well.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,588
Speaker 1: No, nothing's perfectly smooth.

72
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,640
Speaker 1: It's made of atoms little quarks bouncing around.

73
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:51,180
Speaker 0: Hey, they could all be crystalline in a perfect grid and that's smooth.

74
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,278
Speaker 1: No Because it's the grid itself isn't smooth and there's gaps in it.

75
00:04:56,372 --> 00:05:00,109
Speaker 0: It could be really cold and then they'll be really close together and smooth.

76
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:01,773
Speaker 1: Okay.

77
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:05,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess maybe a Bose Einstein condensate might be smooth.

78
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,780
Speaker 0: So is a baby's ass Bose?

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,990
Speaker 0: I'm condensate whatever.

80
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,703
Speaker 1: Moving on Halloween, yeah, and uh, I didn't do anything this year.

81
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,207
Speaker 0: Me neither.

82
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,813
Speaker 1: I wanted to carve a pumpkin I didn't.

83
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:28,508
Speaker 1: I was gonna go to the parade downtown Went to a j-rock concert instead.

84
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,782
Speaker 0: So, you know, it really bothers me though.

85
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,310
Speaker 0: Oh It's Halloween, all right.

86
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,085
Speaker 0: It's a good holiday like the holiday like candy like scare and stuff like jumping out and going boo.

87
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,961
Speaker 0: Right like mischief like costumes.

88
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:54,510
Speaker 0: I Saw like three news stories today about people Think their ghosts are real and I had to link to Randy like four times.

89
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,579
Speaker 1: I'll just point out that while I was in the city.

90
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:06,029
Speaker 1: It's not really Halloween related, but I saw these ads For psychic detectives and this is on court TV court TV.

91
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,619
Speaker 0: And is it a fictional show?

92
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,164
Speaker 1: the subscript is.

93
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,730
Speaker 1: it says psychic detectives?

94
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,081
Speaker 1: This isn't based on a true story colon.

95
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,950
Speaker 1: This is a true story.

96
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:20,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we can sue them right for the false advertising.

97
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,650
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it is a true story.

98
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,435
Speaker 0: Whatever they show really happened.

99
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,281
Speaker 0: The psychic part was just made up.

100
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,187
Speaker 1: something like that something like that.

101
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:38,697
Speaker 1: Randy should buy some commercial time on court TV, of course There's also a lot of people who are still believing in things like someone's gonna put razor blades in the apples They give to kids.

102
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:46,190
Speaker 0: or you know, you know At least while that's crazy You could put a razor blade in Apple.

103
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,734
Speaker 1: There's no way you could put a razor blade in an apple that I wouldn't see before you'd see it But you know what?

104
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:55,416
Speaker 0: You're never gonna see a ghost ever Not a real one at least.

105
00:06:55,477 --> 00:07:00,074
Speaker 1: Well, hey if I did I get a million bucks out of Randy sweet With those million bucks.

106
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,979
Speaker 0: I wonder how many razor blades you could buy.

107
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,316
Speaker 0: I Mean you could probably just buy a bunch of.

108
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:10,247
Speaker 0: you really wanted to see children eat apples full of razor blades.

109
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:18,489
Speaker 0: if you won the Million dollars you could just buy children be You can feed them apples with razor blades.

110
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,819
Speaker 1: and Yeah, who's that?

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,829
Speaker 1: Roman Polanski is a very famous pedophile who fled the game is pedophile because he fled the country and he's still out there.

112
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:31,737
Speaker 1: They never got it.

113
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:32,742
Speaker 0: Why don't they get him?

114
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:33,546
Speaker 1: because he's not.

115
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,633
Speaker 1: he got away All right.

116
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:38,524
Speaker 0: Now, how does razor blades and apples relate to pedophilia?

117
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:39,949
Speaker 1: You want to do something to little kids?

118
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,702
Speaker 0: Not sexual and I don't want to do it.

119
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:47,108
Speaker 0: I was just suggesting it that whoever Was obviously going about it the wrong way.

120
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:58,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah The hours wondered like say someone actually was putting razor blades and apples and say somehow you didn't see the the razor blades sticking Out of the Apple or the hole in the Apple where the razor blade was shoved in.

121
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,259
Speaker 1: Say they're a sicko and they like this sort of thing.

122
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,770
Speaker 1: Like oh, I love the idea of a kid eating a razor blade in an Apple.

123
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,540
Speaker 1: How would they see the kitty?

124
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,801
Speaker 1: third?

125
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,530
Speaker 1: How would they get any pleasure out of it?

126
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,450
Speaker 0: Well, I imagine it would be a lot like the old man who tells you to get off his lawn.

127
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:18,289
Speaker 0: I mean, he sees you get off his lawn, but he doesn't see you go home and cry to your mommy Even though he thinks about it and laughs.

128
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:31,575
Speaker 0: So Bill Gates, he gave like a hajillion dollars to fight malaria a Jillian a yeah hundreds of millions something like 250 million Something by malaria of all things.

129
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:44,207
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is if you actually look at the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation thingy They're always like we give money to fight the diseases that the poor people have instead of the rich people diseases like diabetes and such.

130
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,065
Speaker 0: So malaria is a poor people disease.

131
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:47,730
Speaker 0: It has a cure.

132
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,730
Speaker 0: We just need to spend money to give the cure to people who have it and kill mosquitoes.

133
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,537
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much a sure bet.

134
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,209
Speaker 0: but I realized why he's doing this, huh?

135
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,429
Speaker 0: See Apple gets in the news with their little iPod video.

136
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,974
Speaker 1: Microsoft doesn't get the.

137
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,121
Speaker 0: Google gets in the news doesn't do anything.

138
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:10,202
Speaker 0: Google gets in the news with their googling Microsoft Vista.

139
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:11,309
Speaker 0: it gets negative news.

140
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:16,969
Speaker 0: So Bill Gates has to go and spend money to fight malaria to get some positive news for the Microsoft.

141
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:22,645
Speaker 0: Notice how there's no positive news for any of their products services.

142
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:32,537
Speaker 1: Ah I saw a thing talking about how Microsoft Office was good on like a Windows blog Somewhere written by a guy who works for Microsoft.

143
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:40,019
Speaker 0: once there was a guy Who was using the Vista beta as his OS and he talks about they have the ribbon on all the programs.

144
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,748
Speaker 0: now I don't know about the ribbon.

145
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:42,653
Speaker 0: I never actually used it.

146
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,899
Speaker 0: So I can't yeah me either.

147
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,959
Speaker 1: Well, you know suppose it because I dumped the windows.

148
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,410
Speaker 0: I'm done with that totally dumping the windows and you know what.

149
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,476
Speaker 0: if the ribbon is any good someone will steal it and make it in for the Linux.

150
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,158
Speaker 0: So it's been an apple.

151
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,592
Speaker 0: He sold a million videos in 20 days.

152
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:09,489
Speaker 0: I Think it's catching on You know, and this is with two dollars a video For basically crap TV shows.

153
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,939
Speaker 0: some other people would say they're not crap TV shows, but I say they're crap TV shows.

154
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,599
Speaker 1: I agree that most of them are crap, but I like certain TV shows.

155
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,658
Speaker 0: Well, there there are good TV shows, but none of them are available for $2 an episode from Apple.

156
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,240
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

157
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,758
Speaker 1: I see I can't get my eyes.

158
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a wonderful show.

159
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,874
Speaker 1: I had a busy prick me with an AIDS infected needle.

160
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,299
Speaker 0: Good luck with that.

161
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,157
Speaker 0: But You know, imagine if they had.

162
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:39,209
Speaker 0: you know Real deal, you know full-on everything.

163
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:43,360
Speaker 0: just put on old things that aren't on TV anymore and charge 50 cents for them.

164
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,179
Speaker 0: You're making zero dollars off of them.

165
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,159
Speaker 0: Now you could be making hundreds of thousands of dollars off of them.

166
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,352
Speaker 1: No Call that stuff in DVD box sets.

167
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,160
Speaker 1: that cost a lot of money not everything.

168
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,880
Speaker 0: There's still a lot of things that haven't made it to DVD box set.

169
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of things have.

170
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,970
Speaker 0: a lot of things have.

171
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:01,700
Speaker 1: but our box set of old crappy Hitchcock movies.

172
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:06,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean that actually comes out to be cheaper than the downloading that box.

173
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,774
Speaker 0: But like BBC is putting the Monty Python full things for download.

174
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:11,376
Speaker 1: Yeah.

175
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:16,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Well, that was you got it for a present you wouldn't have bought.

176
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,846
Speaker 1: it was so much money I would have bought it for the price they paid for it.

177
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:23,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, they bought it at like Costco, which is like Sam.

178
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,960
Speaker 1: They got it for nothing anyway.

179
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:30,500
Speaker 0: anything else going on, uh There really wasn't much.

180
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,000
Speaker 1: I mean I went to the city all weekend and I didn't really read the interwebs all weekend.

181
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:40,214
Speaker 1: So I kind of missed out on whatever happened, but I did find something cool.

182
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,320
Speaker 1: It's probably old but it's cool.

183
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:48,120
Speaker 1: It's a website dedicated to spoiling things like movies and books and anime and whatever.

184
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,540
Speaker 0: Oh, so I guess they could be useful but also incredibly painful.

185
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:53,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really useful.

186
00:11:54,025 --> 00:12:04,260
Speaker 1: like I wanted to find out how a stupid show ended so I looked like oh so-and-so dies and then Marry, so hey if the show like other shows were like you see the ending but you still don't know what happened.

187
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,464
Speaker 0: Does it explain those?

188
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,086
Speaker 1: Yes.

189
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:06,527
Speaker 1: Yes here.

190
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,490
Speaker 1: I'll go into one.

191
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,554
Speaker 0: Go to Evangelion.

192
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,139
Speaker 1: I'm going into Donnie Darko.

193
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,367
Speaker 1: Everyone's seen Donnie Darko.

194
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,834
Speaker 1: All right, there's about.

195
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,000
Speaker 0: this is spoiler.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,808
Speaker 0: Watch out.

197
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,060
Speaker 1: All right, it describes an Extremely great detail.

198
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:31,079
Speaker 1: It doesn't not only spoils it it Explains why what it's telling you spoils it and then explains in great detail the scenes that actually do the spoiling.

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,474
Speaker 0: now Is this guy is this one guy writing all this or it's like a wiki?

200
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,900
Speaker 1: or what is this like a wiki?

201
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,972
Speaker 1: It acts like a wiki and it looks like a wiki.

202
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,199
Speaker 1: I don't think it's actually a wiki.

203
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,031
Speaker 0: People are people like editing it in or like.

204
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:54,153
Speaker 1: it has some stubs and people are adding entries like there's one listing for every James Bond movie ever and it says Bonds right-hand man dies bond gets the girl another girl dies.

205
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,800
Speaker 1: He doesn't die and the villain does die.

206
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,712
Speaker 0: Awesome The coolest thing I saw today was the jack PC.

207
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,548
Speaker 1: I Saw a picture of that thing.

208
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,978
Speaker 0: So it's it's a PC.

209
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:08,665
Speaker 0: But first there was three.

210
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,712
Speaker 0: comm made the hub that you put in the wall.

211
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,036
Speaker 1: Yep, and the switch.

212
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,046
Speaker 0: Oh They made a switch also.

213
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they made the switch right after they made them.

214
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:21,688
Speaker 0: Basically just you take your outlet out of your wall and you put this hub in there And you run network cable to it.

215
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,260
Speaker 0: And well, there you go or you guys you could cut a hole in the wall.

216
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, they made the jack PC.

217
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,496
Speaker 0: now, which is just you cut a hole in the wall.

218
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,400
Speaker 0: You put this computer.

219
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,068
Speaker 0: It's you know, not so big.

220
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,334
Speaker 0: it fits a hole in the wall.

221
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,389
Speaker 0: It has a DVI Head headphone in and out microphone in I guess.

222
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,400
Speaker 0: and then for USBs, huh?

223
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,339
Speaker 0: If you just plug the DVI cable to a monitor you plug in a keyboard and mouse of USB.

224
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,158
Speaker 0: You have two USBs left push a button on it a light turns on and you have a computer.

225
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,856
Speaker 1: I take it it's not that powerful considering, you know heating and it has a.

226
00:13:55,902 --> 00:14:06,379
Speaker 0: I think it had a very very low power Embedded AMD type processor, which is actually still good enough and that one problem with it is it comes with the windows CE.

227
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,079
Speaker 1: ah, ah

228
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:31,138
Speaker 0: The windows CE ah, but um, I imagine if you were mad slick you could either a Switch up the OS that's in the flash by taking the flash out reflashing it putting it something else on there like a custom Linux kernel or if you were extra slick you could plug in like a USB hard drive to the USB hole and get it to boot off of it.

229
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:31,861
Speaker 0: It's.

230
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:38,066
Speaker 1: you know, I've got this USB hard drive sitting there on the floor Defeating the purpose of having.

231
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:42,340
Speaker 0: it's a lot easier than having a laptop with a power cable and then a DVI cable.

232
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:46,099
Speaker 1: Good for our media box in the living room hooked up to the TV.

233
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you use it like dude check this out.

234
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,280
Speaker 0: the only oh it didn't have a network thing was the other problem.

235
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,809
Speaker 1: There's got to be some sort of network thing.

236
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:57,688
Speaker 0: Well, no, you'd have to use like a USB Like network card or something.

237
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,512
Speaker 1: So I didn't make one.

238
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,340
Speaker 0: I didn't see a network thing on it.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,682
Speaker 0: There might be an Ethernet hole in the back of it Like you.

240
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,337
Speaker 0: just put you have the Ethernet in the wall.

241
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:04,640
Speaker 1: make a lot.

242
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,040
Speaker 0: It could be wireless built in could be wireless built in it and see it though and I didn't see words saying it.

243
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,746
Speaker 0: But it could.

244
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:13,500
Speaker 0: if it had that You just wouldn't need a PC in your living room.

245
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:27,259
Speaker 0: you plug this thing in and you just have all the T Boeing myth TVing done by another computer and you just use the Windows CE thingy to do a connect up some sort of Samba share maybe snacks forward like a thin client.

246
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:41,339
Speaker 1: So, uh, we realized that it's hard for us to talk about science and tech even though we made it a bit Because All our good banner comes from us arguing with each other or disagreeing or saying things the other person doesn't know.

247
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:43,605
Speaker 1: We agree on science.

248
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,140
Speaker 0: I don't see how you could disagree on science seeing is it it's?

249
00:15:48,420 --> 00:16:01,795
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean if there's evidence that says X is true and we both see that evidence then we both agree that X is true and Our caught podcast basically goes hey, uh, so evolution is pretty much a fact, isn't it?

250
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:02,718
Speaker 1: Yep.

251
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,184
Speaker 0: Yeah Hey, you see that chair?

252
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:05,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

253
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:06,609
Speaker 0: What color is it?

254
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,135
Speaker 1: Kind of bluish blue?

255
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:08,536
Speaker 0: Yep.

256
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:08,958
Speaker 1: Yep.

257
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:16,100
Speaker 0: Yep See now if I had said green, it's not really that entertaining because well, I'm just wrong.

258
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would say no it's blue and then I'd post a picture on the blog and then the world would go Oh, it's blue.

259
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:29,619
Speaker 1: Maybe Colin or colorblind friend wouldn't but everyone else Sucks to be colorblind Especially if you like German board games.

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially the camel game.

261
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:37,816
Speaker 1: oh god, it's like four different colors like four different pastel camels, it's a good game.

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,778
Speaker 0: Oh Hiccups, what do you do about those in a podcast you punch someone squarely in the solar plexus?

263
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,504
Speaker 1: No It'll care him.

264
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,071
Speaker 1: I guarantee you won't be hiccuping anymore.

265
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,040
Speaker 0: You know, actually science says differently.

266
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,719
Speaker 1: Why do you science say?

267
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:58,520
Speaker 0: Science says that hitting someone in the solar plexus does not care the hiccups.

268
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,490
Speaker 1: Um, I believe we could conduct an experiment to find out.

269
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,293
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

270
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,339
Speaker 0: I don't really have any hiccups anymore.

271
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,248
Speaker 1: We'll see about that.

272
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,174
Speaker 0: We will see.

273
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:07,717
Speaker 0: but you know what?

274
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,055
Speaker 0: science.

275
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:21,150
Speaker 1: but I mean Despite the fact that you can't really disagree on science unless the evidence isn't clear enough Like say there's not enough evidence for something.

276
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,357
Speaker 0: You don't have a theory yet.

277
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,440
Speaker 0: You still have a hypothesis.

278
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:28,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you have a hypothesis and I have a hypothesis.

279
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:39,235
Speaker 0: I like to say hypothesis Yep, the most and there's no experiments conducted yet that are conclusive then Who's to say?

280
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we both seek out more evidence.

281
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:52,834
Speaker 0: See, you know how you can disagree on science if one of the people you're discussing science with doesn't understand science Yep, or if someone is stupid You know.

282
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:59,400
Speaker 1: if you don't understand science it's the same as being stupid Yeah, or if someone is misinformed, but that gets fixed immediately when you get the facts out.

283
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:12,654
Speaker 1: The part of the problem is some people will disagree on the facts and then therefore they can't agree on a conclusion because they've got the facts wrong to begin with and Won't look at actual evidence showing them.

284
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,114
Speaker 1: They're wrong.

285
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 0: The only way to disagree on facts is number one.

286
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:27,399
Speaker 0: if you The place where you're getting your facts from like if it was a study you might claim that the study was done improperly Yep, or two.

287
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,209
Speaker 0: you just don't like it and you're denying it.

288
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,795
Speaker 1: I think two is the biggest part of this.

289
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,118
Speaker 0: two is a pretty big problem.

290
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:44,749
Speaker 1: I mean America's still debating evolution and every other country in the world is laughing hysterically I mean during the original scopes monkey trial so long ago.

291
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,758
Speaker 1: I mean we're talking before World War two.

292
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:58,209
Speaker 1: even back then the French newspapers had headlines like Americans debating facts or Americans are stupid or I could pull out some actual headlines if you wanted me to.

293
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:01,049
Speaker 1: They were making fun of us then.

294
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:12,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one thing I heard from another country was this British guy and he was basically saying how in Britain they're paying real close attention to it Because they're worried that it'll come over there next.

295
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:18,466
Speaker 0: Like if they win in America that next they'll be coming to Britain trying to win and they don't want that.

296
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:21,809
Speaker 1: a bunch of Australians Who are pro intelligent design got together?

297
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,746
Speaker 1: because they saw how well it was going in America and they decided they were gonna push it in Australia.

298
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:35,270
Speaker 1: because the I Forget exactly how their government is set up, but like their equivalent parliamentary I think yeah, but I mean like the different departments or whatever.

299
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:50,160
Speaker 1: But their equivalent of like a minister of education is kind of pro intelligent design Supposedly and These people are like, yeah ID ID go and the government put a blanket statement out saying Intelligent design is not science.

300
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,247
Speaker 1: It will never be considered.

301
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,675
Speaker 0: go away cool Good for Australia.

302
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,263
Speaker 1: Yeah, too bad.

303
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,228
Speaker 1: We can't get some of that here.

304
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,595
Speaker 0: Yeah thing is though Australia is like half awesome Half crap.

305
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're real big on the DRM and things like that.

306
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,609
Speaker 0: You get Nintendo games like years after they come out.

307
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, their gameboy advances don't work with other people's gameboy advances.

308
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:17,278
Speaker 0: from what I heard from an Australian guy I don't know how true it is, but there's an outback.

309
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,864
Speaker 0: There is an outback.

310
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,530
Speaker 0: There are rough-and-tough people out there.

311
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,617
Speaker 0: There's great sports.

312
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,634
Speaker 0: Yep, it's clean It's Play pleasant to live in.

313
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:29,084
Speaker 1: the water's cancer a lot of skin cancer.

314
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,610
Speaker 0: You got to watch us just cuz the Sun.

315
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but my grandparents tried to move there actually.

316
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,630
Speaker 0: Well, you need mad skills to move there.

317
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, they won't just let you move in.

318
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:44,741
Speaker 1: you have to prove that you have a skill that they need and that you'll become gainfully Employed and you don't have any diseases and a whole bunch of others.

319
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:46,890
Speaker 0: I actually heard a guy talking today about moving to Australia.

320
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:48,742
Speaker 0: He's like it doesn't matter how much money you have.

321
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:49,990
Speaker 0: You need to have a special something.

322
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, be like a rocket scientist or something in because they respect science there.

323
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:59,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, he us As long as you're not Mexican They'll let you in.

324
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,897
Speaker 0: it seems Oh Arabs they don't the Arabs in it.

325
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:03,841
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like them so much.

326
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,450
Speaker 1: They don't like people who look different.

327
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they're okay with a lot of the white aliens because they look the same.

328
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:16,177
Speaker 0: Oh, no, British people are coming to our board Canadians, oh, they don't like Canadians though.

329
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:18,447
Speaker 0: They just don't know you're Canadian till you say something.

330
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,373
Speaker 0: Hey Canada's cool, though.

331
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,236
Speaker 1: I love Canada.

332
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:23,919
Speaker 0: It's just cold.

333
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:24,763
Speaker 1: Yeah.

334
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,209
Speaker 1: Now we need a passport to go there.

335
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,951
Speaker 0: Thanks.

336
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,899
Speaker 0: We've been watching some do right.

337
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,742
Speaker 0: I love that.

338
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:31,970
Speaker 1: I don't like Dudley do right so much.

339
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,330
Speaker 1: I was more a fan of the fractured fairy tales, right?

340
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,093
Speaker 0: Where does it good?

341
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:39,530
Speaker 0: but you gotta you gotta love the snidely whiplash that the one that I just watched.

342
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 0: It's so great snidely whiplash is like foreclosing on these mortgages.

343
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,097
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

344
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:48,210
Speaker 0: Yeah You don't understand.

345
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,087
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, we got on a tangent.

346
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:57,067
Speaker 1: I mean The point is just that we can't argue about science here because there's no argument.

347
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:03,120
Speaker 1: There's either something's true or something isn't or we don't know and There's no way we could ever disagree.

348
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,810
Speaker 1: So we can't come up with any way to get banter.

349
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:09,509
Speaker 0: We could probably try to get some side tech guests who?

350
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 0: You know, maybe know some science.

351
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:17,009
Speaker 0: We don't know or are dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and they don't understand what we just said.

352
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,234
Speaker 0: They don't under.

353
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:19,017
Speaker 0: so then we can.

354
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,502
Speaker 0: you know science them.

355
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:27,727
Speaker 1: or another angle we could take is We could go the informative route and pick a topic that we know a lot about and talk about it.

356
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:30,673
Speaker 1: I don't know how Unboring that would be.

357
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:38,692
Speaker 0: yeah, the thing is also is that we're not experts in any particular area other than Computing.

358
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least as far as science.

359
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,190
Speaker 0: I mean we know more science than the average person.

360
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,661
Speaker 0: You don't know enough about any one science.

361
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:51,043
Speaker 0: Like we couldn't give you a lecture on Particle physics.

362
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:58,350
Speaker 1: Yeah About quantum physics, but I couldn't talk about it in a way that there are other people who could talk about it better.

363
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:00,866
Speaker 0: I could talk about quantum physics for maybe about 10-15 minutes.

364
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,238
Speaker 0: I just tell you everything I knew about it and that would be it and that wouldn't be Exciting or anything.

365
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,849
Speaker 1: wasn't there a time when you didn't believe in atoms?

366
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:24,001
Speaker 0: Hey, you know that was before you could see him and I didn't say, you know, all I saying that was that Atoms were a model for describing the particles that made up everything and we knew that everything was made of smaller bits But we didn't know for sure that it was.

367
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,756
Speaker 0: it was Protons neutrons and electrons.

368
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:30,627
Speaker 1: Well, actually, yeah, we did before we saw him.

369
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:31,290
Speaker 0: How did you know?

370
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,138
Speaker 0: It was only a model that worked.

371
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:33,621
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

372
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,008
Speaker 0: no it was a model.

373
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:41,546
Speaker 1: it That sort of physics as opposed to quantum physics didn't come out of the model.

374
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:45,480
Speaker 1: and then discovery Ideology it came out of the.

375
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:49,175
Speaker 1: we discovered these particles Because we could see them cut.

376
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,804
Speaker 1: we could detect them coming out of things when certain reactions happen.

377
00:23:53,385 --> 00:24:03,768
Speaker 1: if you detect particles, you don't You know, it's it's like it really you can't ever see an atom because it's you know Photons bouncing off of something is how you see.

378
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:06,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always a problem.

379
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:07,817
Speaker 0: We should try to fix that.

380
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:09,561
Speaker 1: That's impossible to fix.

381
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:12,710
Speaker 1: You can't see you can only represent based on data.

382
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, it's like.

383
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:16,890
Speaker 0: alright, we keep trying to use vision.

384
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,090
Speaker 0: We keep trying to detect things by bouncing a photon off of it and then detecting.

385
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,355
Speaker 1: No, we don't do that at all.

386
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:25,189
Speaker 1: We try to detect it using other much more advanced sensory apparatuses.

387
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:26,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how do those things work?

388
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:30,070
Speaker 0: I've always heard about these sensory things they use in accelerators.

389
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,578
Speaker 0: I've never actually heard about how they work or anything.

390
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,170
Speaker 1: They're all very very different like a neutrino detector.

391
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:37,980
Speaker 1: One way to do it is.

392
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,827
Speaker 1: they have a big tank of water Pure pure pure water and if a neutrino goes through the water the odds are it'll hit one of those water molecules.

393
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:45,689
Speaker 1: make us a flash.

394
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:47,555
Speaker 0: They're actually flashes.

395
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:48,560
Speaker 0: like you can see it flash.

396
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:49,022
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:50,227
Speaker 0: Wow, that's pretty cool.

398
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,220
Speaker 0: or Just look at this big tank of water and I'll see.

399
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,450
Speaker 1: like I don't know if humans can see it.

400
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,657
Speaker 1: I think they need a camera to see it.

401
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,366
Speaker 1: I don't know how fast they're or powerful.

402
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:01,576
Speaker 1: These flashes are Much cooler.

403
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:06,187
Speaker 0: if it was a real like a big like a flash bulb You like you take pictures?

404
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,570
Speaker 1: Like when they discovered positrons and all that sort of stuff electrons and egotrons.

405
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:19,490
Speaker 1: They would set up photographic plates and then they could see the spirals as the particles flew away from the reaction.

406
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:24,250
Speaker 0: Remember say but I mean, how do you think of this to begin with?

407
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,467
Speaker 1: Science.

408
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:28,860
Speaker 0: But I mean who thinks of that.

409
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:30,490
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm smashing atoms here.

410
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:34,829
Speaker 0: Let me um put a big tank of water next to it and see if anything happens in the water.

411
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,676
Speaker 1: This was more huh?

412
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:40,430
Speaker 1: Every time I collide these two atoms it a certain result happens.

413
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:45,170
Speaker 0: I wonder what's happening, but how do you detect the result and know what it was before they made the detector?

414
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:49,149
Speaker 1: Because they had other detectors that detected larger scale events.

415
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:54,611
Speaker 1: Like if you run two atoms into each other, you can detect that energy is released Huh?

416
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:55,635
Speaker 1: Yeah was released.

417
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,362
Speaker 1: Where did the atoms go?

418
00:25:57,382 --> 00:26:07,210
Speaker 1: and then you set up a thing like well I'll put this thing around it where if a if an atom hits it It'll react in a certain way and I know it reacts that way because I fired atoms at it and reacts that way.

419
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:08,478
Speaker 1: So I'll put it around.

420
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,089
Speaker 1: so I'll see if the atoms bounce off each other.

421
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:12,237
Speaker 1: Hey, they had never detected an atom.

422
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:13,661
Speaker 1: the atoms must have disappeared.

423
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,370
Speaker 1: So what they turn into where they got energy?

424
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,350
Speaker 1: Maybe actually they turn into energy and particle.

425
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,680
Speaker 0: Well, you do math to figure out how much of it turned into energy and then the rest obviously did not Something like that.

426
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:29,460
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz you know equals MC squared and such.

427
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,126
Speaker 1: that's actually not the equation.

428
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,330
Speaker 0: I know it has a lot.

429
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,499
Speaker 0: well, it's actually this the the.

430
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,293
Speaker 0: there's another version where it's like M equals No, no, no.

431
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:45,594
Speaker 1: over equals MC squares is is a representation but is a simplification of the actual equation Significantly more complex.

432
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:46,416
Speaker 0: Well, there is.

433
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:58,865
Speaker 1: the whole thing is it's a large theory of relativity, which has many equations encompassing it equals MC squared is just saying that either time or Speed of light has to be constant.

434
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:03,387
Speaker 1: Einstein made the speed of light constant because that made his equations.

435
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:10,379
Speaker 1: Awesome he could have done it the other way and it would have worked just as well, but he chose this way and He was smarter than I was.

436
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:16,009
Speaker 0: so what it really says is that You know matter it has a whole lot of energy in it.

437
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:22,770
Speaker 1: No, it more just says that mass is energy it is energy, but it is a whole lot.

438
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:31,128
Speaker 0: In fact, it's C squared a whole lot Yeah, which in a grand scale isn't and a grand scale isn't that much but on a human scale?

439
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:31,670
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

440
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:39,396
Speaker 0: I mean, you know if you got all the energy out of like a piece of wood all of it all C squared of it It's a lot of energy.

441
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:43,912
Speaker 0: you could pry power a city on that for like Weak.

442
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:45,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know keep in mind entropy.

443
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,024
Speaker 1: You really can't get that energy.

444
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:48,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it sucks.

445
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:49,855
Speaker 1: You know the whole thermo.

446
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,586
Speaker 0: does that something we can do about science if we can't argue about it.

447
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,590
Speaker 0: We can complain about it.

448
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, stupid thermodynamics.

449
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,472
Speaker 0: I mean Bringing.

450
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,661
Speaker 0: if I burn a piece of wood, I can't get all the heat.

451
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,045
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

452
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:02,687
Speaker 0: I burnt it.

453
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:03,890
Speaker 0: It's all mine.

454
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:04,528
Speaker 0: Where's it going?

455
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,555
Speaker 0: It's my wood.

456
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:12,493
Speaker 0: friggin laws of physics stealing my fire Lisa in this house.

457
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:14,179
Speaker 1: We follow the laws of thermodynamics.

458
00:28:15,382 --> 00:28:16,727
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget the quote.

459
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,922
Speaker 1: Oh Busted own food, whatever.

460
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:23,450
Speaker 0: I know it's from the Simpsons.

461
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a whole thing recently about math in the Simpsons.

462
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,527
Speaker 0: how hard it was for them to get these math jokes in.

463
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:38,088
Speaker 1: because I Remember the first one remember way way back when Bart went to the genius school and there was the rdr.

464
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,137
Speaker 1: rdr Already ha ha.

465
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:40,438
Speaker 1: Yeah.

466
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,730
Speaker 1: Well, I remember laughing at that.

467
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,090
Speaker 1: I was real little when I saw that episode and then I took AP physics and an AP physics.

468
00:28:48,551 --> 00:29:03,434
Speaker 1: we were calculating a Gaussian surface and we were calculating the Gaussian surface of a doughnut shaped objects and then I realized that the operative part of the equation we were using was rdrr and I realized

469
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:03,675
Speaker 0: up

470
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:10,867
Speaker 1: that it was the shape of a doughnut and I laughed for like At least a minute straight and everyone's looking at me

471
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:12,415
Speaker 0: Don't?

472
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,607
Speaker 1: I said rdrr?

473
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,878
Speaker 1: Hardy ha ha and they're all geeks.

474
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:19,002
Speaker 1: they all got it and then we didn't.

475
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:21,029
Speaker 1: we just stopped working all day and laughed about that.

476
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:22,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was great.

477
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:54,900
Speaker 0: there was a. I don't know this for a hundred percent, but there was a tale of the of the Friends went to Fairfield High School and they told a story that there was a teacher there and He was a math teacher and when his problems arrived at an answer involving the number 69 he would put a tally above the board and Yeah that's That's not as funny as rdrr.

478
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,770
Speaker 0: No, but it's definitely stranger.

479
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:09,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually my calculus teacher in tenth grade He pretty much He said okay, I think more times than he said any other word including definite and indefinite articles.

480
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:13,269
Speaker 0: Oh, I hate it, especially when there's good teachers that say words over and over.

481
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:19,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I had one teacher who would always say in essence In essence in essence in essence everything was in essence.

482
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:22,157
Speaker 0: I was like so nothing's for real It's only in essence the same.

483
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:28,555
Speaker 1: I had an English teacher who said quintessential at least twice a day Twice a day isn't so bad.

484
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,621
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like constantly.

485
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:37,030
Speaker 1: the MK guy was terrible because he'd say it like, okay, and He'd expect some sort of response like yeah, and then he'd keep going.

486
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:41,423
Speaker 1: But if no one said anything he would quite literally stand in front of the classroom going.

487
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:41,804
Speaker 1: Okay.

488
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:42,586
Speaker 1: Okay.

489
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:48,169
Speaker 1: All right Okay, okay, and then he'd move on like he'd get stuck.

490
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:51,477
Speaker 0: Some people got these problems.

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, can science explain them?

492
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:55,834
Speaker 0: probably Maybe they should.

493
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:57,398
Speaker 1: we should get a scientist in.

494
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,731
Speaker 0: you know, I'm actually pretty sure that you know, some of those problems like ADD and such Like.

495
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:11,901
Speaker 0: I'm not a super expert, but at least from the few things I've read there's no Gene for ADD.

496
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:15,359
Speaker 0: There's no virus No bacteria.

497
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,992
Speaker 0: There's no Chemical.

498
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:24,170
Speaker 1: I think the problem here is more simply that I believe ADD is something that does exist and can affect people.

499
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:31,903
Speaker 1: I do believe however that it is Wildly over diagnosed that many people who are told they have ADD are just you know kids.

500
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:49,508
Speaker 1: Oh my god, ah Maybe if we let him play on proper playgrounds Yeah, yeah cuz I mean when we were kids we were already complaining about the decline of the playground because when we were kids They were taking away the seesaws and they're taking away the merry-go-rounds.

501
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,890
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, I had a pretty good at my elementary school.

502
00:31:53,151 --> 00:32:03,734
Speaker 0: There was there were three playgrounds and when I was in kindergarten There was the old playground and then there was the the big toys which is the new playground.

503
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:18,242
Speaker 0: the old playground consisted of some old style swings two long chains of the rubber seat a sandbox a spinny thing Two wooden splintery seesaws of metal handles.

504
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,070
Speaker 0: Ooh and this big square tower thing.

505
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:24,390
Speaker 0: It was a square tower and you climbed up it various ways.

506
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:28,370
Speaker 0: It's just big Frickin tall rectangle structure at the top.

507
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,049
Speaker 0: You could stand up there and those are railing and there was a slide from up there to get down.

508
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,424
Speaker 0: This thing was like at least 10 feet tall.

509
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:34,928
Speaker 0: It's pretty tall.

510
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:46,790
Speaker 0: then the big toys is a big wooden thing and they had the the tires and The tube and a swirly plastic slide and some chains to climb up in those plastic.

511
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,307
Speaker 1: Worst things ever because the plastic slide was fun and we got a Van de Graaff generator.

512
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,270
Speaker 1: you'd go down that thing.

513
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:54,256
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

514
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,770
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but they were still fun to go down.

515
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:04,710
Speaker 1: but one time I got I've slid down one and I went to stand up and I brushed my arm against a little like Metal thing like a little screw and it shocked my arm so hard.

516
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,290
Speaker 1: My arm was dumb and I went crying to my mom and I couldn't explain what happened.

517
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:12,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when we were little kids the little the swirly yellow slide was still pretty good.

518
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:20,616
Speaker 0: now as big kids We need the long metal slides to get any fun or the carny slides But they're all going away there.

519
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:22,122
Speaker 1: I mean think about it when we were kids.

520
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:26,156
Speaker 1: They were taking away the seesaws and all that stuff I saw a few days ago.

521
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:29,170
Speaker 1: They're taking away swings now because swings are too dangerous.

522
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:33,685
Speaker 0: So if there's gonna be no moving parts, what's?

523
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:34,348
Speaker 0: what's the fun?

524
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:34,730
Speaker 0: You could just.

525
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:38,863
Speaker 1: They're also taking away sandboxes because animals might do things in them.

526
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:44,125
Speaker 0: You could use that white sand And Animals might do things.

527
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,778
Speaker 0: They might just pee on the kids.

528
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,465
Speaker 1: I've seen kids peeing on stuff.

529
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,834
Speaker 0: so oh my god I remember nursery school.

530
00:33:52,854 --> 00:34:03,157
Speaker 0: Some kid was peeing in the back of the nursery school playground, and I told her oh one time When I was in second grade You know, we're in a Catholic school.

531
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:04,622
Speaker 1: There was this kid named Pierre.

532
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,167
Speaker 1: He had pretty French.

533
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:07,010
Speaker 1: No, he was not French.

534
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:08,333
Speaker 0: Why was his name Pierre?

535
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,418
Speaker 1: His name was Pierre.

536
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,304
Speaker 0: What the hell are those parents thinking?

537
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:17,052
Speaker 1: So anyway, one day Kids gonna get picked on and he just peed Even glass?

538
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,739
Speaker 1: He just sat there and he just unzipped and peed.

539
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,103
Speaker 0: Wait, he unzipped?

540
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,146
Speaker 1: He unzipped and peed.

541
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,570
Speaker 1: He was sitting in his desk and he just peed.

542
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:25,033
Speaker 0: Where'd he peed?

543
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:25,876
Speaker 0: Did he just go on the floor?

544
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:26,478
Speaker 1: Just went on.

545
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,005
Speaker 1: the floor started because the classroom was kind of slanted and started making his way toward the front of the room.

546
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:38,284
Speaker 1: And Who's a nun looks and says who's got a drink and no one says anything.

547
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:42,103
Speaker 1: and then everyone's looking and we all real Everyone realizes at this point.

548
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:42,688
Speaker 1: What is happening?

549
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,482
Speaker 0: I never heard this story and no one wants to react to it.

550
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:47,946
Speaker 1: cuz no one's sure what to do.

551
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,010
Speaker 1: We're all second graders.

552
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,399
Speaker 1: We didn't even think to laugh cuz this was just too weird.

553
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,282
Speaker 0: second grade.

554
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:52,884
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

555
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,607
Speaker 0: I can grade.

556
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:54,370
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

557
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,745
Speaker 1: And it was you know, this was back before, you know would have been a biohazard because you know wasn't.

558
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:03,139
Speaker 0: it's not a biohazard It's sterile.

559
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,130
Speaker 1: It's sterile If you get a tooth pulled by the dentist.

560
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,406
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to take it home in a lot of places because it's a biohazard.

561
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:11,190
Speaker 0: I took it home.

562
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:12,248
Speaker 1: So, you know what the nun did?

563
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,530
Speaker 1: She made him get some paper towels and clean up his pee and then we went back on with the lesson.

564
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:18,934
Speaker 0: Sounds about right.

565
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, she hit him too with the ruler a couple times.

566
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:22,850
Speaker 0: That's not so right.

567
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,114
Speaker 1: I was a college school.

568
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:24,476
Speaker 1: They hit us.

569
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:25,218
Speaker 1: They hit me a lot.

570
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,443
Speaker 1: Cuz I was smart ass.

571
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,145
Speaker 0: I would hit back.

572
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:29,149
Speaker 1: I Didn't hit back.

573
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,572
Speaker 0: I would hit back Cuz.

574
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:36,049
Speaker 1: I'd always ask questions about science and they give me God answers and I'd ask for science answers and then they hit me.

575
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:38,483
Speaker 0: I always read stories you ever read.

576
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:39,549
Speaker 0: they caged the animals at night.

577
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,550
Speaker 0: No, it's basically this guy's autobiography of his childhood.

578
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,878
Speaker 0: This is sequel and it's actually pretty sad.

579
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:56,382
Speaker 0: cuz like his mom is all screwed up in traction all the time And his brothers don't care for him and he's always in like You know foster houses and things and it's terrible.

580
00:35:56,542 --> 00:36:02,968
Speaker 0: and you know, his life pretty much sucked as a child Uh-huh, and he came to my middle school once and told us about it after he read it and he cried.

581
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:07,067
Speaker 0: whatever You know put on a show I think but you know, it's true.

582
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:07,730
Speaker 0: basically.

583
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:14,989
Speaker 0: Well, one of the things is he's always in Catholic places where nuns would hit him a lot You know and I was always just like you never hit back.

584
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:18,609
Speaker 0: You can't really you know, I get you get my sympathy for some stuff, but not for that.

585
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:23,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to hit back cuz remember when you're when you're in second grade, you're a little kid.

586
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,417
Speaker 1: So those nuns are tall.

587
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,803
Speaker 1: They're strong.

588
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,230
Speaker 1: They're stronger than your old ladies.

589
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,618
Speaker 1: Nah, they weren't all old ladies.

590
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:32,950
Speaker 0: If you push one over they'll break their hip and you win.

591
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,737
Speaker 1: Actually, some of them were pretty young.

592
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:35,881
Speaker 0: if they're young.

593
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:36,905
Speaker 0: Why are they hitting kids?

594
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,354
Speaker 0: They're not mean old ladies They're mean nuns.

595
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,402
Speaker 0: You're mean and young none.

596
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,733
Speaker 1: There was one real nice none who gave me some gerbils Gerbils.

597
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, she had gerbils and she gave me a couple.

598
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:53,389
Speaker 0: I know could you I can't imagine like like a 20 30 year old nun hitting kids.

599
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:57,450
Speaker 1: Yeah one nun she was old, but she used a metal ruler.

600
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,526
Speaker 1: Everyone else used wooden rulers and regime with that metal ruler.

601
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,350
Speaker 1: That was endgame.

602
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:03,741
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because she was so old.

603
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,129
Speaker 0: She needed the metal one to.

604
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:07,095
Speaker 0: You know spice it up.

605
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:10,389
Speaker 1: I only ever saw her actually hit a kid once and the kid kind of deserved it.

606
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:19,287
Speaker 0: You know kids do deserve a hitting sometimes But I don't think that you know, I don't think that's not should be doling it out.

607
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:24,890
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, actually, you know, the Singapore hitting is a little too hard.

608
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:35,058
Speaker 1: I'm kind of an advocate of caning because the more I see people doing stupid things It'd be a great way to solve problems.

609
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:44,742
Speaker 0: if someone was stupid if you just whacked him and said hey no See the thing is it's like it's not really cruel or unusual I mean the caning they do is a little cruel because a little too much.

610
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:54,418
Speaker 0: but seriously if someone Let's say someone robbed a convenience store instead of locking them up in prison where they'll come out and just you know Not change their mind or anything

611
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:57,410
Speaker 1: or if anything they'll learn how to rob one better from the people who are yeah

612
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,958
Speaker 0: You just whack them right just not caning.

613
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:11,409
Speaker 0: but like Whipping or something something like between spanking and caning or just humiliate him just a good spanking Spanking's good.

614
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,578
Speaker 0: The judge himself does it with a giant paddle.

615
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:18,290
Speaker 0: a paddle paddling paddling is good paddling of the swollen ass.

616
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,862
Speaker 0: That's that's how we get him great.

617
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,189
Speaker 0: It'll be so much cheaper.

618
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:29,810
Speaker 1: You know and people why this won't happen because we do have the whole, you know prison industrial complex going in the u.s.

619
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,657
Speaker 0: Now it is but the prison doesn't make us money.

620
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:32,601
Speaker 0: It loses us money.

621
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:37,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is the prison exists The prison system is huge.

622
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a lot of people work for it.

623
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:43,726
Speaker 1: Everyone who works for the prison system has a vested interest in what we'll be.

624
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:46,497
Speaker 0: still need prisons I mean for like crazy murders.

625
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:49,990
Speaker 1: we do you realize how many people are incarcerated in the United States?

626
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,062
Speaker 1: We have one of the highest per capita rates.

627
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,149
Speaker 0: I think the highest.

628
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:58,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have more people in prison per capita than China then a communist oppressive China.

629
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,298
Speaker 0: We have more than Australia, which was a prison colony.

630
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,806
Speaker 1: Well, isn't Australia a hundred percent.

631
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:10,607
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah Even Though we want to go there and they just don't let us.

632
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:18,117
Speaker 1: you know I think we got a topic for a Friday coming up the prison industrial complex prison industrial complex because it's a something I'm we totally lost science.

633
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, we lost science, but we couldn't talk about science.

634
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,430
Speaker 1: We'll have to come up with a way to talk science.

635
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:29,850
Speaker 0: I think we do a problem of Microphone close to the mouth a little less far from the mouth and you can see it on the wave getting bigger and smaller.

636
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,304
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see if anyone complains when they listen to this.

637
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,410
Speaker 0: I'm sure they will.

638
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:35,218
Speaker 1: Anyone still listening this far into it?

639
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,525
Speaker 1: because we got on off on a tangent.

640
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:42,624
Speaker 1: Yeah Hey Alex Pete if you hear this right now, it's no good.

641
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:43,366
Speaker 1: Say something.

642
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,509
Speaker 0: That's no good.

643
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:46,198
Speaker 1: We won't do that.

644
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,186
Speaker 1: We won't make a habit of that.

645
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:51,060
Speaker 1: but This podcast kind of went off on a crazy tangent.

646
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,709
Speaker 1: We went from science to a kid peeing to prison industrial complex.

647
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:02,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think tomorrow and the next day will be a lot better though because we can argue about things.

648
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,507
Speaker 1: I like games you don't like you like anime.

649
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:04,688
Speaker 1: what?

650
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:15,705
Speaker 0: hey maybe we should you know pick something else or we can talk about like it and not liking because it's really the only room for Any real discussion unless we made an informative Monday night like today.

651
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:21,850
Speaker 1: This is how to Build a Linux box or this is how to use jabber properly.

652
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just think that might be a little boring.

653
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:28,085
Speaker 0: It sounds almost like a separate podcast we should do.

654
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:33,223
Speaker 0: Yeah Let's get some suggestions from people we know.

655
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,410
Speaker 1: yeah, what do you want to hear?

656
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,786
Speaker 1: What should we add other than sci-tech because we don't have so much sci-tech.

657
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was geek night special.

658
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,099
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for our opening music.

659
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:51,620
Speaker 1: Promotional consideration was provided by Noah.
