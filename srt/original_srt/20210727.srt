1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,238
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, July 27th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:10,640
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:14,245
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,693
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:21,410
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about the grindy, pay-to-win, Pokemon Unite MOBA.

6
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:23,628
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:32,950
Speaker 1: So, uh, we're not gonna dwell on it, but, uh, the NHL expansion draft did happen for the newest team that joined the NHL, the Seattle Kraken.

8
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:40,930
Speaker 0: If you don't understand what that means, it basically, every team chooses which players that are the most important players on their team.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,790
Speaker 0: And there's some list, you have to meet some requirements.

10
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:53,150
Speaker 0: And then when there's a new team that comes out of nowhere and has no players, that team goes around to all the other teams and they steal one player from each team.

11
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,169
Speaker 1: How fucking cool is that?

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,490
Speaker 0: So they're there, but they can't steal the ones that got protected.

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,010
Speaker 0: They steal the other, the low hanging, the low fruits.

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,137
Speaker 1: You got two games going on.

15
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,110
Speaker 1: If you're a fan of another team, you got to be like, all right.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,070
Speaker 0: It's a lot like, you know, a kickball, right?

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:07,880
Speaker 0: It's like, right.

18
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:10,149
Speaker 1: I choose Johnny.

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,591
Speaker 0: Right.

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:22,830
Speaker 0: And then immediately after that draft, they have the regular draft where you choose from amongst the children of the world to which ones you will have exclusive bargaining rights with.

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,930
Speaker 1: Rangers had actually, despite having the amazing draft pick last year, they got like 16th overall again this year, just by luck.

22
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:33,229
Speaker 0: That's that's pretty much in the middle.

23
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was OK.

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,178
Speaker 1: We got 32 teams now.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,109
Speaker 0: In fact, that's right in the middle.

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

27
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:41,165
Speaker 1: But the cool thing about this is one now the NHL, like Dr.

28
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,610
Speaker 1: Hibbert would approve, has symmetry.

29
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:48,169
Speaker 1: There are the same number of teams in every division in the NHL.

30
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:50,190
Speaker 0: That is correct.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,449
Speaker 0: And two, we don't need any more teams.

32
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:53,954
Speaker 1: I've seen like.

33
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:57,449
Speaker 1: I've only seen two expansion drafts like of this format in my life.

34
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:03,950
Speaker 1: And this one, I actually really enjoyed watching because Seattle, you watched it live.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, the reason I watched it live, I just checked the day after and looked at the list.

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,809
Speaker 1: So here's what was going on with it.

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:22,210
Speaker 1: For one, I forget who was up on stage, but the guy on the right where the navy blue blazer was like really mean and catty and everything he said was like very like a weird, mean girl.

38
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,989
Speaker 1: Like he kind of made fun of every other NHL team one by one.

39
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:31,630
Speaker 1: Every time a Canadian team came up that they were taking someone from, he'd mentioned how the teams up north didn't have such a great season.

40
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,870
Speaker 1: And like he just dug into every single team.

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,230
Speaker 1: And it was kind of funny to watch.

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,730
Speaker 1: But to him aside, the rest of the draft was.

43
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:50,290
Speaker 1: So remember when the Mighty Ducks became a team and they did the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened in the history of the NHL with their Disney on ice, like nonsense to try to announce the team.

44
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:59,830
Speaker 1: This was like this weird combination of so wholesome and so pure that I got to respect it.

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,650
Speaker 1: Like the Seattle team, like almost all the announcements, they get like someone to do the announcement in a cute, kitschy way.

46
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,049
Speaker 1: Like they had someone who climbed to the top of Mount Rainier announced one of the teams from the top of Mount Rainier.

47
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,950
Speaker 1: And they're like, this is the record for the highest elevation that an expansion draft pick has ever been announced.

48
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:22,530
Speaker 1: And they did one like in like someone in a scuba suit, in a shark tank.

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,637
Speaker 1: And it was like that.

50
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,390
Speaker 1: stuff's all stupid and marketing nonsense.

51
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:28,230
Speaker 1: But it was also very like kitschy Seattle.

52
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,370
Speaker 1: And I respect that they're leaning into their identity.

53
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:37,750
Speaker 1: But with all of that, they got some football players and like other Seattle people to give announcements.

54
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:44,349
Speaker 1: It was very clear which of those people have ever seen a hockey game in their life and which of them have not.

55
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,630
Speaker 1: And that it's worth going back.

56
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,390
Speaker 0: That's how it is with hockey, right?

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,384
Speaker 0: Being something that is quite large.

58
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,210
Speaker 0: Hockey is a big, a big thing, but it's not the biggest, right?

59
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,748
Speaker 0: There's a lot of places that just don't have any, right?

60
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,790
Speaker 0: So it's this weird in between thing where it's big enough to be a thing, but not big.

61
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:15,408
Speaker 0: So it can sort of have some aspects of being huge and having tons of money and some aspects of being this unknown, weird thing.

62
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,110
Speaker 1: But the other thing, the other aspect of it that's interesting, we'll move on to the actual news and stuff.

63
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,250
Speaker 1: There's so much news, we're only going to cover two big stories.

64
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,510
Speaker 1: But with the expansion draft, normally a hockey team with the salary cap era has to grow organically.

65
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:33,049
Speaker 1: They can't just like pick the right team.

66
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,023
Speaker 1: Like the difference between a D&D character that levels up over the course of four years of your high school versus a D&D character.

67
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,410
Speaker 1: you start at level 10 and choose a path and an end result.

68
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:53,210
Speaker 1: So expansion draft teams are this interesting case where they, the people in charge of the team, basically get to decide the composition of the team from nothing.

69
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,876
Speaker 1: Like, we want a team that plays like this.

70
00:04:56,156 --> 00:05:01,210
Speaker 1: If we get that player, let's get this other player specifically to complement them.

71
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:05,186
Speaker 1: And that doesn't happen in Major League sports.

72
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:05,869
Speaker 1: Like that is a...

73
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually, because usually you have some players that are already on contracts.

74
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:18,490
Speaker 0: I mean, you could wait a long time until you basically, you could set it up to where you just let everyone's contract expire, give everyone bridge deals.

75
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:28,310
Speaker 0: And then like maybe some magically you've timed it out in such a way and, you know, maybe in purposely lost a bunch of games so that you just lose all your players at once.

76
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,322
Speaker 0: But typically you're going to have a significant number of players who are on long term deals.

77
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:38,230
Speaker 0: that are your core players and you have to build around them because they're on your team.

78
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:49,730
Speaker 0: You signed them, you know, three years ago, whatever you wanted to keep them, you just, you know, and so the past you, which might not even be you if, you know, the previous GM of your team, right, signed those deals.

79
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,855
Speaker 0: Now you're the new GM.

80
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,150
Speaker 0: It's like you're stuck with the same deals that were there.

81
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,550
Speaker 0: So you have to, you only have a few spots that you can play with on your roster.

82
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:05,490
Speaker 0: You can't, you know, it takes a long time, several years to like redo, you know, redo your team.

83
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,290
Speaker 1: But instead you get to just craft a team from the ether like it's it's unique.

84
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:18,710
Speaker 1: And when Vegas did the expansion draft more like recently, I suspected that they were going to do really well because of that, like better than they did.

85
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,329
Speaker 1: Like they almost won the Stanley Cup their first year being a hockey team.

86
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:29,370
Speaker 1: So I bet the Kraken will do very well like Vegas their first few years and then they'll be like a normal team after that.

87
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,890
Speaker 1: So in the news, whatever other news we were talking about, this is probably the biggest one and it's important.

88
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:42,310
Speaker 0: Activision and Blizzard independently, which is the same, they're the same company.

89
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,409
Speaker 1: They are the same company now.

90
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:44,930
Speaker 1: They were a lot.

91
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,290
Speaker 1: So I bring this up because and I'll talk about this more when we talk about the news.

92
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:56,790
Speaker 1: There was an early narrative of people used to like before these stories all broke that Activision had the bad culture.

93
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,656
Speaker 1: But Blizzard was a good company.

94
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:03,150
Speaker 1: that was like stuck in the Activision umbrella and Activision was making them more and more toxic.

95
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,170
Speaker 1: And while that may be true, based on this news, it is very clear that Blizzard on its own is also super toxic.

96
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,609
Speaker 0: I assume that every large game company.

97
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,152
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

98
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:14,550
Speaker 1: Like, don't forget, everyone's mad at Blizzard.

99
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,769
Speaker 1: Ubisoft has a very similar horrifying situation ongoing.

100
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,530
Speaker 1: The news about that is just eclipsed by the recent news about Blizzard.

101
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:27,430
Speaker 1: Blizzard, Activision, Blizzard, Ubisoft are equal offenders, as are almost all AAA games.

102
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:45,850
Speaker 0: I pretty much assume that every single like major nerd company, not even just video games, but especially games, that the culture is is like this, except Nintendo, where I believe my my opinion of Nintendo is that the it's probably not broey in this way.

103
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:58,667
Speaker 0: But I still imagine Nintendo to be, you know, sexist and also have more problems related to overwork, that, you know, knowing the stories I've heard about like Miyamoto overwork, you know, it's I'm.

104
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,910
Speaker 0: you know, I guess those are just Japanese.

105
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,497
Speaker 0: There's also some I guess.

106
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,850
Speaker 0: I guess that's sort of a racist idea also.

107
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:05,212
Speaker 0: Right.

108
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,160
Speaker 0: And that, you know, it's sort of like.

109
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,310
Speaker 0: that's the stereotype of a Japanese company.

110
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:10,231
Speaker 1: Right.

111
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:14,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's tough because Nintendo could be an exception, but I just I doubt it.

112
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:17,609
Speaker 1: So there's a lot going on here.

113
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:27,490
Speaker 1: But basically, Blizzard had the culture that you all assumed and expected it had that people who have worked there and quit or been fired or pushed out have been telling people about forever.

114
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,174
Speaker 1: But now there's a lawsuit, a big for real lawsuit that

115
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:37,722
Speaker 0: and not a lawsuit from like people, you know, like just some people who are, you know, employees of the state

116
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:38,383
Speaker 1: of California,

117
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:45,111
Speaker 0: state of California, where the company is, is suing the company, which is if the state sues you, you're a much bigger trouble.

118
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:45,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

119
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:52,190
Speaker 0: Then if your employees try to sue you because your employees, you know, they had to pull their money together with a class action.

120
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:52,571
Speaker 0: Right.

121
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,394
Speaker 0: It's like, no, no, no.

122
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:57,690
Speaker 0: If the state comes after you, they have the state, the state's power, right?

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,492
Speaker 0: The tax money.

124
00:08:59,013 --> 00:08:59,514
Speaker 1: I'm going to read.

125
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:03,042
Speaker 1: I'm going to read a very short excerpt from The Daily Beast because I just I want to.

126
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:06,390
Speaker 1: this news is big enough to be very precise with exactly what's happening.

127
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,410
Speaker 0: Do you need a content warning for all these sexual assault stories?

128
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:14,210
Speaker 1: We do not, because what I'm about to read does not get into any specific details.

129
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,530
Speaker 1: That are content warning.

130
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:25,930
Speaker 1: But if you read, which I have read the actual complaints, serious content warning, it is fucked up shit that was going on in Blizzard.

131
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,390
Speaker 1: And I suspect this is just the alleged, I guess, allegedly, we're not lawyers, allegedly.

132
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,869
Speaker 0: So the court, the case isn't over yet.

133
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:48,830
Speaker 1: So from The Daily Beast quote, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed suiting its active vision Blizzard, alleging that they subjected its female employees to a degrading, pervasive frat boy workplace culture.

134
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:56,430
Speaker 1: Women comprise only one fifth of the company's workforce, and those employees were subject to sexual harassment, unequal pay and retaliation.

135
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:03,070
Speaker 1: The suit alleges female employees who spoke to the bureau said their male colleagues and bosses would make rape jokes hit on them.

136
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,190
Speaker 1: One employee claimed to have an assault situation involving photos that I'm not going to read a detail.

137
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,809
Speaker 1: And it only gets worse from there.

138
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:18,510
Speaker 1: Like this is this is worse than what even a lot of pessimistic people about the industry had expected and assumed.

139
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,250
Speaker 0: No, no, that's what I expected.

140
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,319
Speaker 0: It is what I expected.

141
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,310
Speaker 1: This is what I have assumed.

142
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:29,210
Speaker 0: I expect and assume that, you know, let's name another game called Rockstar Games where they make GTA.

143
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:29,691
Speaker 0: Come on.

144
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:33,069
Speaker 1: You can't tell me that, you know, I have any rights been in deep shit over this.

145
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,797
Speaker 0: Oh, Riot.

146
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:34,082
Speaker 0: Right.

147
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:34,529
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

148
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,152
Speaker 0: Right.

149
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,910
Speaker 1: It's like enemy number one when it comes to sexist nonsense.

150
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:38,612
Speaker 0: Yeah.

151
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:42,530
Speaker 0: Obviously, I'm not trying to like slander or libel any of these places.

152
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:43,072
Speaker 0: Right.

153
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:47,690
Speaker 0: But it's like I'm saying not that these things actually happen there.

154
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:51,009
Speaker 0: I'm saying that I assume those things actually happen there.

155
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:59,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I believe they did, even though I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever, other than that's the culture of these places.

156
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,090
Speaker 1: I mean, one of the reasons I am not like did not seriously try to be at one of these large game companies is they don't they don't pay shit.

157
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,228
Speaker 1: Like that's just the thing.

158
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:16,390
Speaker 0: But it's one of it's one of the reasons I won't work at like any company over a certain size or any company you've ever heard of.

159
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:24,740
Speaker 1: But I also do not like, like or trust the entire triple A ecosystem.

160
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,150
Speaker 1: like it is just no workers rights, like exploitation, never mind all this harassment and all this sexist stuff and racism.

161
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,650
Speaker 1: There's so much going on there.

162
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,008
Speaker 1: It's just it's a shit show.

163
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:37,510
Speaker 1: And this lawsuit is serious.

164
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:43,870
Speaker 1: Their stock dropped on this news significantly and the world like people are taking it seriously.

165
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:59,770
Speaker 0: So what I would really makes me it makes me think about, right, how over the past few years, so many of the higher up people at Blizzard working, you know, everyone I know, one by one, I'm the Moreheim guy.

166
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,232
Speaker 0: Right.

167
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:03,630
Speaker 0: All these people were at Blizzard sort of abandoned ship.

168
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:04,993
Speaker 0: Right.

169
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:12,890
Speaker 0: You know, when the after they guess they got it's like, OK, Activision bought us, we shipped our stuff, we you know, we achieved and then let's bail.

170
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,619
Speaker 0: They all bailed.

171
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,368
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,538
Speaker 1: And so many people we know of that was there was there was.

173
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,150
Speaker 0: there was the layoff situation also a while back.

174
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:21,412
Speaker 0: Right.

175
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,329
Speaker 0: Which made me think it's not a great place to work.

176
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:28,030
Speaker 0: The products they've been putting out, they've been delivering products less.

177
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,913
Speaker 0: Well, see, it's like.

178
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:39,790
Speaker 0: which led me to imagine that there was some and the people leaving led me to imagine there was organizational dysfunction where there previously was not or at least it was going downhill.

179
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:40,132
Speaker 0: Yeah.

180
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:44,230
Speaker 0: Like in response to this in response to this lawsuit.

181
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:45,032
Speaker 0: Right.

182
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:50,750
Speaker 0: You're seeing comments from people who are still there and also some of those former people.

183
00:12:51,771 --> 00:13:01,030
Speaker 0: And what I've noticed is a lot of the former people were saying things along the line, some along the lines of, yeah, we failed you.

184
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,919
Speaker 0: We fucked up.

185
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:02,810
Speaker 0: Right.

186
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,289
Speaker 0: Which is, I guess, yeah, you did.

187
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:09,850
Speaker 0: But the current like executives were like refuting.

188
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is so that this escalated rapidly.

189
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:19,130
Speaker 1: Executives at Blizzard tried to issue statements to the effect of like either this isn't a problem or.

190
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,289
Speaker 0: But yet the previous executives effectively indirectly admitted it by saying we failed you.

191
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also doesn't which doesn't excuse them for the fact that they failed them.

192
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:42,390
Speaker 1: That happens in a lot of industries when the white dude who is a senior executive at a company or someone who steps down or resigns or recently stepped down and they say like, yes, we failed, we failed.

193
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:43,558
Speaker 1: No, you didn't just fail.

194
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,349
Speaker 1: You were actively a part of it if you knew.

195
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,590
Speaker 1: And if you didn't know, you are terrible at your job.

196
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,530
Speaker 0: Right.

197
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:57,710
Speaker 0: So basically there was the people who were responsible for the bad culture in the past and probably part responsible for starting it because they were there.

198
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:58,212
Speaker 0: Right.

199
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,179
Speaker 0: The Moreheim guy, who isn't that?

200
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,950
Speaker 0: the Blizzard guy who was there from the start.

201
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:01,413
Speaker 0: Right.

202
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,830
Speaker 0: So it happened under his watch.

203
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:04,151
Speaker 0: Right.

204
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:08,010
Speaker 0: The cult people don't realize how much of the culture of a company.

205
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:08,954
Speaker 0: Right.

206
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,170
Speaker 0: Comes down like from the top.

207
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:12,310
Speaker 1: Oh, it happens.

208
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:15,550
Speaker 1: I think you like penny arcade or say big or small.

209
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:16,331
Speaker 0: Right.

210
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:27,470
Speaker 0: The attitude of like a very few executives at the top of a company largely dictates the culture of like the entire company, even if it's massive, even if the CEO is far away and you never hear from them.

211
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:27,971
Speaker 1: Yeah.

212
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:40,950
Speaker 1: But in this case, like this type of situation, the game industry, I think a big part of it like and it's in addition to cultures of racism and sexism and in addition to the exploitation of the workers.

213
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:48,140
Speaker 1: There's also this specific problem that's more common in the game industry than a lot of other industries of.

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,490
Speaker 1: there are specific, well-known harassers who are in the company, who are protected.

215
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,208
Speaker 1: This happens in tech companies a lot, too.

216
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:05,630
Speaker 1: Who are protected for reasons that I cannot fathom because they tend to not actually be the people who are actually making the products good either.

217
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:13,310
Speaker 1: It's like their friends in senior management protect them when they are actually causing these problems to a big degree.

218
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,710
Speaker 0: It's the same reason someone doesn't kicked out, isn't kicked out of board game night.

219
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,272
Speaker 0: Yeah.

220
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,150
Speaker 0: And they're really shitty.

221
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,409
Speaker 0: You know, same same idea.

222
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:21,957
Speaker 0: But yeah.

223
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:23,210
Speaker 0: But the current executives.

224
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:23,853
Speaker 0: Right.

225
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:25,770
Speaker 0: They were they're taking the line.

226
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:26,212
Speaker 0: Right.

227
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,650
Speaker 0: The current executives, I think there's, you know, some of them recent hires.

228
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:32,010
Speaker 0: Wasn't there the person who used to work in like the Bush administration?

229
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,817
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

230
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:35,345
Speaker 1: I don't actually know all the I don't.

231
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,510
Speaker 1: I have no idea who are these.

232
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:44,169
Speaker 0: So when they hired these people, it already was looking bad because of the resumes of the people that they hired to replace the outgoing people.

233
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,390
Speaker 0: But yeah, they gave statements like denying that these things were true.

234
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:54,530
Speaker 0: And so the Blizzard employees, like hundreds of them, perhaps even like up to a thousand.

235
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:55,769
Speaker 1: So this is breaking news.

236
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,990
Speaker 1: Jason Schreier has been reporting on this pretty thoroughly.

237
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,004
Speaker 1: So I'll link to his they were.

238
00:15:59,024 --> 00:15:59,390
Speaker 0: All right.

239
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,310
Speaker 0: So they put out a letter like saying, that's a bunch of bullshit.

240
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,133
Speaker 0: This is right.

241
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:07,870
Speaker 0: They were the employees are siding with the state, which tells you that the state is right.

242
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:13,710
Speaker 0: And then tomorrow, Wednesday, the twenty eighth of July, they're just going to walk out.

243
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

244
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,010
Speaker 1: The employees are striking tomorrow.

245
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,693
Speaker 1: They're walking out.

246
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:21,230
Speaker 0: They don't have a union and they have reportedly not discussed making a union.

247
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:21,934
Speaker 0: They should.

248
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,768
Speaker 1: I think you're looking at the same source.

249
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:24,050
Speaker 1: I have.

250
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,270
Speaker 1: Schreier confirmed that they have not discussed a union.

251
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,149
Speaker 1: I think they probably should.

252
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,237
Speaker 0: Why aren't they?

253
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,670
Speaker 0: But they're walking out tomorrow.

254
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:31,652
Speaker 1: Yep.

255
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:38,050
Speaker 1: So they have issued some statements on Twitter, like the people who are organizing the walkout on how they want to be supported.

256
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:42,230
Speaker 1: And it seems to be double check all this because this situation is evolving.

257
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,390
Speaker 1: Like this is breaking news as of one p.m.

258
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,131
Speaker 1: Eastern today.

259
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:52,848
Speaker 1: But they do want people to not play Blizzard games tomorrow to log out of Blizzard and Activision Services to end.

260
00:16:52,868 --> 00:17:08,037
Speaker 1: a large number of gaming outlets have agreed to not cover any Blizzard or Activision games or news in any capacity, except as relating to the walkout, the strike and the harassment suits, including.

261
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:14,190
Speaker 1: I'm not going to play or talk about Overwatch or any of that stuff until this situation is resolved to my satisfaction.

262
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:22,829
Speaker 0: You know, if it would be, you know, if I ran Twitch or YouTube, I would if I was on Twitch, I would block streaming.

263
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:26,690
Speaker 0: If I ran if I ran packs, I would be like, you can't have a booth.

264
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,640
Speaker 0: You can't have a panel.

265
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,509
Speaker 0: It's like you can't come.

266
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:28,930
Speaker 0: Yeah.

267
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,856
Speaker 0: You know, it's like every.

268
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:35,250
Speaker 0: all the other gaming companies should like, you know, block them out.

269
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:41,750
Speaker 0: Be like, you know, if I was I guess they have their own thing, battle net, so they can't get kicked off of that.

270
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,349
Speaker 0: But if they were on Steam, Steam could be like, oh, we're not selling your games, taking them off.

271
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess if someone owns the game, they can still play them.

272
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,850
Speaker 0: But they go, we're going to kick you out of our store.

273
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:58,726
Speaker 0: We're going to, you know, basically, you know, and I think people should do that to, you know, that would be.

274
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,550
Speaker 0: that's like, you know, the minimum right.

275
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,769
Speaker 0: Is basically someone who got caught blocking them.

276
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:03,572
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:07,810
Speaker 0: I think that if I was if I had the power to do so, I would go one step further.

278
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,010
Speaker 0: And that one step would be like, hey, other game company to which there is no lawsuit or anything.

279
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,350
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to be you want to continue to be on our platform?

280
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:21,810
Speaker 0: Well, we're not playing the old innocent until proven guilty game anymore.

281
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:22,333
Speaker 0: Right.

282
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:25,950
Speaker 0: I need affirmative proof that your culture is wonderful or else.

283
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:33,163
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we need this actually so much like leads ratings for like building efficiency or ratings like.

284
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,870
Speaker 1: there's independent organizations in a lot of industries to rate things.

285
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:54,130
Speaker 1: We almost need a third party independent organization that rates the level of sexism, racism, et cetera, inside of the culture of game companies and certify or decertify them to attaining certain levels of like minimum professionalism.

286
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,390
Speaker 0: So then how do you how do you do that?

287
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,650
Speaker 0: Because when that inspector comes, it's not like when you the health inspector comes to a restaurant and looks around and this rat.

288
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,429
Speaker 1: Oh, there are a lot of ways to do this.

289
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,725
Speaker 0: Surprise, surprise.

290
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:06,150
Speaker 0: I'm here.

291
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,993
Speaker 0: I see the rats.

292
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:11,550
Speaker 0: If you go to a company, everyone sees you and now they're going to be on their best behavior.

293
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,270
Speaker 1: That's not how these things tend to work.

294
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:15,489
Speaker 1: So like unions have experience with this.

295
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,389
Speaker 1: Other industries have things like this.

296
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:28,264
Speaker 1: For example, one thing that has happened in other industries is when companies that do ratings along those lines are checking out a company to recertify them, they'll do things like.

297
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:32,530
Speaker 1: they get to come and talk to anyone they want to behind closed doors privately.

298
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:39,710
Speaker 1: They'll come and set up a system for people to anonymously report anything that they'd like to have looked into.

299
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,492
Speaker 1: Things like that.

300
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:45,030
Speaker 1: There are ways to protect the workers and also get this information.

301
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,650
Speaker 1: We need something because this is going to keep happening.

302
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,230
Speaker 1: And the response is always the same.

303
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,770
Speaker 1: The executives always say, we're sorry, we failed you, we need to do better, but they never do.

304
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:56,715
Speaker 0: That's only.

305
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,570
Speaker 0: that's only what the former executive saying.

306
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,010
Speaker 1: I know that's what's even worse.

307
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:05,190
Speaker 1: It's like Blizzard also own gold by trying to fight against this.

308
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,470
Speaker 1: Like, what do they think that all their employers are going to be like, oh, yeah, no, it's fine.

309
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,150
Speaker 1: Their employees are like, yeah, I didn't even report all my harassment.

310
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,218
Speaker 1: Here we go.

311
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:13,129
Speaker 1: Who can I call?

312
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,890
Speaker 0: If you work at Activision Blizzard, I'm sure you can call the state attorney general's office in California.

313
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,497
Speaker 0: They are proud.

314
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,629
Speaker 0: They're the ones bringing the suit.

315
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:24,390
Speaker 0: So I'm sure they would love to hear your story.

316
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,549
Speaker 1: There are also a number of journalistic outfits who have reached out and they have anonymous and protected avenues.

317
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:40,570
Speaker 1: If you work at Activision Blizzard, where you can tell your story with or without giving them your name and details and contribute to this investigation.

318
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:55,810
Speaker 0: And not to mention, if you're experiencing any sort of bullshit, not just, you know, workplace bullshit, but, you know, it could be work like landlord bullshit or any kind of bullshit that you feel is, you know, not cool.

319
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,130
Speaker 0: If it's the kind of thing where you have to sue on your own, OK, you have to sue on your own.

320
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:00,919
Speaker 0: But that's real hard.

321
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,629
Speaker 1: It really works.

322
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:02,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:13,570
Speaker 0: But this shows you that there are if it's something's criminal, like let's say your boss is doing wage theft or your landlord is not following your call.

324
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,049
Speaker 0: There is probably all your attorney general.

325
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:16,972
Speaker 0: Right.

326
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:21,150
Speaker 1: There is either an organization in your state like the thing that's going after Blizzard in this case.

327
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,190
Speaker 1: There are to call your attorney general.

328
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:27,510
Speaker 1: Even call not your senator, like that's a little bit like too small for them.

329
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:38,450
Speaker 1: But like your house rep, if they're a Democrat, at least, will like surprisingly often like help you out with shit like this, like way more than you would expect.

330
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,590
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of people that you can call.

331
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,290
Speaker 0: And even if they can't directly do anything, they can at least point you somewhere.

332
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:55,870
Speaker 0: So, you know, these the the state, you know, attorney generals of California didn't bring this case just out of nowhere.

333
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:56,215
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,228
Speaker 0: They heard about this.

335
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,210
Speaker 0: It's not like they're going and looking at every company, you know, companies in California and they're not looking at all of them constantly.

336
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,250
Speaker 0: Someone called them and told them this was going down.

337
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,346
Speaker 0: How else would they know?

338
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,438
Speaker 0: Right.

339
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:08,671
Speaker 1: Yep.

340
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:19,170
Speaker 1: So in some other news, because this is going to be an ongoing story and I encourage you to follow it, it looks like I guess Valve is releasing the Game Gear 2.

341
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,471
Speaker 0: Right.

342
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:25,390
Speaker 0: So Valve announced the people were upset with, you know, we already talked about the the the Switch upgrade.

343
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:32,770
Speaker 1: If you're mad that the new Switch is not 4K 60 FPS, you have no idea how technology works at all.

345
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,930
Speaker 1: It is literally impossible to do that.

346
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,710
Speaker 0: The they announced the Steam Deck and the Steam Deck is basically a Switch clone.

347
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:46,930
Speaker 0: But the idea is that it's a basic PC so it can run all every game that's on Steam because it's a PC.

348
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:58,210
Speaker 0: They just crammed a PC into the smallest rectangle they could with a screen on it, which is a pretty big and a slab, a slab controllers on the side and it's like ports on the top.

349
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,790
Speaker 0: So you could plug it into a monitor and use it as a, you know, because if you could use it as your gaming PC, if you wanted to.

350
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,694
Speaker 0: Right.

351
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,522
Speaker 0: And so, yeah, it's.

352
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,430
Speaker 0: if you look at picture, no one's held it.

353
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,412
Speaker 0: At least I haven't held it.

354
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:17,170
Speaker 0: So I can't say whether it's comfy or whatever, but I can tell you that looking at it, it doesn't look comfy.

355
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:20,070
Speaker 0: And the steam controller was a debacle.

356
00:23:20,513 --> 00:23:21,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

357
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,950
Speaker 0: So this doesn't look great.

358
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,569
Speaker 0: The thing that really stands out about being bad is that it has, you know, two like touch pads on.

359
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:28,473
Speaker 0: Yeah.

360
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:33,170
Speaker 1: Remember the touch pad they put on the steam controller that the touch pads and the steam controller weren't great.

361
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:40,210
Speaker 0: Even if these are as great as like the magic touch pads that Apple makes, you know, two of them, one on each thumb is not amazing.

362
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:46,570
Speaker 1: Also, what I don't like is the buttons and all the controls like like the actual like they're all way near the top and way near the edge.

363
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,138
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, like.

364
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:50,010
Speaker 0: I imagine I could be wrong.

365
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:54,189
Speaker 0: I could be wrong, but it doesn't look comfy.

366
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:03,570
Speaker 0: Two, just what I know about, you know, the world, it looks big and heavy.

367
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,730
Speaker 1: It does it and it weighs a little more than twice what a switch weighs.

368
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:16,330
Speaker 1: And already, you know, maybe because I'm approaching 40, but if I'm laying on my back, like in bed playing the switch, like up over my face, my arms get tired after an hour or so.

369
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:22,510
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could play an hour or so laying in my bed with something that weighs more than twice what a switch weighs.

370
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:25,810
Speaker 0: It doesn't weigh as much as a Game Gear, but it's close, right?

371
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kevion, we actually tried to look up how much a Game Gear weighs and literally every website I went to listed a different number.

372
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,930
Speaker 0: It also is going to depend on what batteries you put in the Game Gear.

373
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, this has built in batteries, so it's a little different.

374
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,609
Speaker 1: But we'll see.

375
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,570
Speaker 1: I'm not saying this is a bad device.

376
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,373
Speaker 1: I don't know.

377
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:47,030
Speaker 1: Valve has a mixed track record on hardware.

378
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,449
Speaker 0: Valve has never done well with hardware they've made on their own.

379
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,550
Speaker 1: So Valve VR hardware, best in breed.

380
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,436
Speaker 0: They didn't make that.

381
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,849
Speaker 0: HTC made it and they bought it.

382
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:56,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, true.

383
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:59,830
Speaker 1: But the hard but that's the their index.

384
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,800
Speaker 0: They didn't buy this.

385
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,409
Speaker 0: They made this.

386
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but their index VR that that was because it's theirs now is like best in breed bar.

387
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,349
Speaker 0: That's not hardware that they made.

388
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't that doesn't count.

389
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,470
Speaker 1: Maybe they got some of the work on this.

390
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,052
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know.

391
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:19,070
Speaker 0: The hardware that Valve has made on its own from nothing is all garbage.

392
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:22,010
Speaker 0: I think the more the problem I have link thing garbage.

393
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,189
Speaker 1: The problem I have here is more that garbage.

394
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:32,090
Speaker 1: Most of the games I at least play on Steam are PC games that kind of assume you're using a mouse and keyboard or like a joystick.

395
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,612
Speaker 0: Exactly.

396
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:34,254
Speaker 0: There is no.

397
00:25:34,354 --> 00:25:39,690
Speaker 0: if there there's basically no game on Steam that I want to play portably.

398
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,630
Speaker 1: That might be the only one.

399
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:42,153
Speaker 1: But you know what?

400
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:44,730
Speaker 1: I could also have had some switch like it's there and it's fine.

401
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:46,610
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

402
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,189
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I don't know.

403
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,570
Speaker 1: Although the listener actually points out something nobody can get fucking video cards.

404
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,005
Speaker 1: This thing actually might be a gaming PC for you if you.

405
00:25:58,025 --> 00:25:58,447
Speaker 1: so it's hard.

406
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,308
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

407
00:26:01,254 --> 00:26:02,869
Speaker 0: It could be a gaming PC for you.

408
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,890
Speaker 0: Valve claims that every game that they have tried on Steam runs on the Steam deck.

409
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:09,715
Speaker 0: All right.

410
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,205
Speaker 0: And that it runs at 30 FPS.

411
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,490
Speaker 0: However, they didn't say anything about the settings.

412
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:21,790
Speaker 0: So this means obviously they could get every any game they tried by adjusting the settings and turning down your graphics a whole bunch.

413
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,705
Speaker 0: You could eventually get it to run it at 30 FPS.

414
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:24,771
Speaker 0: Guess what?

415
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:30,025
Speaker 0: If you don't have a video card because video cards are expensive, you can buy like an Nvidia 770, right?

416
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:34,990
Speaker 0: A 8, 10 year old, who knows how old, right?

417
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:35,949
Speaker 0: A very old car.

418
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,910
Speaker 1: Those are actually weirdly hard to get right now because no one can get video cards.

419
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,202
Speaker 1: You realize Emily's using a 770 right now.

420
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,510
Speaker 1: That is the best we could get.

421
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:44,332
Speaker 0: Sure.

422
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:49,669
Speaker 0: But if you had a 770 and you turn the settings down, you could run every game at 30 FPS.

423
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,790
Speaker 0: You can get an integrated the integrated CPU video card.

424
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,590
Speaker 0: You're like the Intel IG, whatever it comes on.

425
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,090
Speaker 1: I play a lot of Steam games on my HDPC, which is very old.

426
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:02,817
Speaker 1: It has a GT450M in it.

427
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:12,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, a 450M can play just about every game at 30 FPS with the settings turned down.

428
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:15,010
Speaker 0: So it's not really that different.

429
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,910
Speaker 0: Just any video card you can get is going to be as good as this little thing.

430
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,570
Speaker 0: So there's no reason to buy this for its horsepower capabilities.

431
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,930
Speaker 0: The only reason you would buy this is your arms are super strong.

432
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,129
Speaker 0: For some reason, it's comfier than it looks.

433
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:35,970
Speaker 0: You want to really, really want to play PC games on the go and you don't have any other existing device that already does it.

434
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,270
Speaker 0: This really just seems bad.

435
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:42,187
Speaker 0: I was very shocked that people reacted positively to this in any way.

436
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,270
Speaker 0: It looks to me like a bunch of garbage.

437
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,630
Speaker 0: Like when I go, when I fly somewhere, like, you know, obviously I'm someone who's like the biggest Steam fanboy who's had Steam since the day Steam existed.

438
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:59,230
Speaker 1: I just have a laptop and I just plug a controller into a laptop and play them on like planes and things like or I have my Switch.

439
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,729
Speaker 0: Probably a better experience.

440
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,090
Speaker 1: Oh, almost definitely.

441
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,955
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

442
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,890
Speaker 0: I'm not going to preorder one of these.

443
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:10,269
Speaker 0: I'd love it to be proven wrong because, you know, but... If this thing is good, I'll probably buy one.

444
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,910
Speaker 0: I won't, but I still, I travel a lot.

445
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,170
Speaker 0: I'll acknowledge that it's good if I'm wrong, but I don't see any world in which I buy one, even if it's somehow perfect.

446
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,346
Speaker 1: Like once we're in a post-Covid world...

447
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,210
Speaker 0: I have no use for it.

448
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,390
Speaker 0: I have an iPad and a Switch.

449
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:24,869
Speaker 0: What the hell do I need another thing for?

450
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:31,030
Speaker 1: Like for me, once we're in a post-Covid world, like my normal life, not during a pandemic, is I travel a lot, like a lot lot.

451
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,109
Speaker 0: I have an iPad and a Switch and an upgraded GBA and a DS Lite and a 3DS.

452
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,348
Speaker 0: Why do I need this?

453
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:37,889
Speaker 0: Even if it's amazing.

454
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:48,290
Speaker 1: And so the other thing about it is the cheapest one, the $400 one, only has 64 gigabytes of space, which is like two games.

455
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,010
Speaker 0: You put in, you put an SD card in there.

456
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:54,110
Speaker 1: But also, at least it's, you know, it's very slow storage.

457
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,649
Speaker 1: You don't get NVMe, like you don't get real SSDs unless you buy the two big ones.

458
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,050
Speaker 0: So your load times will be slower, but that's not a big deal.

459
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,246
Speaker 0: You're already playing, you're already willing to play at 30 FPS.

460
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,810
Speaker 0: So who wouldn't care if the load times were lower?

461
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:06,840
Speaker 1: That's the other thing.

462
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,748
Speaker 1: Most PC games...

463
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,390
Speaker 0: It's not a magnetic spinning disk.

464
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,609
Speaker 0: It's still going to be fast enough.

465
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,489
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but here's the other problem.

466
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,390
Speaker 0: NVMe will just be a little bit faster.

467
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,130
Speaker 0: You probably might not even be able to tell the difference for most games.

468
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,390
Speaker 1: Most games I play on a PC assume I'm looking at a gigantic monitor of some kind.

469
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,710
Speaker 1: I'm very curious how many games are actually playable and readable on this tiny screen.

470
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could like play Civ on this, but it wouldn't be...

471
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,290
Speaker 1: Without a mouse, using those tiny little touch pads.

472
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:35,670
Speaker 0: I think you're better off buying Civ VI for iPad.

473
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,129
Speaker 0: Than, you know, buying it.

474
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:40,570
Speaker 0: But then again, if you play it on here, you don't have to buy it again.

475
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,249
Speaker 0: If I want to play Civ VI on iPad, I have to buy it again.

476
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:47,050
Speaker 0: But here, it's like it's your existing Steam libraries.

477
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,549
Speaker 0: You want it to buy games again.

478
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,030
Speaker 0: And that is, I think, the one big selling point of this.

479
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:55,150
Speaker 0: Is that since it's your Steam library, you've already bought the games.

480
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:00,030
Speaker 0: Whereas if you were to buy a Switch, or an iPad, or whatever other gaming device.

481
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:02,109
Speaker 0: You don't have any software to start with.

482
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:06,970
Speaker 0: So if I had a Steam deck, I could just play Quake immediately.

483
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,168
Speaker 1: Now, here's the other thing.

484
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,510
Speaker 1: This news came out, you can sign up for reservations.

485
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:19,530
Speaker 1: You realize this shit is not available until at the earliest Q2 2022.

486
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,408
Speaker 1: We're talking a year from now.

487
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:24,389
Speaker 0: Less than a year from now.

488
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:25,369
Speaker 1: A little less than a year.

489
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,828
Speaker 0: Three, eight, you know.

490
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:31,130
Speaker 1: Q2, so April, May, early April at the earliest.

491
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,029
Speaker 1: Or like April, like June-ish.

492
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, eight or nine months.

493
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:35,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, not twelve.

494
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,349
Speaker 1: That's a pretty long, like, at that point I'll just wait and see.

495
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, this thing will look sadder then than it does now, right?

496
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,290
Speaker 0: Because there'll be nine other months of stuff getting better.

497
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,110
Speaker 1: Yup, by then, who knows?

498
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,370
Speaker 1: By then you might have like a more, a Switch Pro Pro.

499
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,690
Speaker 1: Like who even knows what's going to happen?

500
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:53,148
Speaker 0: Not that soon.

501
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,940
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

502
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,820
Speaker 1: So we haven't played it much lately.

503
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,520
Speaker 1: We've just been busy.

504
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,379
Speaker 1: But Star Wars Squadrons, fucking fantastic game.

505
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,539
Speaker 1: Like utterly fantastic game.

506
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:16,078
Speaker 1: Works with VR, like perfectly, but also is totally fine with the same interface if you don't do VR.

507
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,939
Speaker 1: Like it's a perfect, perfect store.

508
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:36,080
Speaker 1: Motive has published an article that goes into extreme depth on how they did this and also how they made a VR game that is so accessible and involves so little, like it doesn't cause motion sickness.

509
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,060
Speaker 1: All the problems you expect from VR aren't there in a game where you're flying around at breakneck speed in a spaceship.

510
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,940
Speaker 1: They actually go into specific details on how they made that happen.

511
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,900
Speaker 1: Like here is the exact things they did to make this work.

512
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:52,260
Speaker 1: And this article is just phenomenal.

513
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,340
Speaker 1: It goes into a level of depth that I was surprised they posted publicly.

514
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:07,572
Speaker 1: And if you are even remotely interested in VR games of any kind, especially from a development standpoint, this is a must read series of articles, little things like.

515
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,660
Speaker 1: I'll give you a tiny example.

516
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:20,840
Speaker 1: They if you notice when you play Star Wars Squadrons, when you turn in any direction, like you're rotating your ship, the pivot point is around your head, not the center of the ship.

517
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,689
Speaker 1: And this article explains why.

518
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:29,140
Speaker 1: one of those causes extreme vomit and the other one causes zero discomfort.

519
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:32,260
Speaker 1: It's just a really, really neat article.

520
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,159
Speaker 0: But of course, that's not real.

521
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Speaker 0: If you were in a real ship, it would pivot around itself and not your head.

522
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,039
Speaker 1: But also if they're spaceships, so.

523
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:42,261
Speaker 0: Right.

524
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:48,936
Speaker 0: But also, if you were to design a ship for a human to fly, you would have it move in such a way, right?

525
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,819
Speaker 0: You would design the ship so that maybe your head is near the center of gravity.

526
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,287
Speaker 1: You don't need to, though.

527
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:55,639
Speaker 0: The only reason you don't need to.

528
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:56,864
Speaker 1: You don't need to.

529
00:32:56,904 --> 00:33:07,339
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is the only reason you do this in VR is because one of the things that causes motion sickness is when your brain detects certain kinds of motion through your eyes.

530
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,980
Speaker 1: But your inner ear says, hold up, slow down, buckaroo.

531
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,268
Speaker 1: I didn't feel that.

532
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,779
Speaker 1: You must be poisoned.

533
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:17,320
Speaker 1: Pretty literally, it's like, well, something's wrong.

534
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,800
Speaker 1: You'd better vomit because you must have eaten something bad like that is.

535
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:22,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is literally part of what's going on.

536
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:24,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

537
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:30,003
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying, you know, X-wings and TIE fighters are not realistic designs.

538
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:35,560
Speaker 0: And if the designs of the ships were different, you may not have to do some of the things that they have done.

539
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,438
Speaker 1: That is true as well.

540
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,927
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

541
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,213
Speaker 0: So I learned today.

542
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:43,679
Speaker 0: you probably you might have already known about this, but I did not.

543
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:45,520
Speaker 1: So I did not know about this.

544
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,020
Speaker 1: I just came through this video.

545
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,459
Speaker 1: I played a similar game in like long ago, but not not this.

546
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:56,804
Speaker 0: So there's a game I heard about today, which it seems like such an obvious game.

547
00:33:56,925 --> 00:33:58,640
Speaker 0: How could I not have known about this game?

548
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:01,700
Speaker 0: It's called Foot Down, and it's a real simple game.

549
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,943
Speaker 0: Everyone gets on their bicycles and you ride in a circle within a restricted area.

550
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:09,659
Speaker 1: It's got to be a small area or this would be dangerous as fuck.

551
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:16,467
Speaker 0: And this is a beautiful game because the way it works is it's basically impossible.

552
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,340
Speaker 0: You don't need a referee.

553
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:19,199
Speaker 0: You don't need penalties.

554
00:34:19,462 --> 00:34:21,900
Speaker 0: It's like it's just a perfect, beautiful game.

555
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:22,603
Speaker 0: So simple.

556
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,540
Speaker 0: You bike around in a circle and then you start.

557
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:29,498
Speaker 0: And if you put your foot down on the ground, you're out.

558
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:34,580
Speaker 0: Or if you leave the bounds of the game area, you're also out.

559
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:36,380
Speaker 0: And the last person remaining wins.

560
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:44,108
Speaker 0: The only thing you might need to make this game perfect would be to have like, you know, a video for instant replay in case two people put their foot down, like at the same time.

561
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,480
Speaker 0: And they're the last two people.

562
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:48,639
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if they're not the last two people, right?

563
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:50,539
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who was who went out first.

564
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,918
Speaker 0: It only matters if the two or the most extreme to call.

565
00:34:56,081 --> 00:35:02,320
Speaker 1: You could have something like if it were an Olympic sport, like with fencing, have sensors on the shoes that detect the slightest touch on the ground.

566
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:03,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

567
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,360
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's a beautiful, beautiful game.

568
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,312
Speaker 0: I didn't know existed.

569
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:06,880
Speaker 0: You know, right.

570
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,048
Speaker 1: It looks super fun.

571
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:09,399
Speaker 1: I legit want to play it.

572
00:35:10,123 --> 00:35:11,980
Speaker 0: In this video, they discuss variants.

573
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:19,640
Speaker 0: They say that like in professional, like top tier foot down, if you when you put your foot down, you leave your bicycle behind to create an obstacle.

574
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:25,740
Speaker 0: But some people don't do that because it could be a threat to to their bicycle.

575
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:29,000
Speaker 0: But they say that in their games, they've only had minor bicycle.

576
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:37,419
Speaker 1: I can say like because you've never been mountain biking, a bike, a mountain bike will survive pretty much anything except landing on another mountain bike.

577
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are playing on mountain bikes.

578
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,999
Speaker 0: I feel like this would be better off playing on it.

579
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,979
Speaker 0: This actually would be a good use for a fixie.

580
00:35:45,201 --> 00:35:47,679
Speaker 0: I feel like you want like a mountain fixie.

581
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,281
Speaker 1: Yeah, because then you can race against the pedals and that also braces your rear wheel.

582
00:35:53,964 --> 00:36:00,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in a way in this video, this with a couple of years old and has a ton of views that you are taught the game.

583
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:04,500
Speaker 0: They show you a lot of interesting gameplay out in the square driveway.

584
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:10,960
Speaker 0: And they also build a battle bike with which to, you know, play foot down with.

585
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:14,099
Speaker 0: So I'm liking this foot down.

586
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:14,582
Speaker 0: I don't.

587
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:19,980
Speaker 0: The only thing stopping me from playing it is that I already own two bicycles, none of which are any good for playing foot down with.

588
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,160
Speaker 0: I would need a third bicycle.

589
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:29,042
Speaker 1: This reminds me a lot of Luke Burge's the Friday night fight, like competitive versus juggling.

590
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:35,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's very similar, you know, in its format of, you know, eliminating people.

591
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:36,204
Speaker 0: Right.

592
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,280
Speaker 0: You juggle and you know, when you lose it, you lose a club.

593
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:39,621
Speaker 0: That's it.

594
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:40,083
Speaker 0: You're out.

595
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:43,220
Speaker 1: It's also very Smash Brothers adjacent in that regard.

596
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,700
Speaker 1: It's like you could be just stay away from everyone.

597
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,140
Speaker 0: I mean, elimination is a great game format.

598
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:55,220
Speaker 0: You know, just look at pub G's and Fortnite and whatever is, you know, those just took it to the next level by having one hundred people.

599
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,437
Speaker 0: It's like, why not have one hundred people play foot down in a field?

600
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,543
Speaker 1: This would be.

601
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:02,925
Speaker 0: And then the problem is, as people get eliminated, the field gets, you know, is still big.

602
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:05,120
Speaker 0: You need to shrink the field, which is what PUBG does.

603
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,883
Speaker 0: It's real.

604
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:10,240
Speaker 1: So I think this would be very hard to play on a road bike.

605
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:12,260
Speaker 0: Uh, impossible.

606
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,138
Speaker 0: You need a mountain bike or a fixie or something like something.

607
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,999
Speaker 0: You can lower your center of gravity, something that can take some bonks.

608
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,688
Speaker 1: Well, like a real mountain bikes, you can hit a button and your seat just retracts down like out of your way.

609
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:25,719
Speaker 1: You'd want something like that.

610
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,163
Speaker 0: You could do that.

611
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,720
Speaker 0: But yeah, like, you know, a road bike is unstable when not at speed.

612
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like an F-16 like road bikes.

613
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:37,240
Speaker 0: I worry you could play this obviously with BMX bikes.

614
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:38,538
Speaker 0: That would be very easy to do.

615
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,961
Speaker 0: You know, you get pegs and everything you could stand on, you know, do all kinds of stuff.

616
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:45,641
Speaker 0: But that might actually be too easy and too hard to force people to put their foot down.

617
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:49,064
Speaker 1: You'd have to attack people more aggressively, which could lead to more injuries with the BMX bike.

618
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:52,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think BMX would be a little more dangerous if you're doing it that way.

619
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:54,060
Speaker 0: But certainly viable, you know.

620
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,800
Speaker 1: But also, you know what this fits into, because again, you have a really mountain bike.

621
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,880
Speaker 0: Well, if you used BMX bikes, you could play on like one of those BMX, like a skate park or BMX park and get ramps going.

622
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,200
Speaker 0: And you go up a ramp, come down and slam into somebody.

623
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that gets to that injury city.

624
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:13,340
Speaker 1: So another reason why this works so well for mountain bikes and the reason it works so well as a sport, because again, you've never mountain bike.

625
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:23,260
Speaker 1: One of the main things you do to practice and get good at technical mountain biking is biking extremely slowly over like very specific obstacles like biking.

626
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,281
Speaker 1: Being able to stop and just stand on your bike with no trouble is a skill you need to have.

627
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:32,720
Speaker 1: Being able to hop up on just your front wheel, hop up and just your rear wheel.

628
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,518
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of drills I had to do back when I mountain biked like.

629
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:36,885
Speaker 1: that's the kind of stuff I can't.

630
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:37,809
Speaker 1: actually really I can't.

631
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:39,919
Speaker 1: there is there is no way I could.

632
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:43,920
Speaker 1: there is no possibility I could get on my front wheel on my hybrid bike safely.

633
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,199
Speaker 1: I would hurt myself immediately if I tried to do that.

634
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,087
Speaker 0: I can't do it.

635
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:48,119
Speaker 0: It's not the right job.

636
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,192
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to try it.

637
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:49,680
Speaker 1: I think I would.

638
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,060
Speaker 1: I think I might be able to barely do it for like 10 seconds at most.

639
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:04,208
Speaker 0: I mean, I think we've done things of the day showing trials biking people who are like, you know, bouncing all basically doing parkour with their bike, riding on really thin rails, bouncing all around that

640
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:09,018
Speaker 1: you do that slow as practice to be able to do it fast when you're mountain biking where now it's life or death.

641
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:10,504
Speaker 1: Hmm.

642
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:12,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, I want to play the shit out of the sport.

643
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,226
Speaker 1: This looks so fun.

644
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,520
Speaker 0: It's going to be hard to get a game of foot down together.

645
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,239
Speaker 1: Why don't we just get some shitty mountain bikes and play it ourselves?

646
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:23,037
Speaker 0: I'm talking like, well, now it's like, where am I going to put it?

647
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,380
Speaker 1: So our bike room is pretty much empty at this point, like for some reason.

648
00:39:27,841 --> 00:39:28,851
Speaker 0: Well, then go buy go.

649
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:29,840
Speaker 0: You go use your money.

650
00:39:29,923 --> 00:39:30,480
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

651
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,560
Speaker 1: Even like I got some bike work done recently.

652
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:35,800
Speaker 1: The every bike shop is out of parts.

653
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,890
Speaker 1: No one can get anything.

654
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,780
Speaker 1: No one can get new bikes.

655
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,799
Speaker 1: Like there is a bike supply chain crisis going on right now.

656
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,020
Speaker 0: So everything's supply chain crisis.

657
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

658
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,359
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what.

659
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,559
Speaker 1: Once the supply chain crisis is down and like we're post covid.

660
00:39:47,942 --> 00:39:48,268
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

661
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:49,000
Speaker 0: So twenty thirty.

662
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,380
Speaker 1: Yeah.

663
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:49,521
Speaker 1: Like.

664
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:53,320
Speaker 1: I will at that point look into getting to like piece of shit mountain bikes.

665
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,418
Speaker 1: Like I'm talking like like my old research.

666
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:58,640
Speaker 0: We can find some New York City foot down league.

667
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:00,960
Speaker 1: The two of us should go play it.

668
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,599
Speaker 1: If that is the case, I'll get us some shitty mountain bikes and we'll go.

669
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,160
Speaker 1: I'm talking like some 90s Schwinn mountain bikes like hardtails.

670
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,399
Speaker 0: New York City.

671
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:13,918
Speaker 1: In fact, I bet a hardtail would almost be easier depending.

672
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:19,598
Speaker 1: I can already think of ways I might customize a bike that would almost be cheating to be better at this.

673
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:24,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm like I'm looking for if there's a foot down meet up.

674
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:24,823
Speaker 1: All right.

675
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:26,140
Speaker 1: Well, you look that up in the moment.

676
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:28,819
Speaker 1: The Geek Nights Book Club book, The Tale of Genji.

677
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,540
Speaker 1: I'm actually plugging along as Genji sleepwalks through his life.

678
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,689
Speaker 0: You just say you're going to say that.

679
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:38,220
Speaker 0: you're just going to say that every time because Genji doesn't grow or change as a person.

680
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,200
Speaker 0: As far as I can see, every single episode, sleepwalk through life.

681
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:41,663
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:42,440
Speaker 0: Say that over and over.

683
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:45,700
Speaker 1: Well, what I'm curious about is I'm about to be out of town.

684
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,955
Speaker 1: There won't be any geek nights next week.

685
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:48,730
Speaker 0: Oh, good.

686
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,800
Speaker 0: I'll have time to do other things.

687
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm going to have a lot of time to read more Genji.

688
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,679
Speaker 1: I want to see if Genji grows as a person at any point.

689
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:58,431
Speaker 1: And I'm hoping I'll read enough in one.

690
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:04,019
Speaker 1: go to encounter Genji becoming a better person or a worse person or worse person would also be interesting.

691
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,177
Speaker 1: But you should read The Tale of Genji.

692
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:10,219
Speaker 1: one, because we're going to finish it before around the end of summer and do a show on it.

693
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:13,840
Speaker 1: Two, it's the first novel ever written by a human.

694
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,780
Speaker 1: I feel like you should read.

695
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,260
Speaker 1: You should try to experience the first of anything just to know where things came from.

696
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,600
Speaker 1: We've said that before about anime, like watch Astro Boy.

697
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,760
Speaker 1: We've said that about comics.

698
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,720
Speaker 1: We've said about video games like play Pong.

699
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:38,301
Speaker 1: I know there were games before Pong, but anyway, but two, we will not be at PAX West 2021.

700
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:43,699
Speaker 1: I mean, actually post an announcement about that, partly because I mean, we sort of announced that already.

701
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:52,668
Speaker 1: We've announced it several times on the show, but I'm going to make a new like an official post about it, because I've noticed something over the years at PAX is a lot of people like

702
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:53,010
Speaker 0: the

703
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,920
Speaker 1: average geek nights fan does not listen to the geek nights podcast, does not engage in the geek nights community, does not go to the geek nights website.

704
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:05,520
Speaker 1: So of course, we'll be out of PAX and a lot of people will see us and just walk up, be like, oh, we just got a big fan.

705
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:07,679
Speaker 1: Are you doing anything at this PAX?

706
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,158
Speaker 1: Like, what's your panel this year?

707
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,419
Speaker 1: Like we post this shit.

708
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:13,039
Speaker 1: I know you don't read it like it's.

709
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:18,120
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I want to make it abundantly clear that we are not going to be there because we think it is unsafe.

710
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,236
Speaker 1: We are like we are not attending PAX West because we don't think it's going to be safe to go to.

711
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:24,050
Speaker 0: The policy is still the same, right?

712
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:25,841
Speaker 0: They did.

713
00:42:25,982 --> 00:42:28,900
Speaker 0: PAX did, to their credit, change their policy.

714
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:38,480
Speaker 0: They are now going to require that everyone at PAX either has been vaccinated or has, I guess, a recent ish negative test.

715
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:40,260
Speaker 0: I don't know how they're going to check for these things.

716
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,060
Speaker 1: There are some like in New York State, there's a way to check for that.

717
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:43,712
Speaker 1: But I don't know about.

718
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:44,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

719
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,820
Speaker 1: But the point is, with people flying there, how are you going to do?

720
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,880
Speaker 0: Regardless, that's their new policy.

721
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,260
Speaker 0: Because that is a load bearing or sure, that is an improvement over the policy they had before.

722
00:42:57,844 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 0: But it's just not good enough, right?

723
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,840
Speaker 0: It's it is not safe to have the packs at this time, in my opinion.

724
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:09,780
Speaker 1: And especially because it's 30 days out and Delta's getting worse.

725
00:43:10,122 --> 00:43:17,960
Speaker 0: When we say I don't want anyone to be confused when we say we're not going to a convention with, you know, a mask or a social distancing requirement.

726
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:32,880
Speaker 0: That is not because we believe that those things are ineffective or we don't want to comply with those things, because most people who would say, right, I'm not going somewhere where I got to wear a mask are, you know, anti-vaxx, bad people, you know, get them out of here.

727
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:34,839
Speaker 0: If you're one of those people, stop listening to this show.

728
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:52,940
Speaker 0: When we say that, we're saying, look, if it's not safe enough in the world for us to have a large gathering with no masks and no special social distancing requirements, then it is, in our opinion, not safe enough to have a large gathering period.

729
00:43:53,501 --> 00:44:03,700
Speaker 0: So if there is a large gathering, I will not go to it, regardless of what the, you know, you know, it's like, oh, you could if they had kit packs and said no masks.

730
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:04,482
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:08,520
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, I still wouldn't go because it's not safe enough.

732
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Speaker 0: It's not safe enough to go without the mask.

733
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:13,800
Speaker 0: So it's not safe enough to go, period.

734
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:24,100
Speaker 1: So to be abundantly specifically clear, geek nights will not appear at or attend any convention where masks and/or social distancing measures are prudent and necessary.

735
00:44:25,342 --> 00:44:27,459
Speaker 1: If they are prudent and necessary, the con should not happen.

736
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:36,200
Speaker 1: In one last little bit, our panel from the last PAX online can't PAX, which was a fantastic event.

737
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,160
Speaker 0: We can go to online PAX, no problem.

738
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:38,725
Speaker 0: Very safe.

739
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,160
Speaker 0: It was a really safe to go to online.

740
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,699
Speaker 1: It was actually a really good online PAX.

741
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:42,740
Speaker 1: Like, I had a lot of fun with it.

742
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,099
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of panels I still got to watch vods of.

743
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,759
Speaker 0: But our panel... I still got to watch the keynote with the jackbox.

744
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:49,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

745
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:50,540
Speaker 1: You saw they're selling a TKO shirt.

746
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,500
Speaker 1: That's all the TKO characters, like the monsters.

747
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:55,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a really good shirt.

748
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,440
Speaker 1: But our panel is on YouTube.

749
00:44:58,923 --> 00:44:59,429
Speaker 1: We'll link to it.

750
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,260
Speaker 1: Atari Game Design.

751
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,329
Speaker 1: The people who watch the panel live with us and the Discord and on Twitch, we're super chill.

752
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,540
Speaker 1: People ask really good questions.

753
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,940
Speaker 1: These online PAXes, like the people who ask questions in the chat.

754
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:13,120
Speaker 1: Why aren't you people at real PAXes asking those questions?

755
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,680
Speaker 1: Why are the questions from the audience at PAX the worst possible questions?

756
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,606
Speaker 0: Because at PAX online is obviously only the people who are like super pet.

757
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:23,740
Speaker 0: They care a lot.

758
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,480
Speaker 0: So you're going to get a better, you know, selection.

759
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:30,700
Speaker 0: Whereas at regular PAX, you got people who just walked in, you know, off the whatever.

760
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,101
Speaker 1: Yep.

761
00:45:32,624 --> 00:45:35,020
Speaker 1: So that panel, Atari Game Design is just on YouTube.

762
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,198
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

763
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:37,900
Speaker 1: I think I linked to the slides.

764
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:39,239
Speaker 1: I linked to the list of the games.

765
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:49,100
Speaker 1: And if you don't, even if you don't watch it, the thing I do want to tell you, go find a ROM of an Atari game called Pitfall 2.

766
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:58,296
Speaker 1: Because if you've never heard of this game and have no idea what the deal is, you will be like shocked that this is a game that was literally on an Atari 2600 cartridge.

767
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,162
Speaker 1: It is.

768
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:02,339
Speaker 1: it is amazing that this game exists.

769
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:12,503
Speaker 1: And that said, Pokemon Unite, the fact that a Pokemon MOBA was announced actually got me pretty excited.

770
00:46:13,006 --> 00:46:17,026
Speaker 0: We did talk about this when it was news, we said, hey, they announced a Pokemon MOBA.

771
00:46:17,146 --> 00:46:19,180
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's going to be a real thing.

772
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:24,064
Speaker 0: And I completely forgot about it until it came out and a couple of came out, I guess, within the week.

773
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:24,549
Speaker 0: Right.

774
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:25,559
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe a week ago.

775
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,080
Speaker 1: I played enough matches to be able to play ranked competitive Pokemon Unite.

776
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:37,680
Speaker 0: As soon as a couple of days after it came out, I played it and then I played it again yesterday and now I'm ready to discuss.

777
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:51,400
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this Pokemon MOBA, it actually has at the core of the gameplay, is actually a great idea and a great mechanic that improves MOBA significantly.

778
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:59,520
Speaker 0: It works is you, your Pokemon and you go around the map and you do, I guess, in other MOBA's, it's called jungling.

779
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,017
Speaker 0: But basically you're doing PvE.

780
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,760
Speaker 0: You're fighting these Pokemon that are just on the map.

781
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,820
Speaker 1: They kind of just stand there and let you.

782
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't really fight back too hard.

783
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,465
Speaker 0: Some of them do the strong ones, but yeah, you're basically you can just beat up on them pretty easily.

784
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:14,759
Speaker 0: You beat up on them and you collect little jemmies.

785
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:24,200
Speaker 0: But, you know, and then what you have to do is you go to the enemy territory and you there are these rings like basketball hoops, basically basketball hoops.

786
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:27,200
Speaker 0: You slam dunk your points that you've collected.

787
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Speaker 0: You haven't collected any points.

788
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,540
Speaker 0: There's no there's no reason to dunk.

789
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,428
Speaker 0: There's no point like right.

790
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:36,120
Speaker 0: You collect victory points, but then you have to go into enemy territory to score them.

791
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:42,202
Speaker 0: And that mechanic alone is solves a lot of what I would all complain about with MOBAs, right?

792
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:43,380
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, you're playing Dota.

793
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:46,960
Speaker 0: The goal is to destroy this ancient thing in the in the back.

794
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:51,660
Speaker 0: OK, I'll go directly to the ancient thing and try to score right away by damaging it.

795
00:47:51,983 --> 00:47:53,500
Speaker 0: That doesn't do shit, right?

796
00:47:53,722 --> 00:47:55,840
Speaker 0: That's an awful idea in Dota, right?

797
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:57,580
Speaker 0: To score points is a bad idea.

798
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,764
Speaker 0: What kind of stupid game.

799
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:03,020
Speaker 1: the last hit and he got a mic and poke right in Pokemon Unite.

800
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,240
Speaker 0: You can score points immediately.

801
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:08,100
Speaker 0: It is in your best interest to score points immediately.

802
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,220
Speaker 0: You're always trying.

803
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:16,280
Speaker 0: If you want to win, you are effectively either always scoring points or defending and preventing the other team from scoring points.

804
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,540
Speaker 1: You're always leveling up faster than that.

805
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:25,440
Speaker 0: And if you are right, if you're playing competitively, you are focused on scoring from the beginning to the end of the match.

806
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:31,600
Speaker 0: And secondly, the match will always be assuming the team doesn't forfeit, which can happen.

807
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:37,240
Speaker 1: So I looked at my stats almost every match I played where we won the enemy team forfeit.

808
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:38,495
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

809
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:41,286
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

810
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,540
Speaker 0: The game is exactly 10 minutes long.

811
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:47,640
Speaker 0: All the other MOBAs, they could end quickly if a team gets routed.

812
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,939
Speaker 0: They could go long, but they're usually 40 minutes ish.

813
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,201
Speaker 0: Right.

814
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:52,460
Speaker 0: Ten minute battles.

815
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,260
Speaker 0: That is like a really good time.

816
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,552
Speaker 0: I don't know.

817
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:56,440
Speaker 1: Playing it was fun.

818
00:48:56,841 --> 00:49:01,843
Speaker 0: The game's long enough that you had a substantial game that wasn't just, you know, over too quickly.

819
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:03,920
Speaker 0: But it's not so long that it drags out.

820
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,040
Speaker 0: It is a very nice time length for this type of game.

821
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,340
Speaker 0: Yep.

822
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:09,246
Speaker 0: Great.

823
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:14,020
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is, the game is still a MOBA.

824
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,142
Speaker 0: So you're sort

825
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:31,460
Speaker 1: of a little bit different here in that it's definitely simpler in terms of how you interact with the game, how you would do like a lot of MOBAs that like your characters have a like, depending on what attack you're using, you'll really only have three different attacks equipped at any given time.

826
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,040
Speaker 0: The biggest the biggest simplification is simply that there's no item shop or whatever.

827
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,200
Speaker 1: It's well, there's not there is, but outside of the match.

828
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,742
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

829
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,918
Speaker 0: There's no item shop while you're playing the match.

830
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:42,842
Speaker 0: Right.

831
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:47,342
Speaker 0: Which is usually the most complicated and most significant part of your Dodas in your roles.

832
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,959
Speaker 1: You just have the item or items you pick before the match and that's it.

833
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,009
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that.

834
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:53,818
Speaker 0: You're getting ahead of yourself.

835
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:54,720
Speaker 0: Right.

836
00:49:55,303 --> 00:50:00,060
Speaker 0: So your Pokemon and it's Pokemon is like the perfect thing for a mobile.

837
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,069
Speaker 0: You have so many characters.

838
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,180
Speaker 0: You have so many only Pokemon.

839
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:03,476
Speaker 0: There are hundreds of Pokemon.

840
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:03,800
Speaker 0: Right.

841
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:04,447
Speaker 0: No problem.

842
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:05,439
Speaker 0: And you pick your Pokemon.

843
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:08,700
Speaker 0: You start out as a low, unevolved Pokemon.

844
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,080
Speaker 0: I think Gengar, but I started out as fucking, you know, a little ghastly guy.

845
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:17,380
Speaker 0: And then you you level up over the course of the match, like you do in a MOBA.

846
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,479
Speaker 1: And they have 16 to start like Absol's there, Lucario, Venusaur, like it's a good mix.

847
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, they got enough Pokemon where it's interesting and they're already adding a Pokemon.

848
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:30,080
Speaker 0: So they're not wasting any time in increasing the number of Pokemon.

849
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,360
Speaker 1: Not that you can play with all these Pokemon right away, but I'm getting ahead of myself again.

850
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:34,462
Speaker 0: You are.

851
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:39,680
Speaker 0: You pick a Pokemon, you start out unevolved, you level up, you evolve.

852
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:40,343
Speaker 0: Right.

853
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:42,579
Speaker 0: And that makes it easier to kill enemies.

854
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,944
Speaker 1: Real fun.

855
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:48,620
Speaker 1: Like you get your first level real quick unless you are like terrible at this game.

856
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,420
Speaker 1: And you basically every time you level up, like you'll learn a new move.

857
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:58,840
Speaker 1: And once you've got two moves, you can choose to replace one of your moves with another move or just keep the move you already got.

858
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:01,540
Speaker 1: And the moves are all like pretty radically different.

859
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,425
Speaker 0: Very Pokemon-esque.

860
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:06,800
Speaker 0: The moves are very interesting, but also very easy to understand.

861
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:08,150
Speaker 0: You're playing the MOBA.

862
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,080
Speaker 0: It can't be overstated.

863
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:16,560
Speaker 0: You're playing this MOBA on the Switch using twin stick and buttons, which is the way all MOBA's should have been controlled.

864
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:19,460
Speaker 0: The RTS controls in MOBA's are nonsense.

865
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,404
Speaker 0: There's no reason that that's the way.

866
00:51:21,424 --> 00:51:24,333
Speaker 0: a game where you control an individual unit is the.

867
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:26,360
Speaker 0: you would use mouse and keyboard RTS.

868
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,360
Speaker 1: You could just skip the tutorial, dive into this game, mash buttons and you'll figure it out in like 30 seconds.

869
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,360
Speaker 0: The only reason MOBA's are controlled that way is because the first MOBA's were Warcraft 3 mods.

870
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:36,945
Speaker 0: Right.

871
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,540
Speaker 0: And so that they controlled that way.

872
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:42,960
Speaker 0: That is a dumb control scheme, right, for controlling a single character.

873
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,680
Speaker 0: The twin stick gamepad control is perfect for this kind of game.

874
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:48,739
Speaker 0: It always has been.

875
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:55,140
Speaker 0: I don't know why Dota and LoL should change their controls to be gamepad based, but Pokemon's doing it the right way.

876
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,651
Speaker 0: So that's pretty much the.

877
00:51:57,711 --> 00:51:59,500
Speaker 0: I guess there's a few other positive things.

878
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,360
Speaker 0: There's some interesting mechanics in the game.

879
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:06,760
Speaker 1: The mechanics I want to call out because we're not going to explain everything in the game because there's a lot of things in the game to explain.

880
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,668
Speaker 1: The mechanics that are really interesting.

881
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:11,460
Speaker 1: that I think are also improvements on the MOBA format.

882
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,720
Speaker 1: So this is similar, other MOBA's do a similar thing.

883
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:21,480
Speaker 1: If you score enough points in one of the hoops, you blow that hoop up and your team kind of controls that area more now.

884
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,480
Speaker 0: So that's effectively similar to like destroying towers in a MOBA, like pressuring a lane.

885
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,989
Speaker 1: But it also means you can't just milk one tower.

886
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:32,000
Speaker 1: You've got to like diversify and go attack something else at some point.

887
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:40,080
Speaker 0: Now the towers, the hoops behind each hoop is this sort of speed lane that goes back to your base along the road.

888
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,460
Speaker 1: So you can get back to your defensive zone way faster.

889
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,460
Speaker 0: Well, right.

890
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,480
Speaker 0: When you're in your side of the map in your speed lanes, you go faster.

891
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:53,120
Speaker 0: If you're behind an enemy hoop in their speed lane, you go slower.

892
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,120
Speaker 0: But if you destroy a hoop, you're destroying the speed lane behind it until the next hoop.

893
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:04,160
Speaker 0: So when you destroy a hoop, scoring more points means you're going to have to go deeper into enemy territory.

894
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:10,520
Speaker 0: But you'll be able to get into deeper into enemy territory easier because the slowdown lane is gone.

895
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:17,980
Speaker 0: And also the enemies will have a harder time getting out of their lane, you know, into your territory because they lost their speed up zone.

896
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,399
Speaker 1: But there's still two lanes, like there's hoops on either side.

897
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,100
Speaker 1: Like there's two lanes and then a jungle in the middle.

898
00:53:22,522 --> 00:53:24,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you take out the top hoop, you don't have to go deep.

899
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:30,140
Speaker 1: You take out the bottom hoop, but they take out the top hoop and you're still like pretty evenly matched.

900
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,900
Speaker 0: There's also a little springboard.

901
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,419
Speaker 0: So if you die and respawn, you can step on the springboard to sort of jump out into the battlefield quickly.

902
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,540
Speaker 1: It took me a second to figure out the controls for that.

903
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,700
Speaker 1: It actually wasn't that intuitive.

904
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:42,060
Speaker 0: It's not that intuitive.

905
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:44,280
Speaker 0: It's kind of a little bit annoying if you use the right stick.

906
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,420
Speaker 0: It's good to me, but it's at least the mechanically.

907
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:46,780
Speaker 0: It's good.

908
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,820
Speaker 0: The other interesting mechanic that I like is that sometimes at the top of the map, a rotom will appear or at the bottom of the map.

909
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,180
Speaker 0: I forgot about this other Pokemon, I forget his name.

910
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,699
Speaker 1: And other maps love similar things.

911
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're special.

912
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,560
Speaker 0: Apparently this is also mechanic that was in League of Legends that I just didn't know about.

913
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,660
Speaker 0: And if you kill those Pokemon, right, then special things happen.

914
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:17,480
Speaker 0: So what can happen sometimes is like if a rotom appears, both teams will sort of go to the rotom because you want to be the team that kills it.

915
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,939
Speaker 0: Because then it'll join you and do awesome shit.

916
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:25,280
Speaker 1: Though in my experience, 100% of the matches I played, the team that wasted their time doing that, they got crushed.

917
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:26,726
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

918
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:28,220
Speaker 0: That always worked out well for us.

919
00:54:30,307 --> 00:54:33,160
Speaker 0: When I played, the teams would be fighting over the rotom, right?

920
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,340
Speaker 0: We'd all go there.

921
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,359
Speaker 0: You'd be fighting each other.

922
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,340
Speaker 0: And then it's like, well, if you kill all the enemies first, now the rotom's just sitting there.

923
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,620
Speaker 0: You have to fight it a little bit.

924
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:44,840
Speaker 0: If you try to go kill it on your own and no one helps you, it's strong enough it'll stop you.

925
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:48,760
Speaker 1: Another really good mechanic, and this is when you're starting the match.

926
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,180
Speaker 1: Because this game, you click "I want to play" and you're in a match like instantly.

927
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:54,138
Speaker 1: Like it's pretty good about that.

928
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,080
Speaker 1: Now it's Nintendo.

929
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:02,060
Speaker 1: No voice chat, like obviously, which is honestly a giant pain in the ass because I hate playing team games without voice chat.

930
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,480
Speaker 1: But this game does do something pretty good.

931
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:09,880
Speaker 1: A big problem with team games is that people who play them tend to not play with the team.

932
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:16,500
Speaker 1: When you start the match, Nintendo made it really easy to you hit like ZL, I think, and it opens the menu.

933
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:21,860
Speaker 1: And you can just tell the team which of the three lanes you're going to go after at the start of the match.

934
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,680
Speaker 1: It'll even put a little route for you to remind you where to go if you do that.

935
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:32,000
Speaker 1: And it shows you what other members of your team have chosen for their lane.

936
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,220
Speaker 1: So you can pretty easily make a plan without having to talk to other people.

937
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:42,140
Speaker 1: That is like the bare minimum coordination you need to be able to play a MOBA.

938
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,520
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good design decision.

939
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,639
Speaker 1: If they made it more complex, people wouldn't use it.

940
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:52,020
Speaker 1: If they didn't put that there, this game would devolve to kids like mashing A in the jungle and not coordinating.

941
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,897
Speaker 1: I saw it work pretty well and I saw people using it.

942
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw a little bit of use of it, but not that much.

943
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:05,800
Speaker 0: So yeah, overall it's a simpler MOBA, but in many ways there's still enough gameplay there that it's interesting and fun.

944
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,327
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it a lot.

945
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:09,680
Speaker 1: I actually would play it more like I would play.

946
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,320
Speaker 0: It's more elegant and more well designed than the popular MOBAs.

947
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,543
Speaker 0: I think it might be.

948
00:56:14,944 --> 00:56:20,320
Speaker 0: in terms of the things we've discussed so far, it may be the best big time MOBA.

949
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,953
Speaker 0: I don't know, there might be some small MOBA out there.

950
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:22,780
Speaker 0: I've never heard of, right?

951
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,980
Speaker 0: But in terms of the big MOBAs, it may be the best one based on those aspects.

952
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:34,220
Speaker 1: And up to a point, skill doesn't matter because I was playing matches mostly with people who haven't leveled shit up or bought anything outside of a match.

953
00:56:34,643 --> 00:56:37,040
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get to that, the reason why this game is bullshit.

954
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:50,000
Speaker 1: And the matches, 100% of the matches I played were either a ridiculous snowball victory or a crushing "we are trapped in our spawn for the entire match" defeat.

955
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,760
Speaker 1: At no point did I ever encounter a match that was even remotely close or fair.

956
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,679
Speaker 1: And I played a ton of matches.

957
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,280
Speaker 0: Gameplay-wise, that is the biggest failing of this game, is that it is still a MOBA.

958
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,920
Speaker 0: You are still statefully, within the context of one match, leveling up.

959
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,216
Speaker 1: And if you level up a little bit faster than the other team...

960
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,440
Speaker 0: If you level up faster than the other team, then you can basically one-shot them, right?

961
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:17,200
Speaker 0: And now they can't do anything.

962
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:36,819
Speaker 0: Every single match I played, not like most all, 100% of the matches I played, even when it was all noobs who didn't know what the hell was going on, including myself, or when they were clearly pros who knew what they were doing, every match, everyone was a landslide from one team or the

963
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,000
Speaker 1: other.

964
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,060
Speaker 1: I'm talking scores of like 890 to 20.

965
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,046
Speaker 0: I saw 900 to less than 100 in one match.

966
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,519
Speaker 1: I had a match where the other team got zero.

967
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,257
Speaker 1: We trapped them in their spawn until eventually they all quit.

968
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:50,800
Speaker 1: They forfeit.

969
00:57:51,122 --> 00:58:04,900
Speaker 0: It didn't matter if, you know, one match someone was AFK, the team, or is there sometimes a reason for the landslide, but in the five versus five matches where both teams played hard the whole time, or at least appeared to, always a landslide victory or a landslide loss.

970
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,978
Speaker 0: Leveling up faster than the other team as soon as, right?

971
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,720
Speaker 0: And a lot of games people, they did, thankfully, include a forfeiting mechanic.

972
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,880
Speaker 0: Your team can vote to quit.

973
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,380
Speaker 1: And that is 90% of all the games I played ended in the other team forfeiting.

974
00:58:17,881 --> 00:58:20,600
Speaker 0: As soon as you're behind by some levels, just resigned.

975
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,339
Speaker 0: What are you going to do to catch up?

976
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,259
Speaker 0: It's like, if you try to go out and like level up some more, the other team will be scoring points.

977
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:30,160
Speaker 0: If you try to go stop them from scoring points, but defense, they'll kill you.

978
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,580
Speaker 0: So even worse than you, if you try to score points right behind their back, they'll kill, they'll just kill you.

979
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,760
Speaker 0: They're just better than you.

980
00:58:36,921 --> 00:58:38,900
Speaker 0: It's like they've leveled up more.

981
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,779
Speaker 0: What can you do?

982
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:47,520
Speaker 0: No skill that you have is going to let you like at a lower level, you know, kill the enemy team or do anything to set them back.

983
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,980
Speaker 0: And being killed puts you out of the game.

984
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:58,360
Speaker 0: So you have to respawn, making you fall further behind, because the time while you're dead, the other team is getting XP and you're waiting to respawn.

985
00:58:59,221 --> 00:58:59,760
Speaker 1: Even worse.

986
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,080
Speaker 1: Now, maybe I'm wrong.

987
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,199
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm wrong.

988
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:04,939
Speaker 1: You cannot see the score until the end of the match.

989
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:07,339
Speaker 0: There you might be able to.

990
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,000
Speaker 0: I think if you like press a button.

991
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:12,720
Speaker 1: I tried every fucking button I could find, like, and I could not find a way to see the score.

992
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,020
Speaker 0: I think if you open up the score screen that shows like the sort of like the equivalent of pressing tab and counter strike.

993
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,240
Speaker 0: I think it's there.

994
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,280
Speaker 0: It's there somewhere.

995
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:22,920
Speaker 0: But yes, it makes no sense to me at the top.

996
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,599
Speaker 1: Why isn't it just the score just there like in a basketball match?

997
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:28,399
Speaker 0: The score should absolutely be.

998
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,640
Speaker 0: That's the only problem with the user interface at the top of the screen.

999
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,760
Speaker 0: And humongous numbers.

1000
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,860
Speaker 0: The score should be there constantly.

1001
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,539
Speaker 1: Because as a player, I will change my strategy like early on.

1002
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:42,800
Speaker 1: If depending on anything happening in that score, I will be making decisions based on that score.

1003
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:43,986
Speaker 1: Just like, I'll just defend.

1004
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,759
Speaker 0: Why am I scoring points?

1005
00:59:48,682 --> 00:59:53,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the other problem is that the game instead will pop up.

1006
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,400
Speaker 1: Things that will say it's a pretty close match or your fault.

1007
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,480
Speaker 1: You're falling behind.

1008
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,900
Speaker 0: I've never seen a message that says it's a pretty close match.

1009
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:07,539
Speaker 1: I saw your team is struggling in the very beginning because we both had someone rush out and score like 10 points right away.

1010
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:10,240
Speaker 1: And it was like, it's a, it said like, it's a pretty close match.

1011
01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:15,600
Speaker 1: And then 30 seconds later, it said, we're like, it said we're winning by a lot.

1012
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:19,000
Speaker 0: And it was over winning by a lot or our team is suffering.

1013
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,038
Speaker 1: What does it say?

1014
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,793
Speaker 1: You're really struggling to catch up.

1015
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:22,600
Speaker 1: is what it says.

1016
01:00:22,861 --> 01:00:23,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one.

1017
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:29,240
Speaker 1: Basically, if you see it say you're struggling to catch up, your team will probably vote to quit within 10 seconds of that.

1018
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,219
Speaker 0: You should vote to quit.

1019
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:32,280
Speaker 0: If you see that message, there's no reason to continue playing.

1020
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
Speaker 1: I don't think, I think maybe three matches I played made it to the end of the 10 minutes.

1021
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:39,500
Speaker 0: I've made it to the end of 10 minutes quite often, but it was always a landslide.

1022
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:54,533
Speaker 0: The one other mechanic in the game I forgot to mention is there is at the end of the match, cause it is timed and the final minute it's like doubles, like all the points go way up so that this is, could be an interesting catch up mechanic.

1023
01:00:54,553 --> 01:00:55,880
Speaker 0: for like the team that's behind.

1024
01:00:56,282 --> 01:01:04,680
Speaker 0: They could go and like, they could hold their, you know, don't die, hold the balls you've collected and don't dunk them and wait for the final minute.

1025
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:09,540
Speaker 0: Then go on a dunk spree to score a ton of points and catch up, a surprise come from behind victory.

1026
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,540
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's what they were thinking of.

1027
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,760
Speaker 0: The problem is it's activated for both teams.

1028
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,160
Speaker 0: So the team that's ahead just scores a whole bunch of points.

1029
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:19,040
Speaker 1: They're already behind.

1030
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,940
Speaker 1: There's no way for them to possibly score points during that.

1031
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:26,980
Speaker 0: It only serves as like a, as like a fun way to make the end of the match exciting.

1032
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,960
Speaker 0: It doesn't really provide any meaning mechanically speaking.

1033
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:37,280
Speaker 0: So, so that all the good parts of the end, the bad parts of this game, this game is like, this game is, I'm going to say it right here.

1034
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:37,999
Speaker 1: I know Kotaku.

1035
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,980
Speaker 1: There was a controversy out there.

1036
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:40,019
Speaker 1: This game is shit.

1037
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:46,960
Speaker 1: And it is shit because the game is free to play microtransactions to hell.

1038
01:01:47,422 --> 01:01:50,779
Speaker 1: And it's cosmetics and game affecting stuff.

1039
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:51,718
Speaker 0: Yup.

1040
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,455
Speaker 0: It is a pay to win game to get more out.

1041
01:01:55,741 --> 01:01:58,020
Speaker 1: You got to pay to get more items.

1042
01:01:58,182 --> 01:01:58,980
Speaker 1: You got to, all right.

1043
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,839
Speaker 1: You have to both grind.

1044
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,515
Speaker 1: You have to grind and pay.

1045
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:04,340
Speaker 0: You don't have to grind and pay.

1046
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,220
Speaker 0: You can pay or grind.

1047
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,720
Speaker 0: So the microtransaction stuff is all over the place.

1048
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:21,219
Speaker 0: There's like, there's 20 different, there's like several different shops and different currencies and all different ways to get, you know, you have a trainer level that goes up.

1049
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:24,550
Speaker 1: So last night I played for like four hours continuously.

1050
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,980
Speaker 0: That's a lot more than I played.

1051
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:30,273
Speaker 1: Like just, that was just last night.

1052
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:30,820
Speaker 1: I played for four.

1053
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:31,979
Speaker 1: I just played and played and played.

1054
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:36,373
Speaker 1: And the end of that, I had like 4,000 coins to unlock.

1055
01:02:36,393 --> 01:02:37,557
Speaker 1: a new Pokemon was like 13,000 coins.

1056
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:39,660
Speaker 1: And there's 16.

1057
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,019
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

1058
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:40,740
Speaker 0: No, it's not there.

1059
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,380
Speaker 0: I've never seen a Pokemon that costs 13.

1060
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,884
Speaker 0: They all cost eight or 10.

1061
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:44,175
Speaker 1: I saw one.

1062
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,412
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure one cost 13 for me.

1063
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:46,858
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1064
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,140
Speaker 1: To get like the Unite pass or whatever.

1065
01:02:48,461 --> 01:02:51,500
Speaker 1: There's so many things to unlock that I don't understand them all.

1066
01:02:52,408 --> 01:02:52,620
Speaker 0: Right.

1067
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,559
Speaker 0: So yeah, I can't even explain all this too much.

1068
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,779
Speaker 1: Like you start with this bullshit item that you can hold.

1069
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:01,840
Speaker 0: And so there are cosmetic things.

1070
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,920
Speaker 0: Cosmetic things are expensive, but they're cosmetic things.

1071
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:05,959
Speaker 0: So you can ignore them.

1072
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:15,340
Speaker 0: And everything you can buy, you can buy with either the points that you earn by playing or with the points that you get by spending money.

1073
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:22,820
Speaker 1: I don't think it is possible to get there is no in the game just by playing in the death of the universe timeframe.

1074
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,790
Speaker 0: So every single item in the game is.

1075
01:03:27,332 --> 01:03:29,198
Speaker 0: there's nothing that is exclusively pay.

1076
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:29,954
Speaker 0: only that I saw.

1077
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,853
Speaker 0: And there is nothing exclusively grind.

1078
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:32,840
Speaker 0: only that I saw.

1079
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:33,742
Speaker 0: Everything is.

1080
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:38,340
Speaker 0: you can achieve anything by either method, but you're correct.

1081
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,340
Speaker 0: The prices on everything were ludicrous, right?

1082
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:44,755
Speaker 0: It's like to unlock a Pokemon is 10,000 points.

1083
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,835
Speaker 0: If you play this game just regularly, I'm almost at 10,000 points.

1084
01:03:50,504 --> 01:03:52,980
Speaker 0: I have to get 9,000 so I can unlock one more Pokemon.

1085
01:03:54,161 --> 01:04:06,880
Speaker 0: To spend money to unlock a Pokemon 10,000, it's a different currency, but to basically get enough currency with real dollars to unlock a Pokemon is going to be, I calculated close to $10.

1086
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:06,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1087
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:09,399
Speaker 0: And there's that's a lot of fucking money.

1088
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:10,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1089
01:04:10,744 --> 01:04:12,300
Speaker 0: So that's already $150.

1090
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:18,080
Speaker 1: It's like 50 bucks if you want all the Pokemon and your reason I was going to have is the leftover Apple.

1091
01:04:18,461 --> 01:04:25,880
Speaker 0: The reason I was able to get to 10,000, almost 10,000 coins is because there's so many bonuses, like things to achieve.

1092
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:28,179
Speaker 0: When you start playing, you're brand new at the game.

1093
01:04:28,882 --> 01:04:37,053
Speaker 0: If you were to, if I spent all those on a Pokemon, the amount of time it would take me to earn enough from zero without all these starting bonuses.

1094
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:43,600
Speaker 0: as a new player to get to 10,000 again, to buy another Pokemon would be a very long time.

1095
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,820
Speaker 0: If I played regularly, I would get there, but it would take a while.

1096
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:53,462
Speaker 0: And to get all the Pokemon would take, especially because they're already adding another Pokemon.

1097
01:04:53,663 --> 01:04:58,040
Speaker 0: to get all of them over time, ungrindable, you will have to pay money.

1098
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:05,080
Speaker 1: If you want all of them, uh, like games I play, if they're competitive, every character is just unlocked from day one.

1099
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:06,000
Speaker 1: That's not where they make them.

1100
01:05:06,261 --> 01:05:07,020
Speaker 0: So, right.

1101
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,160
Speaker 0: So cosmetic things, they're cosmetic.

1102
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:09,679
Speaker 0: We don't care.

1103
01:05:09,762 --> 01:05:10,339
Speaker 0: That's fine.

1104
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:10,760
Speaker 0: Right.

1105
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:11,394
Speaker 0: Make your money.

1106
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,439
Speaker 0: Pokemon.

1107
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:13,200
Speaker 0: Okay.

1108
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:18,160
Speaker 0: If you don't have access to all the Pokemon, is it a, is it truly purely competitive?

1109
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,660
Speaker 0: As long as you can unlock enough, you can unlock plenty.

1110
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:30,340
Speaker 1: I already have like, they give you plenty of Pokemon are broken up into basically like tanks, uh, like tanks slash defense, like, you know, whatever category.

1111
01:05:30,561 --> 01:05:31,939
Speaker 0: So you'll, you'll have enough Pokemon.

1112
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,120
Speaker 0: Plus it does the same thing.

1113
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,860
Speaker 0: League of Legends does where over, you know, depending on what day it is, different Pokemon are just unlocked by default for everybody.

1114
01:05:40,162 --> 01:05:42,400
Speaker 1: They're all on the Pareto frontier as far as I can see.

1115
01:05:42,862 --> 01:05:45,160
Speaker 0: Well, some of them were OP, but balancing is happening.

1116
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:49,380
Speaker 0: Uh, so, but yeah, you're going to have enough Pokemon to play with at any given time.

1117
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:52,340
Speaker 0: Is that really a big deal that you don't have every Pokemon unlocked?

1118
01:05:52,480 --> 01:06:02,200
Speaker 0: You know, not necessarily, but the final thing, and this is what really ruins it is Pokemon can, you know, much like in the real Pokemon game, Pokemon can hold items.

1119
01:06:02,581 --> 01:06:07,900
Speaker 0: So w and your trainer level determines how many items Pokemon can hold.

1120
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,160
Speaker 0: So if you're less than trainer level seven, I think it's seven.

1121
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:12,920
Speaker 0: Your Pokemon can hold one item.

1122
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,080
Speaker 0: If you level up more, your Pokemon can hold two items.

1123
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:23,580
Speaker 0: And if you level up even more, eventually your Pokemon can hold three items, game, game affecting items.

1124
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,660
Speaker 0: There's an item that can like an apple core that I have.

1125
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,960
Speaker 0: It's like a free Garbo item.

1126
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,649
Speaker 0: I got makes Pokemon heal all the time.

1127
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,460
Speaker 0: There's another item plus special attack.

1128
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:41,879
Speaker 0: So I played against someone who is using Gengar and they clearly, I could tell based on what was on the screen, uh, they had spent money.

1129
01:06:42,261 --> 01:06:45,476
Speaker 1: Clearly they had spent, I'll tell you, anyone who spent the start of the match.

1130
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:48,319
Speaker 0: at the start of the match, their Gengar was just one shotting.

1131
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:52,269
Speaker 0: Uh, it wasn't a Gengar yet, but basically they were one shotting our team out of the gate.

1132
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:53,780
Speaker 0: They leveled up way faster.

1133
01:06:53,924 --> 01:06:54,580
Speaker 0: It was a landslide.

1134
01:06:54,702 --> 01:06:55,659
Speaker 0: We were trapped in our spawn.

1135
01:06:55,806 --> 01:06:56,017
Speaker 0: Yup.

1136
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:03,700
Speaker 0: If you don't buy money, if you pay, there was no way for me to beat that person without also spending money.

1137
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,751
Speaker 0: Absolutely no way, no amount of skill or decision-making.

1138
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:12,440
Speaker 0: Pokemon choice, team coordination, nothing we could have done could have overcome the power of the fact that that person spent money.

1139
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,740
Speaker 0: We had lost the game before it started.

1140
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,119
Speaker 1: You got to grind and pay to get Pokemon.

1141
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:20,040
Speaker 1: You got to grind and pay to have item slots and you got to grind and pay.

1142
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,800
Speaker 0: Nine out of 10 players did not appear to have spent money.

1143
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,879
Speaker 0: One player spending money tilted the whole game.

1144
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,920
Speaker 1: But there are 15 different types of items and within those types, there's different levels and like, there's like, you will never get these items.

1145
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's exactly right.

1146
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,420
Speaker 0: Not only do you need to get the rare items, right?

1147
01:07:36,481 --> 01:07:38,540
Speaker 0: That are the strongest, best items to go with your Pokemon.

1148
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:40,839
Speaker 1: You know, they're going to add more items and more Pokemon.

1149
01:07:41,694 --> 01:07:41,840
Speaker 0: Sure.

1150
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:44,960
Speaker 0: And level yourself up enough to be able to use three items at once.

1151
01:07:45,383 --> 01:07:47,880
Speaker 0: You need to level up the items themselves.

1152
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:51,820
Speaker 0: There's things you can get to spend on items to upgrade them.

1153
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,280
Speaker 0: So you need to get your items maxed out, right?

1154
01:07:55,622 --> 01:07:58,879
Speaker 0: If you do that, who's going to beat you unless someone else had also spent money?

1155
01:07:58,899 --> 01:08:06,124
Speaker 0: because to level to get the items to unlock the slots and to level up all three items for each Pokemon, right?

1156
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:17,599
Speaker 0: The amount of grinding you would have to do to get all of that maxed out is basically an impossibly long time because your trainer can also have an item.

1157
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:19,800
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

1158
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,240
Speaker 0: But yeah, you get the potion item, but there's more items.

1159
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:24,118
Speaker 1: And guess what?

1160
01:08:24,582 --> 01:08:24,957
Speaker 1: Same story.

1161
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:26,920
Speaker 0: There are more trainer items.

1162
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:33,700
Speaker 0: So like you get a potion, you see your trainer holds potion and that means you can push X to heal and then the potion cools down.

1163
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:38,638
Speaker 0: But obviously if you get better items, I'm sure this super potion or hyper potion or whatever somewhere, right?

1164
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,920
Speaker 0: So yeah, it is a MOBA that is elegantly designed.

1165
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,559
Speaker 0: Pokemon are fun.

1166
01:08:46,865 --> 01:08:47,560
Speaker 0: We like Pokemon.

1167
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,059
Speaker 0: Pokemon goes great with MOBA.

1168
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:51,511
Speaker 0: They made a lot of changes to the MOBA format.

1169
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:53,560
Speaker 0: that are positive, though they didn't change it enough.

1170
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,478
Speaker 0: You can still level up and landslide, but at the end of the day, it's a pay to win game and that ruins everything else.

1171
01:08:58,783 --> 01:08:58,880
Speaker 1: Yep.

1172
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:03,180
Speaker 1: So it sucks because the game is fun and they have ruined it.

1173
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:12,660
Speaker 1: I honestly advise you to never play it because unless you if you want to be good at this game, buy everything, spend money and you'll be the goddamn world champion again.

1174
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:22,220
Speaker 0: I think if you played in a match where everyone spent money and had everything maxed out, that is true, then you would be and everyone was skilled because there is some amount of skill decision making going on.

1175
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,759
Speaker 1: You will never achieve that level.

1176
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:29,037
Speaker 0: If you dedicate your life and decide because it's still early, this game is not even a week old.

1177
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:32,660
Speaker 0: If you have a bunch of money, you got nothing to do with because you're just rich.

1178
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:34,519
Speaker 0: And you have nothing better to do.

1179
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,600
Speaker 0: And you love Pokemon and you love MOBAs.

1180
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,979
Speaker 0: And this game is your game.

1181
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:45,160
Speaker 0: You could spend all your fucking money on it, hundreds and hundreds of dollars, and you could become the champion of Pokemon Unite.

1182
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,519
Speaker 0: But I would encourage you not to do this.

1183
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,698
Speaker 0: Look at the history of the way Nintendo has treated esports.

1184
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,240
Speaker 0: That is not a road you want to go down.

1185
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:58,898
Speaker 0: If you want to become an esports person, wait for a different game from a different company to spend your life on.

1186
01:09:59,641 --> 01:10:04,180
Speaker 0: A game that will treat its esport community with more respect than Nintendo.

1187
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,040
Speaker 0: And also, you know, you know who had one that's not pay to win.

1188
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:08,558
Speaker 1: This was also Tencent.

1189
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,840
Speaker 1: It was a Tencent game in collaboration.

1190
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:11,940
Speaker 0: Tencent made this game.

1191
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,760
Speaker 0: It's just Nintendo licensed.

1192
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,999
Speaker 0: Nintendo did not make this game, though I'm sure they had some input on it.

1193
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:19,440
Speaker 0: This is largely a Tencent made game.

1194
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Speaker 0: It's also going to be on mobile.

1195
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,159
Speaker 0: So if you don't have a switch, it'll be a mobile pay to win game as well.

1196
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:32,940
Speaker 1: So my advice, if you want to play this, only play it with groups of friends, like get a bunch of friends to play versus against each other and agree.

1197
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,899
Speaker 0: Don't use any items.

1198
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:40,677
Speaker 1: That none of you will ever buy any item and you will never unlock anything but additional Pokemon.

1199
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,900
Speaker 0: I would just say, you know, even if you did that, a friend might grind more.

1200
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:50,319
Speaker 1: Even though I'm saying you're not allowed to use any in-game currency except to get right Pokemon.

1201
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:50,999
Speaker 1: Nothing else.

1202
01:10:52,143 --> 01:10:58,175
Speaker 0: I would say that everyone has to use potion as their item because you just get it pretty early.

1203
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,720
Speaker 1: Everyone has to use that apple core as their held item.

1204
01:11:01,502 --> 01:11:05,460
Speaker 0: Everyone uses their apple core and equips no other items, no matter what.

1205
01:11:06,101 --> 01:11:07,760
Speaker 0: No leveling up the items, no nothing.

1206
01:11:08,744 --> 01:11:09,679
Speaker 0: And then, yeah, that's it.

1207
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be okay to unlock new Pokemon.

1208
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:13,200
Speaker 0: Friends only.

1209
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,439
Speaker 0: Unlock a Pokemon, but don't, you know, that's it.

1210
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:20,999
Speaker 1: If any of you want to play in that mode with us, I would actually be inclined to play with the listener.

1211
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:27,240
Speaker 0: Like that's something I would play with all people I knew who are abiding by like the level zero no spend.

1212
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of fun to play that way.

1213
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,539
Speaker 0: And, you know, but it would still be a landslide every time, I think, no matter what.

1214
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:40,180
Speaker 1: I'm curious, even if everyone is equal, if everyone was equal and it was people who were all trying hard and people were skilled and intelligent.

1215
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:48,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, because definitely like if I had voice, I would add, I would add very polite words with some people on my teams because it was clearly like, okay, that's either a kid or someone.

1216
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,359
Speaker 1: They just wandered off by themselves and got killed a thousand times.

1217
01:11:51,842 --> 01:11:54,360
Speaker 1: Never actually did it, contributed anything like that happens.

1218
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:59,780
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go on Twitch and like see, find a streamer who is tolerable, who's playing.

1219
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,359
Speaker 0: And I assume they'll be playing with a team against a team.

1220
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:03,679
Speaker 0: Just to see what that looks like.

1221
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, to see if it looks like to see if there's any sort of semblance of balance there.

1222
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,720
Speaker 0: I'm sure there'll be money spending and grinding at that level of play.

1223
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,759
Speaker 0: But, you know, there's a match of 10 pros, even if they spent money.

1224
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:19,220
Speaker 0: Will it always, will I be able to find anyone else having a close match?

1225
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:27,180
Speaker 1: Because one thing it does get right that didn't matter because of the landslide was, like we said before, the attacks, like different Pokémon are radically different and interesting.

1226
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,100
Speaker 0: Oh, very interesting.

1227
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:38,200
Speaker 1: Like Fly, I'll give you an example, Fly, you literally fly off the map, are invincible for like six fucking seconds and you can choose where you come down and fuck somebody up.

1228
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,760
Speaker 0: I picked the crab guy because I like crabs and no one else picked it.

1229
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:43,820
Speaker 0: And it's like I had an attack, the rock wall.

1230
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:49,519
Speaker 0: It's like you forget, I think was it, but it's like it shoots out and then it creates a wall of rocks and sort of an arch.

1231
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:52,480
Speaker 0: So you can use this both for keeping opponents away.

1232
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,380
Speaker 0: They can't get through the wall, but also for trapping them in.

1233
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,598
Speaker 0: Like you can't get away from me.

1234
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:58,719
Speaker 0: I put a wall in front of you and then I kill you.

1235
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:04,759
Speaker 0: But also some Pokémon like Gengar might have an ability to do a short dash teleport and come right through the wall.

1236
01:13:05,141 --> 01:13:09,400
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of that sort of good interplay, even in such a simple game.

1237
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,300
Speaker 1: Like I've been rocking.

1238
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,820
Speaker 1: I play mostly Talonflame and that's real fun.

1239
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:13,800
Speaker 1: You are so fragile.

1240
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:14,905
Speaker 1: You just are.

1241
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:16,720
Speaker 1: you can get anywhere on the map so quick.

1242
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,120
Speaker 1: So like your teammates under attack and suddenly you show up and save the day.

1243
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:20,630
Speaker 1: It's good fun.

1244
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:23,779
Speaker 1: But yeah, this game is pay to win garbage.

1245
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,880
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

Speaker 1: Yep.

1257
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:36,778
Speaker 1: We're going out of town for a bit.

1258
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:39,080
Speaker 1: Then we'll be back for like a week of shows.

1259
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:40,839
Speaker 1: Then actually we're going to be out of town again.

1260
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:46,979
Speaker 1: There's a tiny chance we'll do at least one special episode during that second out of town outage.

1261
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,299
Speaker 1: And then we're pretty much in town forever after that.

1262
01:14:50,446 --> 01:14:52,300
Speaker 1: And yeah, we won't be at PAX West.

1263
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,259
Speaker 1: We'll see if PAX Unplugged even happens.

1264
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,540
Speaker 1: TBD on Magfest.

1265
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:01,680
Speaker 1: And otherwise, I leave you with something that you've probably forgotten.

1266
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:11,249
Speaker 1: Now the Koopa teach you the meaning of mean.

1267
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,789
Speaker 1: These Bob-omb birds ain't dropping finales.

1268
01:15:14,673 --> 01:15:16,709
Speaker 1: We better split or we'll be full of holies.

1269
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:18,804
Speaker 0: You said, "Canelies, I'm ready to

1270
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:18,986
Speaker 0: eat.".

1271
01:15:19,492 --> 01:15:20,308
Speaker 0: In fact, it's lunchtime.

1272
01:15:20,653 --> 01:15:21,229
Speaker 1: Time to retreat.

1273
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,399
Speaker 0: Koopa, your rap's rotten just like you.

1274
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,797
Speaker 0: Good rap will win.

1275
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,859
Speaker 1: This ball is through.

1276
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:37,679
Speaker 0: Get a grip, you two.

1277
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,899
Speaker 1: You're so, so wrong.

1278
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:41,519
Speaker 1: I think they're playing my favorite song.

1279
01:15:47,101 --> 01:15:51,820
Speaker 0: I got me a princess and the king of rap, and they're going to get the point of my Koopa trap.
