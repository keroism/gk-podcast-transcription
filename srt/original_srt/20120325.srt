1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,627
Speaker 1: It's Monday, March 26th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:13,208
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,050
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,914
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:18,700
Speaker 1: Tonight, it's a tech news round-up.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,963
Speaker 1: Cuz we didn't have much else to do the show on in a hurry.

8
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:34,961
Speaker 0: Well, I figure I figure it's okay Cuz we haven't done in a long time.

9
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:38,640
Speaker 0: You know, if we did tech news round-up every week Then we would be Twit and not Geek Nights.

10
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:42,819
Speaker 1: Ah, but if we were Twit Do you think I'm not saying whether or not?

11
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,770
Speaker 1: I believe it is true that we could give better or worse commentary than them?

12
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:46,613
Speaker 0: It's hard.

13
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:50,550
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the thing is it but you have to put a definition of better or worse, right?

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,561
Speaker 0: Because you know, they're more.

15
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:53,809
Speaker 0: they're more professional than we are.

16
00:00:54,612 --> 00:01:01,530
Speaker 0: You know higher profile and such and I'm sure most people in our geek community, you know, at least not our listeners.

17
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:11,201
Speaker 0: but obviously, you know twit listeners would probably say that twit is more entertaining than we are but We are clearly vastly more technologically knowledgeable than they are.

18
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,645
Speaker 0: there is no question about this.

19
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:18,785
Speaker 0: if you're looking for technological accuracy Definitely want to go with us.

20
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:29,110
Speaker 0: nerdy guys you don't give a shit and we're willing to lay down, you know, all kinds of big words and Not you know the people going for the more mass appeal even though we haven't really done that lately.

21
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:31,589
Speaker 0: Not so much.

22
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:54,810
Speaker 0: It's like when we're talking about a tech news though, you know We don't you know, it's like, you know, even if we're talking about tech news on a low level We don't bring in you know something that's contradictory to technological fact and we often do bring in the Technological fact as like supporting like it can't be done because blah blah blah You know other people always seem to fail at that and they'll be like, oh, well, what if there's something something?

23
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,967
Speaker 0: I'm like that something something is not possible.

24
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:04,629
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, it's a tech news roundup meaning it'd be kind of stupid to do some news now.

25
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:17,398
Speaker 1: Oh Cue of that music there little thing of the day music and how about that?

26
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,520
Speaker 1: It's time for things of the day.

27
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:20,830
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

28
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:30,180
Speaker 0: So check this out, you know Brian Kern Ahan of Kern Ahan and Richie the guys who wrote the book on C Literally, he wrote a book much more recently.

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,474
Speaker 0: You can buy the Kindle Edition for 10 books or the paper edition for 15 or you can just read it.

30
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,872
Speaker 0: Uh, oh, I think you can only read the table of contents.

31
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:46,420
Speaker 0: But anyway, I Thought it was free whatever But this book is still worthy of being a thing of the day.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,960
Speaker 0: Basically, you know, this is very important and smart technological person wrote a book called D is for digital.

33
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,490
Speaker 0: What a well-informed person ought to know about computers and communications.

34
00:02:56,481 --> 00:03:01,660
Speaker 0: This book explains how today's computing and communications world operates from hardware through software to the internet and the web.

35
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:06,520
Speaker 0: It includes enough detail that you can understand how these systems work no matter what your technical background.

36
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:10,319
Speaker 0: The social political and legal issues that new technology creates are discussed as well.

37
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:15,820
Speaker 0: So you can understand the difficult issues we face and appreciate the trade-offs that have to be made to resolve them.

38
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:34,306
Speaker 0: So from the looks of it, obviously, I haven't read it because I thought But anyway, I think this book is probably you know, at least from what I've seen so far the best book to give to a person who doesn't know about internets or anything like that and Get them to be educated.

39
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,134
Speaker 0: Obviously, it won't teach you programming.

40
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:53,074
Speaker 0: It won't teach you how to use a computer It won't teach you anything like that But it'll sort of help you understand, you know the new Laws of society in a technological world and how things work, you know, basically I mean, let me read the table of contents preface introduction.

41
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:54,400
Speaker 0: part 1 hardware.

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,262
Speaker 0: What's in a computer?

43
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,748
Speaker 0: bits bytes representation of information inside the CPU.

44
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,640
Speaker 0: part 2 software algorithms programming and program languages software systems learning to program.

45
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:12,582
Speaker 0: part 3 communications networking the internet the World Wide Web data information and privacy, so that pretty much covers Everything, huh?

46
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:16,553
Speaker 1: You know, I wonder if we could do the same concept.

47
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,380
Speaker 1: remember those old the way things work books.

48
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:26,875
Speaker 1: They had the mammoths in him Nuclear power and like how records work and everything and excruciating detail for little kids.

49
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:28,220
Speaker 0: Maybe I had different books than you.

50
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:29,445
Speaker 1: Maybe you did.

51
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:30,429
Speaker 1: Those are really good books.

52
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:36,011
Speaker 1: I will make those the next book club book, perhaps As good as I want my hat back.

53
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,000
Speaker 1: Nothing is as good as I want my head back.

54
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:45,124
Speaker 0: I think something is All right, here's a question for you right ready rim Tomorrow on Amazon.

55
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:45,867
Speaker 0: There's two books.

56
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,937
Speaker 0: They have the same release day, right the sequel to.

57
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:49,840
Speaker 0: I want my hat back.

58
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,648
Speaker 1: I want my other hat back.

59
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,179
Speaker 0: That's right, or I want my shoe back or something like that.

60
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,759
Speaker 0: and New Prince of nothing book, which one do you read first?

61
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,488
Speaker 1: That's not fair because I could.

62
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:04,311
Speaker 0: what is not fair?

63
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,660
Speaker 0: I'm just saying if it happens just saying what do you read?

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:21,660
Speaker 1: That's like saying all right There's two pieces of entertainment that may be equally compelling One of which takes 30 seconds to consume and one of which takes about four days to consume Which what there has to be one that you are you can't be absolutely 100% equally excited.

65
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:27,015
Speaker 0: Ah, but even if I were you have to be slightly more leaning towards one of them than the other.

66
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:40,716
Speaker 1: fact, even if you know All right, here's is okay I'll check cuz I gotta bust out the game theory analysis because here's the trouble if one of them is very quick to consume Even if okay half as good as the long book by consuming it first.

67
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:44,709
Speaker 1: my net enjoyment Over a period of time obviously, okay.

68
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,080
Speaker 0: I made a mistake and asking you which one you would go after first.

69
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:48,940
Speaker 1: What if I only get one?

70
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,760
Speaker 0: What if you only had one and the other one you could never see or experience in your life?

71
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,674
Speaker 0: But the other one you could read in full as many times as you please.

72
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:01,189
Speaker 1: Prince of nothing cuz it's equal Couldn't live up to what happened in the first hat.

73
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,454
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Prince of nothing.

74
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:03,678
Speaker 1: I gotta know what the fuck happened.

75
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,823
Speaker 0: That's right That's right.

76
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:07,047
Speaker 1: I really got to know.

77
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,254
Speaker 1: actually now I'm thinking about that again.

78
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:10,297
Speaker 1: next book come out.

79
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:10,999
Speaker 1: god damn it.

80
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,227
Speaker 0: Let's check Amazon.

81
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,677
Speaker 1: Anyway, so my thing of the day.

82
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:17,796
Speaker 1: Not talking about ponies, but it's tangentially related.

83
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,660
Speaker 1: I got to make that known.

84
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:27,066
Speaker 1: Lauren Faust who basically made my little pony what it is today the internet phenomenon also was doing another little show.

85
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:34,090
Speaker 1: as you may know she had a hand in such great classics as the Powerpuff Girls and You know, she made my little pony what it was and she moved on.

86
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:41,305
Speaker 1: and now she's doing a little thing for DC the super best friends forever and It'll be interesting.

87
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,451
Speaker 1: I saw you know, there's a clip.

88
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,199
Speaker 1: I'm linking to the sort of like teaser clip.

89
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:53,220
Speaker 1: She does good stuff and I look forward to seeing more of her work in non pony realms in the future Even though I kind of wish you just go back to ponies.

90
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,585
Speaker 0: I wish you'd make a comic book.

91
00:06:54,645 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaker 0: right because you look at this really reminds me of like tiny Titans the comic book Only a little less tiny but it's that same sort of thing.

92
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,443
Speaker 0: We're like you.

93
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 0: take the superhero characters you sort of, you know Boil their characters down to like this caricature of themselves and you sort of you know Make it, you know, really expressive and cute and you tell fun stories.

94
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:17,706
Speaker 1: That is what her biggest strength is.

95
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:19,452
Speaker 1: look at all the words that we like it's.

96
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,178
Speaker 1: she has characters like.

97
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:25,319
Speaker 1: she's a Independent of who writes a good story because you know, they have different writers for a lot of these things.

98
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:32,820
Speaker 1: She takes good characters and she does good character direction and like overall like world direct all that kind of stuff.

99
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:40,933
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know there have been lots of these sorts of things in comic book form But relatively few in TV animation for me and even these are shorts, right?

100
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:47,900
Speaker 0: No, it's a whole show like this except ponies And I really wish someone would make a whole show like this to start with a comic.

101
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think you know.

102
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:55,326
Speaker 0: Maybe what she should do is she should make a comic book because she definitely do it all in her own and it would be Epically awesome.

103
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:56,856
Speaker 0: She could do a pony comic book.

104
00:07:56,916 --> 00:08:00,668
Speaker 0: I mean, I Want to know why there's a strawberry shortcake piece of shit.

105
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:10,958
Speaker 0: boycott all-american greetings still because of the penny arcade Back in the day Hasbro being a relative but Hasbro does plenty of comics as Transformers.

106
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:11,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

107
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:15,269
Speaker 1: however, they Not the best I can tell.

108
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 1: remember they appointed not to make this the pony show They hired or are trying to hire a product manager just for my little pony.

109
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:29,560
Speaker 1: They realize they have to you know Exploit it the right way and they appear to be very carefully not wanting to fuck it up.

110
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:34,320
Speaker 1: So they don't want to make the comic until they make the comic right though There are pony comics in a ton of other languages.

111
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,272
Speaker 0: Well, those are more like kids coloring books not comic books.

112
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,299
Speaker 1: you buy the comic book, but they still have comics in them.

113
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,407
Speaker 0: They should just get bongo or IDW to do it.

114
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,068
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,415
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's not the pony show.

116
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,378
Speaker 1: That's that's coming.

117
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:48,140
Speaker 1: That's right later.

118
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:52,076
Speaker 1: So it's a tech news roundup, but first the meta moment.

119
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:52,860
Speaker 0: you do the day.

120
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,827
Speaker 0: All right, of course, I did not.

121
00:08:54,887 --> 00:09:03,369
Speaker 1: this coming weekend, but next motherfucking weekend We're gonna be in Boston for anime Boston and the penny arcade Expo East.

122
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,667
Speaker 0: Oh 2012 fuck your mother.

123
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:06,892
Speaker 1: we are doing.

124
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,740
Speaker 1: let's play money-making game.

125
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,452
Speaker 1: We are doing the geek nights tabletop workshop.

126
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,400
Speaker 1: That one is a class.

127
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,417
Speaker 1: We're teaching you how to play and win Carcassonne and Agricola and a secret game to be announced.

128
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,280
Speaker 0: how much time is left?

129
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:33,450
Speaker 1: Yep, we are also going to be there with a bunch of our friends like I don't know Luke crane and Jared Sorensen who are doing a whole bunch of things some parsley events a The D&D a panel on old D&D and why it's actually awesome.

130
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,779
Speaker 0: Play old D&D by the book, but no one wants to play with me.

131
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,483
Speaker 0: I'll play it and we need more.

132
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:46,402
Speaker 0: people who are dedicating will actually show up every time and prepare and Some of those nerd NYC people probably would invest in it for reals.

133
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,770
Speaker 1: Maybe those guys love that kind of role-play.

134
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,421
Speaker 0: Maybe let's run it at recess.

135
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,508
Speaker 0: Ah Old D&D by the book.

136
00:09:56,071 --> 00:10:06,655
Speaker 1: How old though because while the original one that I have that I got a goodwill in Rochester I would not mind reading the red green blue dungeons and dragons as in from the Dungeons & Dragons Cyclopedia.

137
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:14,108
Speaker 0: the thing is I have to read it again But yeah the red green blue that I got at the Goodwill store levels go up to I think 36 I don't know.

138
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:20,369
Speaker 1: I look in the Cyclopedia in Dungeons & Dragons that was existing at the same time as advanced dungeons and dragons.

139
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:24,906
Speaker 1: Anyway Anyway, so yeah, we'll be packs be an anime Boston shits going down.

140
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:25,609
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome.

141
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:27,677
Speaker 1: Book Club book is the Hunger Games.

142
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:28,440
Speaker 1: Just the first one.

143
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,906
Speaker 1: I know the movie came out.

144
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,010
Speaker 1: read the book.

145
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,362
Speaker 0: This one should be easy enough because most of you fucking read it.

146
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:36,795
Speaker 1: Alright, read the book Movie doesn't count.

147
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:38,459
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't gotta read.

148
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,242
Speaker 0: It's the book club.

149
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:39,843
Speaker 0: Not the movie.

150
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:41,067
Speaker 1: Not a sports page.

151
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,236
Speaker 1: Not a magazine But a book.

152
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,403
Speaker 1: that's right.

153
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,979
Speaker 1: So yeah tech news roundup.

154
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,006
Speaker 1: I have most of the news is here.

155
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,110
Speaker 1: So I will start.

156
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,098
Speaker 0: I've been reading a lot less internet lately.

157
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:54,945
Speaker 0: So I have a lot less news is.

158
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:56,290
Speaker 1: so let's start.

159
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,659
Speaker 0: I have my ability to discuss the news is has not dwindled.

160
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,010
Speaker 1: Let's start with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.

161
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,050
Speaker 1: Because they were in the news twice.

162
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,057
Speaker 0: How could they be in the news twice?

163
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,710
Speaker 0: did somebody like who works there quit and like post a bunch of stuff on the internet?

164
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,573
Speaker 0: That was scandalous.

165
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,682
Speaker 0: So first there must be some reason.

166
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:16,670
Speaker 1: this is kind of an aside in technology.

167
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,524
Speaker 0: But I have a big press conference or they announced it's interesting that they had two things.

168
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:28,270
Speaker 1: The first one is that they proposed some rules to how GPS navigation systems work in cars.

169
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:43,750
Speaker 1: Specifically they wanted to make it such that the screens cannot display your position Relative to the car you're in Like, you know, you can't angle the map down and show like the arrow that shows like see the turns coming up ahead.

170
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,398
Speaker 1: This is how it'll look like to you.

171
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:50,263
Speaker 1: So no GTA mode only over-the-top mode Yep, and two they can't update in real time.

172
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:53,517
Speaker 1: They have to show you a static map Uh-huh.

173
00:11:53,638 --> 00:12:00,649
Speaker 1: Their argument is that this will reduce distractions and make people safer drivers that people rely too much on GPS.

174
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,183
Speaker 1: and I didn't read their study fully, but I read.

175
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,670
Speaker 1: I read some of the commentary.

176
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,482
Speaker 1: I found some counter studies that I didn't read just as much.

177
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:12,374
Speaker 1: I Think this is ridiculous.

178
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know now one of those things that sounds like common sense, right?

179
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,970
Speaker 0: Do you think oh, yeah if it updates less often then that means you look at it less or whatever.

180
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:25,550
Speaker 0: But you know, there's an argument to be made the other way and I'm pretty much whatever the science.

181
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:28,582
Speaker 1: Well, there is an argument to be made for as you can look at.

182
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:31,354
Speaker 1: remember when we were looking to buy that house and beacon Remember a realtor.

183
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:35,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, she would drive look at just literally just staring at the GPS.

184
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:42,029
Speaker 1: She wouldn't even look at the road and apparently she'd been in like 10 car accidents in the previous few months Yep, and we're riding in her car like oh god.

185
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,690
Speaker 0: So I think it pretty much just comes down to the evidence right if you can demonstrate.

186
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:51,670
Speaker 0: You know within reasonable doubt or whatever some level of confidence that these rules will decrease.

187
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,950
Speaker 0: You know damage and death on the road.

188
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,576
Speaker 0: So I know you should put them in.

189
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,765
Speaker 1: but I have a counter argument to even that.

190
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:00,578
Speaker 0: you do not have the evidence Then do not do that.

191
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,950
Speaker 1: I have a counter argument to even that.

192
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:12,509
Speaker 1: Okay, what if it turns out that only shitty drivers are more likely to get into accidents because they stare at the GPS Mm-hmm and good drivers?

193
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:19,250
Speaker 1: Because the orientation and real-time updates of the map are so accurate and from the perspective of the user?

194
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:31,050
Speaker 1: You could argue that someone who glances at it quickly and then resumes looking at the road is much more likely to be able to Information and then resume looking at the road if it's contextual and in real time if it's just a static map.

195
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:36,070
Speaker 1: How many times you've been driving but again right in the days before any of this?

196
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,150
Speaker 1: You know any sort of navigation device and you had a map like print it out.

197
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,582
Speaker 1: You're trying to like hold it in front of you while you're driving.

198
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,210
Speaker 1: that shit is dangerous, right?

199
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,590
Speaker 0: But I mean again, this is just your common sense as opposed to someone else's common sense.

200
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:54,370
Speaker 0: You know if you can provide evidence to suggest that that is true within some high level of confidence.

201
00:13:54,712 --> 00:14:02,657
Speaker 0: Then what we need obviously is some sort of rule that says Oh, well, if you're this kind of driver, then you can do use this But if you're not you can use that.

202
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,847
Speaker 1: so, you know, ah, but how do you legislate that?

203
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:05,510
Speaker 1: and more importantly?

204
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:14,806
Speaker 1: this is all crazy anyway, because Phones have the real-time GPS and will never be regulated in that regard.

205
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:26,670
Speaker 1: So anyone who wants to use GPS navigation if a law were passed to Basically ruin in-car GPS, they would just mount their phone on their dashboard.

206
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:31,970
Speaker 0: But then they'll just say, you know any GPS software that they would there's no way that would fly.

207
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,652
Speaker 1: I mean does that count?

208
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,103
Speaker 1: All right GPS software on my laptop computer.

209
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:36,945
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,470
Speaker 1: What about my boat navigation?

211
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:39,917
Speaker 0: Right.

212
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,215
Speaker 0: That's Bring your boat navigate.

213
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:46,370
Speaker 0: your boat navigation isn't gonna have the road data, you know, so you can't bring it in your car.

214
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,243
Speaker 0: It won't help you Yeah.

215
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,495
Speaker 1: But what if I just overlay him out?

216
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:54,780
Speaker 1: the thing is that there's no way a law could be passed that would ban GPS navigation systems updated in real time.

217
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,670
Speaker 1: because what constitutes a GPS navigation system?

218
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:03,230
Speaker 0: I think I think the fundamental thing here right is that remember this is a regulation of software.

219
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:05,350
Speaker 0: It's impossible to regulate software.

220
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:11,330
Speaker 0: You cannot make a law that says software that does X may not exist or may not be sold or may not be used.

221
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,635
Speaker 0: So they can always.

222
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:18,831
Speaker 0: someone can always make software that does X and distribute it and there's no way you can stop it Which

223
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:28,382
Speaker 1: so the way they would do that in this case is they would regulate that the ones that are Built to be mounted in cars like the in-car like the ones that come with cars would be subject to this.

224
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:35,420
Speaker 1: and Unless you're an uber hacker who knows how to you know, root it and fuck with it You couldn't load software on it because it's a walled garden.

225
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,564
Speaker 1: Not even a walled garden.

226
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:37,930
Speaker 1: You're walled out of the garden.

227
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:39,976
Speaker 0: The question is right.

228
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:46,863
Speaker 0: if you know, basically car GPS is like that, you know Like those specific car devices were gimped in this way.

229
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,770
Speaker 0: Would that hurt their sales?

230
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:53,130
Speaker 1: Oh, I think it would destroy their sales meaning they're gonna lobby against this new, right?

231
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,414
Speaker 0: So basically they're gonna make a law that basically puts those companies out of business.

232
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:09,649
Speaker 0: if it's hell if it's enforced and Just everyone gets smartphones or you know In fact that can actually beneficial because then a lot of people who don't have smartphones.

233
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,501
Speaker 0: and Now, you know can't you get a GPS that does?

234
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,149
Speaker 0: that will end up having to get a crappier GP.

235
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:17,530
Speaker 0: I don't know.

236
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:18,975
Speaker 0: We don't know.

237
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:25,529
Speaker 1: Yep to quote every current Navigation system uses the car as a fixed point and shows the map moving around it.

238
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:28,710
Speaker 1: The NH TSA wants that change was to keep the map fixed.

239
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,775
Speaker 0: Well, there have to be some.

240
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:30,036
Speaker 0: they'll be.

241
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,790
Speaker 0: might some be like some black market for old bootleg?

242
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:37,063
Speaker 0: You know some old GPS devices that still do it this way.

243
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,732
Speaker 1: I Think there would be.

244
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,930
Speaker 1: now I would argue obviously like I agree with you that we would have to do some real studies.

245
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:47,787
Speaker 1: But I would argue that my guess is to where this legislation is coming from.

246
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:51,090
Speaker 1: is that people are You know, they want to do something about distracted driving.

247
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,990
Speaker 1: We know it's a real problem and they can't easily legislate against things like eating an apple.

248
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:14,970
Speaker 1: I mean look how much trouble they had even trying to make the phone talking stuff Despite the fact that the evidence shows that talking on any phone hands free or not has equal damage to your ability to navigate safely, but Most of the most of the commentary I see on this people saying yeah, you shouldn't even use a GPS.

249
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:24,055
Speaker 1: Just read a map, but I have seen studies saying that the safest way to navigate in unfamiliar terrain road signs Actually is GPS.

250
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:29,750
Speaker 1: Mmm, but that's assuming you have situational awareness of the road signs and such.

251
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:34,950
Speaker 1: But for example, imagine if you have to take a detour and you know, you memorized your route.

252
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:43,698
Speaker 1: You printed some map quest you looked at maps along the way, but you didn't memorize like, you know bumblefuck town next to the highway Halfway along your route.

253
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,489
Speaker 1: You can't memorize every map in the world.

254
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:47,134
Speaker 1: So what's safer?

255
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:53,110
Speaker 0: trying to look at a map while you're driving trying to hit your phone and tell it to reroute or the GPS That automatically reroute exactly.

256
00:17:53,291 --> 00:18:01,124
Speaker 1: So I think this whole thing's silly and driven probably I'm gonna stereotype here By old people who are mad about GPS is who knows.

257
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:08,017
Speaker 1: but uh The NH TSA was in the news again Because they miss have something interesting.

258
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:11,590
Speaker 1: They said that every driver's ed in America teaches bullshit way to drive.

259
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:12,980
Speaker 0: That might be true.

260
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:22,843
Speaker 1: the specific one They say is that putting your hands at 10 and 2 which is what everyone says you should do Which actually I was taught in real driving school specifically not to do.

261
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:25,170
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm is a terrible way to drive.

262
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:26,914
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter.

263
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,461
Speaker 0: Yes, it does matter that much.

264
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:28,601
Speaker 0: Yes.

265
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:29,666
Speaker 0: It does your hands Scott.

266
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,730
Speaker 1: Have you ever heard of push-pull?

267
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,461
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of different like sort of techniques to turning.

268
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:41,010
Speaker 1: push-pull is when you put your hands lower And when you want to turn right instead of like kind of pulling with your left hand like over the top.

269
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:53,274
Speaker 1: Your hand is lower and you push up with the right hand and you have a lot more maneuvering and movement of the wheel before the other hand has to take over, you know, I never really thought about how I and Think about it.

270
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:56,150
Speaker 1: you often you probably hand overhand it when you're turning quickly.

271
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:57,255
Speaker 0: I don't know how.

272
00:18:57,275 --> 00:19:09,570
Speaker 0: I'm just trying to imagine doing it, but I can't because it's like Imagining it versus you know, it's not you know, and because I'm consciously thinking about it I'm not sure how I do it when it's just a motor reflex and I'm not doing it.

273
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:16,269
Speaker 1: so I guess the driving instruction I got because I learned a little bit from some police and from other some other people that were Interesting as opposed to just driver's ed.

274
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:21,150
Speaker 1: They talked a lot about like when to do hand over hand and where to put your hands and how would you put your hands?

275
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:22,420
Speaker 1: all that stuff.

276
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:36,362
Speaker 1: and Basically, the the reason they're bringing this up isn't the control factor though I've seen many studies talking about how it's better to put your hands different positions Yeah But it's that airbags will break your arms if you're attending to

277
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:36,964
Speaker 0: that is true

278
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:40,978
Speaker 1: or that your hands will be knocked off of the wheel And you won't be able to control the car as easily.

279
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:41,781
Speaker 0: That's also true.

280
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:43,750
Speaker 0: didn't think about that, but it's absolutely true.

281
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:45,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think about that at all.

282
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,290
Speaker 1: I saw the article and I was thinking all about like technique one thing I was driving And they were like airbags.

283
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:57,790
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh one thing I always wondered right is like you look and it's like every car has a circle steering wheel, right?

284
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,180
Speaker 0: But you look at like f1 cars and they sort of this rectangular steering with handles on the side.

285
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:08,308
Speaker 1: Also, that's think about the wheel play of how how far you do they have to hand overhand that thing?

286
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:18,986
Speaker 0: No This is the thing that I'm getting to right an f1 car if you turn it like basically like, you know 90 degrees to the left that's all the way left and 90 degrees to the right.

287
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:19,910
Speaker 0: That's all the way, right?

288
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,392
Speaker 0: It doesn't?

289
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:24,028
Speaker 0: you don't turn it around more than one, you know, so Scott the reason why are the dry?

290
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,667
Speaker 0: Why are the steering wheels in cars?

291
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:32,426
Speaker 0: So Unsensitive that you have to turn them so much because we could easily change that.

292
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,409
Speaker 1: No, we can't.

293
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,473
Speaker 1: There's a lot of one.

294
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:39,529
Speaker 1: the faster you're going the more effect the slight angle of the wheel has on your.

295
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:41,168
Speaker 1: you know Vector mm-hmm.

296
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:49,069
Speaker 1: So and f1 car is going so fast that you need the ultra sensitive one because the tiniest little will to put the car crazily in a different direction.

297
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:53,341
Speaker 1: So and also they're driving in a very different kind of environment.

298
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:54,905
Speaker 1: The wheels are different.

299
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,570
Speaker 1: almost everything about those cars is different.

300
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:00,270
Speaker 1: Normal cars have to drive at both five to ten miles an hour.

301
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,506
Speaker 1: You know parking parking lots maneuvering around and eighty ninety miles an hour on the freeway.

302
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:15,497
Speaker 1: You need a wheel Ratio that fits all of those situations and don't say dynamic because there's no safe and Cost-effective way to do that in current cars.

303
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,025
Speaker 0: Your steering is power controlled.

304
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,530
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's drive by wire.

305
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,192
Speaker 0: You're not right.

306
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,176
Speaker 0: who's right?

307
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,850
Speaker 0: unless you your power steering fails and you have to use like crack and pain.

308
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,308
Speaker 1: I'll use a simpler argument rather than trying to get into the details of it.

309
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,850
Speaker 1: Would you trust the average person on the road if they had an extremely sensitive steering wheel?

310
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,343
Speaker 0: They're already not trustworthy on the road.

311
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:36,429
Speaker 0: So what difference does it make?

312
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,798
Speaker 1: I would argue would probably make them work.

313
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,806
Speaker 0: At least it should be customizable.

314
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:43,754
Speaker 1: also a Power steering can fail.

315
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:52,350
Speaker 1: it does and having the your car has failed in your ass and having the early Means you can still leverage the wheel and bring yourself to all stop.

316
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:55,235
Speaker 0: That's true.

317
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:57,050
Speaker 1: there are a lot of reasons why we use the circle.

318
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:05,429
Speaker 0: I mean some people say would you but then again even if you have the ultra sensitive steering wheel if it fails it could unlock And then you could spin it around a whole bunch of times.

319
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:11,410
Speaker 1: Yes You really want normal people driving cars to have a wheel sensitivity that changes on them all of a sudden.

320
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,165
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's you know, it's if it feels natural.

321
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,330
Speaker 0: You won't even realize it, right?

322
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,287
Speaker 0: Just sort of you know.

323
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,655
Speaker 0: No, like you won't.

324
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:29,030
Speaker 0: even people won't even realize their wheel sensitive is changing even though it is if it's done properly Unless it changes in an emergency situation like that and they never run into emergency situations.

325
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:33,124
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know if the power steering is out the card be like holy fuck.

326
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:34,288
Speaker 0: your steering is broken.

327
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:35,850
Speaker 1: now It's all moot.

328
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:37,177
Speaker 1: You know why we don't need to change?

329
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:42,024
Speaker 1: because robot cars will be here before We could train people to use something other than the current wheel.

330
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:44,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope so Doesn't matter.

331
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:53,430
Speaker 1: I just thought it was interesting that the NHTSA came in on two things and I agree with one and disagree with one and I don't know the bunch of times.

332
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,490
Speaker 1: It's synchronicity.

333
00:22:54,751 --> 00:23:00,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, so here's pretty much the biggest tech ish story that there is period going around the Internet's these days.

334
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,059
Speaker 0: That's the Facebook password deal, right?

335
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,150
Speaker 1: Not the mega upload thing, which is still pretty big news.

336
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,443
Speaker 0: That's a little older story, but it's you know, it's still going.

337
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,090
Speaker 0: This is this is the big one right now.

338
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,263
Speaker 0: At least it's definitely the higher headline in Google News.

339
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:15,931
Speaker 1: This has been going on Stories about this for like the last four Right.

340
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:46,978
Speaker 0: Well the deal is that for months and for quite a while right companies and schools and all kinds of various people right have been sort of asking and or forcing and or Coercing potential employees current employees students whoever someone in subservient positions, you know Or disadvantaged bargaining positions to give up You know Facebook passwords email passwords or to log into accounts and let people, you know teachers, you know administrators Yeah Bosses potential bosses.

341
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:50,537
Speaker 0: Now, look, we're not at their private information We're not talking about.

342
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:52,970
Speaker 1: tell me what your Facebook account ID is.

343
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:55,630
Speaker 1: I have things to say about that too, but that's not this problem, right?

344
00:23:56,652 --> 00:24:00,630
Speaker 0: And then you know look at those things before deciding to hire.

345
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:01,514
Speaker 0: Suspend.

346
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:05,090
Speaker 0: all kinds of things right schools jobs all kinds of places not just school.

347
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,545
Speaker 0: Those are the only ones I can think of right now.

348
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:15,285
Speaker 0: And the reason this is news because it's been ongoing Is that Facebook came out and they're gonna try to fight this shit, which is like fuck.

349
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:16,870
Speaker 0: Yeah Facebook you go for it.

350
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,929
Speaker 0: Yep, right because it's really like no matter how much we tell people right and I can't reiterate this enough.

351
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:34,590
Speaker 0: under no circumstances None whatsoever Should you ever tell any other human being on the planet Earth past present future living or dead?

352
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,510
Speaker 0: Your password to anything not even your spouse not even your own mother.

353
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:45,646
Speaker 1: I'm going to qualify that with some exceptions not even anything.

354
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,887
Speaker 1: It's not exception one old systems where there isn't the concept of users.

355
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:52,870
Speaker 1: There is a password.

356
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,266
Speaker 0: Well, okay that isn't your password then is it?

357
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,526
Speaker 1: ah Okay, so you as long as it cuz and secondly upgrade that shit fast.

358
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,510
Speaker 0: That should be priority.

359
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,774
Speaker 0: You know there are.

360
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:10,028
Speaker 1: there are things like a shared account for specific purposes that can make sense though There are usually better ways to go about it.

361
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:20,922
Speaker 1: Not every system allows right but if it's your personal thing that is like basically email Facebook like your slash dot account anything like that Never ever ever ever right.

362
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:23,012
Speaker 0: and you might be thinking well, wait a minute There is.

363
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:28,249
Speaker 0: you might be thinking wait, there must be a crazy situation where you have to for example rim I die.

364
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,366
Speaker 0: I'm the only one with the passwords like the geek nights web server.

365
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,070
Speaker 0: I need to fix that.

366
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, so your password should be in escrow with the lawyer.

367
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:38,276
Speaker 0: That's not even necessary because I'm dead.

368
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:48,992
Speaker 0: you and the lawyers can go to line ode and You can get the account reset and transfer it over to you because when you inherit the things that belong to me you inherit Belong.

369
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 1: what if for example, I use Windows encryption So my account is encrypted and unless you actually know the password there is no way to get the data?

370
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,742
Speaker 0: This is why you have some sort of thing in a safe deposit box.

371
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:02,183
Speaker 1: Yes.

372
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:02,926
Speaker 0: Someone can inherit.

373
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,389
Speaker 0: it's called escrow But that's not telling it to anyone.

374
00:26:05,892 --> 00:26:10,490
Speaker 0: That's putting it in a safe deposit box or the key and then someone can inherit that key when you are dead?

375
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,355
Speaker 1: Yep at best the the same as the keys to your house Even if you tell it to someone.

376
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:21,830
Speaker 1: that would be a situation where you give it in confidence to for example an escrow company And there's a reason why you can't encrypt.

377
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,730
Speaker 0: There's no reason to tell it to a person though.

378
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,170
Speaker 0: You could just put it on a piece of paper in a safe box that no one looks at but you anyway.

379
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:36,650
Speaker 1: The the sheer idea that anyone would ask you for something so blatant, you know Even you know edge cases aside for your Facebook.

380
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:37,152
Speaker 1: And

381
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:54,704
Speaker 0: the thing is even someone who is smart enough to know this rule because you know that you should never tell it to anyone Ever even a smart person who knows that and I'm sure most of the listeners already are smart enough to know that There are situations where you could be disadvantaged, you know and sort of you know be coerced or forced into giving it up.

382
00:26:54,764 --> 00:27:08,180
Speaker 0: if I'm desperate for a job and I can't Even eat and some guy says hey if you want this job, it's the only job you can get fucker Let me look at your Facebook to make sure that you know, you're kosher Even though you know, it's bad.

383
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:11,596
Speaker 0: You might be willing to do it Yep, and that the thing is.

384
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:14,124
Speaker 1: that's why we need someone like Facebook to not.

385
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,854
Speaker 0: you didn't even get socially engineered Right.

386
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,469
Speaker 0: You just got socially owned which is not fair Yep.

387
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:24,150
Speaker 1: So we need someone big a juggernaut with money to take this to court and fight it cuz they'll win.

388
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:39,281
Speaker 1: they'll win so hard for reasons I don't really want to bother getting into but yeah, but One thing I could say is that I have asked that question before occasionally when I've interviewed people Because if they if they agree they stop easily.

389
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:40,384
Speaker 0: no and you never hire them.

390
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:41,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would.

391
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:42,230
Speaker 1: that's basically a deal-breaker.

392
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:44,050
Speaker 1: Anyone who would give me their password?

393
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see no not safe.

394
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,582
Speaker 0: I see no problem with the actual asking.

395
00:27:48,642 --> 00:28:00,508
Speaker 1: right if you want to ask someone for their path Because actually the laws will probably say that you cannot even ask because you can't even ask for example What someone's gender identity is you can't ask them how old they are.

396
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:02,214
Speaker 0: That's different.

397
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,710
Speaker 0: that's only in a job situation, but that's the job situation.

398
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,349
Speaker 0: But I mean, I'm just saying, you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with asking someone.

399
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,260
Speaker 0: Here's one a rim.

400
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,290
Speaker 0: Do you want to tell me your password?

401
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,710
Speaker 1: So Scott if I am interviewing you for a job and I ask you that it could be a problem.

402
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:30,929
Speaker 1: You want to know why your Facebook account may well have information about you that I'm not allowed to ask about like religion race Of course Sexual orientation, but I'm saying it's if you actually were to look at the Facebook account with that pass.

403
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:39,140
Speaker 1: Oh Most of the laws are geared around asking the question Mmm or asking for access, but that's.

404
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,224
Speaker 0: I'm talking about morality.

405
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:40,967
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't care about.

406
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,493
Speaker 0: you know, the laws are crazy Whatever.

407
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:44,788
Speaker 0: I don't not a lawyer, but I'm saying I don't think you know.

408
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,759
Speaker 0: personally I don't feel there's anything wrong with asking the question.

409
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:57,250
Speaker 0: I feel if you answer it truthfully you're dumb and - you shouldn't look and you should just say yeah, I'm not hiring you because obviously you're a security threat to this company.

410
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:08,645
Speaker 1: Well, the important thing is that Facebook is fighting this because non technologists Especially people who are also in a desperate economic situation are pretty much fucked and would have to you know Give up whatever the person asks.

411
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:09,069
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

412
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:18,170
Speaker 0: So we need someone to fight for them and I guess Facebook's the only one who's yeah Well Facebook says there it could take legal action, but it has no immediate plans to sue any specific employers.

413
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:24,629
Speaker 0: So I think basically this is the ultimatum which is like hey stop doing it or we're coming we're gonna.

414
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:27,621
Speaker 0: you know We could come after you and you'll see.

415
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:36,809
Speaker 0: if any I'm sure if the someone who was like a huge Continuous flagrant violator will be targeted by the lawyers to bring the smackdown to set an example if this wasn't enough.

416
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:46,079
Speaker 1: so Japan They don't really have free speech in Japan, but Japan did the thing that everyone drives As free as it is here.

417
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:56,669
Speaker 1: well, yeah most places aren't yeah But they did the thing that a lot of people try to do and I'm not I don't want to talk about the details of This I want to talk about it kind of a more fundamental problem here.

418
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:02,989
Speaker 1: So the Japanese court ordered ordered Google to disable auto complete for its search engine.

419
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:07,770
Speaker 0: So just for everybody period yep, or at least all the autocompute or at least everyone in Japan.

420
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,999
Speaker 0: So just turn off all autocompletes everywhere.

421
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,240
Speaker 1: Yep.

422
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,185
Speaker 1: And now it's not like.

423
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,450
Speaker 1: this was a you know a pending.

424
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:14,659
Speaker 1: This was the court straight-up ordered it.

425
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:16,225
Speaker 1: Google said fuck you.

426
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:24,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course But basically the reason is that someone in Japan filed suit saying that if you type his name into autocomplete.

427
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:31,850
Speaker 1: Most of the suggestions are associated with criminal behavior because apparently there's someone with the same name as him who was a criminal.

428
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,016
Speaker 0: Alright, there's a lot of.

429
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:35,621
Speaker 0: there's a lot of people named Scott Reuben.

430
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:39,097
Speaker 0: if you type in Scott Reuben and it starts to autocomplete Let's see what happens.

431
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:39,722
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

432
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:52,039
Speaker 0: so The that's an old news, you know, Google says producer filmography Willow Creek Facebook, so, you know, oh I'm not a Producer, right?

433
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:52,764
Speaker 0: This is bullshit.

434
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:55,072
Speaker 0: This is false advertising Right.

435
00:30:55,193 --> 00:30:59,507
Speaker 1: I'm see what I want to talk about the fact that Google said no and that Japan tried this crap.

436
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,341
Speaker 1: and the people don't understand Technology, it's old news the new.

437
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 1: the interesting part here Is that the common theme in a lot of these problems isn't even people trying to hide information about themselves though that may be the case here, but How can we live in a world where any human being?

438
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,409
Speaker 1: Would do a Google search for someone maybe because they're hiring them or whatever?

439
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:33,264
Speaker 1: look at the first hit they see and Blindly assume that is in fact John Smith the serial rapist As opposed to John Smith the guy who applied for a job like.

440
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:35,089
Speaker 1: in what world is that?

441
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,824
Speaker 1: Actually a problem and apparently this one.

442
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:40,536
Speaker 0: Yeah There was a great.

443
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:41,319
Speaker 0: Oh, what was it?

444
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,741
Speaker 0: Hold on.

445
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:42,626
Speaker 0: I got a fine.

446
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:43,390
Speaker 0: Hope it's still there.

447
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:44,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, here it is.

448
00:31:44,294 --> 00:31:53,089
Speaker 0: The top link on reddit as we speak says The title of it is Samuel Clemens dropping the knowledge and as you know, that's Mark Twain, right?

449
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:55,102
Speaker 0: So It says right here.

450
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,334
Speaker 0: This is the quote Censorship is telling a man.

451
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:04,870
Speaker 0: He can't have a steak just because a baby can't chew it and that is so appropriate to this.

452
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,089
Speaker 1: That's one of my favorite.

453
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:10,587
Speaker 1: Okay, so if I type rim I get of Bedford, how about the underwear brand?

454
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,170
Speaker 0: is it still around?

455
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:18,678
Speaker 1: Oh, well it is but the if I the autocomplete is rim of Bedford, okay, uh, which is in Brooklyn.

456
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,643
Speaker 0: Yeah bed stay.

457
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:21,906
Speaker 1: Oh, there's also rim incorporated.

458
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:22,849
Speaker 1: That's the underwear I think.

459
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:24,537
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

460
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,140
Speaker 1: All right.

461
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,710
Speaker 1: What do they make trying to figure this out?

462
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:36,836
Speaker 0: so just because a baby can't tell the difference between rim the podcaster and the clock setter and Rim the underwear company Doesn't mean that we should.

463
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:41,330
Speaker 0: smart people should not be able to have our stake of Google autocomplete.

464
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,397
Speaker 0: Just cuz babies can't chew it.

465
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,226
Speaker 0: and that is censorship which is all over in Japan.

466
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:47,310
Speaker 0: Japan censors the porn.

467
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,949
Speaker 0: They put the mosaics over it.

468
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:55,570
Speaker 0: They censor political speeches actually rules about like, you know, how many flyers you can send out during elections and stuff like that.

469
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:02,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, now that's a complicated issue because obviously I'm not saying it's good or bad I'm just saying it is censorship and they have it in many areas.

470
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:03,281
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:33:03,402 --> 00:33:14,962
Speaker 0: They were their recent talks about those laws censoring various mangas or animes in Tokyo that were threatening and so they have all kinds of stuff that is censoring over there and in Most countries in the world right?

472
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:19,905
Speaker 0: Japan is not alone You know, they're just a little more sensory than us and a little less sensory than China.

473
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,110
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's just how it goes.

474
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:23,398
Speaker 1: So you have another news.

475
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,284
Speaker 1: you want me to keep going?

476
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,802
Speaker 0: I Pretty much don't have news, but I can look for one.

477
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:34,400
Speaker 1: All right, so an MIT professor This is an interesting article Basically made a very lofty statement a y+50 which we know.

478
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,082
Speaker 1: y+30 is impossible.

479
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:38,874
Speaker 1: So I can't imagine.

480
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:43,065
Speaker 1: y+50 argues that it is possible that within 50 years.

481
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:48,122
Speaker 1: We as humans can literally end Disability in any practical sense.

482
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:49,930
Speaker 0: I don't know if I believe that.

483
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,830
Speaker 0: I mean I see where he's going right because we have managed to counter even today a lot of disabilities, right?

484
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:07,733
Speaker 0: Some blind people depending on the cause of blindness can be made to see again with things like eye donations or you know Implanting like cameras into your body that are wired into your nerves or brain, you know We can.

485
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:09,489
Speaker 0: people can see like that with low resolution.

486
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:17,746
Speaker 0: We've got all sorts of you know ear implants to fix some forms of hearing loss now already in with cochlear implants are where you see the first.

487
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:29,426
Speaker 1: it's more I think social problems are going to be a much bigger drain on this being reality than Technological problem because the reason he made there are people who've lost limbs.

488
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,110
Speaker 0: obviously now

489
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:42,893
Speaker 1: The reason he believes this is actually kind of sad but also hopeful that the two wars America started recently brought back a huge number of severely disabled people and This is

490
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,310
Speaker 0: called only certain kinds of disabilities though

491
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:57,666
Speaker 1: but this has caused a huge explosion in the prosthetics industry and prosthetics research and Actually, it's been kind of quietly advancing for the past decade to a degree that is almost ludicrous.

492
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:09,510
Speaker 1: and he has all these examples of Basically most of the prosthetics that are advanced today that we're seeing like on TV like the runners and the climbers and everything Didn't exist until very recently and are progressing very rapidly.

493
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean if you're only talking about that kind of disability, you know the missing limb sort of disability.

494
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:30,430
Speaker 0: Then I actually probably agree with him that in 50 years if you have that kind of disability and you can afford it That you will be able to basically not only you know that you know Have some sort of replacement part that is basically equivalent to the lost part or perhaps even better

495
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,095
Speaker 1: Although while

496
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:37,575
Speaker 0: it may risk, you know be equivalent motor function, you know, you can walk you can pick things up You can do all those things.

497
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,430
Speaker 0: I don't know if we'll actually be able to restore full feeling.

498
00:35:43,071 --> 00:35:52,024
Speaker 0: You know, maybe in 50 years they'll definitely will be some amount of feeling restoration, but that's a very narrow Category of disability true, but what if you have?

499
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,410
Speaker 0: what if we expand this a little bit?

500
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:00,563
Speaker 1: I mean, we're already at the point where there are a lot of severe genetic disorders or Congenital disorders that can be detected in the womb.

501
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:04,450
Speaker 0: So what if I Are you talking about not having those babies?

502
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:17,090
Speaker 1: Of genetic testing and abortion and You know things like that and also treatments, you know genetic treatments We're able to eliminate maybe not a hundred percent of disability.

503
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:30,403
Speaker 1: But what if we get to the point to where we look at back at a wheelchair and that's this kind of archaic You know old barbaric way people had to get around because yeah Because we're rich people living in the fancy country, right?

504
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:34,361
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be true for the whole world Not at first 50 years that for sure.

505
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:47,070
Speaker 0: Yeah first so, you know Definitely among a class of people who you know hat is does that and is willing to do that and wants to do that Right, and you know does, you know test and not have babies that disabilities.

506
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:50,890
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a lot less of that particular kind of disability.

507
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:58,310
Speaker 0: But there are still even then even then there are still lots of disabilities that come about that you there.

508
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,984
Speaker 0: We still don't see them coming and there's not much we can do about it.

509
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:03,450
Speaker 0: like we're making Hawking, right?

510
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,254
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fix Stephen Hawking in 50 years.

511
00:37:05,274 --> 00:37:05,916
Speaker 0: I don't think.

512
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:13,416
Speaker 1: maybe actually we're like to see we're making surprising strides in a lot of Neurodegenerative order disorders and things like that.

513
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:18,110
Speaker 1: if I don't see 50 years, right 50 years in current science is a law.

514
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:21,840
Speaker 0: But I don't see I do a hundred percent fit.

515
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,645
Speaker 0: He's talking a hundred percent fixing.

516
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:24,567
Speaker 0: No disability.

517
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:24,708
Speaker 0: Yeah.

518
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:27,237
Speaker 0: No, I You know, that's the stretch Scott.

519
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,164
Speaker 1: I think he's being a little bit.

520
00:37:29,185 --> 00:37:32,490
Speaker 1: I Think he's being a little exaggerated on purpose.

521
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, no kidding.

522
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:47,793
Speaker 1: But also I think for people who can afford them and at least, you know for the West for the like the industrialized world I think within 50 years there will be a great decrease in the occurrences of any sort of Visible disability.

523
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:53,250
Speaker 0: and people I would say that you know plus, you know, I guess also I just want to toss this aside in there.

524
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,470
Speaker 0: Right, there are things that technically legally count as disability but aren't disability.

525
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,870
Speaker 0: Like if you're pregnant as this, you know, you can get disability payment, whatever and we won't have babies in 50 years.

526
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:02,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

527
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:21,123
Speaker 0: But I think that is definitely true Right that there is has been and continues to be a huge increase in our you know technological ability to Assist or mitigate disabilities of a wide array and that the trend is clearly Going upwards and will not cease.

528
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:26,601
Speaker 0: and with such a long runway There will be a ginormous amount of progress in that area.

529
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:37,858
Speaker 1: Now what I do wonder is that look at the huge Controversy in the deaf community over cochlear implants even though it's more and more youth Don't see a controversy at all and think the whole thing's ridiculous.

530
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,187
Speaker 1: But I wonder if we'll see the same thing with the wheelchair.

531
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:48,650
Speaker 1: I Wonder if there will be people who will argue that we should keep the wheelchair even if we have a in every way better solution.

532
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:49,817
Speaker 0: Well, what are you doing?

533
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:50,360
Speaker 0: Is it right?

534
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,070
Speaker 0: this brings in all sorts of other questions, right?

535
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:58,089
Speaker 0: Like okay, we can repair legs and make them awesome right just like we have the perfect leg replacements robot leg.

536
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,121
Speaker 0: Yep Okay, so who uses wheelchairs?

537
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:01,964
Speaker 0: because they can't walk?

538
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:05,417
Speaker 0: a lot of people some people Because they lost a leg.

539
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,950
Speaker 0: Okay, obviously you lose a leg you get a robot leg.

540
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:09,621
Speaker 0: No one's really gonna argue with that right?

541
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,967
Speaker 0: What if I never had a leg?

542
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,500
Speaker 0: Okay, well maybe robot leg not.

543
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,150
Speaker 0: maybe no one's really gonna complain about that.

544
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:25,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see what if I'm an old lady or an old dude and my leg is just all weak Should I go get her and I'm using a wheelchair?

545
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:30,190
Speaker 0: cuz I've you know I just have we got legs of 90 years old that I go get robot leg.

546
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,611
Speaker 0: That

547
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:48,024
Speaker 1: is a personal choice and I think once again that independent of all other factors The biggest thing that will hold this back in the next 50 years will just be people's hesitance to give up their humanity Mm-hmm and or people's hesitance to Experience invasive surgery and also, you know, there will be physical things

548
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,430
Speaker 0: whether there's nothing wrong with my leg.

549
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:58,430
Speaker 0: I just want to win the running race And I go and you know, but then there's some law that says oh you can only get robot leg if you lost your leg.

550
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:02,365
Speaker 1: You know quote legitimate, but then there will be a rise in oops.

551
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:03,750
Speaker 1: I got run over by a car.

552
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:05,996
Speaker 1: Oops, just on my leg.

553
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:08,930
Speaker 0: I fucked around with the Mafia on purpose.

554
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,490
Speaker 1: Somehow I don't think the Mafia would leave you in a position to get a robot leg.

555
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:18,245
Speaker 1: I'm just saying unless you were assuming the break in the nose thing is they don't know.

556
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,850
Speaker 0: is that I'm still with the Mafia?

557
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,869
Speaker 0: They're gonna bet on me and they're in the robot leg race.

558
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:24,996
Speaker 0: Right, we're gonna.

559
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:27,605
Speaker 0: they run over my legs then I got robot leg.

560
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:32,050
Speaker 0: then they Spend a lot of money to get the even better robot leg.

561
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,430
Speaker 0: We're getting into the robot race and the mafia is betting on me in the robot race.

562
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:38,258
Speaker 1: I think in 50 years, we're gonna see.

563
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,417
Speaker 0: maybe if I'll say this within a hundred years I'm like the boxer who throws all the fights.

564
00:40:42,618 --> 00:40:54,459
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna have a surprising an Analog to the ghost in the shell world where the ultra-rich who need it actually have completely aesthetic bodies and pretty much any good Sci-fi, you're gonna find some analog in the real world.

565
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:55,302
Speaker 0: That's just how it works.

566
00:40:55,724 --> 00:40:57,210
Speaker 0: Oh, gee, we're living in the brave new world world.

567
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:57,472
Speaker 0: Yep.

568
00:40:57,613 --> 00:40:58,340
Speaker 0: Oh, we're living in the 1984.

569
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,400
Speaker 0: Yep.

570
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:06,850
Speaker 1: Yeah I think goes in the shell is more Predictive of our current social trends than a lot of other science fiction.

571
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:10,622
Speaker 0: Well, obviously if you just take all the science fiction there ever was sure.

572
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:14,870
Speaker 0: but I'm talking about the good stuff the stuff that's relevant The people that people know and keep bringing up.

573
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know why.

574
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:19,930
Speaker 0: the people know it and keep bringing it up because it partially came true and is coming more true.

575
00:41:20,372 --> 00:41:22,561
Speaker 1: Make a second to suggest it's the other way around.

576
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:24,006
Speaker 1: those people are still in college.

577
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:24,850
Speaker 0: That's right.

578
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,416
Speaker 0: But it's you know, this is what you don't realize.

579
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:27,460
Speaker 0: It's the other way around.

580
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:30,239
Speaker 0: why you know, it's like oh the good stuff comes true It's like.

581
00:41:30,301 --> 00:41:31,879
Speaker 0: no It's not.

582
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:46,010
Speaker 0: it's you know It is the good stuff because it already is or has or is coming true or it's an idea That's so either disturbing or pervasive or appealing that people are kind of in the last questions coming.

583
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:48,089
Speaker 1: Society is guided toward it.

584
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:55,150
Speaker 1: I mean how much of our scientific advancement has Mirrored science fiction partly because people are inspired by science fiction.

585
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, at what point is our society a feedback loop?

586
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:58,822
Speaker 0: even they're made of meat.

587
00:41:59,043 --> 00:41:59,585
Speaker 0: It's coming true.

588
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:00,307
Speaker 1: Is it?

589
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:02,881
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, we are made of meat.

590
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:06,716
Speaker 1: I know we haven't True.

591
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,481
Speaker 1: in fact, it's becoming less true.

592
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,767
Speaker 1: We're replacing our meat with non-meat.

593
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:14,340
Speaker 0: The opposite is happening I know but that's the whole story.

594
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,922
Speaker 0: You don't get it.

595
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,550
Speaker 0: Where are the visiting guys?

596
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I forgot that we used to be made of meat.

597
00:42:19,843 --> 00:42:20,265
Speaker 1: Not yet.

598
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:21,330
Speaker 1: There's no one to visit.

599
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:22,156
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen.

600
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:22,902
Speaker 1: Maybe there will be.

601
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:23,466
Speaker 0: it's coming.

602
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:28,562
Speaker 1: That's coming But for example 1984 only came to pass it like in North Korea.

603
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,930
Speaker 0: Hey, it just is it for someone.

604
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,618
Speaker 0: That's the most relevant book there.

605
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,910
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, you got a news or I gotta keep going.

606
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pretty much didn't find any tech news.

607
00:42:37,741 --> 00:42:39,390
Speaker 0: cuz like I said, I'm not reading that much internet.

608
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:40,688
Speaker 0: How did you want to give and go here?

609
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:42,819
Speaker 1: Let's do one more.

610
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:43,242
Speaker 1: I don't want to.

611
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:44,450
Speaker 1: I'll skip the Interpol thing.

612
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:47,882
Speaker 1: Let's talk about mega upload because I got a lot to say about that.

613
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:48,123
Speaker 0: Okay.

614
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:48,424
Speaker 0: Okay.

615
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,815
Speaker 1: No, not not the court case Not piracy.

616
00:42:51,057 --> 00:42:53,630
Speaker 1: We're not gonna have any of the arguments that anyone else has had.

617
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,492
Speaker 1: There's a problem.

618
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:58,083
Speaker 0: the same argument we've been having for 15 years did not anticipate.

619
00:42:58,665 --> 00:43:00,430
Speaker 1: so mega upload paid for hosting.

620
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone hosted all that data.

621
00:43:02,837 --> 00:43:03,379
Speaker 1: Yep.

622
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:06,047
Speaker 0: Well, they hosted in quite a few places mega upload.

623
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:13,539
Speaker 1: Uh Can't make any more money because of court injunctions and the fact that their The sites down.

624
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:16,789
Speaker 1: yeah law enforcement wants access to that data.

625
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:26,718
Speaker 1: So do all of the legitimate customers of the company The people who are hosting the data Don't want to host it for free and shouldn't have to?

626
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:35,430
Speaker 1: if mega upload weren't under any sort of legal injunction and they just you Know stop paying that ISP would probably just delete their goddamn data.

627
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:44,650
Speaker 1: But now we're in a situation where whose Obligation is it to pay the hosting company to continue to host mega uploads data?

628
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,530
Speaker 1: Until the court case is sorted out because there are legitimate customers who have a legitimate claim to that data.

629
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:52,172
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

630
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,643
Speaker 1: I don't know what the answer is other than that.

631
00:43:54,743 --> 00:44:00,649
Speaker 1: I feel like the prosecution which in this case may or may not be involving the government.

632
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:07,753
Speaker 1: or Maybe the government or the courts should pay it for the time being and then whoever loses the case may or may not have to Pay it in the end.

633
00:44:07,874 --> 00:44:10,810
Speaker 0: Well, I just wonder what normally happens in these situations, right?

634
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:20,870
Speaker 0: like what if you know the government, you know comes and You know, I have a small business and the government, you know shuts me down, but I'm innocent till proven guilty, right?

635
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,220
Speaker 0: But there's a court injunction that shuts me down, right?

636
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:25,430
Speaker 0: So what normally happens?

637
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,130
Speaker 0: How do I pay my electric bill and that who pays my electric bill in that situation, right?

638
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,730
Speaker 0: Do I have to pay it for my savings, you know, obviously if I win the case do I get the money back?

639
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:34,552
Speaker 0: You know.

640
00:44:34,653 --> 00:44:35,074
Speaker 0: and then what?

641
00:44:35,114 --> 00:44:40,595
Speaker 0: if the elect, you know, I don't that was all my money and I get my electricity shut off You know, do I just have to?

642
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:44,567
Speaker 0: I'm pretty much just fucked until you know the.

643
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:50,152
Speaker 0: you know Get proven innocent and then get you know, some sort of compensation, you know there are a lot of.

644
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:59,863
Speaker 0: I just read a story about a guy who was wrongfully in jail for a long fucking time and Just because he was in Washington State He didn't get shit that he just got set free.

645
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:03,279
Speaker 0: and that was it where if he was in another state He would have gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars.

646
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:05,629
Speaker 1: I feel like so in cases like this.

647
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:11,321
Speaker 1: it's one of those situations where there is no good answer and Whenever there's no good answer.

648
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:12,690
Speaker 1: There's a government answer, right?

649
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:18,750
Speaker 1: And it's like I think the government should front this money out of tax dollars because there's no better option.

650
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:19,435
Speaker 0: That's right.

651
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:20,323
Speaker 0: And it's like you can't?

652
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:21,049
Speaker 0: you know?

653
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:27,710
Speaker 0: Just and your thing is you're not just punishing the dude right, you know innocence of proven guilty, whatever.

654
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,430
Speaker 0: He has customers that you're punishing.

655
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,635
Speaker 0: What if I was a dry cleaner?

656
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,363
Speaker 0: and how these clothes in there?

657
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:36,141
Speaker 0: and but you shut my ass down now What about all these people who own those fucking clothes?

658
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:38,110
Speaker 1: I wasn't laundering money through the dry cleaner.

659
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:43,440
Speaker 0: I dropped off an $800 suit to be dry clean and now you can't get it Right because you can't.

660
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,831
Speaker 0: and it's like cuz they you know The.

661
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:48,750
Speaker 0: I didn't pay rent and the building is closed and the landlord refuses to open it.

662
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:53,288
Speaker 0: Now you got to sue the landlord which means does we had to sue the hosting company to get the files off?

663
00:45:53,308 --> 00:45:59,710
Speaker 0: mega upload You know, but if the government's forcing them to do it, it's like, ah, it's a really really bad situation.

664
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,657
Speaker 1: No, I feel like.

665
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:10,450
Speaker 1: I don't know if this would come to pass But if the government in this case just this particular case We're forced to guarantee the bill for as long as the data had to be held there.

666
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:17,740
Speaker 1: the government would have a sudden big incentive to sort this shit out quickly and Nothing is sorted out quickly.

667
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:19,672
Speaker 0: court shit takes multiple years I know so.

668
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:32,077
Speaker 1: but maybe we could make an incentive structure where the government in the very least Wants to make the data available for some grace period to let everybody download whatever they've got up there that they need and then Shut it down.

669
00:46:32,138 --> 00:46:33,210
Speaker 0: This is one of those situations.

670
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:37,770
Speaker 0: We just I think you just need a judge to come in quickly and fix this thing.

671
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,469
Speaker 0: You know that is clearly holding everything up, right?

672
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,599
Speaker 0: You know, there's this huge limbo.

673
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,585
Speaker 0: you need some smart judge to be like, all right This is what we gonna do, right?

674
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:54,690
Speaker 0: We're gonna put all these servers online and download only mode for you know This period of time or we're gonna make some sort of thing.

675
00:46:54,770 --> 00:47:03,159
Speaker 0: We go through all the legitimate accounts and we mail everyone, you know a disk with their files on it And so, you know or whatever and then that's it.

676
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:04,423
Speaker 0: You just need something.

677
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:06,490
Speaker 0: but the thing is this evidence in there, right?

678
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,259
Speaker 0: So but you don't lose the evidence.

679
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:12,110
Speaker 0: who's supposed to pay for the taking of the care of the evidence?

680
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:21,597
Speaker 1: But in this case in the very least you don't lose the evidence if you let everyone download their stuff and that at least Reduces the total harm Servers around the company.

681
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:28,363
Speaker 1: Yes, the hosting company is getting fucked here But if you let everyone download their stuff It reduces the total harm.

682
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:34,130
Speaker 1: as the result of the court It does all the legitimate customers can get their data and they're no longer involved.

683
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:47,524
Speaker 1: It reduces the problem because now if they do decide to delete the data or the police have to pay for it or whatever They don't have to consider the feelings of all the people who were fucked by, you know The externalities of the situation because they got their data.

684
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:47,886
Speaker 1: They're fine.

685
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,870
Speaker 0: I think that's something else right?

686
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:55,250
Speaker 0: The problem is this hosting company, right and it's like well this stuff is evidence and that's why they're supposed to keep it.

687
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,498
Speaker 0: But where does evidence usually go?

688
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:59,023
Speaker 0: Usually it's confiscated.

689
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:06,088
Speaker 1: Ah, but Scott brought it to an evidence place What is say there was a murder in our apartment like a hobo broke in and then another hobo broke in.

690
00:48:06,128 --> 00:48:06,650
Speaker 1: there's a murder.

691
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:12,549
Speaker 1: So the government, you know the police block off my apartment and they investigate it for like a month that I can't come in.

692
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:15,016
Speaker 1: Do I get compensated?

693
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:15,457
Speaker 0: I don't know.

694
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,205
Speaker 0: what does ask a lawyer what I don't know.

695
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:18,290
Speaker 0: I have no idea what happens.

696
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:21,620
Speaker 1: So but the problem is at least those cases are you know what?

697
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:21,820
Speaker 0: you know?

698
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,047
Speaker 0: who covers that your insurance?

699
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:27,415
Speaker 1: Yep Here's the problem.

700
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:30,710
Speaker 1: Here's why this is an interesting story with these mass.

701
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,720
Speaker 0: I wonder if there's any insurance companies involved in this.

702
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:39,030
Speaker 1: with these massive technology Situations, you know a massive court action that shuts down a server used by millions of people.

703
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:45,990
Speaker 1: It's as though a murder happens in an apartment building and we block off the entire city block.

704
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:50,561
Speaker 1: The scale is so great that we can't just treat this the same way.

705
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,850
Speaker 1: we treat similar situations because far too many people are affected.

706
00:48:54,634 --> 00:49:02,549
Speaker 1: I mean already if there's a you know a death on the freeway We shut the freeway down for like an hour or so and cause huge problems for everyone else while we sort it out.

707
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:04,549
Speaker 1: Imagine if we shut the freeway down for a month.

708
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:09,510
Speaker 1: Are we shot all the freeways down in an entire state because there was one deadly accident?

709
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:13,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know usually this stuff it does, you know doesn't get?

710
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:16,883
Speaker 0: you know It caused a huge ruckus because oh no, we blocked off one dude's apartment.

711
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:19,614
Speaker 0: Well sucks for that one, dude That guy has insurance.

712
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:22,624
Speaker 1: Maybe the you know, the judge is sympathetic and right makes an agreement.

713
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:31,970
Speaker 0: my dry cleaner example one, dude This is thousands upon thousands of people, you know getting held up and the hosting company getting held up big time.

714
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:35,032
Speaker 0: So this is like a you know Isn't something?

715
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:38,824
Speaker 1: that's why the hosting company is the one that filed an emergency motion.

716
00:49:38,864 --> 00:49:41,695
Speaker 1: They're the ones that said look It's an emergency motion.

717
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:42,318
Speaker 0: How can the judge?

718
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:43,524
Speaker 0: it doesn't seem too much of emergency.

719
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,508
Speaker 0: The judge doesn't done shit.

720
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:45,655
Speaker 1: We.

721
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:47,403
Speaker 0: it's an emergency To go.

722
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:47,929
Speaker 0: take care of it.

723
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:53,895
Speaker 1: You want us to keep this data for your evidence and we want to do the right thing and not delete You know all these customers data.

724
00:49:54,598 --> 00:49:57,187
Speaker 1: We just want to guarantee that someone's gonna pay for this.

725
00:49:57,448 --> 00:50:01,837
Speaker 0: Yeah $9,000 a day I heard That's actually not that much money.

726
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:07,623
Speaker 0: in that in the scale of hosting that we're talking I can't think of any reels, you know straight up any.

727
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,390
Speaker 0: all the straight-up answers seem wrong.

728
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,837
Speaker 0: Like should mega upload have to pay?

729
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:13,310
Speaker 0: no not unless you let them restart their business.

730
00:50:13,731 --> 00:50:15,017
Speaker 0: Should the hosting company have to pay?

731
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:17,971
Speaker 0: No, she's the one doesn't pay their bill because the company shuts them There.

732
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:20,843
Speaker 1: should the individual users have to do some sort of class action.

733
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,768
Speaker 1: No, that's BS.

734
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:25,202
Speaker 0: That's also Bureaucracy of the government have to pay.

735
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:26,630
Speaker 0: Well, no, why should the government pay?

736
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,985
Speaker 1: There is an argument that the government should pay because some but it's all.

737
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:42,398
Speaker 1: at the other hand no Yeah But one one function of government is that it deals with the things that private enterprise the free market individual people and society as a whole Cannot deal with.

738
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:51,970
Speaker 0: but that's a huge cost for society to bear especially if it turns out that there actually are guilty and that in the end they do shut down the servers because it's like Oh, we had to pay to keep these fucking servers up.

739
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,261
Speaker 1: That's why I think we need two situations.

740
00:50:54,502 --> 00:50:57,173
Speaker 1: one the government should pay But to.

741
00:50:57,615 --> 00:51:05,250
Speaker 1: the government should have a huge incentive to reduce the stakeholder You know the breadth of stakeholders in the situation as much as possible.

742
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:08,197
Speaker 1: the government should pay for the hosting they should.

743
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:16,766
Speaker 1: the judge should mandate that the company and mega upload allow read-only access to all The files to all their users, even if people download infringing things.

744
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,243
Speaker 1: who cares For?

745
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:18,690
Speaker 0: like judge?

746
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:23,430
Speaker 1: He shouldn't because the infringing stuff is already the court case.

747
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:30,190
Speaker 1: If another five people download an mp3 that damage is far less than the millions of people with legit files.

748
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:35,689
Speaker 0: And then but then right now the RA MPs will sue the judge and the court.

749
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,530
Speaker 1: now I think that this is a case where the judge to have the authority to tell them to go fuck themselves.

750
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,637
Speaker 1: They've already got a pretty solid case.

751
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:45,590
Speaker 0: They're gonna win the case anyway, they're gonna win it actually.

752
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:47,201
Speaker 0: Think it's like 7525 right?

753
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,317
Speaker 0: just It's like normally.

754
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:53,070
Speaker 0: I would say 50/50 just based on you know, whatever.

755
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:54,876
Speaker 1: Well, I have a complicated opinion.

756
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:58,489
Speaker 1: my my personal goal, but corruption goes into there.

757
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,930
Speaker 1: My personal goal is that even though yeah mega upload was pretty much just like the worst pirates.

758
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,283
Speaker 0: But if you look at his case, he's actually working pretty easy.

759
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:11,826
Speaker 0: He's fighting it like the true fight Up on his side.

760
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:23,604
Speaker 1: I hate the RIAA More than I hate most organizations in the world and it's to the point to where I really just want to see him go down Even though I don't want it to be just a straight-up copyright free-for-all.

761
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,370
Speaker 1: I still want there to be music industry.

762
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:26,419
Speaker 1: I want all these things to happen.

763
00:52:26,701 --> 00:52:27,730
Speaker 1: I want a reasonable answer.

764
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:34,849
Speaker 1: The RIAA has excluded all reasonable answers and I really I'll let a lot of things burn down if they get burned down with it.

765
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:37,777
Speaker 1: And I think we're done.
