1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,998
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, April 28th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:10,199
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:13,970
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,577
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,030
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about handwriting and penmanship.

6
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:21,989
Speaker 1: The only classes I ever got Ds in in my entire pre-college life.

7
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,408
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:34,710
Speaker 1: So, as you all know, Emily and I were at PAX East 2022 for all told about four hours on Thursday.

9
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,829
Speaker 1: Because we're really sticking around due to COVID and everything.

10
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,376
Speaker 0: And there were some people getting COVID.

11
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:48,604
Speaker 0: I saw another PAX person today post a photo of a positive rapid test with two solid lines on it.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,334
Speaker 0: Ooh, the solid lines.

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,986
Speaker 1: Mine was like a barely visible line.

14
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:54,730
Speaker 1: Like you could almost not.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,472
Speaker 0: Two solid lines.

16
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:04,750
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, that is a person who, you know, is a person that I, when I go to PAX, I spend time near that person, at least at PAX East.

17
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:10,166
Speaker 0: And I probably would have gotten sick from them if I had done a normal PAX East.

18
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,570
Speaker 0: It is a good chance I would have gotten sick from that person.

19
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,392
Speaker 1: Yep.

20
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:17,300
Speaker 1: And I'm going to be just very direct about this.

21
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:23,229
Speaker 1: Had I not, and Emily not, already gotten COVID because of my job like a month ago.

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,949
Speaker 0: I don't know how much that really, you know.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:32,930
Speaker 1: No, I mean, if I hadn't already gotten it, I would have canceled because the numbers seemed too high and I feel like I would have been corrected.

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,020
Speaker 0: The number is going up.

25
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:34,907
Speaker 0: I don't like it.

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:45,990
Speaker 1: But this, according to my doctor and the CDC, the, the like extra immunity that we have because we got this Omicron variant, it lasts at most three months and then we could get it again.

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,910
Speaker 1: So back to full lockdown soon for us.

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,999
Speaker 0: I don't even know if you don't even know if you really get, you know, how, how immune are you, right?

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,470
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:02,310
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about that when you get like a flu or anything else, you don't get it again from like yourself and your own like contaminated house right away.

31
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:07,390
Speaker 1: But then if you go out in the street six months later, you could get that exact same flu.

32
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:08,852
Speaker 0: Sure.

33
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:17,622
Speaker 0: But it could also, you know, it's like, you know, this, this, this, you know, COVID keeps a mega time, like a T, there could be a 995 to you that just hasn't arisen yet.

34
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:26,390
Speaker 0: There was a time in my life where I think I had a cold and then it, then I got a different cold immediately.

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,964
Speaker 1: Oh, I, uh, when I was a kid, there was a situation where I got a bad cold and a serious flu simultaneously.

36
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,150
Speaker 1: And I had to be hospitalized.

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,250
Speaker 1: Somehow that Dana Carvey special.

38
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:50,150
Speaker 1: Anyway, so at PAX, we all, I did, we did the Atari game design panel, but I had Emily be player two and it went real well.

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,909
Speaker 1: We got a ton of positive feedback because almost no geek nights, listeners, people who had never heard of us before fill in this room.

40
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:00,450
Speaker 1: And, uh, I made a very brief joke.

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,550
Speaker 1: I was, I, I, something like something was worth, like the value of this thing becomes zero.

42
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:11,030
Speaker 1: And then I paused and I did the kind of rim joke, just like an NFT.

43
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:14,550
Speaker 1: And in the crowd, I noticed something very specific.

44
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,690
Speaker 1: Most of the crowd laughed, like, like out loud.

45
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,449
Speaker 1: They were like, ah, fucking NFTs.

46
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:28,470
Speaker 1: But I very specifically saw a handful of people who visibly frown and furrowed their brows.

47
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

48
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:41,237
Speaker 1: That's 100% of the people who appeared to not be happy about that were white, white men who appeared to be between the age of 25 and 35.

49
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:41,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

50
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not a surprise, but I was very heartened by the fact that the vast majority of the room kind of had a moment of, haha, fuck NFTs.

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,170
Speaker 1: Also, uh, yeah, no, that I don't, no one knows about Pitfall 2.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,649
Speaker 1: Like nobody knows that game exists.

53
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,090
Speaker 0: I didn't know until recently the fullness of Pitfall 2.

54
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,633
Speaker 0: There's a reason.

55
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:04,410
Speaker 1: when we did that panel, I was like, Scott, oh my, you got to see this shit.

56
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:05,428
Speaker 1: And then I started it.

57
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,630
Speaker 1: I was shocked when I found that ROM.

58
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:08,848
Speaker 1: I didn't know it existed.

59
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, I knew about all kinds of other pitfalls.

60
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:19,610
Speaker 1: So, uh, the bad ones in particular, my favorite awful game done quick ever is still super Pitfall.

61
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,027
Speaker 1: That is the funniest shit.

62
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:37,810
Speaker 1: So, uh, anyway, in the news, I got two very related newses because the FAA is going after two different sets of people for basically the same bullshit on different scales.

63
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:53,789
Speaker 1: And it's extra funny because of all the federal institutions in the United States, there's one that is very powerful and unlike the others has not been heavily gutted by our terrible governments over the years.

64
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:55,187
Speaker 1: And that is the FAA.

65
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,148
Speaker 0: It's like the FAA.

66
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:08,690
Speaker 0: It's like that is, you know, I mean, I'm sure they're, they're airplane experts, aviation nerds, FAA insiders, government people who are going to be like, oh, you guys don't know what you're talking about.

67
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,630
Speaker 0: The FAA has this problem and this problem.

68
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,447
Speaker 1: And they're just not saying it doesn't have problems, but compare it to what we've done to the CDC or the FDA.

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:18,949
Speaker 0: Yeah.

70
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:34,398
Speaker 0: It's like the, the, if there are problems at the FAA, which I'm sure there are, they are not extremely visible to, you know, the common person in the way that, you know, other dysfunction and other government agencies is.

71
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:46,590
Speaker 0: also when you read the news, you know, most public news, I guess if you're not reading aviation news is like, the FAA seems to get things done when planes crash.

72
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,310
Speaker 0: It's usually not because of regulatory failure.

73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,750
Speaker 0: It's because of, you know, people being bad, right?

74
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,030
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, these are extremely safe if you follow the rules, right?

75
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:06,170
Speaker 0: And it's like there, they appear to the general public to be doing about as good a job as a government regulatory body can be doing.

76
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,890
Speaker 1: But I saw a tweet cause I didn't know a lot.

77
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:15,890
Speaker 1: I didn't think a lot about this, but I was doing a little bit of research around these stories and I found a tweet from what's clearly some aviation nerd guy.

78
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,769
Speaker 1: And it was what it was roughly a meme, but the format was FBI coming after you.

79
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:21,989
Speaker 1: Eh, I'll live.

80
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,570
Speaker 1: FAA's on you leaving the country right now.

81
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:31,109
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, the FAA, they can't really, they can make you stop flying, I guess.

82
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:32,929
Speaker 1: Which is a pretty big deal.

83
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,215
Speaker 0: So, well, it's a big deal.

84
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,230
Speaker 0: if you're a pilot, you lose your livelihood.

85
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:43,350
Speaker 1: So story number one, some stunt people wanted to do what is honestly a fucking awesome stunt.

86
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,730
Speaker 1: They were going to fly two planes and they did this.

87
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,447
Speaker 0: What kind of planes?

88
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,268
Speaker 1: Uh, like prop planes, like a Cessna looking thing.

89
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:49,789
Speaker 1: Okay.

90
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,588
Speaker 1: Gonna fly two planes.

91
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,010
Speaker 1: They're going to simultaneously jump out of each of their respective planes.

92
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,337
Speaker 0: And parachute a distance into the other planes.

93
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,468
Speaker 1: Like it's a big stunt they're going to do.

94
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:08,454
Speaker 0: Well, are there going to be second backup people flying the planes while they're parachuting?

95
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,650
Speaker 0: or were those planes just going to be empty?

96
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,308
Speaker 1: So this is why the FAA is going after them.

97
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,544
Speaker 1: They did all their tests of this stunt with backup pilots in the planes, obviously like it would be stupid not to.

98
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:24,009
Speaker 1: Uh, and the FAA was like, you know what?

99
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,470
Speaker 1: You can do this stunts the way you've tested it totally fine.

100
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:32,909
Speaker 1: And at the last minute they're like, yeah, so we're not going to have the backup pilots because it doesn't look good on TV.

101
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,950
Speaker 1: It's not as scary to everybody.

102
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,150
Speaker 1: And the FAA immediately, their response was, uh, by all means present.

103
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,869
Speaker 1: No, their response was what the fuck?

104
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,149
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.

105
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,709
Speaker 1: Under no circumstances are you to do this.

106
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:46,249
Speaker 0: Yes.

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,509
Speaker 0: You cannot have a plane flying in the air with nobody in it.

108
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:55,624
Speaker 0: Just like you can't have a car driving down the road with nobody in it or a train with no engineer there, right?

109
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:03,607
Speaker 0: It's even if you have an amazing autopilot system, which like when you fly a commercial flight, the autopilot is from what I've learned doing.

110
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,090
Speaker 0: It's like, it's controlling it most of the way.

111
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:06,510
Speaker 0: Right.

112
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,109
Speaker 1: I mean, remember the famous Kennedy, the ghost flight where everyone on the plane died and the plane just kept flying until I ran out of fuel.

113
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,246
Speaker 0: But it's like, you got to have a person sitting there, right?

114
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:18,947
Speaker 1: Yeah.

115
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:27,210
Speaker 0: Because you're, it's not just if it was only your own life being put at risk, then it's a stunt car in a test track.

116
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:27,790
Speaker 1: All right.

117
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,730
Speaker 1: It runs into the wall of the test track.

118
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,150
Speaker 0: And it's like, or the stunt driver who signed up to take this risk is the person who is taking all the risk and everyone else is safe.

119
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:48,010
Speaker 0: But if you have a plane flying in the air and there's no one in it and it crashes, you just killed or severely injured or damaged some innocent people or property or, you know, That had nothing to do with it.

120
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,124
Speaker 0: And that's a no, no.

121
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:50,227
Speaker 1: Yup.

122
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:53,789
Speaker 0: So, uh, of course, yourself at risk all you want, just not anyone else.

123
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:59,190
Speaker 1: So of course the stunt, uh, went wrong and, uh, they, cause they did it anyway.

124
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,350
Speaker 1: They ignored the FAA.

125
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:01,244
Speaker 1: They did it.

126
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,870
Speaker 1: And one of the planes crashed.

127
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,169
Speaker 1: The guy didn't make it into the plane.

128
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,570
Speaker 0: It flew off in a, they did it with the no pilots in the planes.

129
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:09,186
Speaker 1: Yup.

130
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,430
Speaker 1: It flew off in a random direction and crashed.

131
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:20,669
Speaker 1: And now the FAA is like, well, so as of Dateline now, quote, the FAA has not yet said what kind of punishment those involved will face.

132
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,500
Speaker 0: Severe.

133
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,010
Speaker 0: I imagine severe.

134
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,489
Speaker 0: So what did the plane crash into?

135
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:27,870
Speaker 0: Hopefully not any people.

136
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,430
Speaker 1: Luckily the middle of the desert.

137
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:30,650
Speaker 0: Oh, desert.

138
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:30,970
Speaker 0: Okay.

139
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,199
Speaker 0: Good.

140
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,070
Speaker 0: Oh, hopefully not a rare old cactus.

141
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:35,949
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

142
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,490
Speaker 1: I'm glad you know about the rural cactuses.

143
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,889
Speaker 1: That's something that's a topic that I'm specifically mad about.

144
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:42,428
Speaker 0: Okay.

145
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,789
Speaker 0: You should be mad about it.

146
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,106
Speaker 1: Just like taxes take like 400 years to grow in some dipshit with a pickup truck shoots at it and then steals it.

147
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,660
Speaker 0: Yup.

148
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:57,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, that is so much less egregious than this other FAA news that also just happened.

149
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:08,349
Speaker 1: So some YouTuber guy who I'd never heard of, uh, had a live stream and a video where he had the harrowing tale.

150
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,850
Speaker 1: The YouTube video was titled.

151
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,150
Speaker 1: I crashed my plane and it shows he's doing some flight.

152
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,190
Speaker 1: He's like a flying guy, YouTube channel, whatever.

153
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,867
Speaker 0: He had a pilot's license, like legitimately doing everything legit, but something goes wrong.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,410
Speaker 1: The like the engines out, uh, I'm over the mountains.

155
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:23,644
Speaker 1: Oh no.

156
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,389
Speaker 1: My engines out.

157
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,190
Speaker 1: And like he panics, he does a bunch of stuff.

158
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:30,310
Speaker 1: And then he's like, guys, I got a bail and he bails out of the plane and parachutes down and survived.

159
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:30,988
Speaker 0: I saw this.

160
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,262
Speaker 0: Yeah.

161
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:32,028
Speaker 1: Yup.

162
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,390
Speaker 1: So, uh, spoilers, spoilers.

163
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,790
Speaker 1: Uh, he did this on purpose.

164
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,910
Speaker 1: He faked the engine trouble.

165
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,690
Speaker 1: He crashed the plane on purpose.

166
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,230
Speaker 1: This was a stunt for his YouTube channel.

167
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:45,636
Speaker 1: And, uh, yup.

168
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:48,889
Speaker 1: I'm going to read a quote.

169
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:55,271
Speaker 1: Before the FAA made its determination, obviously the FAA is fucking this guy over and deservedly so.

170
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,950
Speaker 1: members of the aviation community were doubtful.

171
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:07,429
Speaker 1: Jacob's video was genuine saying it was unusual that Jacob had brought a parachute with him on a routine flight and that he didn't try to land the plane.

172
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,990
Speaker 1: Parachutes are typically only used by aerobatic pilots or those doing flight tests.

173
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:20,190
Speaker 1: So yeah, not only did he crash his own plane on purpose as a stunt, but he did the most obvious crime.

174
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,730
Speaker 1: Like I'm wearing a parachute for no reason.

175
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,690
Speaker 1: Let me just get into my plane.

176
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,870
Speaker 1: Oh no, the engine is broken.

177
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,769
Speaker 1: Let me ignore all procedures and jump out of it.

178
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,150
Speaker 1: And I happen to be live streaming the whole time.

179
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,290
Speaker 0: I mean like, what do I know about flying?

180
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,540
Speaker 0: Not much, but even that not much includes.

181
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:42,189
Speaker 0: if the engine goes out, try to glide and make an emergency landing somewhere.

182
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:43,058
Speaker 1: Yup.

183
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:53,050
Speaker 1: Or honestly, for that kind of plane, because I have, log to my name, six hours of flight training total when I was in high school.

184
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:06,396
Speaker 1: But one of the things I learned in the STARBASE program and part of that thing was like the procedures, like we learned a lot of air procedures and for a plane like that, the first thing you do, if the engine goes out, try

185
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,080
Speaker 0: to restart it most of the time, it'll just start back up.

186
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:10,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

187
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:17,010
Speaker 1: So, uh, the sort of buried lead in the story, cause fuck this YouTuber guy.

188
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,410
Speaker 1: This is why we all hate these YouTube personalities and this whole system.

189
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:34,810
Speaker 1: But, uh, is that if you are gonna fake something in the modern era, even if you fake it really well, like you make deep fakes or do any like sort of nonsense, the metadata coupled with

190
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:35,894
Speaker 0: nerds

191
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:46,148
Speaker 1: who know a lot about this and are spending most of their time trolling around the internet looking for people to argue with are going to figure your shit out before the F dot dot organizations even think about you.

192
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,610
Speaker 0: But also it is, if you're one of those other F organizations, right.

193
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,867
Speaker 0: It's like, even if they hire those nerds, they might, well, they might not, you know, there might be more dysfunctional, but if it's the FAA, they're going to get you right.

194
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:04,240
Speaker 0: The MCC, it's like, you could probably run a pirate radio and get away with it for a while.

195
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:04,543
Speaker 0: Right.

196
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,257
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,630
Speaker 0: But, uh, I mean, there's some pirate radio.

198
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,670
Speaker 0: Fly a plane without a license.

199
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,447
Speaker 0: Like good luck.

200
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:11,419
Speaker 0: It's like, right.

201
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,430
Speaker 0: I won't be surprised.

202
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,968
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised that you shot you down.

203
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:15,948
Speaker 0: If you tried that.

204
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:26,490
Speaker 1: What's extra funny is this is randomly very close to the plot of a particular episode of Bob's burgers that a watch like a couple of weeks.

205
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,790
Speaker 0: I know that show exists.

206
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,890
Speaker 0: I've never seen any episode.

207
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,470
Speaker 1: Randomly.

208
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,006
Speaker 1: We started watching some episodes of it.

209
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,341
Speaker 0: It's which streaming service.

210
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,970
Speaker 1: it's on Hulu, which we have a free account on.

211
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:36,629
Speaker 0: Okay.

212
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:38,490
Speaker 0: I don't have a solution to anything.

213
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:52,730
Speaker 1: All I'm going to say is this show, like after the first couple of seasons, it is not on the tier of plan image Simpsons, but it is on the tier of the late, like upper silver low gold age of the Simpsons.

214
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:53,589
Speaker 1: Like seasons.

215
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,646
Speaker 0: I've heard people say that they like seasons eight, nine, 10, recognize the characters from it.

216
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:06,490
Speaker 1: But I, you know, uh, we watched this episode where a pilot fakes a fakes engine trouble to try to get saw a woman to be impressed with him.

217
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,930
Speaker 1: And, uh, yeah, you tubers, Bob's burgers had your number.

218
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,609
Speaker 1: The Simpsons didn't even do that plot yet.

219
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:27,810
Speaker 0: As far as I know, we got one more news, which is that, uh, of course next week begins the Stanley cup playoffs, which happens every year, but we don't usually talk about it.

220
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,770
Speaker 1: Well, why, why haven't we talked about the Stanley cup a lot in a while?

221
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,949
Speaker 1: Like what, what could have been going on in New York over the last several years where we were not super vocal about the Stanley cup.

222
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,510
Speaker 0: Well, there was a, there was a pandemic, right?

223
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,450
Speaker 0: That was one problem.

224
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,350
Speaker 0: And problem two is even before then, uh, our team was not in the play.

225
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:53,070
Speaker 1: We were, we were, if you don't watch hockey, the New York Rangers were in a process that is affectionately called rebuild, which basically means our team sucks.

226
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,989
Speaker 1: We're going to get all new players and start over.

227
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:56,330
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

228
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,070
Speaker 0: I guess this is like a well-known thing, but maybe not for the listener, but yeah, a few years ago, right?

229
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,523
Speaker 0: So the Rangers were in the Stanley cup finals in like 2014, 15, right?

230
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,650
Speaker 0: Which is probably the last time we talked to them.

231
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,230
Speaker 1: And they did pretty well, but they weren't cup ready.

232
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,430
Speaker 1: They were not cup team, right?

233
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,490
Speaker 0: It's like they made it to the finals, but they weren't as good as the Kings and that's what happened.

234
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:16,750
Speaker 0: Right.

235
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,089
Speaker 0: But it was, it was pretty close even.

236
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:18,318
Speaker 0: Right.

237
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,209
Speaker 0: You know, it was like a lot of over times anyway.

238
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,090
Speaker 0: Um, so anyway, then they went downhill.

239
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,330
Speaker 0: It's like, they weren't as good.

240
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:29,145
Speaker 0: They weren't making the playoffs for several years, you know, for, you know, the getting worse.

241
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:29,570
Speaker 0: Right.

242
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:30,850
Speaker 0: And then not making the playoffs.

243
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,510
Speaker 0: So they sent a letter right to the fans.

244
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:41,890
Speaker 0: Like, look, we, what it said in effect, what you can read the actual words online was like, look, we're not doing great.

245
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:46,250
Speaker 0: We're going to have to tear it down and suck for a while and then get better.

246
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:46,767
Speaker 0: Right.

247
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,909
Speaker 0: And so that's exactly what they did.

248
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:54,990
Speaker 0: And now just a few years later, we finally made it back to the playoffs.

249
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,470
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, that's, that's a thing that's great.

250
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:09,730
Speaker 0: We're finally gonna, you know, it's been so long, 84 years since we got to go to a playoff game, which is, uh, if you haven't been is completely different from regular season.

251
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,690
Speaker 1: It's different in so many ways.

252
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:17,470
Speaker 1: Like you could do a game design like podcast just about playoff hockey versus regular hockey.

253
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,068
Speaker 0: Right.

254
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,346
Speaker 0: Well, the way I, the way I think I could describe it is like, okay, you have your house that you live in.

255
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:23,910
Speaker 0: Right.

256
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:31,289
Speaker 0: And when you come home from your wherever, your work, your school, wherever you go to, if you go anywhere, but wake up, I don't know.

257
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,390
Speaker 0: Your house has a certain atmosphere to it, right?

258
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,190
Speaker 0: It's right.

259
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,730
Speaker 0: On most days, it's pretty similar because it's the same people.

260
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,890
Speaker 0: They're doing the same things, right?

261
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:48,250
Speaker 0: If you were to come home one day from work and there was like a massive barbecue party at your house, right?

262
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,129
Speaker 0: It's still the same house you always come home to.

263
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:56,370
Speaker 0: And your family is still there even, but the atmosphere is completely different.

264
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,889
Speaker 0: It's like a different place, even though it's the same.

265
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,190
Speaker 1: There's this like that electric energy, like you walk into your arena.

266
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:10,660
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what arena, even if you are like the shittiest, newest team, like a brand new arena, you walk into that arena and there's just an energy in the air.

267
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,744
Speaker 0: Right.

268
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:25,589
Speaker 0: So I learned some information because, uh, since, you know, the, uh, the times, I think when we started having enough money to buy hockey tickets, right, which are ludicrously expensive in New York, as you would expect, right.

269
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,086
Speaker 0: We lived in some other place, like, I don't know, like in St.

270
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:35,469
Speaker 0: Louis, we could probably afford blues season tickets, like several, I don't know what they charge, but it's got to be less than New York.

271
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:39,530
Speaker 0: I think Toronto and Montreal, the only other really expensive ones.

272
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:47,030
Speaker 0: But anyway, since we were able to have the very first time that we bought them, right, we only were buying a quarter season.

273
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:54,530
Speaker 0: And that season I think was the last time we were in the playoffs and I would manage to get two tickets, like one playoff game.

274
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:55,307
Speaker 0: And that was it.

275
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:56,669
Speaker 0: And we didn't get very far.

276
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:02,050
Speaker 0: So since then we haven't been in, we just be going to regular season games.

277
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,070
Speaker 0: This year was the first year where we have tickets.

278
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,370
Speaker 0: We have a half season now because rim got a lot more money and we got, uh, um, right.

279
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,309
Speaker 0: And we're in the playoffs.

280
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:19,110
Speaker 0: So, and they don't really publish the information online about like how playoff tickets work.

281
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:19,969
Speaker 0: Right.

282
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:25,868
Speaker 0: So I thought it'd be pretty interesting for everyone to, to get it inside of, if you had a pile of money, what it would be like.

283
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:30,390
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, you buy the season tickets, right?

284
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,230
Speaker 0: You can buy full half or quarter.

285
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,902
Speaker 0: If you buy quarter, it's not really like.

286
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,109
Speaker 0: they don't really consider you like a season ticket member.

287
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:44,189
Speaker 1: They just consider you like someone who bought a bunch of tickets, like buying a 10 trip on the end on the Metro North train instead of buying a monthly pass.

288
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:45,530
Speaker 0: Right.

289
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,787
Speaker 0: If you buy a half or a full and an NHL season has, uh, 82 games.

290
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:56,090
Speaker 0: So it's 41 home games plus a few pre-season games and they make you buy pre-season games.

291
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,149
Speaker 0: You know, deal with it.

292
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,390
Speaker 0: Right.

293
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,790
Speaker 1: They take the third kind of energy in the arena.

294
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:03,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

295
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:03,708
Speaker 0: It's empty.

296
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:04,890
Speaker 1: It's empty and sad.

297
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:08,827
Speaker 1: And it's full of tourists and people who are given free tickets by their season ticket holder friends.

298
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:10,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

299
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,650
Speaker 0: And if there isn't even like a t-shirt gun or anything, uh, no blue crew, no nothing.

300
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:16,110
Speaker 0: All right.

301
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:21,110
Speaker 0: Anyway, um, so you, you buy either a full or a half season, right?

302
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,450
Speaker 0: And then your team makes the playoffs.

303
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:23,930
Speaker 0: Okay.

304
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:32,970
Speaker 0: So at least I don't know how other teams are doing it, but the way Madison square garden does it is first, they probably go to the big sponsors and the big money people.

305
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:33,627
Speaker 0: Right.

306
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,809
Speaker 0: And they say, all right, these tickets are for you.

307
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:37,209
Speaker 0: You got a luxury box.

308
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:38,470
Speaker 0: Obviously there's no question.

309
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,550
Speaker 0: You just have all the tickets for your luxury box.

310
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:45,330
Speaker 0: You, Oh, if you don't realize this, this is true for pretty much every sporting arena.

311
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:48,830
Speaker 0: Let's say you buy a luxury box because you're mega rich, right?

312
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,510
Speaker 0: And the luxury box has, I don't know, eight seats in front.

313
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,710
Speaker 1: You can't just bring eight friends to every game.

314
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,750
Speaker 0: It's not just like a little, you don't just get, you don't just magically get eight free tickets to every single event in Madison square garden.

315
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,910
Speaker 0: You just have the right to purchase eight tickets to any event.

316
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,358
Speaker 0: And you're buying the seats, right?

317
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,349
Speaker 0: Nobody else can buy them from you.

318
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:14,429
Speaker 0: It's like they can never sell out to someone else because they're only on sale to you.

319
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:18,490
Speaker 0: But it's like, you have to buy them every, do you want to go to a concert?

320
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,970
Speaker 0: Okay.

321
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,930
Speaker 0: There's eight tickets with your name on them at all times, but they're not free.

322
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,170
Speaker 0: So you got to buy them, right?

323
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,830
Speaker 0: So those people don't have to worry.

324
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:35,850
Speaker 0: So then the season ticket holders, the full season people, they get access to buy basically playoff tickets for their seats, right?

325
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,930
Speaker 0: Do you want your seats for every home playoff game?

326
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,606
Speaker 0: Yes or no.

327
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,530
Speaker 0: If you say yes, you have two choices, right?

328
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,074
Speaker 0: Full or pay by round.

329
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,478
Speaker 0: full means.

330
00:20:47,658 --> 00:21:07,370
Speaker 0: you buy the tickets to every conceivable could happen home postseason game, whether they're going to happen or not, you give them the full amount of money as if you're playing 20, you know, all, but you know, what's the maximum number for 16, 16 is the most possible games.

331
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,140
Speaker 0: It could be right.

332
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:16,790
Speaker 0: If you had home home ice advantage and you took it to seven games each round, don't necessarily happen, right?

333
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,070
Speaker 0: And then they refund you for games that don't happen.

334
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:23,890
Speaker 0: If you do pay by round, then it's sort of the same thing.

335
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:25,890
Speaker 0: It's just, you pay one round at a time.

336
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,490
Speaker 0: And when the team wins and makes it to the next round, they charge you again.

337
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:36,849
Speaker 0: And if games don't happen because the round ends early, like in a sweep, then they give you a refund of the games that didn't happen.

338
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:46,050
Speaker 0: So because we have a half season, it was basically that, except they only, we only got half the games, right?

339
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:47,310
Speaker 0: Half the conceivable.

340
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:48,526
Speaker 1: I have a life in a game.

341
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,350
Speaker 1: So a full season is like not feasible in my life.

342
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,687
Speaker 1: That's too much hockey, even for me.

343
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,165
Speaker 0: But who's going to go to right?

344
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,670
Speaker 0: 41 games, right?

345
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,670
Speaker 1: Us if we didn't have jobs and we're idly rich.

346
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,989
Speaker 0: If I'm really old and I can afford it, then maybe, you know.

347
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:12,390
Speaker 0: But anyway, so yeah, we got to buy our seats, the seats we always sit in for half of the conceivable home games.

348
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,687
Speaker 0: And then they were like, all right, if you really want to go to the other half of the games, right, we'll let you buy that now, too.

349
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,289
Speaker 0: And there were slim pickings for that.

350
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:28,910
Speaker 0: And then they did a presale for people who had chase credit cards, sponsorship deal.

351
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:36,510
Speaker 0: Then they did an Internet presale, which they sent out a code, right, to use.

352
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:38,710
Speaker 0: And then they did a general public sale.

353
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:42,450
Speaker 0: And it's like they were rolling these out in so many layers.

354
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:51,190
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, but it's like they make, you know, depending on how well the team does, it's like, you know, they're making huge amounts of money.

355
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:55,170
Speaker 0: Just, you know, it's like they when they get to the postseason, you have to pay the players anymore.

356
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:55,969
Speaker 0: You already paid them.

357
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,050
Speaker 0: You only pay them for the regular season, right?

358
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,070
Speaker 0: Some of them might have bonuses or something.

359
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:10,290
Speaker 1: Well, even worse, you know, the price of the tickets, the seats, the further deeper your gets into the playoffs, the prices rise exorbitantly.

360
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

361
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,428
Speaker 0: So the regular season tickets we have are one hundred and twenty dollars per seat per game.

362
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,750
Speaker 0: Right now, the the first round of the playoffs is a little bit more than that.

363
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,230
Speaker 0: Right.

364
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:33,210
Speaker 0: If we're in the Stanley Cup finals, the fourth round, the tickets are basically like five hundred dollars a game, which is obviously ridiculous.

365
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:42,910
Speaker 0: But the Reese, if you were trying to buy those, like on the open market, it would be easily a thousand dollars plus per easily for if so.

366
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:55,587
Speaker 0: It's like, of course, you know, even if I didn't have rim to put up money, I still would have just bought all those tickets knowing that I could guaranteed make my money like I could just make my money back by selling them no matter what.

367
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, because demand it's just the same reason why conventions sell out.

368
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:03,990
Speaker 1: There's only so many seats you can physically put in a hockey or square garden.

369
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,970
Speaker 0: Despite being, you know, it doesn't actually have as many seats as you imagine.

370
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:08,150
Speaker 0: It's not like a football stadium.

371
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,270
Speaker 0: There's like twenty to thirty.

372
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,850
Speaker 0: You know, it's not a lot of seats because football you can sit so far away.

373
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,590
Speaker 1: You can't see anything.

374
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,289
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually matter that much for the capacity of Madison Square Garden is like twenty thousand.

375
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:27,649
Speaker 0: Anyway, see, I just wanted to share that, you know, even if you don't care, because that is not information that they like.

376
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:40,930
Speaker 0: They don't publish like the full details of this stuff, like just publicly on their websites, you know, and I feel like, you know, that's something like, you know, even someone who's not interested in purchasing, but especially someone who is interested in purchasing.

377
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:45,370
Speaker 0: It's like all that should be public information, like exactly how the fuck that works, right?

378
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:49,850
Speaker 0: Because you like you can get into it and not know what you're going to happen, right?

379
00:24:50,131 --> 00:24:51,150
Speaker 0: They just spring it on you.

380
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,330
Speaker 0: They're like, hey, tickets.

381
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:53,390
Speaker 0: This is the deal right now.

382
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:54,049
Speaker 0: Take it or leave it.

383
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,544
Speaker 0: It's like, whoa.

384
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,490
Speaker 0: Why didn't you tell me how this worked like months ago, right?

385
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,810
Speaker 1: Because while Pax, for example, does spring on, hey, today's the day.

386
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,284
Speaker 1: Go, go, go.

387
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,410
Speaker 1: They explain the process in excruciating detail long in advance of the sudden day.

388
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,890
Speaker 0: I think actually Pax could do a better job of explaining in detail.

389
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,690
Speaker 1: So it looks like it's going to be Rangers Penguins in the first round and then Rangers.

390
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:19,410
Speaker 0: As of today, but it could be Rangers Caps still as a possibility.

391
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,970
Speaker 1: But Rangers Carolina in the next round.

392
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,728
Speaker 0: Well, that that would be bad.

393
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,130
Speaker 1: That's that's what it's like.

394
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:25,550
Speaker 0: Our hope.

395
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,730
Speaker 0: Our hope is that it's Carolina and Boston beat the shit out of each other in the first round.

396
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:30,857
Speaker 0: Yeah.

397
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,386
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any chance Carolina loses, but they could get.

398
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:35,090
Speaker 0: that would be well.

399
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,310
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, Boston's not easy for us.

400
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,008
Speaker 1: Here's the danger.

401
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:42,810
Speaker 1: A Boston Bruins that somehow beats Carolina is going to be dangerous as shit.

402
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,240
Speaker 0: Great.

403
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:43,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

404
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,910
Speaker 0: But it's like if we can get to the second round, I think the only way we get out of the second round is if the team we face in the second round is, you know, beat up real bad.

405
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,710
Speaker 1: Sweep the Penguins.

406
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:53,468
Speaker 1: Take a break.

407
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,490
Speaker 1: We hope it goes to Game 7.

408
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,257
Speaker 0: That's like.

409
00:25:57,318 --> 00:26:00,270
Speaker 0: our only way to the third round, I think, is that path.

410
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,650
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

411
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,709
Speaker 1: I got a real little thing.

412
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:26,518
Speaker 1: This is a video of some film footage that was heavily restored just to make it look more real to avoid the phenomenon where old black and white things feel old timey to people and they lose sight of like the world was real back then and there were people like that.

413
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:32,169
Speaker 1: It's easy to lose that context looking at black and white photos in the modern era or old grainy footage.

414
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:43,770
Speaker 1: But it's just footage of San Francisco Market Street end to end on the front of a trolley from nineteen oh six free.

415
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,629
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that's before the big earthquake.

416
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:51,369
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, it's four days before the earthquake that destroyed all of this.

417
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:53,450
Speaker 1: So that's neat.

418
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,270
Speaker 1: It's like seeing Pompeii before it got destroyed.

419
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,050
Speaker 1: But two, I share this video for one specific reason.

420
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,350
Speaker 1: If you watch this footage, this is an era when cars barely worked.

421
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,290
Speaker 1: Like cars went about as fast as Scott and I ride our bikes.

422
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:11,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, Model T's, which were also death traps, right?

423
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,330
Speaker 1: These are like cars that are not significantly faster than a horse drawn carriage.

424
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:18,750
Speaker 0: And we're loud.

425
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:30,910
Speaker 1: And yet even that back then, when so few people had cars and cars were so slow, this footage, it is abundantly clear that cars are a ridiculous menace to society.

426
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,510
Speaker 1: The few cars that people have are driving all over the road, cutting people off, almost hitting pedestrians.

427
00:27:36,912 --> 00:27:41,650
Speaker 1: They cut off the trolley taking this footage two times in the first ten seconds.

428
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:54,370
Speaker 0: But I mean, if you look at old news from around the time cars started becoming a thing, get an old newspaper at the library, there's plenty of like op-eds and articles of like, you know, cars terrorizing the streets, et cetera, et cetera.

429
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,669
Speaker 0: Get these cars under control.

430
00:27:56,331 --> 00:28:08,930
Speaker 0: And, you know, the decision to instead of ban the cars, but instead to remove everything else and give the car to the road, give the road to the car, destroyed the earth.

431
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,370
Speaker 1: Oh, so I saw something interesting.

432
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,970
Speaker 0: It was the direct cause of most of the problems in our society.

433
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,970
Speaker 1: There are obviously nuances to what this group is doing.

434
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:21,070
Speaker 1: And I'm just going to say that they are doing it and leave it at that.

435
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,110
Speaker 1: But there is a climate activist group in Britain.

436
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,169
Speaker 1: I saw some news today.

437
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:33,890
Speaker 1: They are going to gas stations along major highways in Britain and breaking all the gas pumps and putting up anti-car slogans and leaving.

438
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:36,730
Speaker 1: That's that's happening.

439
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,181
Speaker 0: I think that's I think that's I don't know how.

440
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:42,570
Speaker 0: I think that might be better than the SUV tire slashing people.

441
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's.

442
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,283
Speaker 1: I think we're.

443
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:46,490
Speaker 0: I have to think about it.

444
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:53,370
Speaker 0: All I'll say is that if climate change, as satisfying as it is, the the tire slashing is not hurts the wrong people.

445
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:55,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, is one problem.

446
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:56,890
Speaker 0: But there's got a lot of problems.

447
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,130
Speaker 0: Yeah.

448
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:05,489
Speaker 1: But we can also point out that climate change, if unaddressed, is a literally existential crisis to all of human society as we know it.

449
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,730
Speaker 1: There is a point at which extreme increasingly drastic action is necessary.

450
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:11,330
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,469
Speaker 0: Now, well, the time for that actually has passed.

452
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,850
Speaker 1: We could have nipped this in the bud and banned these fucking cars from San Francisco.

453
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know, you look at the science, right?

454
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 0: The time for for drastic action is already here.

455
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,318
Speaker 0: Right.

456
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,450
Speaker 0: It's been here for a while and we still haven't taken the drastic action.

457
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,730
Speaker 1: So I mean, Al Gore was elected president and we could have started addressing it.

458
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,783
Speaker 1: And then Supreme Court shenanigans and sort of.

459
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,490
Speaker 0: in this we're sort of in the zone, right?

460
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,450
Speaker 0: It's like imagine you have a speeding train, right?

461
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,490
Speaker 0: You pull the brakes like the emergency brake.

462
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:43,013
Speaker 0: It's still.

463
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,661
Speaker 0: the train is going to stop 100 feet, 1000 feet, right?

464
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,886
Speaker 0: It's like the train is maybe 500 feet away.

465
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:50,669
Speaker 0: It hasn't hit us yet.

466
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:54,330
Speaker 0: But if we pull the emergency brake now, it's still going to hit us.

467
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,570
Speaker 0: It's like there is no like we are going to get hit by the train.

468
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,949
Speaker 0: It's like, would it be better even if the train is two feet away?

469
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,470
Speaker 0: Pulling the emergency brake is still a good idea.

470
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,669
Speaker 0: It'll hit us slightly less hard.

471
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,870
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like the train can't go in reverse.

472
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:11,888
Speaker 0: It's going to hit us.

473
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:20,349
Speaker 0: And at every second we don't take the drastic action of pull the emergency brake increases the strength at which the train will hit us.

474
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,669
Speaker 0: So that so don't go saying, oh, it's too late to do anything and be all defeatist.

475
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,821
Speaker 0: Oh, there's just because it is too late to do anything.

476
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,889
Speaker 1: There's a really good video I'll post in the forum just because I think it's worthwhile noting.

477
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:38,889
Speaker 1: It's a video that gets deep into sort of the strategy of the.

478
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:41,810
Speaker 1: we shouldn't do anything about climate change people.

479
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,728
Speaker 1: And they've moved on.

480
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,184
Speaker 1: They were previously in the 70s, 80s.

481
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,350
Speaker 1: They were focused on like denying that it was happening.

482
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,930
Speaker 1: Then they then they moved when the science was irrefutable to focusing on.

483
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:54,089
Speaker 1: Well, it's happening, but humans aren't causing it.

484
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,410
Speaker 1: And they kept moving to a different position to defend themselves.

485
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:12,430
Speaker 1: That's how all these people who are defending not fair, regardless of which issue it is, where they have moved now increasingly, like over the last like one or two years is to the most dangerous possible territory of it's happening.

486
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 1: We're causing it, but it's too late to do anything.

487
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,110
Speaker 1: Everything's fucked.

488
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,210
Speaker 1: Everything's fucked forever.

489
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:18,410
Speaker 1: So don't bother.

490
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,290
Speaker 1: It'll make your life worth for worse for nothing.

491
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:21,569
Speaker 1: And that is not true.

492
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:25,367
Speaker 1: But that is the current line that's starting to be spread by these conservatives.

493
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:31,050
Speaker 0: Well, the truth of the truth there is, you know, the sad one.

494
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,030
Speaker 1: Oh, we can't stop many of the effects.

495
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:34,270
Speaker 1: They are already too late.

496
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,900
Speaker 0: But there's a there's a truth there that is sad.

497
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:40,770
Speaker 0: Well, right.

498
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:41,468
Speaker 0: It's sad.

499
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:41,851
Speaker 0: Evil.

500
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:48,290
Speaker 0: true is that for a lot of those people saying that, it's like they will actually just be dead.

501
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,330
Speaker 0: They're very likely to just die of something else before it's a problem.

502
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,750
Speaker 1: The people who are causing this are people who will die before it affects them.

503
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,058
Speaker 0: Right.

504
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:02,168
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, the train is 500 feet away and you can pull the emergency brake to take less damage from it.

505
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:09,368
Speaker 0: But I already if that person already knows that they're going to die from cancer or something before that happens.

506
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,170
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:16,709
Speaker 0: So they are just a selfish fucking evil asshole who doesn't care about other human beings who will still be alive.

508
00:32:17,332 --> 00:32:19,970
Speaker 0: And therefore they should have no say.

509
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,230
Speaker 0: Let's not have a discussion about giving younger people greater say in government.

510
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:24,589
Speaker 0: The end.

511
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,942
Speaker 0: Let's go.

512
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

513
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:25,810
Speaker 1: All right.

514
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:26,661
Speaker 1: What do you got?

515
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,828
Speaker 0: What do you think of the day?

516
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,749
Speaker 1: It happens when we skip a show.

517
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:31,989
Speaker 1: We got way too much bottled up.

518
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:32,949
Speaker 0: Yes.

519
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:33,989
Speaker 0: Anyway, thing of the day.

520
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:38,510
Speaker 0: So we're going to do our main bit on handwriting penmanship.

521
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,506
Speaker 0: But nowadays that everyone types everything right.

522
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,730
Speaker 0: Typography is the art of choice for everybody.

523
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:48,965
Speaker 0: So Star Wars.

524
00:32:49,878 --> 00:32:50,090
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,590
Speaker 0: You know, I've always noticed that, you know, Star Wars starts off with typography, that crawl.

526
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:56,090
Speaker 0: Right.

527
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,469
Speaker 0: Everyone knows the crawl text going by.

528
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:02,530
Speaker 0: And, you know, I wasn't sure, like, am I just imagining it?

529
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,110
Speaker 0: No, they definitely change the fonts in the different editions and releases and movies.

530
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:11,730
Speaker 0: It wasn't all, you know, it's like my brain had that original font in there.

531
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:12,450
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,570
Speaker 0: And then when I saw other Star Wars movies, I was like, I think they changed that font.

533
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,069
Speaker 0: Sure enough, they did.

534
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:24,910
Speaker 0: And you can learn all about that and more from this Twitter account, Star Wars fonts.

535
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:37,762
Speaker 0: This person examines and identifies fonts, not just in Star Wars movies, but in like random Star Wars, merch, games, books, fucking any Star Wars thing that has typography on it.

536
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:39,309
Speaker 0: They're looking at the fonts.

537
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:41,210
Speaker 0: It's pretty fascinating.

538
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:52,170
Speaker 0: And this while, you know, while Twitter is in the news, this is an example of one of those things that pretty much only exists on Twitter.

539
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,909
Speaker 0: It wouldn't work on a mastodon.

540
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,229
Speaker 0: It wouldn't work.

541
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,628
Speaker 0: I guess it could work as a website with RSS, but the person who's making it isn't making a website with RSS.

542
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:08,969
Speaker 0: So unless you can convince them to do so, it's like, you know, this kind of content is like, you know, Twitter is the only choice.

543
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,210
Speaker 0: This is going to be on Facebook.

544
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:12,219
Speaker 0: It's not going to be an Instagram like.

545
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,149
Speaker 0: it's the only service that will have this kind of thing.

546
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,728
Speaker 0: So that's why it's a shame.

547
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,270
Speaker 0: Yeah.

548
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,206
Speaker 0: Twitter is in trouble.

549
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,429
Speaker 1: In the moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is nine Fox Gambit, not eight.

550
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, nine.

551
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,630
Speaker 0: The listeners most requested book club book.

552
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,629
Speaker 0: All right, listener, you're going to have your way.

553
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,329
Speaker 0: We're going to do this sci fi book.

554
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,230
Speaker 0: I've read it already.

555
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,109
Speaker 0: I read it a while ago.

556
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:35,708
Speaker 0: His room started.

557
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,467
Speaker 1: I started it.

558
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,949
Speaker 1: And all I got to say so far is formations.

559
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,110
Speaker 1: It doesn't waste any time.

560
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,629
Speaker 1: It does not waste any time.

561
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,652
Speaker 1: It is not.

562
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:44,293
Speaker 1: it is.

563
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:51,254
Speaker 1: it is like a brick wall is just right there that you slam into paragraph one.

564
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:52,167
Speaker 1: I love it.

565
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,529
Speaker 1: It's the same feeling I got reading that.

566
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,652
Speaker 1: Actually, it's even.

567
00:34:56,355 --> 00:35:02,970
Speaker 1: it feels denser in terms of like what is on a given page than even that first Prince of Nothing book we read.

568
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,209
Speaker 1: That's what I. that's what I'm going to say so far.

569
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,409
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about it more after I get more than like one chapter in.

570
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:10,748
Speaker 0: Sure, sure.

571
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:11,249
Speaker 0: All right.

572
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:12,549
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's the thing.

573
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:13,114
Speaker 0: And when?

574
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:14,570
Speaker 0: what meta conventions?

575
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:15,007
Speaker 0: None.

576
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:16,150
Speaker 0: None conventions.

577
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,010
Speaker 0: No, nothing.

578
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,188
Speaker 0: It's summer.

579
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:20,729
Speaker 0: Maybe because it's summer.

580
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,110
Speaker 0: I am working on the website.

581
00:35:22,332 --> 00:35:24,590
Speaker 0: I developed a really good search for the website.

582
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:31,710
Speaker 1: It's going to so and we got a pretty good pipeline around making content in outdoor places that are not our apartments.

583
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:32,428
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,625
Speaker 0: Once it's warm outside, you know, it'll be safe to get together outside and make some content.

585
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,129
Speaker 0: So that might or might not happen.

586
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:38,887
Speaker 0: No promises.

587
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:39,468
Speaker 1: Yep.

588
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,529
Speaker 1: And otherwise, yeah, move right into it because we're going to see some people outside in the cold later.

589
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,070
Speaker 1: Handwriting and penmanship.

590
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:51,650
Speaker 1: There's a lot to cover here.

591
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,949
Speaker 1: We're going to mostly focus on our own thoughts and experiences.

592
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:59,450
Speaker 1: But frankly, we are millennials, kind of older millennials.

593
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:19,350
Speaker 1: So we grew up in an era where at least I when I was in elementary school, I was taught like a method of learning how to write in proto cursive with the expectation that when I got into middle and high school, I was taught formal cursive and I was told by teachers all the way up through like 10th grade.

594
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

595
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,670
Speaker 1: When you're an adult, you'll have to like write in cursive, like cursive.

596
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,849
Speaker 1: You have to have good cursive to have a job.

597
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:26,109
Speaker 1: This is a part of your life.

598
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:29,924
Speaker 1: And then around 10th grade, my teachers were like cursive.

599
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,390
Speaker 1: the fuck print everything.

600
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,349
Speaker 1: If you write in cursive, I will not read your papers.

601
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:58,030
Speaker 0: Well, my story is similar, right, in that they were teaching us handwriting in elementary school and they were telling us, right, that like, you know, like as you get older, right, you're going to have to write in cursive and, you know, you're going to use paper with, you know, smaller line rules and you're going to you're going to have to write long papers and you're going to, you know, they were basically like scaring us about like the future.

602
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,549
Speaker 0: Right.

603
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:01,290
Speaker 0: But yeah.

604
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:09,627
Speaker 0: And then I guess, you know, I guess around fifth grade was the first time that I submitted a paper and I typed it.

605
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,389
Speaker 1: It was fifth grade for me, too.

606
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,469
Speaker 1: I remember specifically.

607
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,690
Speaker 0: I typed it on a school computer and printed it out of the Apple dot matrix printer.

608
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,939
Speaker 1: Yep.

609
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:17,348
Speaker 1: Same.

610
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,189
Speaker 1: And and the funniest I just I just have a specific memory of I wrote this essay on the computer.

611
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,590
Speaker 1: It was about the book My Side of the Mountain, if I recall correctly.

612
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,309
Speaker 0: And mine was about Galileo.

613
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,910
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember that my mom has a copy of this essay.

614
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:32,949
Speaker 1: Still, I saw it.

615
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,590
Speaker 0: I also used for that Galileo paper.

616
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,470
Speaker 0: I used a CD-ROM encyclopedia to read about.

617
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:41,950
Speaker 0: Oh, I did it all on the computer.

618
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,230
Speaker 1: I brought the essay home after it got graded, so it had an A on it.

619
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:56,310
Speaker 1: And I showed it to my grandpa, who at the time his career was still manually laying out metal type at the Macomb Daily, the newspaper in the town we lived in.

620
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,125
Speaker 0: They didn't have an offset printer yet in the 90s or 80s.

621
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,170
Speaker 1: And well, it was down.

622
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,614
Speaker 1: He lived in.

623
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,270
Speaker 1: it was like the town next to because we lived in Detroit.

624
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:08,785
Speaker 1: And all he said, he looked at it and said, You just put my entire industry out of a job.

625
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,509
Speaker 1: You can just do this yourself.

626
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,010
Speaker 1: You're in what, fifth grade?

627
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:13,210
Speaker 1: That's amazing.

628
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,030
Speaker 1: No one should ever have to do what I did ever again.

629
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,010
Speaker 1: It killed all my friends because that type was made out of lead.

630
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,806
Speaker 1: And a lot of people died.

631
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:24,228
Speaker 0: Way to go, grandpa.

632
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:25,708
Speaker 1: My grandpa was pretty cool.

633
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:29,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, at least, you know, that's the right way to be a grandpa.

634
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,349
Speaker 0: You don't want to be the grandpa.

635
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,628
Speaker 0: That's like, all right, damn kids, you ruined me.

636
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like, oh, thanks for ruining me.

637
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,149
Speaker 0: Like like sincere thanks.

638
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,230
Speaker 0: Not not, you know, sarcastic thanks.

639
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, I look for I would.

640
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:47,070
Speaker 1: Automation has to lead to leisure, though, not to just even worse jobs.

641
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:47,468
Speaker 1: Of course.

642
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:48,950
Speaker 1: But that's a conversation.

643
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:53,130
Speaker 0: My earliest handwriting memory was actually in second grade, right?

644
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,909
Speaker 0: They gave us, I think, very.

645
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:56,870
Speaker 0: I don't remember that much, right?

646
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:57,670
Speaker 0: Because the second grade.

647
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,138
Speaker 0: But I do remember clearly.

648
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:03,270
Speaker 0: they gave us one of those, like a workbook for handwriting.

649
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,089
Speaker 0: We're like in each page was a letter and you were supposed to write the letter repeatedly along the line.

650
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:09,750
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

651
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,349
Speaker 1: We had those.

652
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,630
Speaker 1: It was the Denelian workbook specifically.

653
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:18,969
Speaker 0: I don't know about if it was Denelian or not, but regardless, it was like, you know, write a bunch of A's, write a bunch of B's, et cetera.

654
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:19,348
Speaker 0: Right.

655
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,509
Speaker 0: So and it was one of those books you could write in the book and it smelled really fucking good because I love selling books.

656
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:35,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I get this book, they hand it to us and I'm like, ooh, and I immediately, immediately write all the letters and all the pages.

657
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:38,430
Speaker 0: And I fill in the whole book, like in one shot, right?

658
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,389
Speaker 0: Like, bam, like really quick.

659
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,264
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:42,730
Speaker 0: Little did I real.

661
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,110
Speaker 0: And then the teacher is like, all right, today we're going to do a. I'm already like done with the book, basically.

662
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:47,526
Speaker 0: Right.

663
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:53,750
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, and like for twenty five more days, I presume.

664
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,950
Speaker 0: I don't know how many more days maybe the book had print and cursive.

665
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,428
Speaker 0: I don't remember, but our lowercase uppercase, it might have been a lot more days than I remember.

666
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:13,649
Speaker 0: I just definitely remember sitting there quietly and awkwardly every day when everyone else was doing the handwriting book and I had already filled in the Z's on the first day.

667
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:23,090
Speaker 1: My kid memory, which is from first grade, was we were learning Denelian, which is the precursor to cursive and like that one formal methodology.

668
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:32,790
Speaker 1: But I remember noticing that our teacher wrote in a much more elegant style of precursor when she was writing her own things like so.

669
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,170
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

670
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:40,030
Speaker 0: I definitely noticed that, like my mom writing in cursive, right, was like way different than the cursive they taught us in school.

671
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:44,630
Speaker 1: So I particularly heard numbers because we learned numbers in cursive, too.

672
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,129
Speaker 1: I remember just having this kid brain memory of that way to write the number two was way better than what was in our workbooks.

673
00:40:52,512 --> 00:40:55,649
Speaker 1: So I wrote the way the teacher wrote it instead of the way the workbook wrote it.

674
00:40:56,391 --> 00:41:02,847
Speaker 1: And at first I was given a bad grade and I appealed this to the teacher saying, but that's how you write it.

675
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:16,766
Speaker 1: And in one of the only instances I can think of in my entire young childhood, a teacher actually listened to me, agreed, best teacher ever, changed the grade to an A and was totally cool with it.

676
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:18,969
Speaker 0: Best grade, best teacher.

677
00:41:19,673 --> 00:41:21,129
Speaker 1: That too looked way better than the two.

678
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,550
Speaker 0: So far we got story of best grandpa and best teacher.

679
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,490
Speaker 0: It's like, let's keep going with other cool handwriting people.

680
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,938
Speaker 0: But I remember what was funny is I?

681
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:37,010
Speaker 1: they taught us this precursive method specifically and they were very, very strict about forming the letters exactly perfectly.

682
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,970
Speaker 0: Oh, wasn't this like Catholic school?

683
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,270
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was a Catholic school.

684
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:41,730
Speaker 0: Oh, that explains everything.

685
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,129
Speaker 1: In fact, left handed kids, this was in the 80s, but left handed kids were not allowed to use their left hand to write.

686
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:49,229
Speaker 0: Everything makes a lot more sense now.

687
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:56,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, also the cool teacher, one of the few teachers who was not a nun, she was just like some teacher they hired.

688
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,190
Speaker 1: The nuns were not cool about this stuff generally.

689
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,730
Speaker 1: No, except Sister Joan.

690
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,329
Speaker 1: She was cool.

691
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,805
Speaker 1: But so we're learning this method, but it was very apparent that nobody writes that way.

692
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,290
Speaker 1: They either write in full cursive or they write in block print.

693
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:22,510
Speaker 0: And yeah, my dad, my dad wrote in print, you know, and I noticed that as a kid, like my mom writes in cursive when she's and she's only like writing notes to herself or whatever.

694
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:23,170
Speaker 0: She doesn't.

695
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:30,290
Speaker 1: I guess I guess I technically write in cursive when I'm writing notes to myself, but I defy any human to read them anyway.

696
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,478
Speaker 1: But what I just?

697
00:42:32,498 --> 00:42:34,450
Speaker 1: I just remember that they teach us this formal method.

698
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:38,130
Speaker 1: But as a kid, I always noticed that nobody writes that way anywhere on earth.

699
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:45,529
Speaker 1: And our school never actually taught us block printing, like actual block print, because there we did that.

700
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,427
Speaker 0: We did that first before we did it.

701
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:53,870
Speaker 1: I learned block print in middle school when I moved to public school and the public school.

702
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:59,346
Speaker 1: people were like basically they increasingly were like, what is this didelian that you're writing in?

703
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,350
Speaker 1: Just write in block print.

704
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,078
Speaker 1: It's easier to read.

705
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:09,708
Speaker 0: And after that, you know, I guess after the the, you know, the fifth grade, pretty much from then on.

706
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,020
Speaker 0: Right.

707
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,470
Speaker 0: It's like I might be writing some stuff.

708
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:12,830
Speaker 0: Right.

709
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,370
Speaker 0: But like mostly I was typing anything that was, you know, text.

710
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:21,550
Speaker 1: So our schools required us to write essays in class in middle school.

711
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,370
Speaker 1: So I wrote all my essays in cursive because.

712
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:23,950
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

713
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,170
Speaker 0: If I had to write an essay in class, I would write it in print.

714
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,910
Speaker 1: But I hated that.

715
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,190
Speaker 1: So what I usually do is fuck around and not work on the essay in school.

716
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:37,909
Speaker 1: And then I just type the essay up at home and like bring it in the next day.

717
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:40,790
Speaker 0: No, but sometimes you'd have a test with an essay question.

718
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:41,206
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

719
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,390
Speaker 1: I just at that point, I hated writing because it hurt my hand to write a lot of.

720
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:48,610
Speaker 0: You were doing it the wrong way.

721
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,369
Speaker 0: If it hurts your hand.

722
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:49,670
Speaker 0: Right.

723
00:43:49,931 --> 00:43:51,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do it the wrong way, too.

724
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,009
Speaker 0: It hurts my hand also.

725
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,390
Speaker 0: All the artists and the people with good handwriting, they move their arm.

726
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,150
Speaker 0: I was just moving my wrist around wrist.

727
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,610
Speaker 1: I was just moving my fingers.

728
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,225
Speaker 1: I was writing also my fingers around.

729
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll do that.

730
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:04,085
Speaker 0: I'll do that, too.

731
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,609
Speaker 0: What I the correct way is to move your arm around.

732
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,929
Speaker 1: The reason of what I blame is I remember in elementary school, they didn't do this in middle school.

733
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,010
Speaker 1: They gave every kid this little rubber like thing.

734
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,210
Speaker 0: We had a triangle.

735
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,690
Speaker 1: I had those and we had to put.

736
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,327
Speaker 1: They wouldn't let us write unless it was on our pencils.

737
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,530
Speaker 1: And as soon as I got out of that Catholic school, I threw that thing away.

738
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,250
Speaker 1: I never used it again.

739
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,890
Speaker 1: It was only it was causing.

740
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:30,909
Speaker 0: I mean, I tried them, you know, but they just didn't work for me.

741
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:31,390
Speaker 0: Right.

742
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,290
Speaker 0: It's like I'm holding the thing the correct way.

743
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:35,649
Speaker 0: I'm just moving my arm the wrong way.

744
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:44,290
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like soon after, you know, it's like the only time I was writing anything was because I had to for school.

745
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:44,590
Speaker 0: Right.

746
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,030
Speaker 0: I wasn't writing anything on purpose until the Internet came around.

747
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:54,268
Speaker 0: And then I was writing a lot on purpose, you know, whether it was bullshit comments or blogs or whatever.

748
00:44:55,213 --> 00:44:56,889
Speaker 0: But I was typing all those things.

749
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:04,690
Speaker 1: Well, it was very noticeable even to me as a fifth grader that even with like formal cursive training and like I could write cursive really fast.

750
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:11,970
Speaker 1: Honestly, the reason I think it hurt my hand so much was that I tended to write like four or five times more in a given essay than like any other kid would.

751
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:13,549
Speaker 1: But that was just me being a weird kid.

752
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:21,529
Speaker 1: But even in fifth grade, having not yet even learned, like been taught typing, I could type faster than I could write.

753
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:26,890
Speaker 1: And that is what sealed all my opinions as a kid and why I wanted to talk.

754
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:33,390
Speaker 0: I've talked about how I had the class, the typing class with the with the old lady with IBM computers, and then I became so good at typing.

755
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:35,167
Speaker 1: So our typing class now.

756
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:38,550
Speaker 0: Now I usually win typing speed competitions against everybody.

757
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,688
Speaker 1: We were pretty close when we just did that little quick typing thing in the Discord a while ago.

758
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,050
Speaker 1: We were the same distance of each other.

759
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,630
Speaker 0: But even my typing isn't perfect.

760
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,989
Speaker 0: I never use the right shift key.

761
00:45:48,471 --> 00:45:50,889
Speaker 1: I don't know why the right shift key is like the secret hack.

762
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,630
Speaker 0: Minus probably has like two presses ever.

763
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:55,690
Speaker 1: Right shift is so good.

764
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,430
Speaker 0: I just pressed it.

765
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,249
Speaker 0: So that's probably like the third press, maybe.

766
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:12,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only the only the only thing I do that's not super legit is I tend to move my index fingers off of the official home row keys, the two with the little divots on them, F and J. I tend to.

767
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:17,650
Speaker 1: I tend to, if I'm typing a lot, drift one to the right and hang out there.

768
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,750
Speaker 1: Like I'm on G and K with my index fingers.

769
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:27,270
Speaker 1: But what's funny is I type the same either way because I don't even picture the fact that a keyboard exists.

770
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,169
Speaker 1: I think words.

771
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,301
Speaker 1: My hands just pump them out.

772
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,670
Speaker 1: the same way I see arrows.

773
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,810
Speaker 1: My feet just move on the DDR mat.

774
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,010
Speaker 0: Exactly.

775
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:36,830
Speaker 0: Same thing with Vim, right?

776
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:43,610
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I don't think about H, J, you know, J, K, L, semicolon, like the letter that just move the thing around without thinking.

777
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:52,049
Speaker 1: So the last time I wrote a significant amount of text with a pen or pencil that wasn't just notes I was taking for myself.

778
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,709
Speaker 1: I remember the exact day.

779
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:55,785
Speaker 1: It was my first day at RIT.

780
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:01,370
Speaker 1: And they made me take one of those blue book tests for some bullshit English class.

781
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,169
Speaker 0: I did one of those.

782
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:02,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:11,069
Speaker 1: And this was decide if you had to take the basically high school English class or if you had to take the remedial English class.

784
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:14,070
Speaker 1: And the test was like a really simple essay question.

785
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:14,769
Speaker 0: I took that one.

786
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:14,918
Speaker 0: Yep.

787
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:16,328
Speaker 1: Every student had to take it.

788
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:24,366
Speaker 1: That was absolutely the last time I wrote more like a page or more by hand in my entire life.

789
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:30,292
Speaker 0: I mean, the thing is, despite, you know, typing everything right, it's I actually always have.

790
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:32,750
Speaker 0: I have two notebooks, like paper notebooks on my desk.

791
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,690
Speaker 1: I take notes faster with a pen and paper than I do with a laptop hands down.

792
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,050
Speaker 0: One of them is for work notes and one of them is for not work.

793
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,058
Speaker 1: I got a moleskine.

794
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:42,450
Speaker 1: I carry around work all the time.

795
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,850
Speaker 1: I just I just page by page.

796
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,729
Speaker 1: All my notes are in there.

797
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:49,201
Speaker 0: It's like sometimes, you know, I could be writing down, you know, like whatever in there, right?

798
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,570
Speaker 0: Just any absolutely anything I need to write down for any amount of time.

799
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:54,050
Speaker 0: You know, it's not organized.

800
00:47:54,211 --> 00:48:09,790
Speaker 0: It's just like a space to put whatever, because no matter how good anyone makes all kinds of different little apps or post it notes on the desktop or, you know, just open up more VIM windows or Emacs org mode or, you know, any of these things that people have, right?

801
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,269
Speaker 0: The obsidian note that I talked about.

802
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:13,129
Speaker 0: That's like I talked about that.

803
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:14,568
Speaker 1: That might be the closest.

804
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:20,450
Speaker 0: Well, that's good for notes that you want to keep organized and filed and recall later.

805
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,030
Speaker 1: I will take my handwritten notes and type up summaries of them into other things later.

806
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:38,330
Speaker 0: We're talking like, you know, write down an IP address, like see an IP address that you can't copy and paste or so easily write it down, you know, and then, you know, a minute later, type it back in again or stuff like that.

807
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:38,604
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:44,728
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's the kind of handwriting I've been doing other than like a few postcards here and there.

809
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,109
Speaker 0: For a very long time.

810
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:51,646
Speaker 0: And my handwriting wasn't good to begin with because I did the handwriting book in two seconds.

811
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:55,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I typed everything since fifth grade.

812
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,189
Speaker 1: My handwriting was extremely good up through fourth grade because the Catholic school, you know, I get hit.

813
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:07,810
Speaker 1: But as soon as I could type, my handwriting got so bad that I kept failing handwriting classes in middle school because I never wrote anything anymore.

814
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,488
Speaker 0: I didn't have handwriting class.

815
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,669
Speaker 0: You know, it was part of English class.

816
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:12,988
Speaker 1: Like it was an aspect of it.

817
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:13,809
Speaker 0: We did not have that.

818
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:19,570
Speaker 0: After the second grade handwriting book, there was no more handwriting instruction.

819
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:19,826
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

820
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,009
Speaker 1: It all through elementary school handwriting and well, it was called penmanship was a line item on our report cards.

821
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:30,790
Speaker 0: So another topic, right, is calligraphy.

822
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:37,229
Speaker 0: So I didn't know calligraphy was a thing until like, you know, my mom was trying to do it for like maybe 10 minutes.

823
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,589
Speaker 0: She got some calligraphy pens and some books and she, you know, she was trying to do it.

824
00:49:42,053 --> 00:49:43,329
Speaker 0: And then I was like, oh, that looks fun.

825
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:44,910
Speaker 0: Look, because I like pens.

826
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:48,630
Speaker 0: We already did a show on pens, but like it was cool that the pens were slanty.

827
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:49,170
Speaker 0: Right.

828
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:50,888
Speaker 0: And it was fun to try to use them.

829
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:58,730
Speaker 0: But, you know, I feel like calligraphy is now just for like people who do handwritten wedding invitations and shit like that.

830
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:02,870
Speaker 1: I treat it like an art form, but not a practical method of writing a long form text.

831
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:03,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

832
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:09,870
Speaker 0: It's like because sometimes, you know, you want to create some text and there's no computer font.

833
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:14,829
Speaker 0: I'm sure there might be some fancy system you could use to get the, you know, to get it look right.

834
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,989
Speaker 0: Just draw in Photoshop with a Wacom or something like that.

835
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,849
Speaker 0: But, you know, you still need to have the art of your arm doing the calligraphy.

836
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,149
Speaker 0: To make fancy texts.

837
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:26,290
Speaker 1: Motherfucker.

838
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,110
Speaker 1: So I have a random notepad, just like notes I was taking for work stuff.

839
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,250
Speaker 1: And I'm just looking at it from a penmanship eye.

840
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:34,230
Speaker 1: And I noticed something.

841
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:36,729
Speaker 1: I have two kinds of writing that I do.

842
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:42,390
Speaker 1: If I if there's a sentence or like a note like like, oh, we got to deprecate that service.

843
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:45,110
Speaker 1: I write it in cursive, but it looks it's more like shorthand.

844
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,089
Speaker 1: Like it's so barely formed and scribbly that I think only I could read it.

845
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:54,810
Speaker 1: But my printing, when I'm like making lists of things, I always do block printing.

846
00:50:55,292 --> 00:51:00,729
Speaker 1: And I just noticed that about half my letters still have the fucking Devillian like tales hanging off the end.

847
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:07,250
Speaker 0: And so this whole thing came up because I read this blog post about penmanship.

848
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,490
Speaker 0: You can read it yourself if you if you care.

849
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,762
Speaker 0: Right.

850
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,350
Speaker 0: It's not that great a blog post.

851
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:11,524
Speaker 0: Right.

852
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,249
Speaker 0: But the two things I took away from the blog post for one.

853
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,190
Speaker 0: Right.

854
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,410
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, penmanship is like a form of communication.

855
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:20,710
Speaker 0: Right.

856
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:27,689
Speaker 0: It's like if you're doing notes for yourself, you're still communicating with your future self, but especially if it's for someone else to read.

857
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,170
Speaker 0: Right.

858
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:43,850
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, how frustrating is it to talk to someone who like can't like form proper sentences or how or someone, even if they're typing online, you can see the letters, but you can't quite get the meaning of what they're saying because the grammar is poor.

859
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,929
Speaker 1: And to Bellas, I get the order sheets where someone had phoned in a big order that someone else took the notes down.

860
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,262
Speaker 1: I could never read anything.

861
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:50,110
Speaker 1: anyone else fucking wrote.

862
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,929
Speaker 0: That's why we have Grubhub now where you can't get it wrong because they check boxes instead of typing words.

863
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:56,990
Speaker 0: But if it's a phone order.

864
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:57,246
Speaker 0: Yeah.

865
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,689
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you have a hard time.

866
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:07,010
Speaker 0: So if you write something for someone else, another audience to read and it's not, you know, legible, it's like you're, you're failing at communication.

867
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:10,330
Speaker 0: So there's that, there's that aspect, which is like, oh yeah, that's right.

868
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:10,585
Speaker 0: Yeah.

869
00:52:10,691 --> 00:52:11,530
Speaker 0: That's a thing, right?

870
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,370
Speaker 0: There's a second aspect, which is that it's like an art.

871
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,890
Speaker 0: You think about like, you know, comic books have like letters, right?

872
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:26,810
Speaker 0: Like, you know, uh, there's this huge crossover between like the worlds of like, you know, art comics and like architectural drafting, right?

873
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,969
Speaker 0: Like a lot of people do more than one of the above, right?

874
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,830
Speaker 0: And it's like, and lettering by hand, as opposed to typography, which is about printing, right?

875
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:41,729
Speaker 0: Are like these completely different arts, even though they both involve setting text on a piece of paper.

876
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:42,330
Speaker 0: Right.

877
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,209
Speaker 0: Um, and so there's like that whole art to it.

878
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:54,510
Speaker 0: You know, you think about fonts right on your computer, like choose the right one, but when it comes to your hand, it's like, you got every, you have infinity fonts in your hand, right?

879
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,010
Speaker 0: Good luck, right?

880
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,170
Speaker 0: Serifs don't exist really with handwriting, right?

881
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:06,148
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, um, I mean, I guess you could, if you were really gonna draw all those little serifs on there, right?

882
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,307
Speaker 0: You really want to.

883
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:17,890
Speaker 0: Um, but he talked about in the blog post, how there's this, you know, basically there's this book that architects have, uh, which is like, sort of like the architect design textbook.

884
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:25,330
Speaker 0: I imagine if you go to architecture school, you probably buy this thing, uh, when you start and you keep it forever, sort of like that one animator book.

885
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:30,990
Speaker 0: You know, or, uh, there's a few computer science books, like the SICP one, maybe, right?

886
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:31,666
Speaker 0: There's a few of them.

887
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:34,970
Speaker 0: Um, and it's already in, it's like sixth edition, right?

888
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:42,130
Speaker 0: And in that book, there is basically a whole section that teaches you to write and this particular font.

889
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:43,590
Speaker 0: And it's like, Holy shit.

890
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:51,590
Speaker 0: Like me not knowing anything about architects, but it's like, as soon as I saw the font, I was like, every architect writes in that font, every blueprint you've ever seen.

891
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:54,750
Speaker 0: It's like they're handwriting in that font, right?

892
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:58,350
Speaker 0: Architects obviously can all fucking draw cause that's their job, right?

893
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:04,169
Speaker 0: Even if they use CAD these days, um, they can most all, almost all of them can draw on paper really well.

894
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:04,850
Speaker 0: Right.

895
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:09,110
Speaker 0: And they're all writing in that same way for a large number of reasons.

896
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,810
Speaker 0: And I was like, that's actually pretty cool.

897
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:13,030
Speaker 0: And it's really stylish.

898
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,970
Speaker 0: And like, if you wrote that way, it would be pretty cool.

899
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:17,290
Speaker 0: Even if you weren't an architect.

900
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:24,114
Speaker 0: So I ordered a old busted up used copy of that book, uh, for like a $4.

901
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:25,128
Speaker 1: I vaguely interested too.

902
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,506
Speaker 0: Cause uh, yeah, cause I just want to read that section and you know, see what it has to say.

903
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:30,549
Speaker 0: I don't care about the rest of it.

904
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,430
Speaker 0: The architect part.

905
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:41,110
Speaker 1: But in general, like a very important skill, even the computer error is to be able to, if necessary, writes probably in print, like just let cursive die unless you're doing.

906
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,410
Speaker 0: This is like the architect font as a print font, right?

907
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:49,628
Speaker 1: It's like being able to write in block print legibly if and when you need to in a way that other people can read.

908
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,289
Speaker 1: Very useful in case like something happens.

909
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:54,809
Speaker 1: The internet stops working.

910
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,369
Speaker 1: Technology fails us.

911
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,470
Speaker 1: Like it's a skill that is very human and very important.

912
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:10,590
Speaker 0: I think the time in my life, practically speaking in my current life, the time that it matters the most, um, would be if I go back to the office, right?

913
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:27,650
Speaker 0: Um, when I work with other people in person, very often when I'm explaining something to someone either on a whiteboard or even at my desk, right, I will be like, you know, drawing and writing, you know, like, like a live presentation.

914
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:31,270
Speaker 0: Like I don't have slides prepared, but I'm at to explain something to someone.

915
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,950
Speaker 1: I've learned, I rarely write any words or letters on them.

916
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,529
Speaker 1: I just use shapes because my handwriting is so bad.

917
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,610
Speaker 0: I mostly use shapes, but sometimes I'll have to use words, right?

918
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:47,469
Speaker 0: Like I'll write, I'll draw like a cylinder and I'll write like database, you know, but it's like it, you know, people can't read it.

919
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,012
Speaker 0: So it's like.

920
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:55,390
Speaker 0: that is the area in which, you know, if I'm in person explaining things to people, probably at work, but possibly also other settings.

921
00:55:56,272 --> 00:55:58,810
Speaker 0: And I use, I really like to use, you know, drawing.

922
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:05,030
Speaker 0: I thought about actually making YouTube videos where I would hook up my iPad, which I can draw on with the magic pencil, right?

923
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,990
Speaker 0: And sort of put the magic iPad and my face on the screen at the same time as a way to like, you know, treat it like a whiteboard.

924
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:11,810
Speaker 0: And not bad.

925
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,550
Speaker 1: Sadly, the best tool I've used for that digitally because I have the Wacom is mischief, but it's discontinued.

926
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,430
Speaker 1: Like the company's gone.

927
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:28,570
Speaker 0: I still have the software, but yeah, I could just have my, you know, record the video from the iPad, record the video from my face and OBS and, you know, whatever, um, you know, capture card from the iPad webcam from the computer, right?

928
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,830
Speaker 0: All set or, or actual camera.

929
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:31,290
Speaker 0: Right.

930
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:37,809
Speaker 0: I got, it's very easy, but it's like, my handwriting is way too awful for that to actually be any good.

931
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:45,008
Speaker 0: You go, you watch like some YouTube channels with like, um, the what's the math one number file.

932
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:45,488
Speaker 0: Right.

933
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,870
Speaker 1: I was about to say there's a bunch of, but yeah, they, they have like a number file on the ground paper and they're just like, exactly.

934
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:56,649
Speaker 0: They give the person the giant roll of Brown paper and the Sharpie to, to, to deuce to teach you with.

935
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:57,029
Speaker 0: Right.

936
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,550
Speaker 0: And you can read what they're writing.

937
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:04,367
Speaker 0: If I did that, even if I was very good at the math as you know, which never will happen in my whole life.

938
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,510
Speaker 1: But as they were doing it about like the game design of Puerto Rico or like something, right.

939
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:17,608
Speaker 0: If I was going to teach you, if I was going to be a number featured in a, a board game of filed computer file video, I'm not even smart enough for a computer file, which does exist.

940
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:19,390
Speaker 0: It's the same people making the channel.

941
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:24,930
Speaker 0: Like I could not write legibly enough on the Brown paper, even going slow, right.

942
00:57:25,335 --> 00:57:26,489
Speaker 0: That it would be any good.

943
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:29,890
Speaker 0: So, uh, that's the thing, right?

944
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,990
Speaker 0: It's, it's not a completely useless skill, even though it's now mostly useless.

945
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:35,449
Speaker 1: Yup.

946
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:41,866
Speaker 0: It's uh, and it's a, and even if it's not used as a skill, it's very valuable as an art, right.

947
00:57:43,132 --> 00:57:46,010
Speaker 0: Especially if you're making some sort of a comic books or something.

948
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,582
Speaker 0: Right.

949
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:47,264
Speaker 1: Yup.

950
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,449
Speaker 0: Graphic novels.

951
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,630
Speaker 1: But, uh, it is, and I'm just thinking about it.

952
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:00,050
Speaker 1: I don't really write anything now except notes and custom forms, customs, farms, diagrams, forms.

953
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:00,421
Speaker 0: Yup.

954
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:00,702
Speaker 0: Yup.

955
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:00,916
Speaker 0: Yup.

956
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:03,210
Speaker 0: I'm always really slow filling out forms.

957
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:07,510
Speaker 0: Cause it's like, even if your handwriting sucks, you can do better just going slowly.

958
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:07,616
Speaker 0: Yup.

959
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:08,367
Speaker 0: No matter what.

960
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:11,570
Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, the forms got the little blocks.

961
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,609
Speaker 1: You have to fit a letter in every individual block.

962
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:14,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

963
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,941
Speaker 0: If I'm at like the DMV, I'm like, right.

964
00:58:19,111 --> 00:58:21,090
Speaker 0: Trying to make sure I don't mess anything up.

965
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,730
Speaker 0: Get a driver's license spelled, you know, Scott Robin or something.

966
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:31,590
Speaker 1: The other aspect of this that we can wrap up is, uh, signatures are generally written, at least in the West in cursive.

967
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:33,245
Speaker 0: Mine is awful.

968
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,190
Speaker 1: Who don't write in cursive.

969
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,069
Speaker 1: They usually learn how to do their signature in some pseudo cursive.

970
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:44,610
Speaker 1: And Mike's signature is funny because it originally was my name just written very nicely.

971
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:47,570
Speaker 0: Every letter in cursive, but it's mine too.

972
00:58:47,912 --> 00:58:50,770
Speaker 1: As time went on, I was writing it faster and faster and faster.

973
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:56,250
Speaker 1: And I kind of go through the motions that would make the right letters, but very quickly.

974
00:58:56,931 --> 00:58:59,329
Speaker 1: And it slowly transformed into a scribble.

975
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:03,150
Speaker 1: And at this point it is just a scribble.

976
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,290
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, but I would just write an X at some points, right?

977
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,110
Speaker 0: Cause it doesn't really matter.

978
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:10,530
Speaker 1: Especially like if I'm checking out and someone like wants a signature.

979
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:19,970
Speaker 0: I have, I have a version of my signature stored in the Adobe fill and sign because most of the time I'm filling out digital forms and I drag it onto there.

980
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,170
Speaker 0: So I look, it's the one that's in there is awful.

981
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:27,430
Speaker 0: And I sort of felt like, you know, there are people who will like help you develop your signature.

982
00:59:27,511 --> 00:59:28,770
Speaker 0: It's like, maybe I should try that.

983
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,049
Speaker 0: Like how much could that service go?

984
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,009
Speaker 1: See, I went the other way.

985
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:40,170
Speaker 1: I let mine get so bad that that squiggle is extremely consistent and extremely, like it is my signature.

986
00:59:40,332 --> 00:59:42,170
Speaker 1: You can tell right away that's rim signature.

987
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:44,110
Speaker 0: Mine looks up, but mine doesn't look good.

988
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:48,710
Speaker 0: Mine looks like a, like a, like a, uh, like a wily coyote that an anvil fell on.

989
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:50,550
Speaker 0: It's not a good one.

990
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:56,350
Speaker 0: It's like mine's got a little structure because it's like, I feel, I just wanted to make it more like artistically pleasing, right?

991
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:56,867
Speaker 0: Aesthetically.

992
00:59:57,332 --> 01:00:00,268
Speaker 1: See my squiggle is almost pleasing because it's like dah, dah, dah.

993
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:05,609
Speaker 1: And then there's like a big stylized sort of D and then another dah, dah, dah after it.

994
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:11,890
Speaker 1: But for an unrelated reason, I looked up all the scans of all my driver's licenses over the years.

995
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:16,510
Speaker 1: That's fucking signature is just identical for all of this time.

996
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,363
Speaker 1: That scribble is 100% consistent.

997
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,470
Speaker 1: It is kind of shocking.

998
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,390
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

999

1008
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,250
Speaker 1: So yeah, pay attention to what's going on in Moldova right now.

1009
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:33,070
Speaker 1: Breaking news since we recorded and then I finished the last bit.

1010
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,690
Speaker 1: But things are getting spicier in the war and I don't mean in a good way.

1011
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:47,709
Speaker 1: But anyway, stay safe out there and for now I simply leave you with... Lynn, should we be worried that our son is obsessed with a game where you just dress a cat and that's it?

1012
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:48,796
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

1013
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:50,689
Speaker 0: I mean, you get obsessed with things too.

1014
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,689
Speaker 0: Remember when you got really into soap carving?

1015
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,610
Speaker 0: Every soap in our house was shaped like a little duck, sort of.

1016
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I get obsessed with interesting things.

1017
01:01:58,232 --> 01:01:58,710
Speaker 0: Right, sure.

1018
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,173
Speaker 0: You know what?

1019
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:01,310
Speaker 1: Maybe I could help Gene with his microgreens project.

1020
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:02,395
Speaker 1: Show him how fun it can be.

1021
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:05,070
Speaker 1: I mean, we could have a mini farm in our apartment.

1022
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,110
Speaker 1: Who wouldn't want a mini farm in their apartment?

1023
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:07,532
Speaker 1: Me!

1024
01:02:07,713 --> 01:02:09,524
Speaker 0: I don't want a bunch of mini animals in here.

1025
01:02:09,544 --> 01:02:10,410
Speaker 1: This place would stink.

1026
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:11,746
Speaker 1: No, Lynn, that's not-.

1027
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,530
Speaker 1: Anyway, my point is I think he's just too distracted by that cat game.

1028
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,541
Speaker 0: Oh, a mini tractor could be fun though.

1029
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:18,990
Speaker 0: Tiny little haystacks.

1030
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,976
Speaker 1: Yep, okay.

1031
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:21,630
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna go get water.

1032
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,697
Speaker 0: Oh, get me some too.

1033
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,149
Speaker 1: And a little snack, maybe a cookie.

1034
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:24,670
Speaker 1: Sure.

1035
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:25,549
Speaker 0: And some crackers.

1036
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:25,843
Speaker 0: Really?

1037
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, and cheese with the crackers.

1038
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:29,070
Speaker 0: And arrange it a little bit.

1039
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:32,810
Speaker 1: Gene, what are you doing out of bed with the laptop?

1040
01:02:33,131 --> 01:02:33,695
Speaker 0: Oh, hey dad.

1041
01:02:33,735 --> 01:02:35,610
Speaker 0: I'm just talking to some people on a perbo forum.

1042
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,429
Speaker 1: Okay, what people are you talking to?

1043
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:42,190
Speaker 0: Perbo people are perbs as they call themselves, which is delightful.

1044
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:48,550
Speaker 0: Apparently there's a trick where if you press both buttons at the same time, perbo will cycle through all the outfits you've ever changed them into.

1045
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:50,670
Speaker 1: Wow, I did not know that.
