1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,811
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 25th 2020.

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,579
Speaker 1: I'm rim Tom Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,231
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about packs Pam air second edition.

4
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:19,736
Speaker 0: Not the convention.

5
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:23,697
Speaker 1: Yeah No, it's the kind of game we'd play at a convention.

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:25,759
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:31,160
Speaker 1: So as you know, we had to set up a bunch of pipelines to record panels at home remotely.

8
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:34,760
Speaker 1: We're gonna use this pipeline to do a bunch of other projects probably.

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:41,117
Speaker 1: Wow, we we're getting close to being in for the long haul in terms of content creation when we're stuck at home.

10
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:42,320
Speaker 1: and that's continuing.

11
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:52,854
Speaker 1: But one of the problems of us being in separate places is that I owed a bunch of technology and Scott owns a bunch of Technology, but there were pieces of technology that we didn't both have a good version of.

12
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:53,135
Speaker 1: like.

13
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:54,460
Speaker 1: I have the really good mixer.

14
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:57,579
Speaker 1: Scott has like a one input device to use.

15
00:00:58,443 --> 00:00:59,811
Speaker 1: Scott has the live wedge.

16
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:04,399
Speaker 1: I don't really have a Video switcher device streaming thing like that.

17
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,044
Speaker 1: So I actually bought.

18
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:21,335
Speaker 1: I was gonna buy an HDMI input card just to use better cameras for all these pipelines when I needed to But I didn't want to get one that goes in my PC Even though those are extremely high quality like a black magic like PCIe card for that.

19
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,700
Speaker 1: It's just like a plus quality.

20
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,477
Speaker 0: I mean, I just have a USB a for one and it's extremely high quality.

21
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:32,779
Speaker 0: Yep, right I just wonder if I'm I can use more than one on the same computer at the same time or if that will mess up.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, that depends.

23
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:35,851
Speaker 0: I've heard that it causes.

24
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:40,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard it causes a lot of problems to do that And that's why you need this switcher thing.

25
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,148
Speaker 1: Yeah Some of those things have a bunch of lanes.

26
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,780
Speaker 1: or also if you know what the problem is Usually you'll have the same problem you have if you plug in two sound cards.

27
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can't ever like really be in sync with each other.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,720
Speaker 1: So I was looking around and I wanted like a high quality device night all these parameters.

29
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:02,345
Speaker 1: But then I saw that black magic sells their atem devices Which I've seen pros use like.

30
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:06,220
Speaker 1: they're really good video switchers and like video input devices.

31
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:09,818
Speaker 1: But they have a mini version that's relatively new.

32
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:15,400
Speaker 1: That's way cheap like the pro version that does a bunch of crazy stuff is over a thousand dollars.

33
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:25,643
Speaker 1: this mini version was I got it for under 300 the Mid-range to upper range like prosumer capture USB C devices I was looking at.

34
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:28,251
Speaker 1: we're only like 80 to 100 bucks less than that.

35
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:33,340
Speaker 1: So I figured I'll just get like this real device and I'm not gonna like review this device.

36
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:39,100
Speaker 1: This isn't a Monday show But the reason I'm bringing this up is like magic did something cool that I haven't seen a lot of other companies do.

37
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:52,825
Speaker 1: the hardware is Basically the same as the pro version like the the same like the pro version has more chips inside it But the outside of it like the case and the buttons and the inputs and outputs I think I think what.

38
00:02:52,865 --> 00:03:01,742
Speaker 0: I think one of the higher level ones had more a few more buttons Yeah, but yet it's I. it looks you would you would have to like put a sticker to tell them apart or look closely Exactly.

39
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:04,029
Speaker 1: So this one won't live stream itself.

40
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:05,995
Speaker 1: Like it can't encode in live stream or anything.

41
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:15,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, the live wedge can do that Yes But it can take four HDMI ins and send HDMI out so I could use this as a switcher for a better capture device.

42
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:22,939
Speaker 1: And it's designed to just appear as a webcam but a super high quality webcam Mm-hmm, but and that's all cool.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:38,880
Speaker 1: But the cool thing about this is that the documentation for the pro version and the mini version is actually the same Documentation and the mini for the cheap version can do almost everything the pro version can Except the live streaming.

44
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:44,577
Speaker 0: So if you want to set the expensive part because that you need a CPU that can encode video.

45
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:51,660
Speaker 0: That's a relatively I mean, it's not a super expensive CPU But it still adds a significant expense to the device.

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,807
Speaker 0: It adds more power requirements to the device.

47
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:58,120
Speaker 0: the device needs more memory to hold the video data in memory, right?

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,004
Speaker 0: So do it?

49
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,653
Speaker 0: the ability to encode video?

50
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:09,364
Speaker 0: just a video encoder Just a hardware video encoder is already a somewhat expensive device on its own for a good one that can do high res in real Time.

51
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:18,470
Speaker 0: right, you know, it's like yeah That's the kind of an expensive thing like a real desktop computer kind of does Uses a significant CPU percentage doing that kind of work.

52
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:24,720
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you remove that the red HDMI switching That's like it's like that's just signal switching.

53
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:25,672
Speaker 0: It's like you just know.

54
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:26,259
Speaker 0: it's way cheap.

55
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:31,660
Speaker 1: But all the features that you would normally use the pro for other than streaming are still in there.

56
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:31,902
Speaker 1: Like.

57
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,060
Speaker 1: it'll do all it'll do chroma keying and hardware.

58
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,860
Speaker 1: It has all the transition stuff picture-in-picture stuff.

59
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,101
Speaker 1: like.

60
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:48,872
Speaker 1: it has all the things that you would use if you were Like the person who was doing the live stream like in the production trailer somewhere and I guess that the point I want to make the cool thing here.

61
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,218
Speaker 1: Is that the interface for this?

62
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:50,660
Speaker 1: the buttons?

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Speaker 1: It's the professional layout instead of doing what most companies do where you have like the prosumer the prosumer or like low-end Professional versions and then you have like the consumer versions that just like have a simplified baby interface.

64
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:06,840
Speaker 1: This has the real interface.

65
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:23,135
Speaker 1: so if someone wanted to say learn how to be the person who sits in the control room and like Switches between cameras and monitors feeds and does transitions and all that stuff This will actually if you use this device It'll teach you like what all the buttons do on a professional device.

66
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:28,880
Speaker 1: in the same way That if you buy a real mixer, you will learn what all the buttons do on a professional mixer.

67
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:36,120
Speaker 0: No, I mean, yes a black magic is not a company that is meant that serves an audience of like, you know consumers.

68
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, they serve prosumer and up right, right.

69
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:49,320
Speaker 0: So if you look at like, you know, like the capture card that I bought from like Aver It's like a gamer capture card, but that doesn't matter It's just a branding on it, right, but it's it's meant for gamers to like stream on Twitch.

70
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:55,640
Speaker 0: All it does is convert HDMI to USB 3 and also output HDMI with no delay, right?

71
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,110
Speaker 0: Everything else is nonsense, right?

72
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:05,340
Speaker 0: So it's like Yeah, you know they tried to make it easy because they knew the people using it might just be a gamer who's streaming on Twitch.

73
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,945
Speaker 0: It does everything I needed to do.

74
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,557
Speaker 0: I don't care but you know, it's like yeah, they have a different.

75
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:11,620
Speaker 0: they have different audiences.

76
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 0: They have some products.

77
00:06:13,065 --> 00:06:14,611
Speaker 0: They're trying to sell to professionals.

78
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:18,355
Speaker 0: that wouldn't have all this gamer crap all over it But it would be mostly the same device.

79
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:23,834
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, but black magic is only serving people doing real work, right?

80
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,720
Speaker 0: They're not serving any other audience.

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's it.

82
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 1: Like even though I don't need to you like I'm not gonna use these buttons.

83
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,450
Speaker 1: I basically bought it because it's a video capture device that I can plug into any of my like Computers anywhere even my laptop.

84
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:46,332
Speaker 1: take HDMI inputs it'll synchronize them all at ingest and like do all that stuff, but it's got all the buttons for a professional trailer rig and I just think that's neat.

85
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:54,498
Speaker 1: like I don't see that often with hardware of The lowest tier having at least the same user interface as the highest tier.

86
00:06:54,538 --> 00:07:01,539
Speaker 0: because you know, I mean it There it's they're saving money is that they could make one set of plastic shells and one set of buttons.

87
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:05,331
Speaker 0: brothers They're like, oh no, we got to make a lower-end model.

88
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:11,451
Speaker 0: Let's make a whole different plastic shelf for a Whole different mold at the factory, right?

89
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:12,635
Speaker 0: You know, they don't wanna do that.

90
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:13,257
Speaker 1: Yeah.

91
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:20,000
Speaker 1: So anyway in news They're actually some big gaming news and it's having pretty big reverberations through the game industry already.

92
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:25,740
Speaker 1: Like this is it's bad news and basically nobody on earth seems happy about it, right?

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,639
Speaker 0: Well, so the the original news came a week or two ago.

94
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,093
Speaker 1: Yeah Facebook was like look all our oculus headsets as of this day like now.

95
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:41,649
Speaker 1: if you buy a new oculus VR headset like a quest or an S You have to use a Facebook account or you just can't use your hardware.

96
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:44,089
Speaker 0: Fuck you Mmm, is that what it is?

97
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,800
Speaker 0: Or is it just you can't go to the oculus?

98
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:59,760
Speaker 1: If you buy a new one you can't get you can't get firmware updates If I give you if I gave you my oculus and you wanted to make an account you cannot make an account Except but via a Facebook account, but couldn't I just use it without Nick?

99
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,859
Speaker 1: No, because there's no way to even set the device up run the software or do anything.

100
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:11,473
Speaker 0: Okay, so you're basically unless you are willing to have it I just plug into a computer and get recognized as like a new device.

101
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,640
Speaker 0: Here's the driver go go go and games.

102
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:14,933
Speaker 1: None of this stuff works.

103
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:15,600
Speaker 1: You can't do anything.

104
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,533
Speaker 0: Okay, how about that?

105
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:17,938
Speaker 0: So?

106
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,244
Speaker 1: Everyone before that date?

107
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:25,523
Speaker 1: because as far as I can tell almost everyone who has an oculus device does not link it to their Facebook account.

108
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:26,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, why would you?

109
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,415
Speaker 0: because it doesn't buy you anything?

110
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,620
Speaker 1: It just makes your device worse.

111
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,890
Speaker 0: Basically, wouldn't it let you buy things from the oculus store?

112
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,037
Speaker 1: No, you can do that with the regular oculus account.

113
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:35,558
Speaker 1: up to this point.

114
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:41,566
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's a regular oculus account that predates Facebook buying that.

115
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:46,757
Speaker 1: so when Facebook bought oculus as a company Everyone ready oculus accounts.

116
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:54,429
Speaker 0: Yep So you needed to make but you needed to make an oculus account to set up the device and do all that stuff And then you can use that or a Facebook account.

117
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,175
Speaker 1: now, it's Facebook only.

118
00:08:56,235 --> 00:09:15,839
Speaker 1: so that was the first thing that happened And basically that's the thing that since the day of that purchase The entire developer community has just constantly been afraid that Facebook would do this and was ready to bail on Facebook overall because no one who works with oculus hardware was cool with Facebook owning it for a lot of reasons.

119
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:34,520
Speaker 1: and When this news broke like I follow a lot of experimental VR people and the games industry like I know a lot of people from pecs dev my Twitter feed became filled with nothing but Developers reacting to this negatively trying to plan their post oculus pipelines planning on replacing their hardware.

120
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:37,160
Speaker 1: No one's willing to have a Facebook account in that community.

121
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,305
Speaker 0: No, why would you exactly?

122
00:09:39,766 --> 00:10:00,598
Speaker 1: but the real fear I think and there's more like there's a lot of more news happened on this like since we since that news, but the real problem, I think what people are afraid of is that Facebook is trying to brand these VR headsets as Facebook in order to try to pull people into a Facebook app store and Facebook social network.

123
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:08,140
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean they have you know, the Facebook gaming, you know streaming initiative trying to compete with twitch YouTube whoever right?

124
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:11,851
Speaker 0: It's like that's still a but thing that exists.

125
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,440
Speaker 0: I don't know who goes there, but it's a. it's a thing.

126
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, they keep.

127
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,073
Speaker 0: they're trying to make it a success.

128
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,098
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

129
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:30,779
Speaker 1: So yeah, basically like if I didn't already have an oculus rift and an oculus quest I would never buy oculus hardware again And I definitely won't buy new oculus hardware because I'm unwilling to have a Facebook account even a throwaway one.

130
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:46,967
Speaker 0: Well, this is very similar to when GoPro had a controversy when they they switched the GoPro app so that yeah You could use your good you could buy a GoPro and use it But if you wanted to you needed the app on your phone or right to like You know get firmware updates and synchrony.

131
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:55,076
Speaker 0: you get extra features when you hook it up to the phone and they they When they came out with like a new version of that app and a new GoPro, I forget which one.

132
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,100
Speaker 0: it was four or five.

133
00:10:56,245 --> 00:11:05,720
Speaker 0: I think They made getting a GoPro account mandatory Even if you weren't going to pay for their special extra features and people were like that is some bullshit.

134
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,106
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

135
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:08,030
Speaker 0: and now it's they.

136
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,180
Speaker 0: it was so much uproar that yeah now it's optional.

137
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:22,852
Speaker 0: The app still sort of encourages you to make a GoPro account but you do not and People are also worried like well What if I can't sign into my GoPro account because I'm out in the middle of the woods and then I can't Transfer my file, you know connect to my GoPro.

138
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,038
Speaker 0: It's like, you know.

139
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:27,900
Speaker 0: So GoPro relented and it they made it optional, right?

140
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,660
Speaker 0: You can just buy a GoPro use it use it with your phone without making the account without signing into the account.

141
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:45,915
Speaker 1: So I watched the entire developer community in VR basically abandon this platform instantly and then The article that was posted like the next day like even the verge.

142
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,540
Speaker 1: their headline for this was quote.

143
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,940
Speaker 1: Facebook is making oculus's worst feature unavoidable.

144
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:53,263
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

145
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:56,553
Speaker 0: So the news today is that they're doing even more rebranding.

146
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:57,396
Speaker 0: they've changed.

147
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:58,660
Speaker 0: What did they change?

148
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:05,487
Speaker 1: Okay, so oculus connect was like their conference and they've It's like the oculus convention.

149
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,735
Speaker 1: They've renamed it Facebook connects.

150
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,260
Speaker 1: It's coming up like in a few weeks.

151
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,826
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's called Facebook connect

152
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:27,040
Speaker 1: and there are rumblings that they're not gonna even call the heart the upcoming hardware oculus anymore though a little bit that was cloudy because I think some people Saw the leak of the code name for the oculus quest 2 and thought that that was the new brand name.

153
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,760
Speaker 1: But that appears to be an internal code name.

154
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:33,173
Speaker 0: I just feel like Facebook quest like just replace oculus with Facebook and keep everything else.

155
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, that seems like straightforward, right?

156
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,205
Speaker 1: Oh god, even this article frames it.

157
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:41,680
Speaker 1: as Facebook connect rebranding follows a controversial choice to require Facebook law.

158
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,454
Speaker 0: They've also renamed the team at Facebook who works on it, right?

159
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:49,338
Speaker 0: They're no longer like the oculus team They're not like the Facebook reality something.

160
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:49,620
Speaker 0: Yeah.

161
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:59,756
Speaker 1: So basically everyone assumed was hoping that Facebook wouldn't ruin The oculus people and the oculus culture and the oculus technology like they've ruined literally everything else they've ever bought.

162
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:04,291
Speaker 0: and now Facebook's Remember Facebook was started by that awful person, right?

163
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:04,953
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah not face.

164
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,137
Speaker 0: Oh not Facebook was.

165
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:06,780
Speaker 0: yeah oculus.

166
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:11,137
Speaker 0: You're right oculus was also started by an awful person.

167
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:19,400
Speaker 0: Yeah The point is is that that culture acts I think improved at least, you know oculus of the employees at least.

168
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,917
Speaker 0: But it was really the the thing that oculus had going for it since the beginning.

169
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:24,399
Speaker 0: was that like?

170
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:30,334
Speaker 0: yes Their VR hardware and software was better than the competition and probably still is.

171
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:30,695
Speaker 0: Yep.

172
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,440
Speaker 1: It came first and it just worked.

173
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:40,231
Speaker 1: Yep Cuz like I've used vibes their little fiddly Index is also a little fiddly like this was the most consumer accessible one.

174
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:43,180
Speaker 1: and the quest is like really accessible and really cool.

175
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:51,280
Speaker 1: but Pretty sure almost everyone using this hardware if they're not a developer also isn't using the oculus store.

176
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,508
Speaker 1: They're just using it with steam because it just works with steam.

177
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, though that may not be the case in the future now.

178
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:03,108
Speaker 1: so I've got a two-year time limit to upgrade all my VR and probably go with whatever like Index 2 is.

179
00:14:03,229 --> 00:14:05,903
Speaker 1: or I got to keep an eye on this space now Which is?

180
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,951
Speaker 0: I have a rainbow situation here in New York.

181
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,300
Speaker 0: It was just a sudden storm and now the Sun is out again.

182
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see the Sun coming back out there late in the day.

183
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,789
Speaker 0: I think this rainbow action, but I can't see it cuz I'm doing a podcast.

184
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,780
Speaker 1: but I guess here's my like real real fear Aside from everything else that's going on in the space is something very specific.

185
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:27,907
Speaker 1: VR is still like an extended market Barely like more like a niche market like it has.

186
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,464
Speaker 1: it's not mainstream consumer technology yet 100% agree It is.

187
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,740
Speaker 1: it's like an extended market of enthusiasts.

188
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:45,289
Speaker 1: Though the quest is accessible It's still a luxury or like odd item like people aren't just buying these off the shelves that a Toys R Us yet Even though they do just work and they're pretty good.

189
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,740
Speaker 1: Like I think VR is awesome and I'm still really into it.

190
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:59,312
Speaker 1: However, my fear is that Facebook is going to literally try to force people to use Facebook social network stuff in VR and I think what that might lead to.

191
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:13,114
Speaker 1: the biggest threat to Facebook right now in VR is Probably VR chat which Facebook does not own which just works on any Headset and is basically the social network doesn't even need a headset.

192
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,040
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's a desktop client.

193
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,583
Speaker 0: Look at that.

194
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:25,583
Speaker 1: VR chat is janky as hell but you know what it is exactly what people wanted and it kind of works as Janky and weird as it is.

195
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:26,926
Speaker 1: Like I have a lot of fun in there.

196
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:40,517
Speaker 1: I Ban all the kinds of things like VR chat that compete with the things Facebook wants to offer as a first-party service.

197
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,205
Speaker 0: I Don't know if they will.

198
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:47,640
Speaker 0: that's like a step further than even what Apple does in terms of like Monopoly.

199
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,488
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you know how they would go after it.

200
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:52,399
Speaker 1: They go after it based on in-app purchases or things like that.

201
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:53,697
Speaker 0: Are there any?

202
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,380
Speaker 0: Are there any things that Facebook has any like VR games or any VR app at all that Facebook has banned?

203
00:16:00,984 --> 00:16:08,280
Speaker 1: Well, because VR right now everyone just buys stuff on Steam or In the oculus store like Facebook is not really messed with it yet.

204
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,814
Speaker 1: This is the first indication that Facebook is now going to start messing with it.

205
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you knew they were gonna mess with it.

206
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:20,426
Speaker 1: Real like Facebook's Adoption and usage seems to be dropping.

207
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,613
Speaker 1: the brand is toxic to younger people.

208
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:24,720
Speaker 1: like young people don't really use Facebook.

209
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:28,154
Speaker 1: I worry that what they're trying to do is Instagram though.

210
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,935
Speaker 1: Yeah for now Instagram it's just a matter of time.

211
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:40,706
Speaker 1: No So my advice to you if you're a VR developer, basically if you're a VR enthusiast It is too late to buy oculus hardware.

212
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:45,379
Speaker 1: assume that hardware is dead and buy something else like there is no future here for you.

213
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this just goes along with.

214
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:55,928
Speaker 0: you know What I've been saying for since oculus started becoming a thing that people would actually buy is that yeah The VR is not close enough.

215
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,440
Speaker 0: It's to Scott is gonna buy it or care about it, right?

216
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,550
Speaker 0: It's like, you know all the VR is that exists today.

217
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,744
Speaker 0: the whatever they the vibes and whatnot the oculus These are all gonna go away.

218
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:11,040
Speaker 0: the the VR that's actually gonna be the real deal is coming in the future.

219
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,109
Speaker 0: It's a few more years down the road.

220
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,839
Speaker 1: See I still think you're like a hundred percent wrong on that.

221
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:27,460
Speaker 1: This is this is one Generation away from being like a fully expanded market and the lower-end models of one more generation are gonna become mass market.

222
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,168
Speaker 1: I mean, you're welcome.

223
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,880
Speaker 0: I think we're still closer to the virtual boy than we are to that.

224
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

225
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:37,288
Speaker 1: You've never even used VR.

226
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,472
Speaker 1: You have no idea what this is.

227
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:38,713
Speaker 1: Like.

228
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,760
Speaker 0: I know that it's not good.

229
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,572
Speaker 1: What was what was the last VR hardware you have put on your head?

230
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,260
Speaker 1: What was the last VR hardware you tried?

231
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,042
Speaker 0: It's still.

232
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,367
Speaker 0: I mean, it's still that.

233
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:49,070
Speaker 0: what's the difference?

234
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,318
Speaker 0: It's just a higher resolution, you know screen.

235
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:54,012
Speaker 0: You still putting a screen in front of your eyeballs.

236
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:54,856
Speaker 0: It's not any different.

237
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,680
Speaker 1: It's gonna be that It's gonna be screen in front of your eye resolution.

238
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:57,901
Speaker 0: 40 more years.

239
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,025
Speaker 1: All right, so in 20 to 40 more years call me.

240
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:04,338
Speaker 1: Okay Well, the rest of us will keep playing with VR.

241
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,519
Speaker 1: But anyway, the real the story here is just Facebook is doing everything they can to destroy oculus.

242
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:12,989
Speaker 0: Well, they're not trying to destroy it.

243
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,491
Speaker 0: They believe.

244
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,940
Speaker 1: well, I you know, I think they're trying to do.

245
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,919
Speaker 1: I think what they're trying to do specifically is get younger people to get Facebook accounts.

246
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:25,300
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know how many young people have a VR headset more than you more than you realize.

247
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,883
Speaker 1: Quest actually sold really well Really?

248
00:18:28,923 --> 00:18:31,453
Speaker 1: Well, how many I can go try to dig up the numbers.

249
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:31,874
Speaker 1: It's it.

250
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,420
Speaker 0: I can't imagine it's that many.

251
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:38,529
Speaker 1: And there's enough of an ecosystem to where I did it even outsell something like PSP.

252
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:45,717
Speaker 1: There is enough of an ecosystem where there are numerous independent game studios profitably making VR games.

253
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:54,080
Speaker 0: hmm, I Guess if you make you know, really quick ones like VR chat, you don't need to sell that many.

254
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,320
Speaker 1: Well VR chat is very very second-life II and that it's very sort of just open like you can just make whatever in there.

255
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:04,820
Speaker 1: So like someone will give you a link to a secret avatar world filled with it's all just copyright violation.

256
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,600
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, you know, if you look at games like, you know, the bomb defusing one, right?

257
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,020
Speaker 0: It's like yeah that game didn't cost a lot to make you know, so you don't just sell that many copies.

258
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:21,140
Speaker 1: Yeah That game is basically like a kind of a toy compared to what's coming out upcoming.

259
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:30,799
Speaker 1: Also, you know what's gonna I think actually drive headset adoption among our demographic like expanding the extended market that new Star Wars game As long as it's at least passively good.

260
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:32,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's definitely.

261
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:37,820
Speaker 1: I think you're gonna see low-end VR headsets and hot-ass sell out sell the hell out.

262
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:41,312
Speaker 0: Well, Microsoft Microsoft flight simulator already sold all the hottest.

263
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:41,934
Speaker 0: There's none left.

264
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna have to get another production run.

265
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:58,705
Speaker 0: But the point is yeah I definitely see that as a good path for game developers is if your game has a First-person camera of some kind right if you're making a racing especially vehicle games racing airplane Anything like that.

266
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:02,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, no you're saying that I am in my professional experience.

267
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,523
Speaker 1: That is not the case.

268
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:09,200
Speaker 1: almost any plane game like airplane game with a headset will make people violently nauseous.

269
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,238
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, the point is space games are easier for reasons that are way out of scope for the show in.

270
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:23,040
Speaker 0: the point is I think if you're making a game that could be VR, but like doesn't have to be VR, right?

271
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,568
Speaker 0: So like the Star Wars spaceship game, right?

272
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,836
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, that could be VR or it couldn't be.

273
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:33,999
Speaker 0: it works sort of equally Well, either way, it's not like a game, you know, like half-life Alex where it's like it's got to be VR.

274
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,588
Speaker 0: This game is a VR game.

275
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:41,613
Speaker 1: It wouldn't really work on a screen that well And it's good in VR but would not really be worth playing if it wasn't.

276
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:42,958
Speaker 0: and it's not a game like.

277
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:55,019
Speaker 0: I don't know fucking Chess where VR chess is kind of like, all right It's better on a screen to just play chess than to do a tabletop simulator VR chess, right?

278
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,100
Speaker 0: But Star Wars in a spaceship flying an x-wing sort of equally good at both the screen and the VR modes are sort of equally valid.

279
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:08,537
Speaker 0: so if you're making that kind of game add Support for VR but don't require it.

280
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:10,946
Speaker 0: make both Experiences equally good.

281
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,932
Speaker 0: the same way that you could make a cartridge.

282
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,660
Speaker 0: that would be good in a Gameboy Color and a black white game.

283
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,148
Speaker 1: Really good is key though.

284
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:22,859
Speaker 1: So many people try to take an existing game They've made that would be good in VR and add VR to it.

285
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:24,730
Speaker 1: No, that's that that.

286
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,301
Speaker 1: that's how you get Fallout 4.

287
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:28,813
Speaker 0: It's got to be a game that can work either way.

288
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,200
Speaker 0: that has a first-person camera.

289
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,690
Speaker 0: Naturally that you know just sort of works either way.

290
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,639
Speaker 1: actually third-person works really well, too.

291
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:40,642
Speaker 0: You just see yourself you're hovering you look at yourself while you're in or you're looking down and interacting with things Like.

292
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:41,591
Speaker 1: there's a lot like that.

293
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,560
Speaker 1: moss game is like that.

294
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:50,966
Speaker 1: You're basically piloting this little mouse around in a complex 3d environment walking around it and solving puzzles But the camera is first first.

295
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,812
Speaker 1: No, you're standing over the mouse.

296
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:54,216
Speaker 1: third person works fine.

297
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,441
Speaker 1: It's really immersive Interesting.

298
00:21:56,963 --> 00:21:57,245
Speaker 1: I've just.

299
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,831
Speaker 1: you've never seen modern VR.

300
00:21:58,871 --> 00:21:59,675
Speaker 0: You have no idea.

301
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,101
Speaker 0: See you aren't the mouse You're.

302
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:02,026
Speaker 1: so you are the mouse.

303
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:03,192
Speaker 1: you you are the mouse.

304
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 1: you move the mouse with like controllers And you can also but you're reaching the world with your hand and fucks with stuff so that you're not the mouse.

305
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,407
Speaker 0: You're some hand of your both side.

306
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:13,471
Speaker 0: this the same way.

307
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,457
Speaker 0: I'm not Mario when I play Mario Brothers.

308
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:18,048
Speaker 0: I'm still me I'm controlling Mario.

309
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:18,892
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm an.

310
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:20,560
Speaker 1: that's a way to think of it.

311
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,723
Speaker 1: Yes, you're you're playing.

312
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:29,293
Speaker 0: imagine playing Mario Galaxy, but you're in VR in the environment, but if I play Mario Galaxy I'm not Mario, but if I play half-life I am.

313
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:30,360
Speaker 0: I'm Gordon Freeman.

314
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:37,750
Speaker 1: All right, that's an interesting distinction you made for reasons that we don't want to get into right now But it has to do with the power of the immersion of VR.

315
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,300
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some other news here, right?

316
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,033
Speaker 0: So there's a sports news going on.

317
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:44,140
Speaker 0: This is really fascinating.

318
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,680
Speaker 0: Do you remember when those big controversy over those fancy bathing suits in the Olympics?

319
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, people are going faster.

320
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:56,880
Speaker 0: and then there was controversy over the fancy shoes people were using in marathons.

321
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:03,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, and how back in the 90s when it was like gotta be the shoes right Air Jordans They did not actually help you.

322
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:06,340
Speaker 0: a basketball pumps did not help you jump higher.

323
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:16,780
Speaker 1: But now there are shoes that literally by producing less heat on impact and producing more spring instead They can actually reduce your long-distance running times by like 2%.

324
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,552
Speaker 0: So we went from the gimmick times to where the technology didn't really help.

325
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:24,408
Speaker 0: then we entered an era where technology helped But only if you're a professional.

326
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,280
Speaker 0: it's like yeah, here's some professional golf clubs.

327
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:31,020
Speaker 0: They do help Tiger Woods hit the ball farther, but they ain't gonna help you hit the ball farther, right?

328
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:32,225
Speaker 0: Here's a tennis racket.

329
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,195
Speaker 0: It'll help Roger Federer Serena Williams win.

330
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:34,959
Speaker 0: It won't help you win.

331
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:39,180
Speaker 0: And now we're entering the era where like yeah, this stuff will help anybody.

332
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,363
Speaker 0: It's just better equipment.

333
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:45,438
Speaker 0: and it's finally entered the hockey realm right in the NHL.

334
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:49,575
Speaker 0: right now There's been a new stick that has come out that they are using in games.

335
00:23:49,756 --> 00:23:50,580
Speaker 0: So it must be legal.

336
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've got.

337
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:53,832
Speaker 1: Evgeny Kuznetsov is practicing with it.

338
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,720
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of photos of him playing with this stick.

339
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, a goal has already been scored with it.

340
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:02,500
Speaker 0: And basically the blade of the stick has a slit shaped hole in the stick.

341
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,659
Speaker 0: So it's like there's the bottom of this the blade and closer near the top of the blade is a slit.

342
00:24:08,622 --> 00:24:11,740
Speaker 0: And supposedly it obviously makes it lighter because it's just less material.

343
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:16,600
Speaker 0: But I guess it also makes it, you know, less bit more aerodynamic when you push it forward.

344
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,040
Speaker 1: I guess also from what I read near the top and the bottom are shaped slightly differently so you can have more complex puck handling.

345
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:27,700
Speaker 0: Sure, there's something to this stick that it may or may not be an improvement.

346
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:33,037
Speaker 0: It could end up being crazy like the bathing suit and like I'm imagining like holding this stick.

347
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:40,750
Speaker 1: and the one thing I can see Right away is that you could almost like tip the puck up and catch the puck's Corner in that thing and like you could do weird stuff with this stick.

348
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,040
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, they're calling it sling tech for a reason.

349
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,073
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's interesting.

350
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:48,140
Speaker 0: It's a new thing.

351
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,178
Speaker 0: We'll see what comes of it.

352
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:58,460
Speaker 0: But it just reminds me that like, hey, I have memories of like being in middle school high school and the plastic sticks We used like had holes or slits in them in that spot already.

353
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,615
Speaker 0: All my road hockey sticks had that and I always tried to at the time.

354
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:11,280
Speaker 0: I remember thinking like hey How come the pros don't have this hole in their stick that this has either a it's just decoration.

355
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:14,830
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually help you right B. They're not allowed to this.

356
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,652
Speaker 0: rules there.

357
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:18,700
Speaker 0: Maybe they can't because they're six or wooden, right?

358
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:20,886
Speaker 0: The same way they're like minor league.

359
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:24,080
Speaker 0: little league baseball uses metal bats, but pros have to use wooden ones.

360
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,600
Speaker 0: I thought it was you know, something like that, right?

361
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 0: Whatever and I'm sure it didn't.

362
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:30,034
Speaker 0: I knew it didn't make a difference for the hockey.

363
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,520
Speaker 0: We were playing in Jim or whatever.

364
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:34,434
Speaker 0: But this is that exact same thing.

365
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:35,099
Speaker 0: This is new.

366
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:41,527
Speaker 0: It's like I had sticks with this hole in it or at least, you know close to this hole in it 20 years ago over 20 years ago.

367
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,540
Speaker 1: Yep, but I don't think it had any effect on the sticks back then.

368
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,680
Speaker 1: I think it might have just been to save plastic or for structural reinforcement reasons or just to look cool and make kids buy it.

369
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know but I guess now it's a thing Someone's you know done some science to at least make someone believe it's real and it matters.

370
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,709
Speaker 0: It clearly doesn't seem to hurt.

371
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:07,080
Speaker 1: It looks like at the bottom of this article There's another stick that just has a ton of holes in it.

372
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Speaker 1: So the bottom is complete is completely perforated like that Swiss cheese.

373
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:16,840
Speaker 1: There's a screenshot in the article you sent me at the bottom and the NHL is currently reviewing this company.

374
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:21,660
Speaker 1: I guess to decide if this stick with holes in it is a lot gonna be allowed.

375
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:31,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you know as long as it doesn't give some ridiculous advantage like the sneakers or the bathing or if it does Maybe they just have to decide are we willing to let the sport go down this path?

376
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:32,440
Speaker 0: That could be cool, too.

377
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:40,910
Speaker 0: and then As long as it doesn't pose a safety risk like the stick is shattering all over the place Because the sticks are already shattering at a pretty high rate.

378
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:43,400
Speaker 0: That's that's really the number one concern, right?

379
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,540
Speaker 0: You can't have bleeds going like or like someone gets whacked with it and it hurts way more or something.

380
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,548
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I remember as a kid playing street hockey.

381
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:53,640
Speaker 1: We all used aluminum sticks that that was bad.

382
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,429
Speaker 0: I got hurt is we used a fiberglass.

383
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,940
Speaker 0: the stick was fiberglass or plastic and the blade was plastic.

384
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,111
Speaker 1: Our sticks were a lot of my two sticks.

385
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,940
Speaker 1: I had an ice stick where the stick was aluminum.

386
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:10,040
Speaker 1: There's a wooden blade on the end at another one where the stick was aluminum And then the blade was plastic and straight instead of curved.

387
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,819
Speaker 0: Hmm anyway, but yeah, this is something to keep an eye on.

388
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:19,800
Speaker 0: And also, you know watch out for this stuff in other sports that are not as tightly regulated.

389
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,767
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

390
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:31,777
Speaker 0: what he got What was my thing of the day?

391
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:33,184
Speaker 0: I forgot Hypnospace Outlaw.

392
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:39,585
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, so we didn't talk about GDQ nearly enough on this show which which happened over the last week.

393
00:27:39,886 --> 00:27:41,170
Speaker 0: they did GDQ online.

394
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,153
Speaker 0: It was just.

395
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:48,530
Speaker 0: it was just as GDQ, but it was online edition because every see everyone was not in the same location.

396
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,494
Speaker 0: They were all streaming.

397
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:50,277
Speaker 1: I tend to.

398
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,269
Speaker 1: I tend to watch these like a couple days after they air on YouTube.

399
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,420
Speaker 0: They did a very good job of uploading things to YouTube promptly.

400
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,747
Speaker 0: The entire thing is now I believe on YouTube.

401
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:00,530
Speaker 0: great job.

402
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:08,910
Speaker 0: Technical difficulties not there weren't none, but there were way less considering you had all these different people live streaming their stuff, right?

403
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,016
Speaker 0: But I guess it helped in some way and that GDQ only had to handle the streaming Aspect and people.

404
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:19,410
Speaker 0: they didn't have to handle getting everyone set up on the same physical place.

405
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,523
Speaker 0: You know people had their setups at home.

406
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:22,490
Speaker 0: They were already set up.

407
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:29,370
Speaker 0: They just had to manage to stream their own shit somehow which they have experience doing because they're all speedrunners, right?

408
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:35,470
Speaker 0: So I just want to point to if you miss GDQ, I just want to point to a particular run.

409
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:38,541
Speaker 0: Here is a run of a game called Hypnospace Outlaw.

410
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,766
Speaker 0: I may have mentioned it on the show.

411
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:40,789
Speaker 1: It's on sale right now.

412
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:43,359
Speaker 0: Just saying yes by Liz star.

413
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,524
Speaker 0: The game is on sale.

414
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:45,066
Speaker 0: This is a game.

415
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:49,177
Speaker 0: I first saw at PAX Then I played it finally and it was incredible.

416
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:58,362
Speaker 0: It is a game which simulates basically an alternate reality 90s internet service Hypnospace which you access while you're sleeping.

417
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:09,870
Speaker 0: So there's a little bit of cyberpunk going on there And you start out in the game as a moderator of Hypnospace And if you play the game casually and not speedrun it like Liz star does here it basically.

418
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:22,059
Speaker 0: They did an amazing job of like Recreating that feeling of being a lurker in an internet community and seeing it play out That 90s internet aesthetic.

419
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:30,050
Speaker 0: it is such a good game To play casually and explore the the world the virtual world that was created.

420
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:41,630
Speaker 0: And also an extra note you won't know by watching the video But I'm pretty 90% sure that this video ended up being the world record run for this category.

421
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:52,840
Speaker 0: And if you look at the website that has the speedrun records It's Liz star has the record for this category and the time matches the time they got in this run.

422
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,990
Speaker 0: so I think this is a world record run.

423
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,961
Speaker 0: They just didn't realize it at the time too shabby and so it wasn't.

424
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:09,828
Speaker 0: it wasn't like announced and I think afterwards You know it was it was found out like oh even though there was also some fooling around during the run because there are certain times you just have to wait and such.

425
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,787
Speaker 0: so They spend a lot of time going to listen to the the grandma ha ha ha.

426
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,190
Speaker 1: So I saw this tweet that let me down an interesting rabbit hole.

427
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:22,350
Speaker 1: But the tweet was calling my attention to a reddit that I hadn't really noted.

428
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,703
Speaker 1: Maybe I noticed it and forgot about it, but the reddit is called our.

429
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:26,667
Speaker 1: what is this thing?

430
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:27,330
Speaker 1: and it's a place.

431
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:29,038
Speaker 0: I've heard of that reddit, but I have no.

432
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:36,990
Speaker 1: so it's a place where people will post a thing they found Oh, and basically ask other people to explain what the hell this thing is which honestly a pretty good idea.

433
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,899
Speaker 1: I've seen weird things.

434
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:53,009
Speaker 1: I wondered what they were But this reddit is notable in that it is a shockingly rapid rate of responses and high success rate at identifying Very strange and unusual things.

435
00:30:54,152 --> 00:31:01,368
Speaker 1: but the thing that brought my called my attention is this terrifying picture of something and someone's like help me what is this?

436
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:10,770
Speaker 1: and There was an almost immediate combat that said this is gonna sound crazy But that is a harness for a combat dolphin.

437
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:18,368
Speaker 1: And the answer was yes, that was in fact a harness for a combat dolphin.

438
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:22,283
Speaker 0: now When when I mean that's something I've seen in.

439
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:29,829
Speaker 1: so I was about to ask you So you were not familiar with the concept of combat dolphins which are real and are used by multiple militaries including the United States.

440
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:39,350
Speaker 0: to this day I've heard of people using dolphins for military applications But the Dolphins would be operating like on their own like they would train a dolphin to go do something.

441
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,407
Speaker 0: I had never heard of someone riding a.

442
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:44,161
Speaker 1: no No The harness is not for someone to ride a dolphin.

443
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:49,721
Speaker 1: the harness is for the dolphin to wear To be able to accomplish its mission which may involve killing some.

444
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,729
Speaker 0: oh that makes what I was imagining like a sad, okay.

445
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,296
Speaker 1: No, this is like a harness.

446
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:55,441
Speaker 1: that that sounds much more.

447
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,389
Speaker 1: carry the tools they need to murder a guy?

448
00:31:58,671 --> 00:31:59,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

449
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:06,769
Speaker 1: There's one of the things that these combat dolphins are trained for is to catch basically frog divers and murder them by attacking their air supplies.

450
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:08,945
Speaker 1: Like that's a thing.

451
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:11,699
Speaker 1: At least that's one of the things they could have been used for.

452
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:17,413
Speaker 0: also mine detection could be a thing or it could be like the time that You know you.

453
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,300
Speaker 0: probably we did the thing of the day with the.

454
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,781
Speaker 0: oh the color.

455
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:21,608
Speaker 0: the Scottish are the Scottish are.

456
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,746
Speaker 1: I was annoyed That only one person asked me if that was real.

457
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:28,036
Speaker 1: after the show Many people clicked on that link.

458
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:33,330
Speaker 1: only one person exhibited even the tiniest degree of skepticism but anyway.

459
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:37,464
Speaker 1: So I actually went to this reddit and subscribe because this red is pretty up my alley.

460
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:46,227
Speaker 1: and the funniest thing I noticed about this Reddit if you get on this rabbit hole They have a bot and the bots sole purpose is to immediately respond to anything that someone posts.

461
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,510
Speaker 1: that appears to be a bomb Giving them instructions and how to not get blown up and how to contact the appropriate authorities.

462
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:55,577
Speaker 0: And it's also why would it?

463
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:59,370
Speaker 1: how many people find a fine about a terrifying number of people?

464
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,480
Speaker 1: That is like the most common thing.

465
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,610
Speaker 1: people find where they're like, what's this thing?

466
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:16,767
Speaker 1: I have a feeling people just playing a game with that bot trying to find bomb pictures on the internet and My dad was a fireman, you know where you have a lot of bombs turn up old people mostly Vietnam and World War.

467
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:17,710
Speaker 1: two veterans die.

468
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:20,177
Speaker 0: How did you bring a bus?

469
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:22,930
Speaker 0: bring home be like grandpa brought a fucking shell home?

470
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,215
Speaker 1: So yours had this shell.

471
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:24,938
Speaker 1: so you're on a.

472
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:27,550
Speaker 0: you're on a plane or a boat leaving Vietnam.

473
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:29,176
Speaker 0: You finally were allowed to leave.

474
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:32,730
Speaker 0: you finished your duty and survived and you've got a bomb.

475
00:33:33,151 --> 00:33:33,653
Speaker 0: And they're just.

476
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:36,623
Speaker 0: you're just sitting there on the plane or the boat with it and no one gets.

477
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:40,948
Speaker 1: people brought a terrifying Amount of things home with them.

478
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:45,950
Speaker 0: You're just some dude in the military and you get off the boat or plane in the u.s.

479
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:56,342
Speaker 1: In the 70s and you just get off and you're carrying a many times and my dad Respond to some firefighting call where literally the problem was.

480
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:59,750
Speaker 1: someone was cleaning out grandpa's attic and they found a bunch of explosives.

481
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:04,440
Speaker 1: That is a thing people or what's like.

482
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,690
Speaker 1: just bring a landmine home put in the basement forget about it sell the house.

483
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,777
Speaker 1: It's still in the basement.

484
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:09,601
Speaker 1: Someone buys the house.

485
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:10,629
Speaker 0: What's this thing?

486
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:16,022
Speaker 1: Sometimes they're d-milled like I have.

487
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,830
Speaker 1: I don't know where it is anymore, but I had a shell.

488
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,076
Speaker 0: I knew people who had.

489
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:21,808
Speaker 0: I knew people had like grenades that were just they.

490
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,150
Speaker 0: there's nothing.

491
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:29,449
Speaker 1: So it is not that uncommon for grenades that quote have nothing in him to in fact have something in him.

492
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:36,315
Speaker 0: These definitely didn't have anything in him because they didn't have the handle Anymore.

493
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,989
Speaker 0: so if there was something in there it would have blown up already.

494
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:51,230
Speaker 1: But I saw I went to this site, but the most terrifying thing I found was not actually a bomb though There are a lot of bombs here But it was a picture of a weird siren looking device and the person was like, what is this?

495
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:58,315
Speaker 1: I think my neighbors set this up to harass their other neighbors and the answer was yes Your neighbors are psychopaths.

496
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:04,530
Speaker 1: and they set up this alarm thing to like blast sound at some neighbor probably over some petty HOA dispute.

497
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,365
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's my thing of the day.

498
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:20,923
Speaker 1: Okay In the meta moment, we're stuck at home, but we are going to be live to tape at not one but two Upcoming conventions on Friday September 4th at 4 30 p.m.

499
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,046
Speaker 1: Pacific time.

500
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:34,855
Speaker 1: So like 7 30 p.m Real time New York time judge anime by its cover on the yuzu stage at the crunchy roll Expo virtual and then on September 18th at 2 p.m.

501
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,243
Speaker 1: Pacific time or I guess 5 p.m.

Speaker 1: Real time on the PAX 3 channel.

503
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,249
Speaker 1: Where is the finish line?

504
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:42,751
Speaker 0: That's right.

505
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:50,300
Speaker 0: We have already recorded and submitted both videos of both of these panels to The respective conventions for them to air.

506
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:52,810
Speaker 0: so it is all taken care of and set in stone.

507
00:35:53,272 --> 00:36:00,499
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put a little thing in my calendar so that I know when they're airing and I'll go to the Associated chats at the convention.

508
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,162
Speaker 0: do I have to?

509
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,025
Speaker 0: I don't sure.

510
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:03,070
Speaker 0: I don't have to pay to attend now.

511
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,656
Speaker 1: There's no like I got.

512
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:06,384
Speaker 0: well the PAX one is just a twitch channel.

513
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:07,529
Speaker 0: I don't know about the crunchy roll one.

514
00:36:08,861 --> 00:36:13,288
Speaker 0: And yeah I will go and attend to these events and be in the chat while they're going on.

515
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:17,148
Speaker 1: in case Questions just be social.

516
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:24,870
Speaker 1: It'll be interesting to see how it got what kind of audiences these get because online cons Are still kind of a new thing and everyone's still trying to figure out how to make them work.

517
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,427
Speaker 0: We'll see if anyone actually goes.

518
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:39,426
Speaker 1: okay Yeah, because there have been a lot of online cons that I would be interested in but I didn't bother with because I don't have time Yep in some related meta right after I was done recording for packs online.

519
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,830
Speaker 0: I did a little experiment.

520
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:53,950
Speaker 0: I went to the geek nights Instagram Which almost no one follows and I use the the Instagram live feature and I did a little behind the scenes showing How the packs online panel recording technology?

521
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:56,870
Speaker 0: Was done at least in my apartment.

522
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:00,310
Speaker 0: So at least one person liked it.

523
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:07,749
Speaker 0: I don't know but you know I think I did a really bad job of filming cuz it's like holding a phone sort of haphazardly swinging it around.

524
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:11,610
Speaker 0: It's probably an awful video even though my explanation I think.

525
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:16,030
Speaker 0: But that gave me the idea of like hey, maybe that's what this is for.

526
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:19,749
Speaker 0: Maybe this is for behind the scenes action, right is you know?

527
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:33,109
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll do that if there's more behind the scenes also where we're which there may or may were increasingly playing games With the listener and also streaming stuff and just hanging out the geek nights from her crew.

528
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:35,602
Speaker 1: forum Discord is actually getting more and more hopping lately.

529
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:40,224
Speaker 1: because we like our forum We're keeping it going but the kids don't use forums anymore.

530
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:48,872
Speaker 1: forums are very like Some they do but forums are very 2000s and the reality is way more people interact in the discord The.

531
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,021
Speaker 0: regardless of whichever way you want to they're all there.

532
00:37:51,141 --> 00:38:03,100
Speaker 0: be it, you know, yeah email You know Twitter just DM us DMS open, you know any kind of way you want to contact and communicate except don't show up at my house Do not show up here.

533
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:09,070
Speaker 0: I mean You if you did show up at my house, it's like maybe I know it depends.

534
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,174
Speaker 0: I guess now is not a good.

535
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:16,070
Speaker 1: now is a particularly not good time to show up at our house to ask a question about geek nights.

536
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean there was a listener at one point who turned out to be a conspiracy nut.

537
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:30,692
Speaker 0: but before then before revealing their nuttiness They were just texting You know and they were reasonable until Remember.

538
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:37,892
Speaker 1: one time we'd recorded a video for like anime Boston and a listener emailed me and was like based on what's out the window Do you live here?

539
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:42,544
Speaker 1: And I was like, yes, that was cool and also terrifying.

540
00:38:42,705 --> 00:38:43,707
Speaker 1: But yes, sure.

541
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:44,109
Speaker 1: You're right.

542
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,192
Speaker 1: You figured it out That's Riley.

543
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:46,979
Speaker 0: I mean there's internet.

544
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:48,385
Speaker 0: you can figure out right?

545
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,228
Speaker 0: It's like what am I gonna do?

546
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,830
Speaker 1: They figured it out based on what was in the background of our balcony because that building used to not be in the way.

547
00:38:56,731 --> 00:39:01,827
Speaker 1: Granted I think any New Yorker could figure out where we live just based on that picture.

548
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:07,230
Speaker 0: if that If you post a photo of New York, it's like a good 60-something percent chance.

549
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,468
Speaker 1: I can tell you where it is very very likely at least tell you which borough it's in.

550
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,957
Speaker 0: pretty quick Actually be a really good game.

551
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:21,852
Speaker 0: right where there's a foot we post a photo of New York and you have to click on the Map of New York and you get one click and how many feet away you are Right.

552
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:24,923
Speaker 0: because remember there was one that was like a kind of where the map.

553
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:26,810
Speaker 1: ooh, we could be fun.

554
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:31,490
Speaker 1: You know the key is it can't be like I've seen some reddit that there's a game like that.

555
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,410
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of games like that.

556
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:39,602
Speaker 1: The key to this one is it's got to be like a thousand people are doing the picture at once and everyone only gets one Click and you just eliminate players.

557
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,329
Speaker 1: eliminate players.

558
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:42,176
Speaker 0: Now you want to do that.

559
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:43,930
Speaker 0: I figured just be go to a website where you play by yourself.

560
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,381
Speaker 1: I happen to but you only let people guess once.

561
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:46,622
Speaker 1: don't.

562
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:48,229
Speaker 1: let people try to figure it out and zoom in.

563
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:52,526
Speaker 0: No, no No you you guess and then we show you the right answer and you get I want to be I want to.

564
00:39:52,567 --> 00:40:00,244
Speaker 1: I want the people who Look at the screenshot and they're like, ah, that's 230 third Street All right.

565
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:00,626
Speaker 0: All right.

566
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:03,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, otherwise, uh, let's get into it.

567
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,859
Speaker 1: We played a game called Pax Pam air to the second edition of Pax Pam air.

568
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:19,958
Speaker 0: Yep, I played Pax Pam air - I've never played Pax Pam either of I but I played Pax Pam air - right Which is me designed by the same guy Cole Worley who made route.

569
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:30,280
Speaker 0: He I think he designed both of the games - is like a updated edition obviously and - is kick-started somewhat recently maybe like a year or two ago.

570
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:40,840
Speaker 0: And there was a second kick starter for 2.0, which I did back over 3,000 backers almost 250 grand Right, which is for another printing of the game, right?

571
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,120
Speaker 0: So they did a Kickstarter for the game and then they did a Kickstarter for a second printing.

572
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:45,709
Speaker 0: I already kick-started the second printing.

573
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:47,699
Speaker 0: It should be shipping soon ish, I guess.

574
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:54,884
Speaker 0: But yeah, so it's a Pax game just like Pax Renaissance Pax Porphyriana That one.

575
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:59,125
Speaker 0: yet in that I Played trans humanity one time.

576
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,149
Speaker 0: I didn't understand.

577
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,576
Speaker 0: so it's in that series of games.

578
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:03,960
Speaker 0: They're tableau building.

579
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:09,120
Speaker 0: You know card games they're you know, where the heuristics are quite advanced.

580
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:14,780
Speaker 1: They all have a certain sort of sensibility to them, even though they have radically different mechanics in many cases.

581
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:18,389
Speaker 0: Yep, have we done a show on any pack?

582
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:20,580
Speaker 1: I think we might have talked about packs Renaissance.

583
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:22,295
Speaker 1: I'll double-check and I'll link to it if we did.

584
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:38,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I when I played Pax Pam or two for the first time it was at PAX West It's not related to the convention anyway And I played with someone who had played Pax Renaissance Pax Pamir one and they were upset about the differences.

585
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:49,898
Speaker 0: But every difference that they brought up that made them upset with something that actually I when they explained it to me I felt that to Significantly streamlined the game and made it better.

586
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:57,500
Speaker 0: So thanks to that I mean, I mean, I'm bare a slightly interested to see what one is like.

587
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:10,780
Speaker 0: But basically my from the knowledge I have gained not experienced but information I feel like to Significantly streamlines and improves upon one and there's not much reason to play one just play two.

588
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:13,306
Speaker 0: So what is up with Pax Pam or two?

589
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:22,775
Speaker 0: This is a game where you play sort of an Afghan warlord type person during the time of

590
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:41,637
Speaker 1: Troubles We're talking 19th century like post Napoleonic war era but after an empire collapsed in the region and basically, the colonial powers are all trying to like play their game and mess around in Afghanistan.

591
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:47,920
Speaker 0: for a lot of Historical I think it was yeah, I think historically it was called like the great game or something.

592
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:59,660
Speaker 0: But basically you had Russia and Britain both coming into Afghanistan plus the Afghani people Right and all shuffle shuffle shuffle, right all kinds of political war stuff going on.

593
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:05,936
Speaker 0: And I don't know I'm not versed in the history of it I just know that that something went down then that way.

594
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:06,559
Speaker 0: that was.

595
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:10,150
Speaker 1: You know actually the description of the game really says it best.

596
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:16,620
Speaker 1: in fact spammer players assume the roles of 19th century Afghan leaders Attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire.

597
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:25,815
Speaker 1: Western history is called this period the great game because Western history is mostly around fucking with native people and calling it some sort of game.

598
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:26,216
Speaker 1: That's right.

599
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:26,838
Speaker 1: diplomacy.

600
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:43,160
Speaker 1: Yes But basically the game is from the perspective of the Afghani people Making alliances and deals with these different foreign factions to try to achieve their own ends and have some agency in their own affairs And to manipulate these interloping foreigners.

601
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:45,270
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

602
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,400
Speaker 0: So that's the theme of the game.

603
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:48,069
Speaker 0: And so how did I got it.

604
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:48,914
Speaker 1: this'll the.

605
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:50,000
Speaker 1: how does the game actually work?

606
00:43:50,341 --> 00:44:11,058
Speaker 1: If you look at the categories, this game is listed in in board game geek economic educational negotiation political post-Napoleonic spies secret agents But even funnier the list of mckin of mechanisms action points area majority influence area movement card drafting hand management and three more.

607
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:14,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's how it works.

608
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:22,820
Speaker 0: is it's basically a tableau builder meaning that in front of you You're going to be building a set of cards that represent like your abilities, right?

609
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,287
Speaker 0: Sort of like in set, you know.

610
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:26,780
Speaker 0: the same way like Magic the gathering is a tableau builder, right?

611
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,340
Speaker 0: You're summoning creatures, right?

612
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,282
Speaker 0: so there's a market of cards and you start everyone starts with some same amount of money and You go ahead.

613
00:44:34,403 --> 00:44:39,300
Speaker 0: you buy cards from the market and the card it does that same thing that Vinci or small world does where?

614
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,008
Speaker 0: If you want a lot of games do this where.

615
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,189
Speaker 0: if you something is brand new in the market It costs a lot to go that deep right.

616
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,659
Speaker 0: if you want something that's been sitting in the market for a long time something low Demand no one wants it.

617
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,719
Speaker 0: It made its way all the way to the left side of the market without anyone taking it.

618
00:44:54,262 --> 00:44:56,495
Speaker 0: You can take it for free or cheap, right.

619
00:44:56,957 --> 00:45:02,239
Speaker 0: and then You play cards into your tableau and you do what they say on them, right?

620
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:11,360
Speaker 0: What it trouble what that I think my yelling told got somehow activated Siri and Siri somehow played a song.

621
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:14,727
Speaker 1: Now I gotta be real clear.

622
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:21,020
Speaker 1: we are not going to explain how to play this game Because that is way too much for a podcast without visual aids.

623
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:27,200
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about like right what it feels like to play the game and the kinds of things you do.

624
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:34,060
Speaker 1: But all the PAX games they like I said, they all have a similar sensibility even though they're mechanically extremely dissimilar.

625
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:43,962
Speaker 1: But like it's hard to explain and describe until you play multiple of them But your brain will engage with them the same way despite the mechanics being so different Right.

626
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:55,020
Speaker 0: So you buy cards you play them into your tableau and that gives you new abilities Right and you use these abilities and the cards that you play to influence the board and the stuff you put on the board.

627
00:45:55,481 --> 00:46:07,718
Speaker 0: Some of that stuff is just your stuff like cylinders that are like you your tribes from your people Right, but most of the stuff you put on the board is like a British Road, right a Russian army, right?

628
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:11,424
Speaker 0: You know There.

629
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:17,166
Speaker 0: if somebody has the most stuff in a region on the on the map They take the ruler.

630
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:23,369
Speaker 1: token from that being the ruler means you have powers over that area Like you can tax piece.

631
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,040
Speaker 0: oh stuff, right, right.

632
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,520
Speaker 0: So the way you actually there's all this stuff going on your cylinders that you use to be tribes could also be spies.

633
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:32,400
Speaker 0: You put them on other people's tableaus.

634
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,400
Speaker 0: They move around the board doing stuff to interfering with tab.

635
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:41,710
Speaker 1: Yeah The measure of five player magic on them and you have one card that literally just Slides along all the other players cars.

636
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,480
Speaker 1: that eventually does something like assassinates the Siobhan dragon.

637
00:46:45,784 --> 00:46:46,576
Speaker 0: Yeah stuff like that.

638
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:56,480
Speaker 0: But the way the game is scored is that there are these three sets of Basically, like these if you play the physical version of the game.

639
00:46:56,761 --> 00:47:01,500
Speaker 0: They're these really nice kind of like resin like, you know, the components are so good.

640
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:05,320
Speaker 1: I touched an early version of them at a PAX and it was just like whoo, they're super nice.

641
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,420
Speaker 0: They feel almost stony and grainy but not in a bad way.

642
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:11,571
Speaker 0: They're like extra high quality and fancy.

643
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:20,680
Speaker 0: and as three sets There's the Afghan ones which are green the British ones Which are pink yellow or the Russian the Russian ones yellow and the British ones are pink, right?

644
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:24,572
Speaker 0: And it's equal numbers of all three and it starts with none of them on the board.

645
00:47:24,673 --> 00:47:25,094
Speaker 0: None at all.

646
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:30,619
Speaker 0: every player chooses To ally with one of the three factions at the start of the game.

647
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:39,540
Speaker 0: So whichever one you're allied with you're going to be when you build a road or an army You're gonna be taking one of those pieces right and putting it onto the board.

648
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:50,959
Speaker 0: So if it's an if you're Russian if you're allied with Russia You take one of these bricks and you put it Standing up long ways to be an army and you lay it down flat ways to be a road, right?

649
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,281
Speaker 0: Which?

650
00:47:52,562 --> 00:47:55,780
Speaker 0: and then you know other players are putting them on the board, too.

651
00:47:55,941 --> 00:47:58,700
Speaker 0: There might be more than one player with the same Alliance all players.

652
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,609
Speaker 1: We might all just be in with the British and just be colonial pieces.

653
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:05,400
Speaker 0: I'll be Afghans fighting against colonizers, right?

654
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:11,680
Speaker 0: You know regardless these pieces are going on to and off of the board right into three different colors.

655
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,780
Speaker 0: Eventually a card is gonna come out of the deck.

656
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,420
Speaker 0: That's a dominance card if that you know.

657
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 0: And then if that card falls off the market is purchased or if somehow two of them are in the market at the same time You do a dominance check which is basically a scoring ground.

658
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,380
Speaker 0: So the scoring rounds are sort of spaced out randomly, but not entirely randomly.

659
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:35,380
Speaker 1: It feels a little bit like Twilight struggle has a similar mechanic.

660
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:43,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically like yeah, there's gonna be some number of scoring rounds and they're gonna happen not too early in the game.

661
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,579
Speaker 0: They'll happen eventually and then there'll be this many of them spaced out and then the game will end.

662
00:48:49,923 --> 00:48:53,455
Speaker 0: If we get to the final one the game will definitely end but the game could end earlier.

663
00:48:53,616 --> 00:48:57,952
Speaker 0: and what you do during the scoring Rounds is first you say you look at the three.

664
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:00,000
Speaker 0: It's a perfect user interface for a board game.

665
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:10,160
Speaker 0: You look at the three rows of remaining Bricks that are off the board and you say alright Is there anyone who's like really got a lot of bricks on the board, right?

666
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,159
Speaker 0: Is there like a ton of British ones on the board?

667
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,892
Speaker 0: There won't be that many left off the board and they're arranged in three rows.

668
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:22,312
Speaker 0: so you can easily see aha Britain's got way more on the board than everyone else just by looking at it instantly.

669
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:29,660
Speaker 0: and if they have four more on the board Four or more pieces on the board than any other person then that means that they're dominant.

670
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,900
Speaker 0: So if Britain has so many on the board Britain has dominance Afghanistan, right?

671
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:35,586
Speaker 0: Or maybe Russia has dominance.

672
00:49:36,128 --> 00:49:39,340
Speaker 0: and then if someone is dominant then what you do is you say?

673
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,080
Speaker 0: Okay, someone's dominant who is allied with the dominant force?

674
00:49:43,461 --> 00:49:46,171
Speaker 1: So like in the last game two of us were allied with the British.

675
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:55,179
Speaker 0: So the two of us get to have scoring basically yeah, if you're allied with the dot if this someone is dominant and anyone who's allied with it is gonna score some points.

676
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,228
Speaker 0: if Only one person's allied with the dominant faction They're gonna score points by themselves.

677
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:07,839
Speaker 0: and if no one is allied with the dominant faction I guess that wouldn't be possible for them to be dominant then because no one's allied with them.

678
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:10,770
Speaker 0: But I guess it could maybe happen.

679
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:12,920
Speaker 0: I guess no one would score points.

680
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:20,140
Speaker 0: But if no one is dominant So they've all got all the factions sort of have equal ish numbers of things on the board.

681
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:25,858
Speaker 0: Then you just say well who's among you among all players who's got the most like tribes?

682
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:26,540
Speaker 0: and yeah, right?

683
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,483
Speaker 1: Who's the best?

684
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:32,300
Speaker 1: who's the best unless a faction is dominant in which case only the people who are allied with that faction matter?

685
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,600
Speaker 0: Right.

686
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:35,808
Speaker 0: So you're doing all this other stuff in the game.

687
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:39,181
Speaker 0: Like when you actually play on your turn you're doing all this other stuff Right.

688
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes you're putting roads and armies out on the board.

689
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:49,769
Speaker 0: Sometimes you're removing them from the board, but you're like messing with other people's cards buying cards Taxing people to try to get money right.

690
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,739
Speaker 0: you're doing all these other actions right that you know.

691
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,849
Speaker 0: That like don't you know?

692
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:57,120
Speaker 0: trying to become the ruler of a place?

693
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:09,800
Speaker 0: You know all this other stuff marching moving things around trying to give you just paying factions Right, you know paying all this kind of stuff that isn't directly related to like.

694
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:25,448
Speaker 0: it's hard to draw a straight line in your mind between that and the victory condition of Be in the dominant faction make a faction dominant when the dominance card shows up, you know make no one dominant But then be just stronger than everyone else, right?

695
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:27,855
Speaker 0: It's really hard to trust your alliance.

696
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:29,500
Speaker 1: The alliances are spinners.

697
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,486
Speaker 1: You could just be like nope.

698
00:51:30,606 --> 00:51:31,673
Speaker 1: I'm with Britain now.

699
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:32,357
Speaker 1: Fuck y'all.

700
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:35,960
Speaker 0: Yep, you can switch it up very quite easily.

701
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:42,200
Speaker 0: You you have to give things up like if you gave a gift to Britain to gain their favor and then you switch it up.

702
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, your gifts go away obviously because you're now Russian, right?

703
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,781
Speaker 0: They don't care if they get it Like.

704
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:52,120
Speaker 1: the way this works is like some of the cards are people who are patriots of one of the three factions.

705
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:55,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, some cards are patriots and some aren't.

706
00:51:55,907 --> 00:52:01,844
Speaker 0: so if you can only have patriots in your tableau if they're allied with the faction You're allied with.

707
00:52:02,145 --> 00:52:04,393
Speaker 0: so if you change your alliance all your Patriots go away.

708
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,627
Speaker 0: if you play a patriot from a faction That's not in your alliance.

709
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:14,815
Speaker 0: that causes your alliance to change immediately Right, but yeah, that's what the Alliance stuff is really fun like the coalition's.

710
00:52:15,096 --> 00:52:22,618
Speaker 1: I've never seen a game elegantly do what many people have tried to do of Have a sort of coalition forming mechanism.

711
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:28,920
Speaker 0: Well because games where there's usually alliances think like Eclipse or dude, right?

712
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,814
Speaker 0: Where access now is it gets you're forced into one?

713
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:37,529
Speaker 1: Yeah alliance It's not like we start quartermaster.

714
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:43,240
Speaker 0: generally Italy's like no I'm with the Allies Right risk and diplomacy with the informal alliances, right?

715
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:51,834
Speaker 0: But in all those games, you know, the the alliances are sort of like yeah, we're agreeing to work together But in Pax Pam or two, it's like okay.

716
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:53,040
Speaker 0: We're in the same faction.

717
00:52:53,282 --> 00:53:04,260
Speaker 0: We're both trying to put more, you know British bricks on the board as roads or armies because they're both in with the British But we're in no way like trying to help each other.

718
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:08,154
Speaker 0: I'm not trying to help you even though Britain likes.

719
00:53:08,194 --> 00:53:12,732
Speaker 1: we both give gifts to the British But we're really both just trying to shut down those Russians.

720
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:13,997
Speaker 1: and shut down, right?

721
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:23,660
Speaker 0: So You have alliances but in no time Are you actually in an alliance of friendly with another player your different leaders in Afghanistan?

722
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,820
Speaker 0: Who want to form an Afghani state that you are in charge of right?

723
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:34,639
Speaker 0: Not the other guy just because you're both sucking up to Britain at the same time You are in no way friends, right?

724
00:53:36,102 --> 00:53:37,085
Speaker 0: And so that's why it works.

725
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,855
Speaker 0: that's why you can be on the the same team without being.

726
00:53:39,936 --> 00:53:41,785
Speaker 1: and then in terms of actual play It's a lot.

727
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:57,520
Speaker 1: all the packs games are similar in that Every decision you make is a huge decision Like every action in the game is deeply desperately Meaningful and will radically affect the course of the game or at least your own personal chance of victory.

728
00:53:57,962 --> 00:54:02,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do not actually get that many actions during the game to take.

729
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:08,520
Speaker 0: You know and it's there are ways to get some free actions But even then you can't get that many because a lot of times they'll be inconsequential.

730
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:13,039
Speaker 0: So the actions you do take are often enormous, right?

731
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,894
Speaker 0: Especially considering that like yeah, it's like, you know, you put down maybe like two roads.

732
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:21,100
Speaker 0: It's like that's a huge deal two roads.

733
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:24,030
Speaker 1: So as a result the game is a lot of posturing of like.

734
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:29,860
Speaker 1: you could set you there's something that you could do But it would take a couple actions to do it and there's something someone else could do.

735
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:38,580
Speaker 1: They'll take a couple actions to do it But you might start going down that road to get the other person to be prepared to defend against it and then do something else.

736
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:47,378
Speaker 1: like there's that kind of interplay a lot of betrayal a lot of like Anticipating what someone's gonna do and like changing the dominance at the last minute.

737
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:54,520
Speaker 0: Another thing that's very interesting about this game is like I think some other packs games and like many games actually.

738
00:54:54,621 --> 00:55:08,920
Speaker 0: But it has a closed economy so all players start with money the same amount and they use that money to buy cards from the market and that money goes to The market and then if someone takes a card from the market that has money on it, they get that money.

739
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:13,120
Speaker 0: So there's no money entering the game like from the bank.

740
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:16,512
Speaker 0: It's like the money that's in the game from the start of the game is all the money.

741
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:27,320
Speaker 0: when you use the tax action To take money from other players or the market you don't take money from the bank ever Right, the only time money comes out of the bank is with these leverage cards.

742
00:55:27,842 --> 00:55:32,859
Speaker 0: So if you play a leverage card to money will come out of the bank to the person who played the card.

743
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:38,000
Speaker 0: But then if anything happens to that card if it goes away to money goes back.

744
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,940
Speaker 1: So what if I got a bunch of like British leverage cards and then Britain's just sucking it up and I really need a new ally?

745
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,626
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna.

746
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:52,198
Speaker 1: not only I'm gonna lose all these cards But now I'm also gonna lose a bunch of money that I might not have right?

747
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:52,860
Speaker 0: That's true.

748
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,052
Speaker 0: But the most interesting part is the fact the money isn't come.

749
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:58,220
Speaker 0: it's like there's no like taking money from the bank.

750
00:55:58,662 --> 00:56:11,620
Speaker 1: Frequently the leverage cards are not because the game They're gonna play a few readily tight in that It's like some extremely interlocked gears and everybody takes a turn cranking these gears a little bit until the game ends.

751
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:16,660
Speaker 0: Could you imagine playing Monopoly where it's like everything in Monopoly that you know?

752
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:20,494
Speaker 0: You start the game you give everyone $1,100 and then you throw the.

753
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:21,960
Speaker 0: there's no bank at all.

754
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:24,648
Speaker 0: It's like there's no collect from 200 from go.

755
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:28,560
Speaker 0: there's no collect from community chest or chance or free parking.

756
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:37,300
Speaker 0: There's literally no way to get more money Except from another player landing on your house or hotel right or paying you rent from landing on a property.

757
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,788
Speaker 0: There's literally no imagine playing Monopoly like that.

758
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,698
Speaker 0: You cannot get money unless it is money from another player.

759
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:50,780
Speaker 1: that Coupled with the way the factions work make packs pamir unique among the packs games.

760
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:57,840
Speaker 0: So I think if you are I've never played a PAX game you want to get into these because they are a lot of fun.

761
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:10,920
Speaker 0: The the things to note is that a the heuristics of not winning not not playing but the heuristic of winning is Going to be very obtuse because it is one or two steps removed from the direct actions you take in the game.

762
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:22,020
Speaker 0: You have to really do a lot of work and gain experience from playing quite a few times to understand How it is doing this lead to the victory points of the die packs Renaissance.

763
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:27,020
Speaker 1: They don't make sense until you've played the game to kind of see how they go.

764
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:32,560
Speaker 1: But it's like oh, so I'm moving these armies around and executing people and then this banker ends the game.

765
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,360
Speaker 1: But how could I have possibly interacted with that banking system?

766
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:46,990
Speaker 0: yep, but It's easier to see those connections in the very streamlined packs pamir 2.0 as opposed to The other packs games that I've played.

767
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,075
Speaker 0: there are some I haven't played.

768
00:57:48,095 --> 00:57:49,000
Speaker 0: that might be trans humanity.

769
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:53,455
Speaker 1: Look at the hardest in that regard as humanity is absolutely the hardest.

770
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:54,900
Speaker 0: I have no idea what the hell to do in that game.

771
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:59,080
Speaker 1: I watched I walked by you playing it, but I've never played it, right?

772
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:18,646
Speaker 0: But also the game is actually you might be intimidated to not play it at all But much like 18xx it is much especially this again this heavily streamlined Well-polished not just in production value but also rules packs pamir 2.0 to learn to play.

773
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:24,616
Speaker 0: the game is If you can play any other euro e game a small world a fucking carcass own.

774
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:25,138
Speaker 0: if you can play it.

775
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:26,624
Speaker 0: you can play this Game, right?

776
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:29,133
Speaker 0: It's like buy a card play a card.

777
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:31,040
Speaker 0: It's easy easier to play the Magic the Gathering.

778
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,800
Speaker 0: It's like buy card play a card do what your cards say, you know, the cards are very flavorful.

779
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:44,187
Speaker 0: They're all like characters from you know, historical figures from the time and place that are relevant With lots of flavor text on them.

780
00:58:44,207 --> 00:58:48,080
Speaker 0: That's a lot of fun and the cards do things that are relevant to what the cards are.

781
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,760
Speaker 0: You know flavor wise which is fine.

782
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:51,748
Speaker 1: Chris popped into the chat trans.

783
00:58:51,768 --> 00:58:54,660
Speaker 1: humanity is indeed the hardest for directional heuristics.

784
00:58:55,203 --> 00:58:56,650
Speaker 0: There's there is no question.

785
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:58,460
Speaker 0: It is the hardest I could barely even play.

786
00:59:01,423 --> 00:59:04,275
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's you can play this game right.

787
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,560
Speaker 1: nor learning game.

788
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:09,299
Speaker 1: We're two players that never played this before was pretty quick.

789
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:12,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't take that long either.

790
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:20,300
Speaker 0: It can even end quite abruptly because it like I said It can go to to the final dominance check the final scoring round.

791
00:59:20,842 --> 00:59:22,489
Speaker 0: It can end on any scoring round.

792
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:36,547
Speaker 0: if one player if a player in first place Okay uh if there's a. if the gap between the first place player and the second place player is four or more points the game immediately ends and the Player in first place just wins.

793
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:37,190
Speaker 0: that could happen.

794
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,480
Speaker 1: We might have just talked about something like that in a panel.

795
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,950
Speaker 1: That's gonna be live at back soon.

796
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,349
Speaker 0: Oh Maybe yeah talked about game endings.

797
00:59:44,551 --> 00:59:46,259
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but yeah, it's like it.

798
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:55,633
Speaker 0: so in fact, if you are allied, let's say I'm allied with Britain and Britain is dominant in the first dominance check and no one else is allied with Britain.

799
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:57,560
Speaker 0: That would be five points for me.

800
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,933
Speaker 0: I would just win immediately, right?

801
00:59:59,953 --> 01:00:01,120
Speaker 0: That's just an instant win in this.

802
01:00:01,562 --> 01:00:09,040
Speaker 1: So the game is a lot of like slow and thoughtful Reaction to the state of the play of the world and what other players have done.

803
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,373
Speaker 1: But it's very slow.

804
01:00:11,394 --> 01:00:11,979
Speaker 0: game is available.

805
01:00:12,281 --> 01:00:17,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have not kick-started you there should be possible to buy this game afterwards.

806
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:21,440
Speaker 0: I imagine but you'll have to wait a while that even the kick-started people are waiting a while.

807
01:00:21,902 --> 01:00:30,900
Speaker 0: it is worth it to get the physical edition if you plan to play it a lot because It is very fancy and well made and it's not that large won't even take up a lot of space.

808
01:00:32,201 --> 01:00:34,388
Speaker 0: You can play for free on tabletop simulator.

809
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:38,140
Speaker 0: There is a. there is an official tabletop simulator mod for this game.

810
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,822
Speaker 0: We played it.

811
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:44,015
Speaker 0: It's still crappy tabletop simulator, but it's about as good as tabletop simulators

812
01:00:44,376 --> 01:00:59,060
Speaker 1: side, but I will say this Counter-intuitively and this sounds crazy tabletop simulator is actually way better in VR than it is on the desktop for almost any game because It has it's a lot of fiddly interface stuff.

813
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,420
Speaker 1: But in VR, you just pick out the pieces and move them like stuff just works.

814
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,238
Speaker 1: You don't have to know any tabletop simulator stuff.

815
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:17,462
Speaker 0: hmm, so Pax Pam or two terrific game as you would suspect from Terrific, I want to play it again and I want to play it I think After play.

816
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:22,900
Speaker 0: I definitely think it's pretty much this and Pax Renaissance are sort of tied in terms of.

817
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:24,708
Speaker 0: They are like my favorite.

818
01:01:24,868 --> 01:01:38,520
Speaker 1: Pax's are the ones I understand the most the ones I think Lean toward this one more if they both get a lot of play because this one seems like I'm such a tonica is a similar situation for me and that Hans is a very reactive game.

819
01:01:40,403 --> 01:01:42,016
Speaker 1: This is also a very reactive game.

820
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:55,774
Speaker 1: the decisions I'm making are based very solely on what other players are doing and the cards coming up are just sort of like Like they're setting the stage but in Renaissance the cards that are available Dictate the course of the game much more directly.

821
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:56,920
Speaker 1: I found sure.

822
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:05,224
Speaker 0: Yes, I would say that Renaissance I prefer for two player and I prefer the theme of Renaissance I like.

823
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:07,680
Speaker 1: well, you know it is we both know more about.

824
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:17,293
Speaker 0: So Pax Renaissance is he's like we have more heuristics even if I even if I studied both I like the Renaissance more than I love, you know, Afghanistan.

825
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,119
Speaker 0: I'm more interested in it, but Because I'm away.

826
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:32,100
Speaker 0: But In terms of more than two players and in terms of better streamlined more elegant rules I think I would lean towards Pam or two for a first packs.

827
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:42,990
Speaker 1: I think I would agree because I my first game of packs Renaissance was a little bit less definitely a. you won't Understand what you're doing and you'll lose and not understand why.

828
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:46,700
Speaker 1: then we'll play again and that's exactly how it went down.

829
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,806
Speaker 0: I didn't understand why law other.

830
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:51,534
Speaker 0: I don't dislike the other packs games.

831
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:53,800
Speaker 0: I've played like transhumanity or porphyriana.

832
01:02:53,981 --> 01:03:03,658
Speaker 0: I do like them less than these two and they're much more difficult and harder to develop directional heuristics for than Renaissance or Pamir.

Speaker 0: so Stay with redness.

834
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:15,872
