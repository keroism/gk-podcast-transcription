1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,549
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, February 21st, 2013.

2
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:18,344
Speaker 0: I'm Rim, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights tonight on the Geek Nights Book Club.

3
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,653
Speaker 0: It's The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

4
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:23,980
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:36,422
Speaker 0: So for once I'm sitting down to do Geek Nights and I have a plethora of things I could say, an opening bit perhaps, some anecdote from my life.

6
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:37,787
Speaker 1: I got one of those.

7
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,279
Speaker 0: I had the thought I realized, you know what I should do?

8
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,230
Speaker 0: And we've had this thought often on the show.

9
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:48,150
Speaker 0: I should tell one of them and save the rest for some dry time in the future.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,752
Speaker 1: You'll forget it.

11
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:54,153
Speaker 0: And then I was going to instead make my bit about how I forgot about all these things.

12
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:59,940
Speaker 0: And then I actually, in the last few minutes, legit forgot one of the three things I wanted to talk about.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,550
Speaker 0: Like I literally cannot remember it.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,957
Speaker 1: That makes room for mine, which I remembered.

15
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:05,931
Speaker 0: So instead I want to talk about centaur bondage porn.

16
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:09,037
Speaker 1: Okay, let's not talk about that either.

17
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,702
Speaker 0: So I swear this all links together.

18
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:20,402
Speaker 0: So let's back up a bit to February 20th.

19
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,004
Speaker 0: Yesterday.

20
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:23,130
Speaker 1: Why are you backing up with your centaur bondage?

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,031
Speaker 0: So my friend.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,934
Speaker 0: Your friend, the centaur.

23
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:27,597
Speaker 1: That's backing up.

24
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:37,075
Speaker 0: If I knew a centaur, that'd be the chill ones like in a bleach.

25
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:37,476
Speaker 0: That's okay.

26
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,459
Speaker 0: All right.

27
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,502
Speaker 1: Everyone just fast forward.

28
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:43,034
Speaker 0: Heels are our good friend.

29
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,681
Speaker 1: Heels on the centaur.

30
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,288
Speaker 1: I thought they have hooves, not heels.

31
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:48,116
Speaker 0: And the quote is conversation.

32
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:48,839
Speaker 0: I just had at work.

33
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,052
Speaker 0: Is that a horse hanging from the ceiling in your area?

34
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:52,634
Speaker 0: Yes.

35
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:53,176
Speaker 0: Yes it is.

36
00:01:53,196 --> 00:02:00,275
Speaker 0: And he tweets a picture and it's looks like it's a horse suspended from the ceiling in like their office.

37
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,197
Speaker 0: Okay.

38
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,545
Speaker 0: So let's go back like a month.

39
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:11,550
Speaker 0: I was unrelatedly because I had found a, a little mashup of all the, my little pony characters, the centaurs.

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,514
Speaker 0: that was really well drawn.

41
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:17,276
Speaker 0: I thought it was funny because Applejack was carrying a kind of fan shit.

42
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:20,309
Speaker 0: So Applejack's here in like this X, X, X jug and like a NASCAR thing.

43
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,032
Speaker 0: It was just, it was fun.

44
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:26,471
Speaker 1: Triple X porn pony, my little pony centaurs that are backing up with your friend.

45
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:29,059
Speaker 0: I didn't say anything about backing up anyway.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,098
Speaker 0: So I was looking for a, I wanted to find a frumpy centaur.

47
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:42,395
Speaker 1: Like I needed like, the fact that it was centaur, my little ponies wasn't good enough for you.

48
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,521
Speaker 1: They had to be frumpy.

49
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:49,120
Speaker 0: So I had this idea to make a little mashup, like one of those like fantasy reality things.

50
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:56,990
Speaker 0: So I wanted a dog headed girl, badly drawn equivalent of a centaur where spooky goes helping you with these internet searches.

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,417
Speaker 0: And in the course of looking for that, I saw what could only be described spooky ghost as a centaur in bondage.

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,601
Speaker 1: Okay.

53
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:08,556
Speaker 0: So that would, that just got filed away as, yeah, that's the thing that exists.

54
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,248
Speaker 0: Probably should have expected that that exists.

55
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:13,259
Speaker 0: Probably should have expected that for right there.

56
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:13,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,733
Speaker 0: I mean, uh, there's probably porn of, let's see everything.

58
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:22,007
Speaker 0: Let's go with a Chain Chomp and Sonic the Hedgehog.

59
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:22,448
Speaker 0: Okay.

60
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:22,749
Speaker 0: Here we go.

61
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,378
Speaker 0: Oh, you're actually going to Google it.

62
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:24,901
Speaker 1: Why not?

63
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:25,263
Speaker 0: All right.

64
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:26,872
Speaker 0: Chain Chomps and Sonic the Hedgehog.

65
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,220
Speaker 1: I searched for Chain Chomp porn.

66
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,944
Speaker 0: All right.

67
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,977
Speaker 0: Let's go with just Chain Chomp because the Sonic part might be.

68
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:32,679
Speaker 1: Yup.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,081
Speaker 1: Okay.

70
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,582
Speaker 1: So here's actually princess Toadstool getting all porny and there's a Chain Chomp there.

71
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:38,528
Speaker 1: that's looking pretty angry.

72
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,612
Speaker 1: She's sort of holding its chain.

73
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,822
Speaker 1: I guess she's using it in a dominatrix fashion.

74
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,715
Speaker 1: Like it's her dominatrix tool is this Chain Chomp.

75
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:47,337
Speaker 0: All right.

76
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,662
Speaker 0: I'm glad we know that exists.

77
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:52,113
Speaker 1: Oh, here is a womanized Chain Chomp.

78
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,739
Speaker 1: that is all sexy.

79
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:53,820
Speaker 1: Yup.

80
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:54,562
Speaker 1: Rule.

81
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,951
Speaker 1: And in fact it says right here, rule number 34.

82
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,299
Speaker 1: If it exists, there is porn of it and Chain Chomp.

83
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,630
Speaker 0: So yes, should have expected that.

84
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,325
Speaker 0: And in general, point of advice, you look for anything related to centaurs.

85
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,932
Speaker 0: is stuff out there.

86
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:13,252
Speaker 0: So anyway, I didn't find a frumpy enough centaur and I gave up on this gif I wanted to make.

87
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:22,641
Speaker 0: And in the course of that, I saw this like a centaur hanging upside down, like suspension style, like ready to be in porn.

88
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,026
Speaker 1: Ah, rim.

89
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:25,410
Speaker 1: This is a great opening video.

90
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaker 0: So I remember this and then I see this tweet.

91
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:31,610
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I basically tell the tale of that.

92
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,757
Speaker 0: if I found this picture, I can't believe true facts.

93
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,981
Speaker 0: So he responded link please.

94
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:42,513
Speaker 0: I have a conundrum.

95
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,779
Speaker 0: You see, I saw this one.

96
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,589
Speaker 0: I can't, I don't, I can't find it again.

97
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,076
Speaker 0: I don't want to search for it.

98
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,208
Speaker 0: Cause remember I was searching for frumpy centaurs.

99
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,019
Speaker 0: I was not searching for like bondage centaur.

100
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,585
Speaker 0: Do not want to search for that.

101
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:08,990
Speaker 0: So if anyone has a picture of a centaur hanging upside down and what can be described as something like could be described as bondage gear, I need you to send that to our friend heels.

102
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,975
Speaker 1: Why don't you just make one?

103
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,654
Speaker 0: Because it'll be just as good as the drawings of Lamy as we did the other night.

104
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:14,116
Speaker 1: Sure.

105
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:14,598
Speaker 1: All right.

106
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:18,598
Speaker 1: Anyone who is fast forwarding as instructed, now is the time to stop fast forwarding.

107
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,711
Speaker 0: You realize you have to say that really, really slowly or they won't hear you.

108
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:34,500
Speaker 1: If you are fast forwarding as instructed, this is the time to stop and return to the normal playing speed.

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,721
Speaker 1: Right.

110
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,288
Speaker 0: I remembered my other two opening bits.

111
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,882
Speaker 0: One of them is I ate at a restaurant that's really good called Benoit.

112
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,008
Speaker 0: It's French place.

113
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,133
Speaker 1: I know about that place.

114
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:41,374
Speaker 1: Yeah.

115
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:42,299
Speaker 0: I liked that place a lot.

116
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,223
Speaker 0: I went there last night.

117
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:48,231
Speaker 0: So I had a dessert that can only be described as one of those ridiculous things that rich people eat.

118
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,382
Speaker 0: It was bread, like angel food.

119
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:53,450
Speaker 0: It was almost like angel food cake, but like a bread.

120
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,162
Speaker 0: And they brought it to me in this huge silver platter.

121
00:05:56,182 --> 00:06:03,009
Speaker 0: And then they opened the top and just sit in there and then they poured Armagnac over it, which seems to be the bread.

122
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:03,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

123
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,841
Speaker 0: And then they covered it in this like whipped creme fraiche.

124
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:07,623
Speaker 1: So the king's poo.

125
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:14,000
Speaker 0: And I can't say that it was necessarily good, but it was weird.

126
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:20,184
Speaker 1: Well, creme fraiche sort of unadulterated like that is a little, uh, it's got a weird taste to it.

127
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,358
Speaker 0: I think it was creme fraiche whipped with sugar or something.

128
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:22,579
Speaker 1: Yeah.

129
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,806
Speaker 1: But creme fraiche, you know, is basically sour cream, but it has this extra sort of little aftertaste.

130
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:31,346
Speaker 1: It's sort of, you don't want to go straight with it, but if you cook it into something, it disappears.

131
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,576
Speaker 0: But sour cream, like I'll just eat a whole spoonful of that.

132
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

133
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:36,367
Speaker 1: Sour cream is the best.

134
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:38,637
Speaker 0: The third thing I've been updating my tumbler.

135
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,768
Speaker 0: I think I've updated my tumbler in last week.

136
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:45,688
Speaker 0: More times than I've updated any blog I've ever had a moment now because it's not geek nights.

137
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,299
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is like the stuff that doesn't make the geek nights cut.

138
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:48,822
Speaker 1: Okay.

139
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:57,933
Speaker 1: So my opening bit is, uh, you know, we did an episode a long time on battle lore, which, you know, rim hated a lot more than I hated.

140
00:06:57,993 --> 00:06:58,796
Speaker 0: terrible game.

141
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:02,507
Speaker 1: Uh, but of course it's a two player war game.

142
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,706
Speaker 1: That's not so complex, but then again, not completely simple.

143
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:13,904
Speaker 1: It's, you know, sort of a middle of the road war game and I paid a lot of money for it and it was hot for a few minutes and they made a bunch of expansions and it disappeared.

144
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:19,413
Speaker 1: And the only game in that series that seems to still be around is memoir 44, which is basically the same game with a different theme.

145
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,712
Speaker 0: Uh, however, having read the rules to both, I think memoir 44 would be fun.

146
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,079
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about getting a copy of it.

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,983
Speaker 1: It's the same game.

148
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,672
Speaker 0: Not quite what's different.

149
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:30,284
Speaker 0: The core mechanic is not the problem with battle lore.

150
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:35,050
Speaker 0: The problem with battle lore is that the magic system and all that stuff they put on top of that magic system.

151
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:35,633
Speaker 0: we did.

152
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:36,256
Speaker 0: We didn't.

153
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:36,657
Speaker 0: Yeah.

154
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,290
Speaker 0: We played the base game and the scenarios were so simple.

155
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,912
Speaker 0: It was pointless.

156
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:45,809
Speaker 0: We did play two games of it with the magic and it was just stupid.

157
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:47,476
Speaker 1: I don't remember playing with the magic.

158
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:52,276
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the game got was not played even if I wanted to play it and it takes it.

159
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:56,756
Speaker 1: Even if I did want to play it, the setup takes a long time so it wasn't really worth it.

160
00:07:57,118 --> 00:07:58,384
Speaker 1: Uh, so I tried to sell it.

161
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:08,084
Speaker 1: Finally I got off my ass and tried to sell it and someone in New Zealand wanted it and I was like, but then they said they, I was like, are you sure the shipping's going to be like a fortune?

162
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:08,990
Speaker 1: And they said, okay.

163
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,597
Speaker 1: And they PayPal'd me a fortune.

164
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,203
Speaker 1: So I said, okay.

165
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:17,985
Speaker 1: And I went to the post office to mail it and I expected to go to the post office and have this be a pain in the ass.

166
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,478
Speaker 1: And of course it was a pain in the ass.

167
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,269
Speaker 0: Ah, you set that up like, and it wasn't.

168
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:25,273
Speaker 0: And everything was awesome.

169
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:28,667
Speaker 1: It was, I went there, I needed a box to put this in.

170
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,611
Speaker 0: You didn't already have a box.

171
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,121
Speaker 1: They didn't have a box of appropriate size.

172
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,008
Speaker 0: Wait, here's your problem.

173
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:37,724
Speaker 0: You went to the post office expecting them to have the box for you.

174
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:38,990
Speaker 0: You should have, you go to.

175
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,135
Speaker 1: the box is there.

176
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:40,578
Speaker 0: Yes.

177
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:45,102
Speaker 0: God, you go to the post office with just like a fucking letter and you're like, Hey, can I get an envelope for this shit?

178
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:45,987
Speaker 1: They have envelopes.

179
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:46,932
Speaker 0: You don't do that.

180
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:49,683
Speaker 0: You, you package up ahead of time and you show up anyway.

181
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,470
Speaker 1: So they had boxes.

182
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,501
Speaker 0: You're the reason there's lines at the post office.

183
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,769
Speaker 1: They were not out there.

184
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:55,875
Speaker 1: They were out behind.

185
00:08:55,915 --> 00:09:00,118
Speaker 1: They, I had to wait like, and this other guy was also, he was trying to mail camera equipment to Brazil.

186
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,827
Speaker 1: He bought like a Canon EOS.

187
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,314
Speaker 1: He was trying to send to his friend in Brazil.

188
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,485
Speaker 1: We had to wait for them to go and find boxes.

189
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,208
Speaker 1: It took like 15 minutes.

190
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,956
Speaker 0: Bring your own goddamn box.

191
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:08,116
Speaker 1: Okay.

192
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:08,920
Speaker 1: Where's he going to get one?

193
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:14,080
Speaker 0: The box store, which is UPS stores have box.

194
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,063
Speaker 1: I go to UPS.

195
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:17,130
Speaker 1: They're going to want me to mail my shit from UPS.

196
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,293
Speaker 0: You can just buy boxes.

197
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,659
Speaker 0: There's staples has boxes.

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,402
Speaker 0: Office Depot.

199
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:23,255
Speaker 1: Anyways, there's one next to my office.

200
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:24,823
Speaker 1: That's far away from my office.

201
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,311
Speaker 0: There's probably one near your office too.

202
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,574
Speaker 1: There's one here in Queens.

203
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:30,001
Speaker 1: Anyway, then right.

204
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,265
Speaker 1: I had to fill out these forms.

205
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,581
Speaker 1: No pens, no pens to fill out the customs form anywhere.

206
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,385
Speaker 1: Not one pen.

207
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:40,529
Speaker 1: I felt like doing that thing where you go to the bank and grab a fistful of pens and bring it in the post office.

208
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,011
Speaker 0: So you know what?

209
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,482
Speaker 0: The chase mag near me doesn't have any accessible pens for people.

210
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:44,345
Speaker 0: Any.

211
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,445
Speaker 1: then they make you buy some tape because they don't just give you tape.

212
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,518
Speaker 0: And then I got to have four friends to play the D the DS game.

213
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,040
Speaker 1: Exactly.

214
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,830
Speaker 1: And then had to wait in this incredible line.

215
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:55,814
Speaker 1: That was ridiculous.

216
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:56,737
Speaker 0: You know what?

217
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:57,360
Speaker 0: You know what?

218
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:00,572
Speaker 0: If you already have it boxed, there's machines.

219
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,398
Speaker 1: No, the machine was out of order.

220
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:07,396
Speaker 0: If that machine's out of order, whatever I'm attempting to mail doesn't get mailed.

221
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,183
Speaker 1: And I was mailing internationally.

222
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:18,744
Speaker 1: And when I finally got up to the counter, the person really had a hard time figuring out what to type into the computer to make this thing send and such.

223
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,014
Speaker 1: And I was like, this is all you do all day.

224
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:26,377
Speaker 1: It's like there's 20, there's 10 people here now who are sending international things and you don't know what to do.

225
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:27,420
Speaker 0: Not your first day here.

226
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,892
Speaker 1: One employee of post office.

227
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:39,884
Speaker 0: that at a post office, the only people who are in that line are people who are there doing something complicated or need help dressing themselves.

228
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,248
Speaker 0: One of the two.

229
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:44,941
Speaker 0: There is no person in that line with an easy trends.

230
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,254
Speaker 1: I was just sending a standard international package.

231
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:48,636
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:49,500
Speaker 0: That's already crazy.

233
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,485
Speaker 1: Which costs how much?

234
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,535
Speaker 1: Guess how much it costs to send the package to.

235
00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:57,053
Speaker 0: So is it just battle or were they expansions or with the Epic board in a box?

236
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,104
Speaker 1: I didn't even put peanuts and shit in there.

237
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:01,014
Speaker 1: I was just like, I'm assuming you said customs.

238
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:01,516
Speaker 0: It's a gift.

239
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,260
Speaker 1: Yup.

240
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,849
Speaker 0: Did you, you're not going to pay a duty though.

241
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:05,577
Speaker 0: You're going to pass that through to who you're sending it to.

242
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,654
Speaker 1: I didn't, I, they stay accepted it and they're mailing it.

243
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:09,781
Speaker 1: I don't give a fuck what happens.

244
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:10,104
Speaker 1: Okay.

245
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,090
Speaker 0: But you said gift, right?

246
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,310
Speaker 0: Yup.

247
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:11,812
Speaker 0: All right.

248
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,237
Speaker 0: I'm going to say $74.

249
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,244
Speaker 1: You're pretty close.

250
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:20,748
Speaker 0: It was like, remember when we had for sale, I shipped them and I learned a lot about how to ship shit.

251
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:21,833
Speaker 1: It was like 70 something.

252
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,098
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,564
Speaker 1: Cause a lot of money.

254
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:25,166
Speaker 0: I know what's up.

255
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:27,113
Speaker 0: I FedEx shit around the world all the time for work.

256
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,639
Speaker 1: FedEx is way more than post office.

257
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

258
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:34,171
Speaker 0: But you get a lot of things.

259
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:45,863
Speaker 1: The price is actually all even out in the end, but yeah, there are international flat rate boxes, but, and battle or meets the weight requirement, but they don't have a flat rate international box that battle oral fit in.

260
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:46,224
Speaker 0: Yeah.

261
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:56,329
Speaker 0: The point of the flat rate box is that you can only fit so much into it, but if the board gate, I could probably fit fucking Puerto Rico and one of those motherfuckers fit just a bunch of polonium in there.

262
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,912
Speaker 0: Just fill it up.

263
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,162
Speaker 1: Well, that would exceed the weight limit.

264
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,950
Speaker 1: There's a weight limit and a size limit.

265
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,643
Speaker 1: The size limit is the box and the weight limit is a number.

266
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:09,809
Speaker 1: They actually did have a scale there that was surprisingly easy to figure out, to calculate the price.

267
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,135
Speaker 0: Scales are not generally complicated.

268
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:19,258
Speaker 0: You need no, but the two buttons, maybe tar and calibrate they all the scale.

269
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,375
Speaker 1: Also you could type things in and it would tell you how much money it costs to send to different places.

270
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:28,618
Speaker 1: So, and that was pretty, it wasn't exactly accurate, but it was pretty accurate.

271
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:29,322
Speaker 1: You could choose it.

272
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:36,681
Speaker 1: They had a little piece of paper that told you all the country codes in case you didn't know, and you type it in and you choose the kind of postage you want and then it tells you the number.

273
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:41,061
Speaker 0: You know, this is an aside when it comes, you know, there's country codes for phone numbers too, right?

274
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:41,844
Speaker 0: Yep.

275
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:47,383
Speaker 0: In my experience, people in the entire rest of the world know that country codes exist.

276
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:51,540
Speaker 0: Most people in the U S have no idea that country code is one.

277
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,150
Speaker 0: No, they don't realize that's a country code.

278
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,278
Speaker 1: They think Alexander Graham Bell's an American.

279
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,966
Speaker 1: Therefore America is number one.

280
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:08,120
Speaker 0: They think either that the one is just something you type when you dial long distance, because they don't realize long distance isn't a thing anymore.

281
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:08,542
Speaker 1: Nope.

282
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:09,949
Speaker 0: Or, but that's it.

283
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,815
Speaker 0: They have no idea why that one is there.

284
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:21,184
Speaker 1: It's phone numbers are, uh, they're the way DNS is supposed to be calm dot country dot kind of lore low area.

285
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,508
Speaker 0: Well, you saw that XKCD.

286
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:25,658
Speaker 0: nowadays it's country dot where you lived in the year 2000.

287
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:26,500
Speaker 0: Exactly.

288
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:32,781
Speaker 1: But it's, you know, it's, it's DNS calm dot whatever, you know, well.com dot, right?

289
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:33,623
Speaker 0: Yeah.

290
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:39,182
Speaker 1: It goes from, but the thing is addresses go from most specific to least specific.

291
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:44,101
Speaker 1: We should Scott Rubin, no, no, no, no, no USA as opposed to USA.

292
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:44,423
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

293
00:13:44,503 --> 00:13:44,925
Speaker 1: It's got Ruben.

294
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:45,728
Speaker 1: You know what I'm going to say?

295
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:46,271
Speaker 0: You know what?

296
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:49,826
Speaker 0: My phone number is really rim at front row crew.com.

297
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,536
Speaker 1: Cause if you're going to call me, what the fuck?

298
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,009
Speaker 0: I mean, seriously, what are you going to send me a fax?

299
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,611
Speaker 0: What year?

300
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,536
Speaker 1: What year is it?

301
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,164
Speaker 0: Are you going to send the pony express?

302
00:13:59,224 --> 00:13:59,787
Speaker 0: Or I guess the center.

303
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:06,798
Speaker 1: If I go to an old school fax machine and I faxed to your Google voice number, will it show up as a PDF or something in your Google voice?

304
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,159
Speaker 1: Fuck.

305
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,648
Speaker 0: If I know what the fuck is a fax.

306
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:10,611
Speaker 1: Try it.

307
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,616
Speaker 0: The last time I faxed something was in 2006.

308
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:14,979
Speaker 0: I faxed one thing.

309
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:23,458
Speaker 0: Sometimes I will use a fax to purchase order.

310
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:28,713
Speaker 1: in like 2008, a few years ago, I basically used, I didn't actually send a fax.

311
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:37,815
Speaker 1: I use sort of a fake fax work around as a way to scan from a scan from a fax machine.

312
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:47,422
Speaker 1: Well, from a copier, which then sent an email to a fax number, which then went through a fax system and ended up in my work email box as a PDF.

313
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:55,165
Speaker 1: So it's sort of a scan from a copy machine and it turned into a PDF in my outlook.

314
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,151
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's all I got.

315
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:57,912
Speaker 0: All right.

316
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:08,368
Speaker 0: So at any rate, it's time for things of the day.

317
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,444
Speaker 0: I've been looking around the internet looking for the best anime music videos.

318
00:15:12,464 --> 00:15:14,396
Speaker 0: If you're not an anime fan, you don't care about that stuff.

319
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:20,027
Speaker 1: And you're pretty much just picking the ones that we already knew from back in the day and you're reliving the nostalgia.

320
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,818
Speaker 1: You haven't seen any good ones since we left college.

321
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:29,482
Speaker 0: Actually, I've added a good portion of ones that I've seen in the last week that are relatively new.

322
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,626
Speaker 1: Since you started looking.

323
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:31,589
Speaker 0: Yeah.

324
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:32,432
Speaker 0: Since I started looking.

325
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,246
Speaker 1: So you got a few, you got a big gap between say '05 and '12.

326
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:40,507
Speaker 0: Actually, one of the ones that I found that was good was a contest winner from like '08.

327
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:44,724
Speaker 0: But anyway, I do this in this episode because guys, it's Geek Nights.

328
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:50,330
Speaker 0: The whole point is to get the anime geeks into the video games, the video game geeks into the neckbeards and cross pollinate.

329
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,963
Speaker 0: This anime music video is to a show called Panty and Stocking.

330
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,850
Speaker 0: Just watched the video.

331
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,379
Speaker 0: Imagine a dirty adult Powerpuff Girls.

332
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:03,579
Speaker 0: and this video just makes the show look probably more awesome than it is, but the video is awesome.

333
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,490
Speaker 1: It's more of a dirty adult Powerpuff Girls.

334
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,655
Speaker 1: Gatekeepers, really.

335
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:10,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I didn't think anyone listening to this show would know what Gatekeepers is.

336
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:11,535
Speaker 1: No one probably does.

337
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,301
Speaker 0: Dude, anime fans don't know that show.

338
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,148
Speaker 0: Get open!

339
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,758
Speaker 0: That was the biggest show for like a month and a half.

340
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,087
Speaker 1: It was a big show for three weeks because it was the first DigiSub that you could just download from that one website.

341
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,874
Speaker 1: Anime Keep or Anime Factory?

342
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:27,758
Speaker 1: AnimeFactory.net.

343
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:32,135
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the first big DigiSub before that was the Escaflowne movie.

344
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,869
Speaker 1: Those are pretty much the first two digital fansubs that were like...

345
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,619
Speaker 0: Scott and I almost got kicked out of the RIT Anime Club because we told people they could go download the Escaflowne movie.

346
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,444
Speaker 1: I don't remember that.

347
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:42,168
Speaker 0: You don't remember that?

348
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:42,228
Speaker 0: No.

349
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,536
Speaker 0: That's Scott Johnson about that.

350
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,694
Speaker 0: They saw we had that DVD and they talked about kicking all of us out of the club.

351
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:47,800
Speaker 1: Okay.

352
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,885
Speaker 1: They had an e-board meeting about it.

353
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:49,769
Speaker 1: Okay.

354
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:52,017
Speaker 0: That was with Tape Nazi.

355
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,923
Speaker 0: I didn't want to say his full name on the show, but I almost did.

356
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,493
Speaker 0: The first Tape Nazi.

357
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:57,801
Speaker 0: The original Tape Nazi.

358
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,152
Speaker 1: I don't know how it's any different from the fansubs they had already.

359
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:04,104
Speaker 0: Because it was digital and that's how anime types are.

360
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,127
Speaker 0: Anyway.

361
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,435
Speaker 1: Anyway, so check this out.

362
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:17,670
Speaker 1: There are a lot of things in the world that people think are impossible, but if you go to Zombocom, we know that the impossible becomes possible at Zombocom.

363
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,334
Speaker 0: Before we go any further, as soon as you watch this, you're going to try to make noises with your throat.

364
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:25,108
Speaker 0: You're going to be sitting there after you watch that scene today.

365
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:27,180
Speaker 1: Don't hurt yourself unless you go to Zombocom first.

366
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

367
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,266
Speaker 0: I already hurt myself.

368
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,872
Speaker 0: We didn't go to Zombocom first.

369
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,437
Speaker 1: It was a big mistake not visiting Zombocom.

370
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:32,918
Speaker 1: I didn't clip.

371
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:38,831
Speaker 0: The limiter kicked in.

372
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,173
Speaker 0: Anyway.

373
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:43,829
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this girl, her YouTube account is Disney Diva Seven.

374
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:44,973
Speaker 1: I guess she's an opera singer.

375
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,056
Speaker 0: She's the seventh one.

376
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:46,557
Speaker 1: Sure.

377
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:56,686
Speaker 1: She made this YouTube video of her singing the opera song from the fifth element, which is supposedly impossible.

378
00:17:56,767 --> 00:18:00,581
Speaker 1: I mean, the original was sung by some opera person.

379
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:03,532
Speaker 1: You can look it up on the internet with what I assume is a vocoder.

380
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:08,547
Speaker 1: Oh, the original singer's voice is sung by Albanian soprano Inva Mula.

381
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,410
Speaker 1: Right.

382
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:14,766
Speaker 1: But Laura in this YouTube video sings it without any digital enhancements.

383
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:19,604
Speaker 0: I've not tried to verify how 100% that is, but it looks legit to me.

384
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:20,388
Speaker 1: It's pretty legit.

385
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:23,863
Speaker 1: And you can hear her singing over the originals playing like on the track.

386
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:31,554
Speaker 0: She didn't get like, she didn't get a karaoke track to be able to hit those notes and know you're hitting them because it's crazy.

387
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:35,411
Speaker 0: Wait, there's a whole bunch of videos of people trying to sing it that are linked.

388
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:40,311
Speaker 1: Well, only this one, which is actually successful because of Zombocom is the thing of the day.

389
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,441
Speaker 1: The other ones watch at your own risk.

390
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:47,303
Speaker 0: After this episode, I'm going to watch this one called me trying to sing the diva dance from the fifth element.

391
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,849
Speaker 0: And it's uploaded by some dude.

392
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,476
Speaker 0: And it's the picture of a dude trying to sing.

393
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,348
Speaker 0: He's got the same pop filter that I have.

394
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:59,790
Speaker 1: I wonder if anyone does it like pretending to shoot themselves at the end, pretending to get shot at the end.

395
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:02,153
Speaker 0: All right.

396
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:02,314
Speaker 0: Okay.

397
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,838
Speaker 0: I'm done making stupid noises.

398
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,690
Speaker 1: So the great Gatsby, I hope you guys met a moment.

399
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,694
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to do a meta moment?

400
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,941
Speaker 1: Well, we got to do a meta moment.

401
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:20,439
Speaker 0: Well, maybe because we're going to be at PAX doing practical game theory, doing, uh, mastering game mechanics, doing possibly a third event and also enforcing.

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,866
Speaker 0: So we're going to be all over the fuck place.

403
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:24,215
Speaker 0: This is PAX East, by the way, 2013.

404
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:26,121
Speaker 1: It's actually in a few fucking weeks.

405
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,145
Speaker 0: Yeah.

406
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:27,466
Speaker 0: Yeah.

407
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:28,590
Speaker 0: We got to finish those panels.

408
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:29,592
Speaker 1: Yeah.

409
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:30,555
Speaker 1: I'll get to mine this weekend.

410
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,344
Speaker 1: Um, other meta moments.

411
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:43,198
Speaker 1: If you did not listen to the last episode, we, I am holding personally, this event that I came up with and decided not to shit talk, it's going to be pretty easy for me, but probably hard for you.

412
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:50,580
Speaker 1: The front row crew official geek nights game grand Prix 2013.

413
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,523
Speaker 1: Here's how it works.

414
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:57,720
Speaker 1: We are going to compete and Sue see who is the best gamer amongst the listeners and forum people.

415
00:19:58,362 --> 00:20:04,201
Speaker 1: If you want to sign up, all you have to do is join the forum or sign into the forum, go to the thread.

416
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,164
Speaker 1: It's the top thread.

417
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:10,484
Speaker 1: post a comment before March 1st that says you're in, I will add your name to the Google doc.

418
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,572
Speaker 1: We have almost 40 people on this thing.

419
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:13,916
Speaker 1: It is going to be fierce.

420
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,547
Speaker 1: Uh, we are using an F1 scoring system.

421
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:23,987
Speaker 1: The top 10 positions in any particular round or Grand Prix, uh, will score championship points.

422
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,196
Speaker 1: Uh, whoever has the most points.

423
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:29,050
Speaker 1: after however, number of rounds I'm thinking four or five.

424
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:35,126
Speaker 0: now guys, things like this champion, even super aguri is awesome in F1.

425
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:43,474
Speaker 0: So even if you suck at games, if you want to try for this, the right around for so long, I know I've watched F1 since super aguri was around.

426
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,177
Speaker 0: It's the longest.

427
00:20:44,318 --> 00:20:53,175
Speaker 0: I know if you get even one championship point in this thing, you'll have a lot of bragging rights over everyone who didn't participate and the majority of people in this thing.

428
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:53,476
Speaker 1: Right.

429
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:57,514
Speaker 1: So, and don't worry about, I mean, every round is going to be skill games.

430
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:01,448
Speaker 1: I'm never going to pick a rent, you know, a luck game or coin flip game.

431
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:01,549
Speaker 1: Yeah.

432
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,832
Speaker 1: I never, and if there is some luck in the game, which there could be, there will be luck mitigation rules.

433
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,357
Speaker 1: The rules for each round.

434
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:16,881
Speaker 1: I will be determined by me, judged by me, proved by me, everything master and may the odds be ever in your favor.

435
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,870
Speaker 1: You can, you're going to need to do this.

436
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:25,868
Speaker 1: probably a computer, uh, probably some sort of camera or other evidence gatherers.

437
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,764
Speaker 1: So you can prove to the best of your abilities that your score is legit.

438
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:32,277
Speaker 1: And then we might have some sort of challenge system.

439
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:35,293
Speaker 1: If someone thinks you cheated, which I don't think will be really foresee this.

440
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:41,896
Speaker 0: The first task is like some Mario three thing and you get 40 identical stolen from YouTube machine assisted plays.

441
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:42,277
Speaker 1: Yeah.

442
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,561
Speaker 1: I think we'll be able to tell.

443
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:57,297
Speaker 1: Um, and yeah, you just, you know, if you don't want to participate in a round or can't, you just don't and you get a zero, which you're probably going to get even if you do participate because even with the current number of entrance, 75% of people are going to get zeros.

444
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,320
Speaker 1: Um, and oh, I'm going to try to make every round will be as accessible as possible.

445
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:15,146
Speaker 0: I'm not going to do things which will, like, for example, if one of them is a feat of, you know, physical, like a running thing or something crazy out in the real world, it wouldn't be because some people don't have fucking legs.

446
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:19,286
Speaker 0: I was about to say, but that, but are you going to go, how much are you going to include?

447
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,070
Speaker 0: What if someone's blind?

448
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:24,372
Speaker 1: Uh, well, I mean, if they're playing video games and reading the forum, they have something, right?

449
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:24,934
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.

450
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:31,825
Speaker 0: So by not having legs, you're just counting a huge swath of games, many of which are actually eminently accessible to a lot of people.

451
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,187
Speaker 1: Yeah.

452
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:40,228
Speaker 1: But for example, DDR would require people to buy equipment, which they may not have a, you know, I wouldn't pick like a PlayStation three exclusive cause not everyone has a PlayStation three.

453
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:44,568
Speaker 1: I wouldn't pick a game that requires a bad ass PC cause most people don't have a bad ass PC.

454
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:47,397
Speaker 0: But you could, for example, do a hundred meter dash.

455
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:49,704
Speaker 1: Uh, we could.

456
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,309
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that should be one.

457
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,699
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it could be some sort of physical thing.

458
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,269
Speaker 0: Like how many fucking pushups can you do?

459
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,373
Speaker 1: You're not doing that.

460
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:01,489
Speaker 1: Um, it's, it's definitely going to be bored and video game related.

461
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,244
Speaker 1: It is not going to be, you know, though there may be dexterity games.

462
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:05,646
Speaker 1: Who knows?

463
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:06,389
Speaker 1: We'll see.

464
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:08,976
Speaker 1: But yeah, sign up and we'll.

465
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:11,385
Speaker 1: March 1st is when I will announce around one.

466
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,733
Speaker 1: I've already planned four rounds.

467
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:18,633
Speaker 0: Also, Connecticut panels submissions are not only open, but we are currently scheduling.

468
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:27,554
Speaker 0: So if you want to do something at Connecticut, submit sooner rather than later, good spots are disappearing in our private schedule that we're going to start sharing relatively soon.

469
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:27,917
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

470
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:28,923
Speaker 1: I should do something about that.

471
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:29,083
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:29,305
Speaker 0: Yeah.

473
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:33,826
Speaker 0: You still need to send me your, the info so I can make your fucking account for the backend.

474
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:34,911
Speaker 1: What's different than you?

475
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:35,995
Speaker 1: What info do you need to know?

476
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,585
Speaker 0: Uh, I sent you an email asking for some stuff.

477
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:39,548
Speaker 1: Okay.

478
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,070
Speaker 1: I didn't do it.

479
00:23:40,111 --> 00:23:41,457
Speaker 1: What do you not know about me?

480
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:45,936
Speaker 0: I need you to make an account on the regular Connecticut website and send me the username you used.

481
00:23:46,277 --> 00:23:49,087
Speaker 0: Uh, you couldn't, you couldn't manage that.

482
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:54,663
Speaker 0: You couldn't Connecticut websites really bad before you say yes, it is.

483
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:58,836
Speaker 0: There is, depending on whether or talking absolutely or relative.

484
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,639
Speaker 0: Yes.

485
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:06,339
Speaker 0: Regardless, we're here tonight, 25 minutes into the episode to talk about the great Gatsby.

486
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,021
Speaker 1: All right.

487
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,532
Speaker 0: The best thing about this book.

488
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:11,938
Speaker 0: This is the book club one.

489
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,665
Speaker 0: We're not going to summarize the plot.

490
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,413
Speaker 0: We assume you've already read it.

491
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,025
Speaker 0: We're just talking about it as though we're a bunch of friends.

492
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:19,290
Speaker 0: We've all read it.

493
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:26,379
Speaker 0: Way to repeat this every time because people don't seem to get it, especially you who insist on summarizing the entire plot of the, of the book.

494
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,463
Speaker 1: Only to piss you off.

495
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,839
Speaker 0: The best part about this book is that cover from the first edition.

496
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,907
Speaker 0: That art is one of that art.

497
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:39,404
Speaker 0: is that art is so famous that that art is such a famous and iconic.

498
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:42,536
Speaker 1: I even see that if you go to a Barnes and Noble, they got that shit on the wall.

499
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:45,229
Speaker 0: I kind of want to get a nice poster of this and stick it out.

500
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,877
Speaker 1: It's trivial to do because it's so famous.

501
00:24:46,937 --> 00:24:48,544
Speaker 0: I know it's just it.

502
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,594
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's not just this great art.

503
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:55,956
Speaker 0: It actually really well encapsulates kind of the feel of the book and the feel of the era.

504
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,283
Speaker 0: The book was written in and about.

505
00:24:59,086 --> 00:24:59,266
Speaker 1: Yes.

506
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:06,535
Speaker 1: You know, before reading this, I had no idea what it was about other than there was clearly a character named Gatsby who was either great or sarcastically great.

507
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:15,810
Speaker 1: So I had a, and I didn't know that it was about the twenties written in the twenties and they start going in long Island and I'm like, Whoa, I really, I love this.

508
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,333
Speaker 1: I don't know.

509
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:20,493
Speaker 1: You know, I wasn't alive in the twenties, but I totally under, you know, New York hasn't changed.

510
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:23,385
Speaker 0: There are things about the thing about this book that haven't changed.

511
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:33,010
Speaker 0: Like there's the scene with when they're driving the cars really fast, like right before the shit goes down in the end and they're going from long Island, like, Oh, let's go to Manhattan.

512
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:38,897
Speaker 0: You know, as they're driving into the city and they like drive through Astoria and then they stop their cars to talk to each other.

513
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,118
Speaker 0: Right.

514
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:48,533
Speaker 1: You know where the mechanic is with the sign, the glasses, that's all the mechanic shops out behind Shea state wall, city field, you know, in the Rover there.

515
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,399
Speaker 1: I know exactly where that is.

516
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:57,609
Speaker 0: It was startling almost to read a book like this, not really knowing what to expect because I didn't know a lot about the book 90 years ago.

517
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:05,218
Speaker 0: The geography was pretty similar, but not just the geography, but the culture of like commuters and what different neighborhoods are like.

518
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:12,129
Speaker 0: in some senses, though, in other senses, they changed a lot, but like going to grand central, the scenes written about going to the hotel.

519
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:12,892
Speaker 1: It's still there.

520
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:21,491
Speaker 0: Not only is that hope that hotel is still there, but past the hotel all the time in the summer, that scene could happen today and it would be the exact same scene except everyone has a cell phone.

521
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:22,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

522
00:26:23,097 --> 00:26:23,358
Speaker 0: Yeah.

523
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,328
Speaker 1: So, but they were using regular telephones all the time.

524
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,973
Speaker 0: They were, but at the same time, I think.

525
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:35,539
Speaker 0: as a result, I think this book resonated with me a lot more having read it now than it would have had.

526
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,267
Speaker 0: I read it as a kid because I was a Michigander.

527
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:42,424
Speaker 0: I'd never been to New York city, let alone New York state until I was like 16 or 17.

528
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:42,705
Speaker 0: Yup.

529
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:50,290
Speaker 0: So I had never like, I had no idea other than from watching Seinfeld, what New York was like being in New York person.

530
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,852
Speaker 1: Really?

531
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:53,923
Speaker 1: This book was like, whoa, I know exactly what's going on here.

532
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:56,573
Speaker 0: And people here are still kind of like that.

533
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,984
Speaker 0: Like this book is pretty relevant.

534
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:01,649
Speaker 0: People are kind of like that.

535
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:12,302
Speaker 0: I, what bothers me about this episode is that this is whether or not you like the characters, whether or not you're not supposed to like any of them.

536
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:12,969
Speaker 1: None of them are likable.

537
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,056
Speaker 0: I kind of like Gatsby.

538
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,085
Speaker 1: I kind of like the main guy a little bit.

539
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,782
Speaker 1: I like the main guy because aspects of the main guy, but not other aspects.

540
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:22,630
Speaker 0: Uh, what aspect of the main guy don't you like?

541
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,710
Speaker 0: Because what I, what I, when I see about him, why I liked him is that he was in a way kind of like.

542
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:33,218
Speaker 0: he's like the, like he moves here and he's like working like in a, like in financial, he's basically doing the kind of work that I would do.

543
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:33,761
Speaker 1: I liked that.

544
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:34,546
Speaker 1: he was a re.

545
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:38,362
Speaker 1: he's reasonable, you know, not crazy, not stupid person.

546
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:48,038
Speaker 1: He's from a rich family, but he's trying to like, just go on his own and he has the admirable, you know, his main thing is his admirable ability to, you know, forgive and put up with people.

547
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:53,979
Speaker 1: But what I don't like about him is it's like, all right dude, you have basically no balls.

548
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,430
Speaker 1: You're just sort of like, so in the same time where he's putting up with people, he also just takes all shit from people and just isn't see,

549
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,055
Speaker 0: but that was already

550
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,460
Speaker 1: shit because he makes

551
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:20,036
Speaker 0: a point pretty early on in the book where he starts talking about that crazy party you went to, you know, the first one where all this other stuff is going on in his life and that the, the events of this book are a tiny percentage of what's actually going on and how

552
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,749
Speaker 1: most of his day is spent doing his bond selling and going to

553
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,777
Speaker 0: dinner, cooking, they just go, whatever.

554
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,593
Speaker 0: But he makes the point that this book is just about that crazy bullshit.

555
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:35,062
Speaker 0: So it's, I wouldn't really say he doesn't have balls and these people are putting upon him so much as more than he's living his normal life.

556
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:49,085
Speaker 0: It's like if we're living our normal lives and then once every week or so we end up at a party with just crazy people with crazy drama and he's kind of just watching it like, wow, wow.

557
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,652
Speaker 1: So it's just a story of his once a week crazy parties.

558
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:55,002
Speaker 1: Also, he didn't handle a hot tennis girl very well.

559
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,428
Speaker 0: I like her a lot.

560
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:04,416
Speaker 0: I also, yeah, she's pretty cool because she is, she knows she's cool in the literal, not the literal sense, but in the sense of cool.

561
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:08,930
Speaker 0: She is calculated, sophisticated, calm, nonplussed about everything.

562
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,084
Speaker 1: She's cool and probably way hot that that word is not.

563
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:13,269
Speaker 1: tennis girls are way higher.

564
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:20,273
Speaker 0: Well, she's described as being incredibly attractive and the way she dresses tennis skirts way hot when she's wearing those like riding boots.

565
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,817
Speaker 0: That is ace also ace.

566
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:22,137
Speaker 1: Yeah.

567
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:22,478
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:28,267
Speaker 0: She is, if anything, the only problem with her is that she's too cool for school.

569
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:31,280
Speaker 0: And in fact, our main character really couldn't deal with her.

570
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,888
Speaker 0: And I like how she's.

571
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:40,227
Speaker 0: a matter of fact, she's like, you know, actually I could've, I could've done a thing with you, but, uh, you didn't really follow up.

572
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,174
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's the problem with him.

573
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:42,757
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,089
Speaker 0: But whatever, this was a tiny part of his life.

575
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,016
Speaker 0: At least he made out with her.

576
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:46,439
Speaker 1: Yeah.

577
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:58,437
Speaker 0: But this is a simple story about a bunch of shitty people doing their shitty thing and a few cool headed people just kind of watching the train wreck.

578
00:29:58,477 --> 00:29:58,617
Speaker 1: Right.

579
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:01,488
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what the story, the real car wreck?

580
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:05,021
Speaker 1: in this case, obviously as with any great, you know, work, right?

581
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:10,365
Speaker 0: There are many messages, but the core number one message, I'm curious what you think the number one messages, right?

582
00:30:10,806 --> 00:30:13,256
Speaker 1: It's it's the East egg and the West egg.

583
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:21,020
Speaker 1: And it is comparing the old money and the new money, the old money of the East egg and the new money of the West egg.

584
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,632
Speaker 1: You have, you know, Tom and what's her face, right?

585
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:25,876
Speaker 1: Are the old money.

586
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:30,533
Speaker 1: And on the one hand, the old money, it's like, did they really earn their money?

587
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,801
Speaker 1: Oh, they kind of inherited it, right?

588
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:37,939
Speaker 1: But they sort of, you know, act at least outwardly, respectively.

589
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:38,200
Speaker 1: Right.

590
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,559
Speaker 1: They sort of have all these airs and ways about them and, you know, things they do.

591
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:42,840
Speaker 1: Right.

592
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,300
Speaker 1: Yep.

593
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:47,273
Speaker 1: You know, they have a veneer over the reality.

594
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:56,150
Speaker 0: They have the same crazy childish drama that normal people have, but they, but they put it all, they cast it in this completely different light in their, in their personal lives.

595
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,180
Speaker 1: They're sort of shitty and evil, right?

596
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,747
Speaker 0: Not evil, just shitty.

597
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:00,470
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

598
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,325
Speaker 1: I mean, not super evil, like Hitler evil, but you know, not exactly nice.

599
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:04,728
Speaker 1: Right?

600
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,015
Speaker 0: Well, like, yeah, she's cheating on her.

601
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:09,028
Speaker 1: I mean, the dude is mad racist, but he wasn't right.

602
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:12,040
Speaker 0: So he was racist in that really derpy way.

603
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,500
Speaker 1: Right.

604
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:16,034
Speaker 1: But then on the other hand, you have the Gatsby new monies, right?

605
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:19,566
Speaker 1: These people who, you know, how did they earn their money?

606
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,797
Speaker 1: Crime and stealing and not good things.

607
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,367
Speaker 0: But it was, it was relatively cool crime.

608
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:28,177
Speaker 0: I mean, world series and bootlegging.

609
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:28,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

610
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:28,980
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,527
Speaker 1: He earned his money illegitimately.

613
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:32,049
Speaker 1: Right.

614
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:42,749
Speaker 1: But, you know, in terms of his ideals and, you know, the way he conducted himself in his personal life was actually, you know, kind of a good standup person.

615
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:49,031
Speaker 0: It's like, if I had to say anything about Gatsby, it's that he was incredibly naive and entirely too genuine.

616
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:54,930
Speaker 1: It's sort of, in fact mirrors, uh, you're going to love this sanctuary, right?

617
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,488
Speaker 1: You have these people, it's like, you know, these, these two young good guys, these new monies, right.

618
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,470
Speaker 1: And, you know, they want to come and fix the government and make the world better and create a sanctuary.

619
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,644
Speaker 1: And they're all idealistic and young and spirited, but how did they get there?

620
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:15,244
Speaker 1: Yuck is a crime in, well, what about those old guys who are already in charge, right?

621
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,551
Speaker 1: There's the quote in sanctuary.

622
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:20,730
Speaker 0: I joined the Yakuza because I can do in a week, what a normal man takes 10 years to accomplish.

623
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,232
Speaker 1: That's right.

624
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:29,925
Speaker 1: Is, you know, well in sanctuary, at least those guys were Yakuza also, but some, you know, then they were corrupt also, but some of them weren't.

625
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:38,732
Speaker 1: and they got there, you know, the legit non-crime takes 10 years away, but you know, of course they were up to no good.

626
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:40,559
Speaker 1: Their ideals were not right.

627
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:41,683
Speaker 0: Oh, here's the random aside.

628
00:32:41,703 --> 00:32:45,240
Speaker 0: Apparently Ernest Hemingway hated the cover of the great Gatsby.

629
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,065
Speaker 1: Ernest Hemingway hated it.

630
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:47,727
Speaker 1: Okay.

631
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:56,716
Speaker 0: When Fitzgerald lent him a copy of the great Gatsby that he read, he immediately disliked the cover and Scott told him not to be put off by it.

632
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:59,611
Speaker 0: And that it had to do with a billboard along the highway in Long Island.

633
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:02,845
Speaker 1: It does have to do with the billboard along the highway in Long Island.

634
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:12,615
Speaker 0: But Gatsby was just, he was too naive and genuine that he, it's like he held onto this pure image of the past.

635
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:18,043
Speaker 0: I'm not going to allude to all the tennis stuff I would reference because no one listening to this episode will get that, but same thing.

636
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:27,073
Speaker 0: We just talked about that, but again, he carried that naive sort of innocence, like he's doing all these things to make right and get with that girl.

637
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:37,433
Speaker 0: And he has this sort of fairytale idea that if he just gets noticed by her, she's going to leave her husband and get back with him and everything's going to be awesome because her husband's a putz.

638
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:40,327
Speaker 0: How many nice guys do you know who think that exact same thing?

639
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,946
Speaker 0: If I'm just around, she's going to ditch that biker asshole and date me in the end.

640
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:52,820
Speaker 0: And she wanted to have an affair with him because she's, you know, she, I think she probably had designs on our main character.

641
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:55,051
Speaker 0: If that wasn't obvious to all of you.

642
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,080
Speaker 1: But weren't they cousins though?

643
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,093
Speaker 0: But the way she interacted with him was creepy.

645
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,464
Speaker 1: And it was a cousin that she didn't see often until then.

646
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,190
Speaker 0: And read it again.

647
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:05,680
Speaker 0: She flirts with him and it's kind of creepy actually.

648
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,222
Speaker 1: It was pretty creepy.

649
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:06,503
Speaker 0: Yeah.

650
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:10,518
Speaker 0: But so he, she probably wouldn't like seeing Gatsby again.

651
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,043
Speaker 0: She was all about having an affair.

652
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:17,400
Speaker 0: But then when he was like, come run away with me for real, let's do this.

653
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,507
Speaker 0: She refused to do it.

654
00:34:20,009 --> 00:34:21,576
Speaker 0: She refused to back away completely.

655
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:26,179
Speaker 0: And she basically just became a passive character and stood there doing nothing until catastrophe happened.

656
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:26,639
Speaker 1: Yep.

657
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:33,109
Speaker 1: The other thing is I can really relate to this sort of, you know, old money, new money, East egg, West egg contrast.

658
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:39,699
Speaker 1: That is the core of this book because it's something I see, you know, in everyday life, not just in New York, but just sort of everywhere.

659
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:39,980
Speaker 1: Right.

660
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,286
Speaker 0: If anything, it's getting worse.

661
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:41,648
Speaker 1: Yeah.

662
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:50,385
Speaker 1: I mean, look at like, you know, in terms of, you know, internet generation versus not, you know, in terms of thinking on different issues like copyright, it's like old people think this.

663
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:58,999
Speaker 1: new young people think that, you know, and it's just, that's just, you know, young people like the rap music and old people say the rap music is the devil.

664
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,338
Speaker 1: And it's all that kind of stuff that we see everywhere in, uh, in our lives every day.

665
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:11,583
Speaker 0: And this book really sort of shows it to you, but it also really hits that aspect of the main characters about our age.

666
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:14,975
Speaker 0: Like he's going, he's actually similar to us.

667
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:15,938
Speaker 0: He's similar to us.

668
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:22,883
Speaker 0: And especially because the book pointedly avoids the details of his personal life and just shows him interacting with these people.

669
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:38,882
Speaker 0: I find that I actually identify with him to a surprising degree because I picture myself in his situations, reacting in many ways, similarly, not in all ways, because I am much more willing to interject in someone's bullshit.

670
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:39,825
Speaker 1: Yes you are.

671
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:49,338
Speaker 1: But at the other, at the other hand, also the guy who will smile and chuckle and pretend to be paying attention to what some creepy fan boy is saying.

672
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:49,880
Speaker 1: Exactly.

673
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,301
Speaker 1: Right.

674
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,651
Speaker 1: Which is what this guy will do, which I do not do.

675
00:35:52,932 --> 00:36:02,485
Speaker 0: But in a way, that's how I also identify with Gatsby because I like Gatsby, but then when I realized that he was really just a naive man-child, I liked him a lot less.

676
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:10,205
Speaker 0: But if his internal drive had matched the surface, he would have been the most awesome dude ever.

677
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:15,263
Speaker 1: Well, that's why the title of the Great Gatsby is, you know, this title, right?

678
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:26,934
Speaker 1: It's like on the one hand you see the Great Gatsby and in many ways he was not great, which makes it like, oh, the Great Gatsby derp.

679
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:27,495
Speaker 0: Yep.

680
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:31,133
Speaker 0: Well, he was great except no one went to his funeral because no one even knew who he was.

681
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,160
Speaker 0: They just showed up at his house.

682
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:32,902
Speaker 1: Exactly.

683
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:38,060
Speaker 0: I mean, at least if I have a party, I know every single person at that party mostly.

684
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:49,358
Speaker 1: I mean, I hate it when, you know, like you'll go to like weddings and it's like the people who are getting married don't even know all the people there because like their parents invited somebody and it's like, I will never have that shit ever in my life again.

686
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:53,640
Speaker 1: It's like, if I, if it is a party for me, I will know every single person there.

687
00:36:54,082 --> 00:37:00,592
Speaker 0: The little touch that the owl looking guy, owl looking guy is the best guy in the whole actually liked Gatsby and was actually missed the funeral.

688
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:03,645
Speaker 0: Like he'd be like, he wanted to go and he just had something come up for real.

689
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,281
Speaker 0: The fact that he actually missed Gatsby and actually cared about him.

690
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:10,259
Speaker 0: I thought that was a really nice touch because I remember that character, the whole book.

691
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,263
Speaker 1: That was my favorite guy.

692
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:12,808
Speaker 0: I like the beginning.

693
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:17,485
Speaker 0: I've Scott Fitzgerald guys is one of the better authors in English ever.

694
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:19,736
Speaker 0: There's a reason why people talk about him.

695
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,262
Speaker 1: Well, this is what I think, right?

696
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:22,447
Speaker 0: Well, I want to make a point.

697
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,411
Speaker 0: Look at what he did.

698
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,560
Speaker 0: The book is titled the great Gatsby.

699
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,404
Speaker 0: We don't meet Gatsby.

700
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,360
Speaker 1: If you read on Wikipedia, there was a, he had a hard time picking the title.

701
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,643
Speaker 0: I'm reading the same paragraph.

702
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,870
Speaker 0: Those other titles are all stupid.

703
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:36,371
Speaker 1: Yeah.

704
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:40,806
Speaker 0: But anyway, under the red, white and blue, really?

705
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:41,569
Speaker 0: Yeah.

706
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,084
Speaker 0: Gold-headed Gatsby, the high bouncing lover Tramocchio in West egg.

707
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:50,676
Speaker 1: Well, actually when I read that Wikipedia, I read what Tramocchio was.

708
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,633
Speaker 1: I forget, but it was once you see what Tramocchio is, you're like, Oh, of course.

709
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:56,556
Speaker 1: Yeah.

710
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,026
Speaker 0: Gatsby among Ash heaps and millionaires.

711
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,897
Speaker 0: That's, that's the worst title of the bunch.

712
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:06,316
Speaker 1: So there was apparently some great controversy in our forum about whether this was book was good or not.

713
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,508
Speaker 0: I want to get to everyone who said this book was bad.

714
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:16,590
Speaker 0: If I read between the lines of what you said was bad about it, you didn't, I like the characters.

715
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:18,796
Speaker 0: You didn't identify with the characters.

716
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:26,303
Speaker 0: You were mad at the decisions the characters made and you couldn't identify with the setting and you couldn't glean the morals and messages.

717
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:34,407
Speaker 0: No one had any criticism of the style, the presentation, you know, the things that literary criticism is about.

718
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:35,410
Speaker 1: Exactly.

719
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,304
Speaker 1: So the thing is with this book is that, you know, why is it great?

720
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,028
Speaker 1: I'll be honest.

721
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:42,562
Speaker 1: You know, there are many things, you know, it's not a bad book, right?

722
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:46,519
Speaker 1: But in terms of my personal enjoyment of it, it was slightly above me, right?

723
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:47,322
Speaker 1: I really enjoyed it.

724
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,910
Speaker 1: I didn't have a ton of fun reading it.

725
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,975
Speaker 1: It wasn't thrilling.

726
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:59,425
Speaker 1: I wouldn't like go and read it again, you know, enjoyment wise, but in terms of recognition of quality, it's like, ah, ah, well, right.

727
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:08,093
Speaker 1: If someone was going to write a textbook with instructions on like how to write good novel, this is like a plus.

728
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:11,886
Speaker 0: Finally, our character goes to the party and he's like, I wonder what's up with the Gatsby.

729
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:14,098
Speaker 0: Like he's actually like, they set the stage.

730
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,328
Speaker 0: You're really wondering like, what's the deal with Gatsby?

731
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,818
Speaker 0: And you get all, first you get all these rumors.

732
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,850
Speaker 0: He hears what other people say about Gatsby and it's all over the place.

733
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:33,080
Speaker 0: And then he goes around and he runs into a few characters in a row where you, as the reader think, I'll bet that's Gatsby.

734
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,667
Speaker 0: You expect it to be Gatsby and it's never Gatsby.

735
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:38,716
Speaker 0: You, everyone thought the guy was Gatsby.

736
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:44,694
Speaker 0: And then Gatsby talks to him for like five minutes and then he's like, oh, uh, I'm Gatsby.

737
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:45,617
Speaker 1: Yeah.

738
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:45,998
Speaker 1: Sorry.

739
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,204
Speaker 0: I guess I should have introduced myself.

740
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:53,342
Speaker 0: The way that was executed was brilliant and perfectly constructed.

741
00:39:53,623 --> 00:40:04,227
Speaker 0: If you do not recognize how well that was all put together from a constructive construction standpoint of a novel, you haven't read enough novels and pretty much the whole, everything in the book is like that.

742
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:08,287
Speaker 1: You know, the, the coincidence of the, the big scene, which is the car accident, right?

743
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:16,679
Speaker 1: And how he, he goes back and forth between the different people and the different cars and the timing of coming back and how they stopped on the way there.

744
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,186
Speaker 1: And the, the timing is getting dark.

745
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:29,347
Speaker 0: Tom is interacting and he pretty much is going to send the crazy, the old sad guy off to murder Gatsby.

746
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:30,812
Speaker 0: Like he, he's going to make that happen.

747
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:34,829
Speaker 0: And he basically starts to get animated with a guy.

748
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:44,650
Speaker 0: And then there's a scene where the cop who's interviewing someone unrelated sort of notices that there's a little bit of commotion and how Tom like tries to back that back off to let his plot happen.

749
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:45,635
Speaker 0: But it's subtle.

750
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:50,172
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of people miss it, but Tom was premeditating the murder of Gatsby from that point onward.

751
00:40:50,393 --> 00:40:50,553
Speaker 0: Yep.

752
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:56,296
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's just in terms of if someone was going to, you know, it's usually right.

753
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,043
Speaker 1: Things that get a lot of attention, right.

754
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:06,317
Speaker 1: Are things that, you know, don't follow, you know, the textbook, they do something weird or they throw in the twist or they do something clever.

755
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:06,618
Speaker 1: Right.

756
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,970
Speaker 1: And it's like, Ooh, look at that clever thing they did in this book.

757
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,603
Speaker 1: Like for example, Hyperion does a clever thing, right?

758
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:13,812
Speaker 0: But this does a lot of clever things too.

759
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,679
Speaker 1: It does, but it does a clever thing.

760
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:16,642
Speaker 1: So it stands out.

761
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:22,257
Speaker 1: This book is pretty much how to write good novel by the book, right?

762
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,661
Speaker 1: Textbook straight down.

763
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,432
Speaker 1: And that's why it's considered like great American novel.

764
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:28,922
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything fancy or special.

765
00:41:28,982 --> 00:41:33,539
Speaker 1: It does everything you're supposed to do at an extremely high level of execution.

766
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:41,946
Speaker 0: Now, case in point, the little bit at the end where Tom is confronted with you fucking murdered Gatsby, basically don't pretend you didn't.

767
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:53,561
Speaker 0: And his response, that little scene, and it's not even said explicitly, but what he says translates to, I found that dog dead because no one went to check on it.

768
00:41:54,845 --> 00:42:01,867
Speaker 0: The little subtle bits like that and how that counterbalances the fact that Gatsby was murdered and someone else died.

769
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:06,806
Speaker 0: And yet the fact that the main character knows that Gatsby didn't even do it, that it was Daisy's fault.

770
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,604
Speaker 0: It's just, it's also delicately interwoven and brilliant for such a short little book.

771
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,151
Speaker 0: It's just perfectly constructed.

772
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:17,386
Speaker 0: It's like a symphony that's just written by the book.

773
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:18,470
Speaker 0: It's a perfect symphony.

774
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,004
Speaker 0: You have no complaint about it, except perhaps that it's not avant-garde.

775
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:22,365
Speaker 0: Yep.

776
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,416
Speaker 1: But in a way, right, that can actually come out.

777
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:30,097
Speaker 1: kind of boring is, you know, that, that, you know, you did something so plainly, like imagine a bat.

778
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:33,412
Speaker 0: Well, in the same way that Citizen Kane seems really boring to most people.

779
00:42:33,472 --> 00:42:40,841
Speaker 1: Imagine if you had a basketball game and you won by a zillion points because you played so well, but all you did was just take shots and make layups.

780
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:45,176
Speaker 1: No fancy dunks, no fancy trick plays or behind the back passes.

781
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:47,985
Speaker 1: Just, you know, take it the whole layup every time.

782
00:42:48,005 --> 00:42:55,009
Speaker 0: The most boring football game is run, pass, run, march up the field, touchdown, run, pass, run, march up the field.

783
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,239
Speaker 1: No Hail Marys, no onside kicks.

784
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:02,799
Speaker 0: You want to see the onside kick, the two-point conversion, but there's nothing fancy going on here.

785
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,521
Speaker 1: It's straightforward, but it scores a zillion points and runs up the score and the opponent's got nothing.

786
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:16,787
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, our listeners had none of this umbrage with the King Killer Chronicle, both sexy Rops through the world.

787
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,691
Speaker 0: That's the XFL.

788
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:24,144
Speaker 0: You're going to tell me that you prefer the XFL because it's so exciting.

789
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:28,620
Speaker 1: No, it's because, you know, like I, I keep bringing this argument up.

790
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,295
Speaker 1: It's the same thing we've been discussing since the beginning of internets.

791
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:38,860
Speaker 1: And, you know, time really is that most people, they read, they have a piece of entertainment media.

792
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:42,374
Speaker 1: They have a feeling, a reaction to it as all people do.

793
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:48,236
Speaker 1: If that feeling is positive, they rate it as good and they like it or their favorite or whatever.

794
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:52,555
Speaker 1: And if they get a bad feeling from it personally, they say, that's not to my taste.

795
00:43:52,615 --> 00:43:53,198
Speaker 1: I don't like it.

796
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:53,700
Speaker 1: It's bad.

797
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:54,424
Speaker 1: And that's there.

798
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,537
Speaker 1: That's the limit of their critique abilities.

799
00:43:56,798 --> 00:43:59,029
Speaker 1: I, you know, I think it's more subtle than that.

800
00:43:59,049 --> 00:43:59,994
Speaker 0: I think it's more specific.

801
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:08,566
Speaker 0: I think there's a very, very specific problem that I see among, not to stereotype, but younger people who happen to be our listeners or nerdy like this.

802
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,039
Speaker 0: You don't identify with a character or a setting.

803
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:16,414
Speaker 0: And therefore you somehow translate that into saying the work is bad.

804
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,260
Speaker 1: I don't identify.

805
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:18,964
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

806
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:20,496
Speaker 1: is they had a negative feeling towards it.

807
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,313
Speaker 1: And like I said, my feelings toward it, weren't extremely positive.

808
00:44:23,354 --> 00:44:24,380
Speaker 1: They're only slightly positive.

809
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,313
Speaker 0: I cannot identify with the in the Prince of nothing.

810
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:31,771
Speaker 0: I'm not a fat old sad wizard, but I can still recognize the work.

811
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,256
Speaker 1: as look at this craftsmanship.

812
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,240
Speaker 1: It's a miracle.

813
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,691
Speaker 0: It's like all things considered, but you know what?

814
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:41,908
Speaker 0: I don't identify with Katniss, a teenage girl with teenage girl thoughts.

815
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:49,922
Speaker 0: But when you tell me it's a bad book, because you can't identify with the teenage girl, because you're a 30 year old dude, that's not a criticism of the work.

816
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:53,996
Speaker 0: That's a criticism of you as a person who would enjoy that work.

817
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:54,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

818
00:44:54,738 --> 00:45:01,446
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it's not for you, but you should still be able to recognize whether it's good or bad, regardless of whether it's for you or not.

819
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:09,935
Speaker 1: I mean, see, you know, uh, Reagan C spot run isn't for me, but I can tell whether it's a good kids book or not by reading it and checking it out.

820
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:19,879
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean, I can go to the museum and I can look at a statue and I can, you know, I don't know that much about sculpture, but I know a little, and I can tell, oh, look at how well this was crafted.

821
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:25,658
Speaker 1: This was made by a freaking Greek dude centuries ago with a chisel and a hammer and only shit.

822
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:27,466
Speaker 1: It looks like fucking real person.

823
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:29,053
Speaker 1: That is fucking unbelievable.

824
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:29,254
Speaker 1: What?

825
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:30,278
Speaker 1: I want to put it in my house.

826
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,778
Speaker 1: No, I don't really like it, but I can recognize the, basically the miracle of craftsmanship.

827
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,102
Speaker 1: And that is what this book is.

828
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:49,308
Speaker 0: Uh, like remember when he goes, uh, the main character goes home for me to hang out with his family for a little bit, that whole description of like the train ride and every description of everything is, is off the chart.

829
00:45:49,809 --> 00:46:16,825
Speaker 0: It's just, and I think the reason this book has endured so well and is remembered separately and above other works that describe a similar time in a similar place or have similar motifs or similar sort of morals and themes is that this one in particular really spoke to this sort of generation of 25 to 35 year olds from major cities or who have lived in major cities.

830
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,900
Speaker 0: It also really spoke to a generation coming out of world war one.

831
00:46:22,142 --> 00:46:27,709
Speaker 0: And I think that just kind of cemented it in American culture, but also the fact that it really is timeless piece.

832
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:32,091
Speaker 0: I mean, I live in the place where this book supposedly takes place, like parts of it.

833
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,920
Speaker 0: I mean, long islands, not too far away.

834
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:38,657
Speaker 0: They drove right through where Scott and I live and it's still like that here.

835
00:46:38,717 --> 00:46:53,228
Speaker 0: Like I can see those places and I can see people who are just like these characters, people commuting on the exact same mistakes in their real life.

836
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:54,533
Speaker 0: They're only different.

837
00:46:55,015 --> 00:47:02,711
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people are making these mistakes that might be made uncomfortable by the book because they don't recognize that because the, you know, the book is kind of saying whenever

838
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:07,619
Speaker 1: a book has something to say to a person and that person is reading the book, that person never recognized that it's them.

839
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:12,612
Speaker 0: How many fedora fedora wearing brony?

840
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:16,362
Speaker 0: nice guys don't realize that they're just a sad sack version of Gatsby.

841
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:16,763
Speaker 1: Yeah.

842
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,257
Speaker 0: I mean, literally you are a sad sack version of Gatsby.

843
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:25,430
Speaker 0: If you're that fedora, nice guy, because Gatsby is the fedora nice guy.

844
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,440
Speaker 0: The fedora is his mansion, his affectations.

845
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:37,252
Speaker 0: The nice guy is just his weird unrealistic expectations about this girl and her relationship with him and her relationship with the people around her.

846
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,960
Speaker 0: She's dating that biker asshole.

847
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,710
Speaker 0: And that biker assholes racism is.

848
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:48,405
Speaker 0: there are people like that today who are exactly the same kind of racist.

849
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:49,690
Speaker 0: Like that is not changed.

850
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:50,895
Speaker 0: I know people like that.

851
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,385
Speaker 1: You want to hear a funny racist story from today?

852
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:56,016
Speaker 1: What is one of those guys outside my work?

853
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:57,843
Speaker 1: He's trying to, you know, give CDs out.

854
00:47:58,284 --> 00:47:58,545
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:47:58,685 --> 00:47:59,227
Speaker 0: The typical.

856
00:47:59,468 --> 00:47:59,769
Speaker 1: Right.

857
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,237
Speaker 1: And he himself is a black person.

858
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:02,618
Speaker 1: Right.

859
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,987
Speaker 1: And he's obviously trying to get tourists to, to trap them and give him money in exchange for his bad rap CD that you do that he made.

860
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:13,305
Speaker 1: And he calls out to this one tourist and he's like, Hey man, where are you from?

861
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,677
Speaker 1: And the guy was a tourist, so he couldn't resist.

862
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:16,802
Speaker 1: And he said, Norway.

863
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,593
Speaker 1: So the guy says they got Negroes in Norway.

864
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,320
Speaker 1: That's the end of the story.

865
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:23,702
Speaker 1: Wow.

866
00:48:23,722 --> 00:48:23,862
Speaker 1: Yeah.

867
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:24,584
Speaker 0: That's great.

868
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:24,965
Speaker 1: Yep.

869
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:27,392
Speaker 0: There's people like that.

870
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:27,813
Speaker 0: Yep.

871
00:48:29,196 --> 00:48:30,159
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

872
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:38,073
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, not to get into a deep, literally literary analysis of the themes and maybe I could summarize the plot for you, but I don't know.

873
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:39,198
Speaker 0: The book really spoke to me.

874
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:50,099
Speaker 0: It did get, I think it really speaks to, you know, people in their late twenties, early thirties who have gone beyond the point where they can do anything to having to pick something and actually do it.

875
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:53,232
Speaker 0: And there's a little bit of ennui there.

876
00:48:53,313 --> 00:49:00,705
Speaker 0: I don't think we're at the point of, it's not that the, you know, a lot of people say this is the book about like the American dream collapsing in that era.

877
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:04,784
Speaker 1: There's clearly the ennui of like, Hey, you know, we should probably hang out and do something.

878
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:05,528
Speaker 1: What do you want to do?

879
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:05,870
Speaker 1: I don't know.

880
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:07,580
Speaker 1: Let's go to the hotel and get drunk.

881
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,041
Speaker 1: All right.

882
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:11,154
Speaker 1: Maybe you should put on some music and dance.

883
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:12,620
Speaker 1: No one really knows what the fuck to do.

884
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:17,697
Speaker 1: Or board games or anything, but we do the same thing today.

885
00:49:17,717 --> 00:49:20,636
Speaker 1: It's like, Hey, let's go to Manhattan and do, we should go to Manhattan and do something.

886
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:20,978
Speaker 1: Okay.

887
00:49:20,998 --> 00:49:21,882
Speaker 1: What should we do?

888
00:49:22,444 --> 00:49:22,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

889
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:32,462
Speaker 0: I mean that drama of they're all in the uncomfortable situation toward the end and they all decide to go to the hotel and the girl basically, uh, Tom's like, wait, why are we going to the city?

890
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,834
Speaker 0: And Daisy's like, yeah, let's go into the city.

891
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:35,698
Speaker 0: He's like, fine.

892
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:38,710
Speaker 0: And he does all the bullshit to organize them going into the city.

893
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,464
Speaker 0: And then at the end of all that, when she's like, well, there's your idea anyway.

894
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:45,633
Speaker 0: And his reaction to that, I have lived that.

895
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,662
Speaker 0: I have lived that exact reality.

896
00:49:48,742 --> 00:49:51,229
Speaker 0: In fact, Scott, you and I have been in situations like that.

897
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:59,698
Speaker 1: There is an unstated drama, not a hundred years after this book is written the same thing is still going on.

898
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,285
Speaker 0: In fact, I recall a specific time.

899
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:05,927
Speaker 0: We all ended up at a restaurant, a whole bunch of us with a person that would be a source of drama.

900
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,033
Speaker 0: Everyone's uncomfortable.

901
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:07,777
Speaker 0: No one will account.

902
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:08,882
Speaker 0: We'll do it directly.

903
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:22,840
Speaker 0: One of our friends got speed and we lived through everything but the death, including the drive home, the separate cars, who goes in what car, the two people who aren't dating.

904
00:50:24,002 --> 00:50:24,585
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

905
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:37,975
Speaker 0: Uh, I won't name names on the show because some of these people might listen, but we know two people who each were dating other people who ended up with each other later, who had that situation of they rode in the car together, home from the thing.

906
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:41,185
Speaker 0: This book is a hundred years after the book.

907
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:44,636
Speaker 0: It's exactly what happens in American relationships today.

908
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:45,117
Speaker 1: Yep.

909
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:51,501
Speaker 0: So if you can't identify with this book, read it again when you turn 29 and you still can't identify with it.

910
00:50:51,521 --> 00:50:54,893
Speaker 1: Move to a city and stop being a provincial stick liver.

911
00:50:54,913 --> 00:51:02,799
Speaker 0: I defy anyone to live in a major city like New York, hit the age of 35 and not be able to identify with this book.

912
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,385
Speaker 1: And not be, you can't be a shut-in either.

913
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:05,530
Speaker 1: Shut-in won't understand it.

914
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:08,344
Speaker 1: It's hard to have some social life to understand.

915
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,476
Speaker 0: It is hard to move to New York and still be a shut-in.

916
00:51:10,496 --> 00:51:11,260
Speaker 1: There are shut-ins here.

917
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,485
Speaker 1: They get delivery for everything.

918
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:17,164
Speaker 0: Ah, but then you have to be independently wealthy or have a sugar daddy.

919
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:19,652
Speaker 0: In which case, but you still feel to afford rent.

920
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:20,434
Speaker 1: Telecommute living.

921
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,084
Speaker 0: But then you're not living in the city.

922
00:51:23,466 --> 00:51:25,114
Speaker 1: No, they telecommute and they live in the city.

923
00:51:25,435 --> 00:51:26,641
Speaker 0: Where do they live in the city then?

924
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:27,747
Speaker 1: In some shitty apartment.

925
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:31,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, some shitty apartment, probably far enough away to where they're not going to be interacting with all this.

926
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:33,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not long island taking the train.

927
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:45,449
Speaker 0: It's a rare person who is going to be able to live in a city, be 35 and not realize how directly relevant everything that happens in this book is to real life.

928
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,700
Speaker 0: I don't know what else I have to say.

929
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,215
Speaker 1: I mean, I know there's a whole bunch of symbolism you can talk about.

930
00:51:52,256 --> 00:51:56,153
Speaker 1: Like if you were going to give an exam on this book, you would talk about like, what's the green light?

931
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,941
Speaker 0: Why does it symbolize what it does?

932
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:59,125
Speaker 1: You're talking about the green light.

933
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:01,515
Speaker 0: The unattainable dream versus the reality.

934
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:07,937
Speaker 0: His desire for her was only pure when she was an unattainable thing in the distance.

935
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:10,085
Speaker 0: The reality actually destroyed the dream.

936
00:52:10,246 --> 00:52:17,657
Speaker 1: Or you can talk about the eyeglasses on the billboard across from the mechanic shop being like the eyes of God and watching everybody.

937
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:18,942
Speaker 0: If we wrote The Great Gatsby today.

938
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:23,739
Speaker 1: And how the owl-eyed guy matches with the owl-eyed doctor optician poster.

939
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:27,268
Speaker 0: Scott, if we wrote this book today, you know what those eyes are?

940
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:27,328
Speaker 0: Dr.

941
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,093
Speaker 0: Zizemore.

942
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:29,795
Speaker 1: It's Dr.

943
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:30,196
Speaker 1: Zizemore.

944
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:33,083
Speaker 1: That would be skin and not eyes.

945
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:41,855
Speaker 0: That is the thing I would use if I was writing The Great Gatsby today as something that if you live in New York, it's like, yeah, everyone knows.

946
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:44,966
Speaker 1: But I think this is a made up optician and not a real one.

947
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:47,514
Speaker 0: But you need that kind of detail.

948
00:52:47,815 --> 00:52:54,700
Speaker 0: Because when I read this book and he described that, I can picture a thing like that because there are things like that.

949
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,868
Speaker 0: People who live here know those things.

950
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,716
Speaker 0: The thing doesn't actually need to exist.

951
00:52:58,756 --> 00:53:01,146
Speaker 0: The idea of that kind of thing needs to exist.

952
00:53:01,648 --> 00:53:08,513
Speaker 1: But I mean, and I can totally get that feel of, you know, the feeling of billboard sort of watching, even if it doesn't have eyes at work.

953
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:09,657
Speaker 1: I'm in Times Square.

954
00:53:09,677 --> 00:53:11,143
Speaker 1: I'm on the seventh floor.

955
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,113
Speaker 1: It's friggin billboards right outside the window.

956
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:17,170
Speaker 1: And it's like, when you sit near one of those windows, it's like friggin.

957
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,222
Speaker 1: whatever's out there is like upon you all the time.

958
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,146
Speaker 1: You know, so it's like.

959
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:26,671
Speaker 1: I bet this mechanic looking out his window was a lot like me looking out the window at work on my desk was in the other position.

960
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:38,100
Speaker 1: You know, seeing that billboard sort of imposing on your space all the time, you know, sort of watching him and the way he treated his, you know, wife, I guess technically wife, right, and all the things that went on there.

961
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,609
Speaker 1: And anyone who came across, you know, but yeah.

962
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,401
Speaker 1: All right, do you have anything else to say about this book?

963
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:46,504
Speaker 0: No, so what's the next book?

964
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,828
Speaker 1: What is the next book?

965
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:49,192
Speaker 1: So here we go.

966
00:53:50,696 --> 00:54:03,084
Speaker 1: Usually and recently I had a policy of pick a book that I own that is on my shelf that I have not read so that I can read it and get it and eventually have read all the books that are already on my shelf and not buy any new books made of paper.

967
00:54:03,225 --> 00:54:04,208
Speaker 0: So did you do just that?

968
00:54:04,228 --> 00:54:04,248
Speaker 0: I

969
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:11,409
Speaker 1: was about to do just that and then I had selected a book from the shelf that I had not read yet,

970
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:12,532
Speaker 0: but

971
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:21,433
Speaker 1: I discovered the existence of a previously unknown to me book that is such a I swear

972
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:25,261
Speaker 0: to god if you say some book that everyone's read

973
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:28,309
Speaker 1: now that is such a geek night's book.

974
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,538
Speaker 1: there could not be a more geek night.

975
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,420
Speaker 1: scott rubin book.

976
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,525
Speaker 1: i've only started reading it.

977
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:35,674
Speaker 1: i'm like in the second very early on.

978
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:38,564
Speaker 1: my kindle is only less than 20. so far nothing.

979
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:39,165
Speaker 1: no.

980
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:43,055
Speaker 1: uh it might even be more geek nights than prince of nothing.

981
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:49,253
Speaker 1: huh i haven't finished it i don't know yet but here you you're gonna you know okay.

982
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:54,449
Speaker 1: so anyway i was told of a series of books uh by our friend alex.

983
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:54,931
Speaker 1: do you know this?

984
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:55,131
Speaker 1: yet?

985
00:54:55,151 --> 00:55:01,611
Speaker 1: uh we mentioned it maybe the last book club a little bit or maybe in a recent episode i forget.

986
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:11,761
Speaker 1: there is a series of books written by a person named ian m banks about a thing called the culture which is apparently i don't know too much about it.

987
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:15,090
Speaker 1: uh because i'm only partially through one book.

988
00:55:15,992 --> 00:55:22,791
Speaker 1: uh that is some sort of far futuristic utopia of awesomeness and high technology.

989
00:55:22,811 --> 00:55:26,623
Speaker 1: that is exactly the kind of place we would want to live to be awesome for us.

990
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:34,547
Speaker 1: and the second book in this series we're skipping over the first book which is called flavors.

991
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:36,433
Speaker 1: consider i forget what it's called something like that.

992
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:50,860
Speaker 1: the second book in this series which i've been told you can read without having read the first one is called player of games and it is about a guy who is pretty much the best game player there is in this utopian society.

993
00:55:52,540 --> 00:56:01,215
Speaker 0: and according to the small the text on the back of the book i could search through my email and find how many listeners have emailed me to say wait i should read this book over the last.

994
00:56:01,296 --> 00:56:12,078
Speaker 1: yeah according to the back of the book it's about how he supposedly gets entangled into some civilization where you play games to become the emperor or something like that.

995
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:19,503
Speaker 1: so i could not imagine just based on that summary alone and the partial bits i the beginning that i've read so far.

996
00:56:19,523 --> 00:56:30,618
Speaker 1: this is like someone wrote this book thinking like oh let me write a book for rim and scott here those those nerdy cyberpunk progressive utopian game player guys.

997
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,825
Speaker 1: let's write a book for them and that is this book.

998
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:35,635
Speaker 0: so no benjuka there's.

999
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,822
Speaker 1: they play other games besides benjuka.

1000
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:41,817
Speaker 1: that might as well be fucking benjuka already been like three or four of them.

1001
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:45,608
Speaker 1: um yeah so that is the book club book.

1002
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,797
Speaker 1: it is player of games by ian m banks.

1003
00:56:48,857 --> 00:56:50,642
Speaker 1: you can just get it almost anywhere.

1004
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,089
Speaker 1: it is the second book in the culture series.

1005
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:57,102
Speaker 1: so if you want emily is very excited about this book.

1006
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,011
Speaker 0: if you want to read it you can.

1007
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:01,381
Speaker 1: maybe you can read the first culture series book if you want.

1008
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:13,546
Speaker 1: i'm probably gonna go back and read that too because i can't because the the only thing i tell you so far is that not having read the first book in the culture series i'm not sure how much i'm supposed to know about the culture.

1009
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:18,021
Speaker 1: a lot of it you can just pick up on as you go along but it's like.

1010
00:57:18,443 --> 00:57:18,644
Speaker 1: you know.

1011
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:20,291
Speaker 1: they just sort of have an.

1012
00:57:20,352 --> 00:57:22,963
Speaker 1: it's sort of like reading a marvel comic not knowing the marvel universe.

1013
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,452
Speaker 1: right it's like yeah okay who's you know?

1014
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:27,058
Speaker 1: daredevil he's a lawyer.

1015
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:28,383
Speaker 1: i didn't know that you know.

1016
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,791
Speaker 1: and it's like oh the culture there's.

1017
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:36,995
Speaker 1: no you know there's a thing called contact that finds alien civilizations and it's sort of secret and awesome.

1018
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:39,968
Speaker 1: okay i didn't know that you know but you pick up on it anyway.

1019
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,776
Speaker 1: that's the book all right.

1020
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,803
Speaker 1: then i will go back to my other policy.
