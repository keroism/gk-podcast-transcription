Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nice tonight.

4
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:17,980
Speaker 1: Final thoughts on me pilgrim.

5
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:28,663
Speaker 1: Let's do this clever girl.

6
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:32,741
Speaker 0: I Realized I do the opener disproportionately.

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:32,922
Speaker 0: now.

8
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:35,531
Speaker 0: it used to be kind of 50/50.

9
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,194
Speaker 1: I'm just lazy.

10
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:36,976
Speaker 0: Yeah.

11
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus it takes some effort to work up.

12
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:45,590
Speaker 0: You know doing the show we talk normally But during that open it's like hey, it's I can't take that much effort.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,436
Speaker 0: yeah, so we know Scott robot it in the last show and Basically, you know, I'll save this.

14
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,841
Speaker 0: I won't talk about it in the meta.

15
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,025
Speaker 1: Am I roboting right now?

16
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:56,929
Speaker 0: No, you're sure.

17
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:58,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're fine.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,470
Speaker 0: I can see the levels But basically I did order, you know, we haven't upgraded our equipment in like two and a half there.

19
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:06,856
Speaker 0: No, it was even before that.

20
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,542
Speaker 0: It was fucking other than the new microphones.

21
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:09,346
Speaker 0: We bought last year.

22
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:15,226
Speaker 0: It was katsu Con the last katsu con we went to when we bought this fucking mixer.

23
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:15,687
Speaker 0: Remember?

24
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,915
Speaker 0: All right We lug that thing down to DC.

25
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,965
Speaker 0: So we haven't really upgraded in a long time.

26
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,290
Speaker 0: So we're going all.

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,456
Speaker 1: There's a rule we have to upgrade.

28
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:28,030
Speaker 1: we can't just stop we can't just reach the the necessary level and stop upgrading.

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,376
Speaker 0: Oh, well, we always do.

30
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,245
Speaker 1: maybe if this shit didn't break wouldn't have to upgrade.

31
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:35,070
Speaker 0: No, it's not that it broke It's that's a pain in the ass to have more than two people on the show.

32
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,863
Speaker 0: What with only having two inputs into the computer?

33
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,234
Speaker 1: Oh That's it.

34
00:01:41,254 --> 00:01:43,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean we're upgrading.

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:50,790
Speaker 0: so hold off, you know next week I'm gonna be on vacation and then the week after that Fire wire might be a little while before the show sounds the same again.

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,560
Speaker 0: Let's end the wires on fires might sound even better.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,985
Speaker 1: house burns down.

38
00:01:55,346 --> 00:02:00,629
Speaker 1: get too many wires They're burning but much more importantly not my new wires the new RPG.

39
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:07,389
Speaker 0: I got a gloat at least a little bit because I'm happy about this very excited because it turns out that Conrad and a bunch of our friends are also going to this.

40
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:19,882
Speaker 0: So Scott the other day last week was like hey rim There's some Twitter contest to win tickets to the upcoming Scott program pre pre-release, you know fancy You know see it ahead of time special tickets and all that.

41
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:21,350
Speaker 0: and I was like, oh really, huh?

42
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,730
Speaker 0: And I look at my Twitter and I see the things right there.

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,617
Speaker 0: So I just reply and I got a ticket.

44
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,726
Speaker 0: so I messaged Scott back two minutes later.

45
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,477
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah great I got two tickets.

46
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:30,589

Speaker 0: They're still doing the contest like I just tried again today.

48
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:34,689
Speaker 1: I didn't win.

49
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,549
Speaker 0: Ah So, so I guess Friday I could review Scott pilgrim.

50
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,845
Speaker 0: The worst thing is I'm going to Wildwood and you know Emily's not going.

51
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:47,568
Speaker 0: neither is Scott.

52
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,290
Speaker 0: so Everyone else who's going wants to go see Scott pilgrim.

53
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:52,973
Speaker 1: That's great.

54
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully it'll be good enough to see twice.

55
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,210
Speaker 1: Isn't it kind of interesting how it's like?

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never go see movies really unless suddenly we're going to movies all the time.

57
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,466
Speaker 1: No, this is ultra rare, you know occasion that I'll go see a movie.

58
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:05,490
Speaker 0: just went to see Inception.

59
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,776
Speaker 0: Now you're gonna go see Scott pilgrim.

60
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,022
Speaker 1: dude is not a trend man.

61
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:09,006
Speaker 0: That's a trend.

62
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:09,589
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

63
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:11,794
Speaker 0: I will say this.

64
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:14,646
Speaker 0: I've realized I will say this is something I say a lot lately.

65
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:23,584
Speaker 0: It's kind of replaced preface or to be sure or Suffice to say suffice it to say to be sure.

66
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:30,450
Speaker 0: I must say as A fan of the Detroit Tigers one is definitely a fucking winning streak.

67
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:38,073
Speaker 1: So the Tigers aren't that bad not anymore anyway Said lions.

68
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,598
Speaker 1: That's what you should have said.

69
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:43,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had this other far worse team in the same city.

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,136
Speaker 1: I would argue you lie in second.

71
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:49,130
Speaker 0: The Lions are better for fans than the Detroit Tigers.

72
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,354
Speaker 1: How so sure Tigers?

73
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:55,010
Speaker 1: I mean maybe just cuz football is better but Tigers are kind of middle-of-the-road like nothing special.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,678
Speaker 0: They're not that great.

75
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,428
Speaker 0: They're not that bad.

76
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,294
Speaker 0: Lions are so bad.

77
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,036
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

78
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:03,310
Speaker 0: It's like why it's like rooting for the mohawk guy and fist of the North Star.

79
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:06,075
Speaker 0: You know, he's not gonna win.

80
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:09,046
Speaker 0: You're really just there to see how awesomely he loses.

81
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,897
Speaker 1: Anyway, the Yeah, right.

82
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,283
Speaker 1: So - does not a trend make?

83
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:15,509

00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:34,615
Speaker 1: that's scary.

89
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,519

Speaker 1: Verboten Basically discotheque, which is an awesome Anime, you know and live-action movie distributor.

119
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,750
Speaker 0: So they've already said they're going to release project a co and galaxy express.

120
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,192
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

121
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:56,835
Speaker 1: That's my news.

122
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,663
Speaker 0: You use that news last time.

123
00:05:58,703 --> 00:05:59,165
Speaker 0: Did I?

124
00:05:59,205 --> 00:05:59,547
Speaker 1: Yes.

125
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:04,740
Speaker 1: Oh fuck Wow I'm gonna find a new news not reuse my existing news.

126
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:07,047
Speaker 0: So so I'll give you some time here.

127
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:13,345
Speaker 0: Superman According to slashdot saved a family in no not Connecticut.

128
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:14,388
Speaker 0: that says comic connect.

129
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:17,485
Speaker 0: Never mind From having their house foreclosed upon.

130
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:22,770
Speaker 0: All right Apparently they found action comics number one just in the basement.

131
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:24,856
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen.

132
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,584
Speaker 0: That's like they're like, what's this?

133
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,670
Speaker 0: They sold it.

134
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:39,238
Speaker 0: They made money to cover the mortgage and all I have to say to that is they shouldn't let the mortgage fail and kept the Comic, it'll be worth more than the house like, you know, it doesn't really rise As far as I know what.

135
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:42,829
Speaker 1: the value of it doesn't really go up, you know It's just the condition of it can go down.

136
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:57,814
Speaker 1: I would argue the value of an original of this will go up or at least a static plus inflation plus the value probably just went down because the Quanta known quantity just went up by one which is a large percentage of the Known known quantity.

137
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,942
Speaker 1: It's like there are only five of these in the world.

138
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:02,010
Speaker 1: Okay, there are now six of them in the world.

139
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,449
Speaker 1: Well, the price just went down.

140
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,633
Speaker 0: So should I not?

141
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:10,210
Speaker 0: were I to own action comics number one hire hitmen to take out other action comics number ones?

142
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should collect them all into a bundle.

143
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,350
Speaker 1: That way you say there's one bundle of them and then you'd be like, well if anyone wants one you got to buy this bundle.

144
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:19,490
Speaker 0: Actually, here's a way to make copies all together.

145
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,654
Speaker 1: How many copies say?

146
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,742
Speaker 0: you have ten copies of action comics number one.

147
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,890
Speaker 0: can't have tank and say there's only 15 left in the world.

148
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,151
Speaker 0: Right.

149
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,015
Speaker 0: I've got ten.

150
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:26,778
Speaker 1: I don't know how many.

151
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,963
Speaker 1: there's probably a lot more than that.

152
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:28,364
Speaker 0: I'm just.

153
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,710
Speaker 0: I'm just making up numbers.

154
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:34,130
Speaker 0: So let's all right, so I make a YouTube channel I make a live TV stream and all this.

155
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:38,381
Speaker 0: I hold it up and hold up a lighter and I say for the next week.

Speaker 0: I'm killing the hostage P.

160
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,716
Speaker 1: I don't think you'll get enough.

161
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:50,422
Speaker 0: I think I would.

162
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,409
Speaker 1: you would make more than that just selling one of them.

163
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:59,206
Speaker 0: Well, the real way to do that is to burn a fake action comics to prove that you're serious and then threaten to burn another fake one.

164
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:04,550
Speaker 1: And I wasn't able to find the news really in the time.

165
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,509
Speaker 0: I use this like fluff Superman thing to stall for time and you still got nothing.

166
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,676
Speaker 1: It's not easy to find news.

167
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:13,523
Speaker 0: is he watching any anime right now?

168
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,170

169
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,020
Speaker 0: Okay, we should we should get but you know, we did.

170
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,939
Speaker 0: we haven't talked about a lot of Current or even old anime lately.

171
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,163
Speaker 0: We haven't been reviewing a lot of shows.

172
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,830
Speaker 1: I've been busy as I check this out.

173
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,452
Speaker 1: I watched.

174
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:29,230
Speaker 1: I watched a bunch of animes, but I will talk about Space Symphony my tell, right?

175
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,712
Speaker 1: I watched the whole thing and Really?

176
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:34,534
Speaker 1: It's it's.

177
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,785
Speaker 1: it's kind of nice because it's modern animation and pretty good production quality.

178
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,068
Speaker 0: There's a big butt hanging here.

179
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:44,442
Speaker 0: What you said like it's nice and there's a it's.

180
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:50,482
Speaker 1: it's supposed to be a prequel to Galaxy Express 39 and literal prequel or Matsumoto Ian freak.

181
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:50,943
Speaker 1: No, it's.

182
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,870
Speaker 1: it's actually to the TV series.

183
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,741
Speaker 1: It's or the first movie you could.

184
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,889
Speaker 1: it's an actual prequel and it makes sense.

185
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:05,437
Speaker 1: The thing is is the first part of the show itself Isn't really consistent with itself.

186
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:07,242
Speaker 1: It's like what the hell is going on.

187
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,165
Speaker 1: It's like one second.

188
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:15,289
Speaker 1: It'll be like, you know Andromeda will be you know cool and then the next she'll be a bitch and then she'll be cool again and then a bitch.

189
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,958
Speaker 1: and It's like what is going on.

190
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:21,165
Speaker 1: and it's like it's clones, but then it's not close but then it's the real one but it's not the real one.

191
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,930
Speaker 0: and then it's like Could that is that really continuity or just characters being all over the place?

192
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,690
Speaker 1: It's just the characters of a. it's like the first part of the show.

193
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,476
Speaker 0: It's not so it's not continuity.

194
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,604
Speaker 0: Like the backstory was this.

195
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:33,928
Speaker 0: now, it's this.

196
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:39,870
Speaker 1: no It's like the just the show is all over the place for the first few episodes and then they eventually sort of get in line.

197
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:45,736
Speaker 1: And this day it's like, okay now we've got here's the actual thing Yeah, and then it stays can?

198
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:51,775
Speaker 1: it's like it like it fluctuates crazily and you're watching like the first handful episodes You're like just what what.

199
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,079
Speaker 1: I thought that she what.

200
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,250
Speaker 1: and then after a few episodes finally it settles down.

201
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,002
Speaker 0: It's like ah, well, I've been.

202
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:03,004
Speaker 0: I got to start up again But I was watching giant to robo with some people who haven't seen it.

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,076
Speaker 0: So since we weren't at Otacon.

307
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,869
Speaker 0: But the things I always miss from Otacon like if I if well I guess always that this is the first look at

308
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,418
Speaker 1: the first thing you've ever missed from

309
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:51,699
Speaker 0: first

310
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,288
Speaker 1: Oh to kind of everything you miss the most not being there is

311
00:15:54,348 --> 00:16:01,275
Speaker 0: the the art show because not people don't That often take pictures of all the art in the art show because you're not supposed to.

312
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,062
Speaker 0: So the other thing I always miss is the opening animation and sure enough It's not.

313
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:08,048
Speaker 0: there's no way to see it.

314
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:20,580
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell I couldn't find any bootleg Like cam cap of it or anything, but I did fine randomly I wish I realized this was here the opening animation to last year's Otacon Otacon 2009.

315
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 1: It looks like I was under the impression that there was some rights issues and they couldn't put it out.

316
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,044
Speaker 0: So it looks like they could.

317
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:30,506
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell looks like this was put out by Otacon and they couldn't put out 2008 and 2010 but 2009 has very few in literally put out by Otacon.

318
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,442
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

319
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,708
Speaker 1: that's pretty sure.

320
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,200
Speaker 1: you sure that's an official Otacon YouTube channel.

321
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,536
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure but I don't know it was linked to by an Otacon staffer in the forum.

322
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:50,714
Speaker 0: not this video But this channel, okay, so that's good enough for me but this is the Otacon 2009 opening animation.

323
00:16:50,734 --> 00:17:02,719
Speaker 0: in case you didn't see it and I really want all their anime cons to do this because the Daikon animation in this whole imagine of Otacon They showed the Daikon animation and then showed,

324
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:09,121
Speaker 1: you know The thing is, you know Otacon is basically using its its partnerships with Japanese animation studios to make What

325
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,060
Speaker 0: if they just got some fans every year to make one?

326
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,019
Speaker 1: What if they made it at the convention and showed it when the convention was over?

327
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,151
Speaker 0: Do you know how fucking impossible that would be?

328
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,720
Speaker 1: It could be like 30 second animation.

329
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,911
Speaker 0: Do you know how fucking impossible that would be?

330
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:20,554
Speaker 1: It could do it.

331
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:29,454
Speaker 1: It takes a while to animate especially if you had guys like, you know with skills like the We're gonna have enough trouble editing our thing for PAX together by Saturday night.

332
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:30,958
Speaker 1: Some professionals are gonna do it.

333
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,279
Speaker 0: Yes Okay, anyway and also, you know, I have two things of the day two links here because that's cool.

334
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:39,887
Speaker 0: But here's a video.

335
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,715
Speaker 0: Uh, it is on the internet.

336
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,439
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna link to it.

337
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:48,030
Speaker 0: It is video from the concert of Suguzo and Yoshiki.

338
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,080
Speaker 1: The concert where there are absolutely no cameras or recording.

339
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,602
Speaker 1: You know what?

340
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,816
Speaker 0: There are a million freaking videos from Otacon 2010's concerts.

341
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:03,640
Speaker 0: So if you missed the concert if you missed Otacon you can go see the concerts on YouTube even the Yoshita brothers one.

342
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:05,387
Speaker 0: I didn't actually look for that one.

343
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:08,420
Speaker 0: I just looked for the ex-japan one because that's the one I was interested in.

344
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,344
Speaker 1: I'm interested in the other one.

345
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,671
Speaker 0: I've got your shita brother.

346
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:11,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll see.

347
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,021
Speaker 0: I'll look right now It's not.

348
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:13,342
Speaker 1: I'm sure.

349
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:16,050
Speaker 1: there's plenty of your shita brothers period all over YouTube.

350
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,297
Speaker 1: So even if the Otacon one is not there.

351
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,696
Speaker 0: Yeah panel panel.

352
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, here it is Q&A performance.

353
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:24,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like it's here.

354
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,814
Speaker 1: All right, at least enough of it's there.

355
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:27,216
Speaker 1: Yeah.

356
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,686
Speaker 0: Yeah So the meta moment.

00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:31,669
Speaker 1: Are we roboting yet?

358
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,251
Speaker 0: No.

00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:35,160
Speaker 1: Okay, Gen Con starts tomorrow.

360
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:39,053
Speaker 1: Oh crap, you should go and see Luke and Jared there.

361
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,478
Speaker 0: Yes, we will not be there.

362
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,918
Speaker 1: In Indiana I'm trying to cover the non New York things.

363
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,175
Speaker 1: Mozilla drumbeat is this Saturday in New York.

364
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:46,659
Speaker 0: In New York?

365
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's see.

366
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,071
Speaker 0: So you didn't make a list ahead of time.

367
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:53,038
Speaker 1: PAX is I'm looking at my Google Calendar.

368
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:53,520
Speaker 1: It's my list.

369
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,298
Speaker 0: We're gonna be there doing crazy shit.

370
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,787
Speaker 1: Recess is the weekend after that.

371
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:11,416
Speaker 1: Maker Faire is two weeks after that And then at 10 10 10 that weekend is is the burning con but also the New York Comic Con and also the New York anime festival and also nerd NYC board game night.

372
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:15,780
Speaker 0: Next week There may or may not be shows because I'm gonna be out of town at our annual writers retreat.

373
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,587
Speaker 0: Scott will not be at the writers retreat.

374
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,394
Speaker 0: So yeah, we'll see how much I write.

375
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,020
Speaker 1: and then magfest is next year.

376
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,605
Speaker 0: Whoo, magfest.

377
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,654
Speaker 1: I don't I don't believe we should ever.

378
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,740
Speaker 1: everyone has balls of Steve balls.

379
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,391
Speaker 0: We should never say woo in regards to magfest.

380
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,579
Speaker 0: There's only one appropriate response and that is hot.

381
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,260
Speaker 0: And like I said, we're upgrading the studio equipment.

382
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:49,462
Speaker 0: so give it a week or two and we're gonna start bringing a lot more guests on the show because I'll basically Quarter the time it takes to edit and like do post-production on guest shows Mm-hmm.

383
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,152
Speaker 0: So we're up in the ante there quite a bit.

384
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:52,834
Speaker 1: All righty.

385
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:58,013
Speaker 0: All right, so Thursday Scott Pilgrim opens for me next Thursday.

386
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,520
Speaker 0: Scott Pilgrim opens for everyone else.

387
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:04,260
Speaker 0: So I figure we should do a final thoughts on the comic because it's one of the great comics we've read in recent.

388
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,725
Speaker 1: You know, that was my show idea.

389
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:07,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was not your show idea.

390
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:12,830
Speaker 0: It's a geek night show idea which shared responsibility Only comic that we had both read recently.

391
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is the reason that is the show.

392
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:20,479
Speaker 0: I can't believe you didn't even read awesome thoughts because we've already done a show.

393
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,887
Speaker 0: All right, here's the before we get to spinal thoughts and spoilers.

394
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:23,870
Speaker 0: Here's the review.

395
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,787
Speaker 0: if you were between the ages of 17 and 31 I know.

396
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,020
Speaker 1: the thing is I've got like 40 year old people who are reading it and digging it.

397
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,771
Speaker 1: It's sort of weird like okay.

398
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,100
Speaker 1: Let's discuss this whole issue, right?

399
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:41,540
Speaker 1: I was sort of under the the opinion that like, okay There's only certain people who will get this, you know.

400
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,625
Speaker 1: And and like if you're too young or too old you just is not incomprehensible and to an extent that's true My grandma would never get it.

401
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,814
Speaker 1: My mom probably wouldn't even really get it.

402
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,240
Speaker 0: But yet Emily's parents love it.

403
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like, okay It's not really you know, this there's no like.

404
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,840
Speaker 1: there is definitely a subset of people who will get it.

405
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:21,560
Speaker 1: Doesn't have a universal appeal of something like Star Wars where everyone gets it, you know, it definitely is limited but It is also broader than you would suspect like a lot of people are suspect, you know, it's would think Oh, this is only for like, you know 20 to 30 year olds who play grew up with any S's and no one else is gonna even understand anything.

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:32,540
Speaker 0: I think that's not sure who is really for is there's a kind of specific Culture and upbringing that together can create the kind of person who will appreciate Scott Pilgrim.

407
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely think even though some like Emily's parents might enjoy it There's no doubt that they view it differently than we view it They have to.

408
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:44,522
Speaker 0: but at the same time I would argue that the core message of Scott Pilgrim is Timeless.

409
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:53,292
Speaker 0: for anyone who had those experiences and the video game II all that Timeless message, but it's presented in a non timeless manner.

410
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:55,922
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the core message I think comes through no matter what.

411
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:02,264
Speaker 0: so I think really anyone who is astute and Had those experiences Appreciated Scott Pilgrim.

412
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:11,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I have a feeling that unlike say a will Eisner or you know Carl Barks or You know a Tezuka, right?

413
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,799
Speaker 1: This is not a timeless work like a hundred years from now.

414
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:18,261
Speaker 1: Most people are probably gonna read it and go what the fuck, you know It's.

415
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:24,300
Speaker 1: it's not the kind of thing that people will be able to read a long time from now and it'll still work.

416
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:33,626
Speaker 0: Well, what'll be interesting is to go go back you know 50 years from now and see what else did Brian Lee O'Malley do and Will Scott Pilgrim be like.

417
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,831
Speaker 0: this is where it all began.

418
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,560
Speaker 1: Well, he's like in his mid late 30s, right?

419
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,423
Speaker 0: He's got some time.

420
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:44,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know that there is definitely, you know, it's not like 31 To be clear.

421
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,592
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't realize he's done other stuff.

422
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:47,335
Speaker 1: Yeah.

423
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,078
Speaker 1: What was that other thing?

424
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,727
Speaker 1: He did The one with the sad girl on the cover.

425
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget the name of it sad girl in snow.

426
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:54,376
Speaker 0: Wait, that's Fred Gallagher person.

427
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,669
Speaker 1: No, he's a comic artist.

428
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:58,556
Speaker 1: He's done a lot of comics.

429
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:00,463
Speaker 1: Yeah More.

430
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:05,528
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, you hope he doesn't just like roll around in his movie moneys But I don't think he's that kind of guy.

431
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:07,659
Speaker 1: I've met him a couple times and you know, he's just he's.

432
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,220
Speaker 1: you know He's chill.

433
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,586
Speaker 1: He's not one of those crazy kind of.

434
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:12,820
Speaker 0: I guess the best way to review not just the comic but before we get into spoilers.

435
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,839
Speaker 0: And the final thoughts cuz I really want to get right to that and just spoiled because it.

436
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:16,849
Speaker 0: you know That's the discussion.

437
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,163
Speaker 0: We all want to have The.

438
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:28,060
Speaker 0: the whole Scott Pilgrim franchise has been handled Almost I would argue maybe better than any other similarly potential franchise has ever been handled.

439
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,800
Speaker 0: We have to see the movie see the video game to see for sure.

440
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,925
Speaker 0: but look at what happened.

441
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:37,725
Speaker 0: the comic resonated among a certain fan group like many things do and Any time there's something like that.

442
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:38,527
Speaker 0: We're nerds.

443
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:39,992
Speaker 0: We sit around and say man.

444
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,740
Speaker 0: What if they made a movie about Scott Pilgrim?

445
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,287
Speaker 1: Well, it's weird because Oni didn't really do anything like to promote it that you know They don't do for any other comic right?

446
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,780
Speaker 1: It's not like they put Scott Pilgrim like all over the fuck, right?

447
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,060
Speaker 1: They just put it out just like they put out every other Oni comic, you know.

448
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,860
Speaker 1: And I've got other Oni comics like what was that one wanton soup, right?

449
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,774
Speaker 1: They put that out and they had the same promotion as you know, Scott Pilgrim did.

450
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:09,952
Speaker 1: they never really pushed it hard They didn't you know, it was just out the same as every other comic yet.

451
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,904
Speaker 1: It sort of picked up on its own and became Crazy huge.

452
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not talking about crazy huge.

453
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,300
Speaker 0: I'm talking about more.

454
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,043
Speaker 0: So look at this.

455
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:16,706
Speaker 0: they make the comic.

456
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:22,239
Speaker 0: nerds sit around whenever there's a comic or something they like and say man Would it be awesome if they just made a sequel like this?

457
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,808
Speaker 0: What if they made the movie and got so-and-so to play?

458
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:26,394
Speaker 0: it seems like everything.

459
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:29,049
Speaker 0: nerds who were fans of this said wouldn't it be awesome?

460
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,565
Speaker 0: if is Basically what they did?

461
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:32,810
Speaker 0: what if they made a movie?

462
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should get like Michael Cera to star in it.

463
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,165
Speaker 0: Oh, they got Michael Cera.

464
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:39,440
Speaker 0: Oh, what if they made a video game and he was like, oh they made the video game.

465
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,144
Speaker 0: They made it exactly.

466
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:44,243
Speaker 1: we were saying with that that guy the the cabana battle guy We were saying he shouldn't.

467
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:49,740
Speaker 1: just you know, we were always disappointed that he basically made pirate and a cabana battle should have been a game.

468
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, why wasn't it again?

469
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,228
Speaker 0: So nerd said man.

470
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,077
Speaker 0: What if the pirate baby cabana battle guy?

471
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,160
Speaker 0: wouldn't that be crazy?

472
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,363
Speaker 0: Well, it was like.

473
00:24:57,383 --> 00:25:02,440
Speaker 1: it was like we wanted him to just make a game period and then we wanted a sky pilgrim game period.

474
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Speaker 1: And then they combined to lack of two unfulfilled potentials into one.

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,619
Speaker 1: They you know that that would be like if you know, you made a new.

476
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,693
Speaker 1: You made the New Super Metroid game, right?

477
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,180
Speaker 1: But it was also Like, you know reviving some long, you know, well, that was a terrible example.

478
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,765
Speaker 1: I didn't think of any good example.

479
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:30,100
Speaker 0: I failed so but it's every step of the way, you know nerds man the video game.

480
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,273
Speaker 0: What if they got on a Monoguchi to do the music?

481
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:32,494
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:33,520
Speaker 0: Well, they just fucking did that.

483
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,510
Speaker 1: You know, I don't like on a Monoguchi that much I do.

484
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:38,243
Speaker 1: I've seen him live a few times I don't know.

485
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:40,795
Speaker 1: I don't understand why people know I really like them.

486
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,366
Speaker 0: I don't like them live But I like their music on its own.

487
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:47,140
Speaker 1: No, I've listened to it on the youtubes a couple times and not I'm not a fan.

488
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,786
Speaker 0: It's good music for Scott pilgrim though.

489
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:51,916
Speaker 1: Probably it's alright, but it's only for the video game.

490
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:52,920
Speaker 1: They're doing the music, right?

491
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not doing the movie music Someone else's but that's kind of.

492
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,800
Speaker 0: they've taken all the things that nerds would say.

493
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,431
Speaker 0: Would it be awesome if and done the equivalent.

494
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:11,155
Speaker 1: there are some nerds out there who are like, yeah They should have done a different thing, you know I'm not arguing there aren't but the majority of the kinds of things they did like Michael Cera.

495
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:16,435
Speaker 0: getting him was like the crazy nerd Choice and the fact that they actually did it was just surprising.

496
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:21,618
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, I get the feel it's one of those things where you know, I don't I don't think it's.

497
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:24,160
Speaker 1: you know They did everything that nerds wanted perfectly.

498
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:32,326
Speaker 1: But I think it's definitely a situation where usually when a nerdy thing is adapted, especially into a movie the nerd They made the do movie.

499
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:32,849
Speaker 0: What did nerds want?

500
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,700
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, is it gonna be set on Mars?

501
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,500
Speaker 0: Is it gonna be about a space marine?

502
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:39,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't.

503
00:26:40,563 --> 00:26:47,480
Speaker 1: You know, it's these kinds of things right Pete the nerds are like, you know How much does it match the original and it in this case?

504
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:58,500
Speaker 1: They have matched the original, you know enough to where there are no like Super huge complaints like even like Watchmen movie, you know people got something to complain about or spider-man movie.

505
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,192
Speaker 1: They got something to complain about but there's organic web shooters.

506
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:03,416
Speaker 0: I mean exactly right.

507
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,921
Speaker 1: so with Scott Pilgrim It's not.

508
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:11,421
Speaker 1: nothing is perfect, but there is far proportionally less to complain about than with any other nerd Adaptation.

509
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:16,276
Speaker 0: I mean the only person who could possibly play Scott Pilgrim better than Michael Cera's probably our friend Conrad.

510
00:27:16,296 --> 00:27:22,660
Speaker 0: Oh I can think of few people that is that guy, you know, he doesn't really even movies.

511
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,226
Speaker 0: Have you seen with him in them?

512
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:24,849
Speaker 1: We saw you.

513
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,411
Speaker 1: he's there.

514
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:27,420
Speaker 1: I remember he's the arrested development kid, right?

515
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the one thing.

516
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,471
Speaker 0: so what else have you seen with him in it?

517
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,546
Speaker 1: I'm sure I know anything about him I'm sure I have but I just don't.

518
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,634
Speaker 1: you know, remember that you probably haven't.

519
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:38,942
Speaker 1: is that he's always sort of like He's?

520
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:42,958
Speaker 1: you know, Scott Pilgrim is sort of like excitable like hey, and he doesn't seem.

521
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:43,742
Speaker 1: you know He doesn't.

522
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:48,246
Speaker 1: he has all the other qualities of Scott Pilgrim except these sort of Excitable quality like you need.

523
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,920
Speaker 1: they need to give him like a caffeine injection for a few of the scenes and then it'll be alright.

524
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,409
Speaker 0: See, I think they will.

525
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,040
Speaker 0: this is actually I think a big test for him.

526
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,321
Speaker 0: They're good.

527
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,084
Speaker 0: We're gonna find out.

528
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:58,974
Speaker 0: can he alter his like milieu?

529
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:00,600
Speaker 0: Can he act differently?

530
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,200
Speaker 0: Can he pull off Scott Pilgrim or will he be Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim?

531
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,882
Speaker 1: Well other people have seen the movie already, you know No one's.

532
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:11,236
Speaker 1: that's one thing that I think they were doing really interesting with this marketing right for the movie?

533
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:15,775
Speaker 1: is the movies been done Done for a while and there's so many screenings?

534
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:31,780
Speaker 1: are so many Pre-release screenings all over the fucking place like crazy, which I think is like a genius idea You know, like why isn't everyone doing that for anything that's popular, especially for something that's so nerdy You know is gonna be passed around the Pirate Bays, right?

535
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,649
Speaker 1: Obviously, you should just get the screenings out there.

536
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,097
Speaker 1: cuz what's keeping the movie from being released.

537
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:37,760
Speaker 1: It's well.

538
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,280
Speaker 1: Why don't they put it out a day earlier?

539
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,940
Speaker 1: Well, cuz they need to get the reels of film or whatever to every movie theater at once.

540
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:43,965
Speaker 0: I screw that deal.

541
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:46,520
Speaker 1: if they got they got they definitely have one made by now.

542
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,439
Speaker 1: They have a bunch just don't have enough for every theater.

543
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,380
Speaker 1: So as they're sending them out, they're like, okay, dude, do a previews you got one in your theater.

544
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,687
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a freaking previous.

545
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:58,129
Speaker 0: I don't think that's it at all because at least in all the cities I mean digital projection is becoming the standard.

546
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:59,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even so you need to.

547
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,640
Speaker 1: they mail hard drives to every theater.

548
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they don't do it where you download it from the internet.

549
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,077
Speaker 0: They've been doing pre screenings far longer than it takes to ship the movie out to everywhere.

550
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:07,840
Speaker 0: I don't think that's it.

551
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,056
Speaker 0: I think it's more a long-term buzz building system that also it's.

552
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,100
Speaker 1: it's a it's a multiple.

553
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,871
Speaker 1: It's many birds with one stone cuz.

554
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:15,273
Speaker 0: look what else.

555
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,320
Speaker 0: serenity did that too?

556
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,492
Speaker 0: There were a fucking million screenings of serenity before it was in.

557
00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:21,620
Speaker 1: I definitely think you need to do that for nerd movies.

558
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,372
Speaker 1: Otherwise people just get their preview screenings on the internet.

559
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,257
Speaker 1: and at least when you do a preview screening in the theater You can get some monies.

560
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:33,240
Speaker 0: Now that you don't pay for these screenings unless you get someone else to pay for like the pre-screen tickets and give them away.

561
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:36,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there what do you think the people were giving away?

562
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,780
Speaker 1: the tickets are not, you know.

563
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,325
Speaker 1: There's money being changed hands.

564
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:43,279
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe the movie theater isn't just letting all these people come in for free.

565
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,289
Speaker 0: Yes What what we don't know is who is paying.

566
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:51,308
Speaker 0: we don't know if the production company is paying or if like Midtown Comics Paid for the tickets.

567
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:52,454
Speaker 0: for you know, we don't know that.

568
00:29:52,494 --> 00:29:56,630
Speaker 1: but you know what I do know Popcorn monies, they're making money as popcorn.

569
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,514
Speaker 0: notice an inception.

570
00:29:57,775 --> 00:29:58,960
Speaker 0: the other than a few fat people.

571
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,883
Speaker 0: No one bought shit.

572
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:10,186
Speaker 1: Everyone smuggled stuff in and that's just because it happens to be next to a Duane Reade that particular Lot of the multiplexes.

573
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:11,210
Speaker 1: like thing about Tinseltown.

574
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,418
Speaker 1: right Tinseltown is out in the mat Scott.

575
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:16,779
Speaker 0: It's not a Plexus it's just multiplexes that aren't in cities.

576
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:25,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at any theater and they put him out in the woods separate from everything else with a giant parking lot So that there's no drugstore right next to it.

577
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,980
Speaker 0: No, they do that because the lands cheap and people can drive that too.

578
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,687
Speaker 1: But it's also that you know, there's.

579
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,520
Speaker 1: no I don't think there was a candy store right next to the movie theater.

580
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,680
Speaker 1: But like alright fuck we're screwed.

581
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:41,900
Speaker 0: So if Duane Reade were smart, they would open Duane Reade movie editions next to every theater and sell smuggleable goods.

582
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,017
Speaker 0: They basically have that.

583
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:44,627
Speaker 1: Okay, and you just have to be smart.

584
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,159
Speaker 0: I would advertise I'd be like smuggle this shit into the theater.

585
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:58,872
Speaker 1: I'd sell flat drink containers You're not you know, you can't get drunk in a movie theater.

586
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,258
Speaker 1: that's bad they can that's not.

587
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:01,726
Speaker 0: it's not a lot You can't just know.

588
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:06,297
Speaker 0: it's not any more not allowed than Smuggling in my dorsey does?

589
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,959
Speaker 0: I don't even know what a do-si-do is drunk on the do-si-do.

590
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,560
Speaker 1: I guess if I soaked him and get a make you're gonna make a loud do-si-do ruckus and barf the do-si-dos.

591
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:16,775
Speaker 0: We don't get in in New York.

592
00:31:16,815 --> 00:31:17,460
Speaker 0: that bothers me.

593
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,705
Speaker 0: But the Texans get it the adult only theater with the fine dining and the movie at the same time Mm-hmm.

594
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:24,637
Speaker 0: Why don't we have that?

595
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,420
Speaker 1: Because the space versus money is not a good I know but I want it.

596
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,207
Speaker 0: I would be willing to pay a lot for that.

597
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,794
Speaker 1: not enough people will agree.

598
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:32,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I do.

599
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,504
Speaker 1: I mean So, you know what?

600
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,691
Speaker 1: I got a guy got one for you.

601
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,978
Speaker 1: It's right over in the other room Don't only?

602
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:47,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you pay me whatever you were gonna pay that movie theater, okay But one thing if I pay you sparks money, I expect sparks quality.

603
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:55,229
Speaker 1: I'll just go to sell this, you know You got to pay me a little plus sparks money because you get a movie too and then I'll go to sparks and keep the Profit and I'll just go to the sparks.

604
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,540
Speaker 1: I'll just about bike it back over here or take a cab.

605
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,047
Speaker 0: Yes, now my steaks cold great.

606
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,071
Speaker 1: I'll put in microwave.

607
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:02,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna be a great steak.

608
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:03,270
Speaker 1: Actually, I'd be really good.

609
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:12,648
Speaker 0: probably not No Because the point of the run of the raw steak is that it's sizzling hot and blackened on the outside and it is cool And raw on my way over there.

610
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:15,900
Speaker 1: I'll mug the Pizza Hut guy and take his little in you know insulator.

611
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:23,537
Speaker 0: Nah, all right Scott Pilgrim We're going to spoil the ever-living shit out of the common volumes one through six.

612
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:24,400
Speaker 0: Yes all of it.

613
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,624
Speaker 0: We're going to spoil it.

614
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:26,667
Speaker 0: Do not listen.

615
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,575
Speaker 1: Seriously actually no just if you're.

616
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:32,859
Speaker 1: if you if you're like Haven't read it all what the fuck?

617
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,400
Speaker 1: Seriously, go read it and then listen to this episode like right now like pause the episode and read it all and then unpause the episode.

618
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:46,216
Speaker 0: I was not surprised when Scott Pilgrim died me either but I like how they handled that.

619
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,038
Speaker 0: He's like am I dead?

620
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:51,398
Speaker 0: No Actually, yeah, you are dead and then he only came back because the extra life.

621
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:55,500
Speaker 1: Yeah No, I mean the the extra life was such a check-offs extra life.

622
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was.

623
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,829
Speaker 1: no, you know, the thing is it's.

624
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,568
Speaker 1: it's weird like I don't know if I should admit this But basically I read.

625
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:02,759
Speaker 1: I made a bit sort of a mistake.

626
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:07,260
Speaker 1: I read each volume as it came out and I never reread any volumes.

627
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 1: So I forgot many details and rears basically each volume.

628
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:23,480
Speaker 1: I was almost like starting a new and I didn't remember everything from the previous volumes and I only remembered like the most You know biggest important information and I didn't really remember a lot of the small stuff.

629
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:29,740
Speaker 1: I remember the one up but I didn't remember like a lot of other things at all like had the glow, right?

630
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:30,602
Speaker 1: glowing.

631
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:44,776
Speaker 1: and I was listening to some reviews of that other people did of the early episodes like comedy speak just did a review of the first two volumes right because they never read it at all and They noticed they actually mentioned specifically having read only volume one and two.

632
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:45,840
Speaker 1: like why is she glowing?

633
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,340
Speaker 1: And I was like, I didn't even notice it and only in volume six did the right.

634
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:59,184
Speaker 1: But if I had read them all at once again And I probably will read all six just in a row plan to read them all again Then I probably it would stand out like a sore thumb Yeah, or things like.

635
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:05,567
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people actually forgot about Simon and that whole, you know prelude Cuz I came back in a big way at the end.

636
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,975
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really remember that either.

637
00:34:08,076 --> 00:34:10,003
Speaker 0: What really know How are you gonna?

638
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:10,967
Speaker 0: What do you remember?

639
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:12,793
Speaker 0: It's like you never remember anything from stuff.

640
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:13,295
Speaker 0: We watch.

641
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:16,002
Speaker 1: I remember Scott pilgrim.

642
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,746
Speaker 1: he had banned he was going.

643
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:22,956
Speaker 0: I remember in the beginning the river city ransom where he saved came pine from Simon on the roof.

644
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,491
Speaker 0: Yeah in their backstory.

645
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:32,060
Speaker 0: Oh In the back story, yeah Remember at the end, you know what it turned out to be.

646
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:33,635
Speaker 0: He was just some nerd and it was just.

647
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:41,719
Speaker 0: you know The whole time we have all these like memories that we take is true Like that's the way it was and volume six basically said no, here's the reality.

648
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,563
Speaker 0: Here's what really happened.

649
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:49,870
Speaker 1: people just forget what happens when you read volume one like over a year before you read volume say I don't have this problem.

650
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:51,060
Speaker 1: So I had this problem.

651
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,600
Speaker 1: You know, you know, that's why I get trade paperbacks.

652
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:57,450
Speaker 1: I don't get the individual issues because you get the individual issues.

653
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,298
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you read, you know It's basically an issue a month.

654
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:09,662
Speaker 1: So by the time if it's something's five issues It's five months since you've read the first issue and you read so many comics, you know It's like.

655
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,748
Speaker 0: I will say I was wrong about the glow.

656
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:25,443
Speaker 0: all through this all through the whole series until the end when you find out what all that was about I Thought that the glow kind of symbolized going back to the real world and I thought this was all gonna be some sort of weird World.

657
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:26,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean that's sort of.

658
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:32,978
Speaker 0: we're poisoned with that right from seeing too many things where anytime, you know dog I heard you like to dream so I put a dream in your.

659
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,273
Speaker 1: yeah I don't want to spoil like ten things right now, but there are a lot of.

660
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,760
Speaker 0: we can spoil whatever we want.

661
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,948
Speaker 1: You want to spoil I go Tana?

662
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,743
Speaker 1: Yeah Go big.

663
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:42,988
Speaker 1: Oh, there's something to go.

664
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:52,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's so many things that we've watched especially animes Where there's a world where crazy shit that magic happens and then at the very end of the show It's actually.

665
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:53,688
Speaker 1: no it's actually not.

666
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,305
Speaker 1: you thought it was a fantasy world this whole time, but you know, it's not a fantasy world It's a real world.

667
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:00,162
Speaker 1: and here's a real explanation for all that shit you saw.

668
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:03,137
Speaker 1: that was that looked like fantasy, but guess what is not fantasy?

669
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:10,027
Speaker 1: and So of course reading Scott Pilgrim when you've got people going like through dimensions to deliver Amazon I've already combined is a bird not Kim pine.

670
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:13,299
Speaker 0: when when she disappeared Ramona all I thought was she's in the real world.

671
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:20,020
Speaker 1: now Yeah, you know stuff like that, you know anytime magical shit happens like okay that one up actually just came out of nowhere.

672
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,380
Speaker 1: Okay, the skateboard proficiency thing, you know, it's like, okay, you know, there's obviously crazy magical shit.

673
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:28,740
Speaker 1: There's obviously some sort of real-world explanation for this.

674
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,253
Speaker 1: It's not actually for reals that no it's actually is.

675
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,920
Speaker 1: they live in some sort of magical world.

676
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,688
Speaker 1: That's that's what Scott pilgrims about.

677
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:41,039
Speaker 1: they let you know, it it looks a lot like the real world But it actually has video game fights in it.

678
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,365
Speaker 1: well one kind of place.

679
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:49,360
Speaker 0: one way to interpret all that though would be to interpret this, you know as That is the way the world is seen by the characters.

680
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,587
Speaker 0: I mean look at the otaku in the van in Dora their whole thing about how they see the world and like the way the World is through their eyes.

681
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,680
Speaker 0: You could argue the scout pilgrims the same way.

682
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,443
Speaker 0: I mean look at us.

683
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,352
Speaker 0: I think about the world in those terms.

684
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:02,960
Speaker 0: That guy's got an 18 charisma.

685
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:07,129
Speaker 1: The thing is I think it's got pilgrim.

686
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:10,580
Speaker 1: it definitely story wise like I think those things do literally happen.

687
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:20,276
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean that they are also, you know, not a metaphor for you know Exactly and that is why utenna and big O and all these things are so good.

688
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:21,560
Speaker 1: It's like just something litter.

689
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,359
Speaker 1: It's like people think that just because like, you know, something has to not actually happen for it to be a metaphor.

690
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,840
Speaker 0: somehow They're like, oh, is it a is it a cigar or it is a car?

691
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,502
Speaker 0: Is it a cock?

692
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,331
Speaker 0: and you know what it could be both?

693
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:35,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have to be an illusion.

694
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,586
Speaker 0: There's cigar shaped cock.

695
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,640
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be an illusion of a cigar on top of a cock.

696
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,172
Speaker 1: It can actually just be an actual cigar that someone actually smoked.

697
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,999
Speaker 1: and it's still a metaphor for a second.

698
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:47,068
Speaker 0: the car And this is why Scott pilgrim is.

699
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,146
Speaker 0: I think it's not one of the greatest comics of all time But I would argue it's a great comic.

700
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,716
Speaker 0: I'm not great in the you know, it is great sense.

701
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:54,620
Speaker 0: Not just oh, it was great.

702
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'm not.

703
00:37:56,525 --> 00:38:02,040
Speaker 0: it is self-consistent on both the direct level and the metaphorical level.

704
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but obviously this was intentional.

705
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:07,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other things I like about it is it's it's sort of a penny arcade situation, right?

706
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,208
Speaker 1: You get to see Brian the O'Malley improve his skills.

707
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,192
Speaker 0: Yes, Deb.

708
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,560
Speaker 0: I flipped through Scott pilgrim one again, and I like it.

709
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,055
Speaker 0: It's still one of my favorite volumes, but the art looks way different in six.

710
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:20,326
Speaker 1: Yeah compare the early penny You know, I always how.

711
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:29,120
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was on purpose or not But at least at some point he figured out notice in the end how he showed you all the different ways He's drawn Ramona through the whole series and how he made that matter.

712
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if he intended that going in or if he just sucked it dry.

713
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:33,954
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

714
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:35,338
Speaker 1: You know, it was exactly.

715
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:35,840
Speaker 0: it's clever.

716
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:37,191
Speaker 0: So it wins exactly.

717
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:37,877
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

718
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:42,300
Speaker 0: I mean Your highness is like a golden ray.

719
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,637
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't think anyone will get that.

720
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:55,840
Speaker 1: no Yeah You know, it's got pilgrim.

721
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:04,069
Speaker 1: I mean if I had to put it on like a chart of like comics like it wouldn't be anywhere near like an Eisner Or a Tezuka or even a black said right?

722
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:07,038
Speaker 1: It's down below all those guys, but it's above.

723
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,404
Speaker 1: like Spider-man.

724
00:39:08,424 --> 00:39:10,474
Speaker 1: you read every week way above that.

725
00:39:10,494 --> 00:39:11,639
Speaker 0: It's not saying that much.

726
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:16,220
Speaker 0: It's above a lot of the you know, what it's above a lot of the like good manga I've read.

727
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

728
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:18,287
Speaker 1: it's like you got urasawa.

729
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,933
Speaker 1: It's like one step under urasawa.

730
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:20,776
Speaker 1: Yeah pilgrim.

731
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:21,719
Speaker 1: It's like that's where he is.

732
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,465
Speaker 0: I put him in the same class.

733
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:27,517
Speaker 0: Like if urasawa is a b-plus then scout pilgrim is a.

734
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:28,400
Speaker 1: you know, it's just as good.

735
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,113
Speaker 1: It's equal to like yotsuba and I was among a dial.

736
00:39:31,153 --> 00:39:32,700
Speaker 0: That's that's a level of enjoyment.

737
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:35,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's similar of I leave.

738
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,598
Speaker 0: they both speak to me on the same level.

739
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:48,379
Speaker 1: Of course yotsuba does not have the metaphor and the Right, you look at Scott pilgrim and there's some people who've actually been saying stupid shit Like Scott pilgrim is slice of life and it's like what the hell's wrong with you.

740
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:50,327
Speaker 1: See yotsuba is slice of life, right?

741
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:59,720
Speaker 1: You look at it and it's like yotsuba goes to the farm Yotsuba goes to the florist yotsuba rides a bicycle, you know, it's like there isn't a big story of yotsuba.

742
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,460
Speaker 1: There is no, you know epic tale where she's gonna get deported back to where the you know tropical island She came from or anything like that.

743
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,246
Speaker 1: It's just slices of life.

744
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,615
Speaker 1: They're all totally separate and it's just here's.

745
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:11,880
Speaker 1: they're doing this and here's a dude.

746
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,403
Speaker 1: I was among it.

747
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,227
Speaker 1: I was the same way.

748
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,760
Speaker 1: We're in high school and we're going on vacation.

749
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:17,367
Speaker 1: We're driving in a car.

750
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:20,540
Speaker 1: We're fighting over a pillow, you know, it's just random life stuff.

751
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,718
Speaker 1: It doesn't really have any over plot to it.

752
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:27,160
Speaker 1: Scott pilgrim has moments of slice of life that are slices, you know.

753
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,280
Speaker 1: But those moments are all to introduce you to the characters or to the plot.

754
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,932
Speaker 0: Yes to say that this slice of life is stupid.

755
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:33,374
Speaker 0: That's just.

756
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,660
Speaker 0: that's still like make these broad.

757
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,572
Speaker 1: We have bacon therefore everything does not suck.

758
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,380
Speaker 0: that is like my third favorite moment in the entire series.

759
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,906
Speaker 1: Right, that is a slice of life.

760
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:43,729
Speaker 1: is we're just chillin.

761
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,476
Speaker 1: Well now that was bacon breakfast.

762
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:46,540
Speaker 0: That was a slice of bacon?

763
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,780
Speaker 1: Yes, it but it is a slice nonetheless.

764
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,116
Speaker 1: but the there the whole book is not just slices of eating bacon.

765
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:56,429
Speaker 1: the whole book is Fighting seven evil eggs boyfriends.

766
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,399
Speaker 1: and there's a. you know, there's actual acts with.

767
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:02,019
Speaker 1: you know A climax and a dental mall and you know is a story.

768
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:08,060
Speaker 1: Yotsuba doesn't really have that, you know, it's a anything that's a slice of life is just there's no acts.

769
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:11,519
Speaker 1: I mean maybe each individual slice might sort of have an act.

770
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,167
Speaker 0: It's stupid to call a slice of life.

771
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:16,200
Speaker 0: It kind of it removes the usefulness of the term slice of life.

772
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are just they don't know what they're saying.

773
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:21,339
Speaker 0: size of that life is a code for something Yotsuba or something that sucks.

774
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,359
Speaker 1: There are slices of life that do not say there.

775
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:30,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the other thing is a lot of people get confused between like slice of life and autobiography.

776
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:34,973
Speaker 1: It's like look you can have an Autographical slice and autobiography isn't a slice of life.

777
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,283
Speaker 0: It's the whole life chunk of life Or chunks.

778
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:42,196
Speaker 1: I don't know chunks of you could have a slice of like life.

779
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:43,240
Speaker 1: that is autobiographical.

780
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:49,084
Speaker 1: If someone just tells you slices of their life, but doesn't tell you the whole life then it is, you know there's both.

781
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,656
Speaker 0: I guess it could be the whole life.

782
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:56,276
Speaker 0: if Nothing fucking happens to the dude then why would anyone read his autobiography?

783
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:56,758
Speaker 1: So lame?

784
00:41:56,778 --> 00:42:03,927
Speaker 0: Yeah Ah Scott Pilger, I don't know.

785
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,251
Speaker 0: I really like Kim Pine.

786
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:05,773
Speaker 0: Kim Pine.

787
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:06,817
Speaker 1: Everyone likes Kim Pine.

788
00:42:06,837 --> 00:42:07,600
Speaker 1: Kim Pine is number one.

789
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:09,327
Speaker 1: Yes, everyone else is number ten.

790
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:11,395
Speaker 0: I also really like Knives Chow.

791
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 1: I don't really like Knives Chow.

792
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:18,105
Speaker 0: I really like Knives Chow for a lot of reasons especially in the end.

793
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:25,260
Speaker 0: I kind of like how the last volume like everything shifted and She kind of got her act together and I like how they had the closure in their moment.

794
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:28,679
Speaker 1: That's one thing that I like is how every there's no one, you know.

795
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:32,796
Speaker 1: Sometimes in the end of something it's like there's people who are still stupid, right?

796
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:37,974
Speaker 1: But in this Everyone is no longer stupid except Gideon, but he's not.

797
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:39,299
Speaker 1: he's not really stupid.

798
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:39,680
Speaker 0: He's dead.

799
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:48,731
Speaker 1: So yeah, I mean he's you know, he wasn't really you know, he was misguided and evil Yeah, but he wasn't you know stupid or he didn't have.

800
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:49,553
Speaker 1: he had a shit together.

801
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,740
Speaker 1: He just had a bad a bad goal.

802
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,698
Speaker 1: He was you know mean and bad.

803
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:56,788
Speaker 1: He was a bad dude, but he wasn't.

804
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:59,000
Speaker 1: he wasn't like a. he wasn't an incompetent bad dude.

805
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,225
Speaker 1: He was a malicious bad dude.

806
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:00,586
Speaker 1: He knew what he.

807
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:02,935
Speaker 1: we know what he doing more of an Accio.

808
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:07,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like he's not You're not like, you know sitting there going.

809
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,308
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

810
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:10,976
Speaker 1: I wish Gideon would turn good and or anything.

811
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:19,374
Speaker 0: You're like, oh man I wish Gideon would get the shit kicked out of it, right, but everyone else I love the scene at the end where he's like.

812
00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:20,960
Speaker 0: were you watching me through the cat?

813
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,723
Speaker 0: Are you the cat?

814
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:23,871
Speaker 0: and he's like, no, I wasn't the cat.

815
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:29,504
Speaker 0: what you named the cat Gideon and Ronas like shut up Characters that you like.

816
00:43:29,544 --> 00:43:34,440
Speaker 1: that were good people, but they had flaws and then they mostly all fixed themselves.

817
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:46,400
Speaker 1: You know when someone stays stupid It's just like you ever watch those the comedy movies like like dumb and dumber types Someone who's just so dumb and they stay dumb.

818
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,120
Speaker 1: It's just like I guess when I was in like a teenager.

819
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,980
Speaker 1: That was funny because it was just so poo poo poo puma, but nowadays it's like you seeing as someone's so stupid.

820
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,783
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god.

821
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:56,445

Speaker 1: He's so stupid any Scott Pergam.

826
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,460
Speaker 1: It's like you got these likable people that are only a little stupid.

827
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,945
Speaker 1: So you don't have that that feeling.

828
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,250
Speaker 1: but it's like get your shit together.

829
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,880
Speaker 0: Well, everyone gets their their badminton moment.

830
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:09,422
Speaker 0: That's right.

831
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,047
Speaker 0: bad badminton scene is distributed.

832
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,173
Speaker 0: I mean the the way they handle envy.

833
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:15,199
Speaker 0: I really like her character in the end.

834
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:20,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, like seeing how it all turned out and that I don't know that whole scene was pretty cool in the club.

835
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:22,002
Speaker 0: cuz I like How everyone else.

836
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,528
Speaker 1: just the club was pretty much that was.

837
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:24,090
Speaker 1: that was it.

838
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like everybody up in the club.

839
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,193
Speaker 1: Yes Awesome, even Wallace is up in the club.

840
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,360
Speaker 0: course Wallace was up in the club.

841
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,323
Speaker 0: Well, this is a man.

842
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:33,008
Speaker 1: Wallace is probably number two after Kim pine.

843
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:33,209
Speaker 1: Yeah.

844
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,155
Speaker 1: Well, it's like she's way down.

845
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:39,060
Speaker 0: She's like number three hundred.

846
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:40,483
Speaker 0: She's down.

847
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,045
Speaker 0: She's up there.

848
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:42,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

849
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:43,658
Speaker 1: I don't know why your knives chuffing.

850
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,140
Speaker 0: I don't know.

851
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,702
Speaker 0: I just I am.

852
00:44:45,003 --> 00:44:45,666
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of.

853
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:48,737
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll take I'll take frickin like young meal over knives chow.

854
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:49,320
Speaker 1: Really?

855
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think my order would be it'd be a race.

856
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:56,510
Speaker 1: Why are we like ranking the characters?

857
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,220
Speaker 1: because we don't do that for like other stuff, right?

858
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,132
Speaker 0: We did for shows we really really liked in the past.

859
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:03,056
Speaker 0: I can do ten.

860
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,020
Speaker 0: Oh, we did the same shit.

861
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,479
Speaker 0: I think it's just that a toga was fucking show.

862
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:12,400
Speaker 1: Show really is about this cast of characters and there's so many supporting characters and they're all awesome.

863
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:17,780
Speaker 1: So it's like you're just so you end up caring about some of these supporting characters because they're so good.

864
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:42,899
Speaker 0: I think part of the reason we care about him too is that while a lot of them are kind of one-dimensional or they're not super characterized their interactions with each other and with Scott and with the other and with the other characters like the main characters We're very realistic in terms of that world like take their conversations and replace the proper nouns with your own groups inside joke proper nouns and that's Exactly how the front row crew interacts most of the time.

865
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:43,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean.

866
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:48,519
Speaker 1: and the other thing is you look at Scott Pilgrim himself and it's like what does he really?

867
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,740
Speaker 1: Do so much, you know, it's like a lot of times.

868
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:59,070
Speaker 1: He's just basically You know like the bouncing off Target for every supporting character cuz he hadn't found his own.

869
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,800
Speaker 0: all the other characters had found their own or seeking their own.

870
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,747
Speaker 0: He was not seeking or so.

871
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:10,933
Speaker 1: It's like you're really looking at all these supporting people, you know Scott pilgrim is the one who's always got the camera on and most of the time.

872
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:22,220
Speaker 1: but you're really looking at all these supporting characters Bouncing off of him constantly, you know What you end up caring about them a lot because they are like, you know The the plot arcs are them and you know Nana did that too.

873
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,960
Speaker 0: We liked both Nana's and if time went on one Nana never fucking did anything and the other Nana was doing stuff.

874
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,460
Speaker 0: So eventually you're kind of like watching all these characters and you're kind of leaving the one character behind.

875
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:41,565
Speaker 0: Scott pilgrim had to come of age and you know all the metaphors that are obvious and Scott pilgrim Yes, many obvious things.

876
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's I guess that's one negative thing you could say about it is it's not really subtle.

877
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,666
Speaker 1: It's so it's just obvious.

878
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:50,453
Speaker 0: but it's it's while it's not subtle.

879
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:51,075
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

880
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,420
Speaker 0: it isn't just coming of age.

881
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:58,880
Speaker 0: it really gets into the nature of Relationships in that not for everybody not every culture goes through this.

882
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:04,878
Speaker 0: I think many people in the previous generation never had the same kind of scope of life, especially in the 20s to 30s.

883
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,705
Speaker 0: I mean look at all these people.

884
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:25,868
Speaker 0: they're a lot like us, you know, you have your awesome life or you're kicking ass You're the high school, you know nerd running around and then you get to college you live this nerd life in college and then you're in the real world and You still have like like your last set of relationships were the college nerd life And you haven't moved on to anything past that.

885
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,964
Speaker 0: and I think a lot of people have had relationships that went Very similarly.

886
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,820
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people have the issue of I like every girl.

887
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,295
Speaker 0: I mean that was Gideon's problem in the end He liked every girl and he never gave up on any one of them.

888
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:37,738
Speaker 0: and you know what?

889
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,109
Speaker 0: Scott pilgrim had the same problem.

890
00:47:40,753 --> 00:47:44,371
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly Straight up except Scott program had a much.

891
00:47:44,813 --> 00:47:48,074
Speaker 1: Well, not that difficult the time I mean, he just walked out to Ramona's like hey want to go.

892
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:54,800
Speaker 0: I was like, okay Yeah But even then he's still like he had feelings for all these other people and there was no closure with any of those people.

893
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,184
Speaker 0: That's the dangerous combination.

894
00:47:56,525 --> 00:48:05,603
Speaker 0: He had no closure with with people like knives or envy or even Kim and Simultaneously, he had no closure with his current relationship Mm-hmm.

895
00:48:05,764 --> 00:48:08,640
Speaker 0: Nothing was done and everything was a loose thread.

896
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:11,167
Speaker 0: Gideon wanted every thread to be his forever.

897
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:13,413
Speaker 0: Scott pilgrim tied all the threads up.

898
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:15,078
Speaker 0: Yep, and totally made.

899
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:18,350
Speaker 0: actually May notice how he made out with almost everyone.

900
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's why he's awesome.

901
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's.

902
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,596
Speaker 0: I think that's a good way to get closure.

903
00:48:22,656 --> 00:48:26,813
Speaker 1: to be honest You know, you didn't actually see Gideon actually making out with that with anybody.

904
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:33,749
Speaker 0: really no, but you know, yeah He was kind of a dick we got anything else to.

905
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,660
Speaker 1: uh, oh one other thing is a lot of people, right?

906
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,416
Speaker 1: They got to shut up as they're like, oh man, this comic is about these hipsters.

907
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,084
Speaker 1: Look these kids They're not hipsters.

908
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,370
Speaker 1: These are not hipsters.

909
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,836
Speaker 1: You do not know if you think that this is.

910
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:45,600
Speaker 1: those are hipsters.

911
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:48,865
Speaker 0: Those are Basically very.

912
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:49,988
Speaker 0: they're in the same like.

913
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:56,688
Speaker 0: they're on the Venn diagram with like the front row crew and like you listeners that is like Nerd 20 to 30 something.

914
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not hipsters.

915
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:06,020
Speaker 1: if you don't know what hipsters are Go to like, you know, Google image search and look for hipster and there's a no just go to Park Slope.

916
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:11,267
Speaker 1: No Park Slope has got lots of Jews Also a lot of hipster rich people.

917
00:49:11,287 --> 00:49:13,735
Speaker 0: All right cross the Williamsburg Bridge.

918
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:17,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll see on a Friday Saturday.

919
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:19,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the thing is.

920
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:22,000
Speaker 1: the problem I think is this term hipster is being thrown around a lot.

921
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,095
Speaker 1: But a lot of people they don't you know hipsters live in cities.

922
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:26,100
Speaker 1: They don't really live anywhere else.

923
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:34,012
Speaker 1: so a lot of people who don't most people don't ever actually see hipsters ever and So they don't even know what hipster means.

924
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:35,220
Speaker 1: because you don't really see hipsters.

925
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,596
Speaker 1: I guess like, you know in popular culture, you know, like movies all that much.

926
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:40,820
Speaker 1: What's a movie with hipsters in it?

927
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,130
Speaker 0: There's a ton of hipster movies, but they're all.

928
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:44,074
Speaker 1: yeah, you don't see them in.

929
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,677
Speaker 1: like, you know major movies Really, you know that are in the movie theater.

930
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,025
Speaker 1: Inception didn't have any hipsters in it.

931
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:53,640
Speaker 1: No, it didn't, you know, so it's like, you know, Scott Pilgrim doesn't have any in it.

932
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,311
Speaker 1: So it's people don't really know what hipster is.

933
00:49:56,331 --> 00:49:58,620
Speaker 1: They just start calling hipsters to something.

934
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,257
Speaker 1: They see that they think oh that must be hipster.

935
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,286
Speaker 0: All right I mean basically the characters in Scott Pilgrim.

936
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:05,819
Speaker 0: I'd qualify them as nerd or geek kind of hip not hip stir.

937
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:08,259
Speaker 1: It is cuz someone's hip doesn't make you a hip stir.

938
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, a hip stir.

939
00:50:09,826 --> 00:50:14,786
Speaker 1: wears tight-ass jeans rides a bicycle That's you know got no brakes on it.

940
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:17,616
Speaker 0: drinks the pabs blue ribbon drinks a paps blue ribbon.

941
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:18,920
Speaker 0: works a job.

942
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,111
Speaker 0: That's dead end, but they don't care.

943
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:23,680
Speaker 0: because they make enough money They want or they are their trust fund.

944
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,456
Speaker 1: They got a trust fund and they sit around like playing, you know video poker and you know what also.

945
00:50:28,918 --> 00:50:29,640
Speaker 0: this is an aside.

946
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:31,100
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with hipsters.

947
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:38,530
Speaker 0: I think the reason people are so threatened by hipsters and I see like talking to co-workers and people I get I figured it out They see a hipster.

948
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:39,578
Speaker 0: forget the trust fund.

949
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:44,119
Speaker 0: hipsters An actual hipster actual normal non trust fund hipster.

950
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,593
Speaker 0: All right, they have decided to issue some long-term corporate career.

951
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:50,760
Speaker 0: They're working at like Starbucks.

952
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:54,159
Speaker 0: All right, they're making enough money for rent and fun.

953
00:50:54,461 --> 00:50:57,979
Speaker 0: They got like five roommates and they've decided rent and fun is gonna be their whole life.

954
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,892
Speaker 0: Mmm, is there anything wrong with that?

955
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:02,600
Speaker 0: Anyone who hates that is jealous of that?

956
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,933
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing is the vast majority of them are the trust fund kind.

957
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:06,857
Speaker 1: There's almost none.

958
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,946
Speaker 0: that are the No, I think there's.

959
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:14,253
Speaker 1: I think it's about 50/50 I think I think you I think you are greatly Underestimating the number of people with trust funds.

960
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:22,260
Speaker 1: I've seen multiple Companies is actually a hot market of making things to help parents manage the trust funds because there are lots of them.

961
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:23,908
Speaker 0: No, so I think here's what's going on.

962
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:26,400
Speaker 0: I still think the majority of hipsters are non trust fund directly.

963
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:36,256
Speaker 0: However, I think every like core of hipsters like six hipsters living in one apartment I think one of them is the nucleus with the trust fund and the others are sponges.

964
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:37,702
Speaker 1: Oh, you're greatly I like.

965
00:51:37,823 --> 00:51:39,491
Speaker 1: I know for a fact that they like.

966
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:43,246
Speaker 1: the number of trust funds is Number of hipsters.

967
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,314
Speaker 0: There's so many I think they really are.

968
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:46,860
Speaker 1: No, it's that's what I'm saying.

969
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:49,250
Speaker 1: It's pretty close.

970
00:51:49,432 --> 00:51:50,911
Speaker 1: a lot of these kids They're just.

971
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:56,257
Speaker 1: you know Even if they don't have a trust fund they see their parents pay their rent and then all their stuff they.

972
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:59,100
Speaker 1: so they just bum Around but they don't live with their parents.

973
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,088
Speaker 0: So even with the trust fund what's better?

974
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:08,700
Speaker 0: the guy whose parents pays for him who lives the hipster life Or the guy who parents pay for him who eats bologna and white bread and plays video?

975
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:10,749
Speaker 1: Those are both, you know bad.

976
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should have your own monies.

977
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:13,000
Speaker 1: Why?

978
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:14,879
Speaker 0: I've got free money forever.

979
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:17,304
Speaker 1: Because now you're.

980
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:18,428
Speaker 1: you don't have your shit together.

981
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,051
Speaker 1: who cares?

982
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,320
Speaker 1: you're like Scott pilgrim and kick your ass.

983
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,840
Speaker 0: What if I've got my shit together on every other facet of my life except money and money's coming in forever?

984
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:27,491
Speaker 1: You suck.

985
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:30,076
Speaker 0: Yeah Because you want that.

986
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,520
Speaker 0: no What if you won the lottery and you won that like $50,000 a year for life, I would do something with it.

987
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:44,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't sit around playing video poker and drinking paps loo ribbon all day No, but I'd sit around playing counter-strike and drinking chamois all day.

988
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:46,286
Speaker 1: I wouldn't you wait?

989
00:52:46,306 --> 00:52:48,555
Speaker 0: that was me a waste and also podcast a lot.

990
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:49,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's doing something.

991
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,266
Speaker 1: Anyway, hipsters don't do anything.

992
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:52,270
Speaker 0: Sometimes they do.

993
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,197
Speaker 0: they go to bars and they talk about me.

994
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:58,267
Speaker 0: Maybe they're in a band I like in the end.

995
00:52:58,368 --> 00:53:00,260
Speaker 0: how now Scott pilgrims band sucks?

996
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:03,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, that really like that was the coming-of-age.

997
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:05,617
Speaker 0: my band sucks and I don't care.

998
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:10,453
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You know, I don't think sex bomb was actually supposed to be that good either.

999
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:12,340
Speaker 0: No, they were powerful but not good.

1000
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't like they were you know, touring the the country or anything.

1001
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:17,887
Speaker 0: I think one thing I want to touch on.

1002
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:19,232
Speaker 0: we've talked about this a couple of times.

1003
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:30,056
Speaker 0: a lot of people have a very specific complaint about Scott pilgrim and the complaint they always make is The video game like they liked like most of us who like Emily's parents everyone like.

1004
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:36,819
Speaker 0: maybe they get the references Maybe they don't but they like the core message the story the metaphor the world all that stuff.

1005
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:56,080
Speaker 0: But I think a lot of people who were disappointed with the ending In fact, I think most people who are disappointed with the ending Didn't get the core message or didn't have the kind of life to where they would Understand on a personal level the core message and as a result Their primary enjoyment was the fight scenes and the humor and the video game references.

1006
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:59,720
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people who enjoy it on that level and the people who enjoyed on that level.

1007
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:02,552
Speaker 0: I can see why they would be very unsatisfied with the ending.

1008
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:06,023
Speaker 0: They're like the end wasn't epic enough and That's bullshit.

1009
00:54:06,063 --> 00:54:08,492
Speaker 0: The ending was basically perfect.

1010
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,660
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what other ending could you really have?

1011
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,412
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the best ending you could have.

1012
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:12,855
Speaker 1: but they're like.

1013
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:15,809
Speaker 0: I wanted a big Wanted more video games thing.

1014
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:16,673
Speaker 1: It was a big fight.

1015
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:18,100
Speaker 0: They wanted a bigger fight and they want.

1016
00:54:19,341 --> 00:54:21,490
Speaker 0: They basically didn't care about the metaphor.

1017
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:22,314
Speaker 1: I got a one-up.

1018
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:23,680
Speaker 1: how much more video game do you want?

1019
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,220
Speaker 0: They wanted more video game shit, and they didn't get the core messy.

1020
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:27,766
Speaker 1: I think that's.

1021
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:31,500
Speaker 1: the other thing is that you know You don't see having video game shit like that too often.

1022
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:34,456
Speaker 1: There really isn't that much of it and it says a lot of it.

1023
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:34,818
Speaker 1: like in.

1024
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:41,528
Speaker 1: you know Volume one but a lot is like two or three half the people who make this like a pretty ransom coin and a skateboard And one up and I did.

1025
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,040
Speaker 1: there's like three things.

1026
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:48,899
Speaker 0: I Defy most of the people who have complained about the end of Scott Pilgrim from even knowing what clash at demon head is.

1027
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:50,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

1028
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:51,209
Speaker 1: So that's like, okay.

1029
00:54:51,249 --> 00:54:53,720
Speaker 1: So there are three video game things in a whole volume.

1030
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:57,525
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of video game stuff going on It's just a little bit.

1031
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:01,558
Speaker 1: but somehow people like, you know inflated to think like oh, there's so much of it.

1032
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:03,739
Speaker 1: Holy crap It's just all about video game references.

1033
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,288
Speaker 0: I do I think my favorite moment aren't that many.

1034
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:13,453
Speaker 0: my favorite moment in the entire thing other than the cat thing at the end Was well now the bunch of room coming to my head.

1035
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:15,100
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I could just talk about it forever.

1036
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,084
Speaker 0: We'll do the movies.

1037
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,554
Speaker 0: You should see thing where we just say all the things we liked and quote it.

1038
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:22,272
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I actually forgot what is very good now.

1039
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:23,740
Speaker 0: bacon was good, but it wasn't great.

1040
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,142
Speaker 0: It was when knives chow.

1041
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:35,074
Speaker 0: her moment of closure with Scott Pilgrim was you will always be my clash at demon head Because that is such the perfect line.

1042
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:44,339
Speaker 0: think about it the nostalgic First video game or memory of something that if you actually went back and played it for real is a piece of shit.

1043
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:49,451
Speaker 0: But at the same time it was important to your development as a person.

1044
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:53,684
Speaker 0: the memory of it is important to you and That's it.

1045
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:57,646
Speaker 0: playing a game like clash at demon head Is?

1046
00:55:57,768 --> 00:55:58,818
Speaker 0: you don't want to play that now?

1047
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,405
Speaker 1: But you don't watch him in there.

1048
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:08,960
Speaker 0: your memory of playing it and your memory of watching it are very important and they shaped you As a person, yep, I had a lot of Master the Universe figures and when I see them I still go.

1049
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:13,757
Speaker 0: I played a lot of really shitty NES and Atari games to the point of being scarily good at them.

1050
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:16,139
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I wouldn't want to play him now.

1051
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:23,681
Speaker 1: No Like if I break out the NES emulator like there's some games in there that I can play like Kirby's adventure or Super Mario 3.

1052
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,303
Speaker 0: You're not playing.

1053
00:56:24,344 --> 00:56:25,488
Speaker 0: no Bunga's ambition.

1054
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,055
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's a difference.

1055
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,200
Speaker 1: That's a different category.

1056
00:56:29,243 --> 00:56:34,159
Speaker 1: You know Megaman's I can play but Megaman one Metroid you can play Megaman one.

1057
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:45,868
Speaker 1: Yeah But there are a lot of unplayable games like, you know Cheetah, man You know, what's fitting?

1058
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,440
Speaker 1: I like Kung Fu Heroes, right?

1059
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,300
Speaker 1: I played that game when I was a kid and I played it quite a bit, but it's pretty much unplayable now.

1060
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:55,459
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not totally broken as like the Cheetah men level, but it's pretty bad.

1061
00:56:56,323 --> 00:57:00,079
Speaker 1: You know and it's it's but I have fond memories of it, but I can't really play now.

1062
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:03,393
Speaker 0: So I'm really looking forward to the movie like.

1063
00:57:03,774 --> 00:57:08,712
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to this movie Almost as much as I was looking forward to like NS2.

1064
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:10,540
Speaker 1: I'm not looking forward to that much.

1065
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,556
Speaker 0: I'm more like not as much as I was looking forward to Team Fortress 2 you.

1066
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:16,109
Speaker 1: the only movie I'm still looking forward to is Tron.

1067
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:18,419
Speaker 1: I put all my eggs in one basket Tron.

1068
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,600
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to Tron, but I don't expect it to be better than Tron.

1069
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,008
Speaker 1: Well much like clash at demon head right Tron.

1070
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,997
Speaker 1: the story of the original Tron movies is there really?

1071
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,383
Speaker 0: there's something that bothers me About Tron.

1072
00:57:31,746 --> 00:57:33,680
Speaker 0: So the arcade guy was complaining.

1073
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:43,171
Speaker 0: He's basically like I made that game and that jerk stole it and now the kids are putting all their money Into his game in my arcade.

1074
00:57:43,815 --> 00:57:44,780
Speaker 0: It's his arcade.

1075
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:46,878
Speaker 0: He's the one making the money.

1076
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:49,189
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

1077
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,940
Speaker 1: the story of Tron is really dumb.

1078
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,265
Speaker 1: It doesn't hold up at all.

1079
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,450
Speaker 0: It doesn't make any sense.

1080
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,000
Speaker 1: These special effects don't really hold up that much.

1081
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,263
Speaker 0: No They do.

1082
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:58,868
Speaker 1: they were revolutionary at the time.

1083
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:01,678
Speaker 0: They hold up in the same way that the daikon animation holds up.

1084
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:08,607
Speaker 0: You watch it And if you understand what it is, it is awe Inspiring to see that what they pulled off.

1085
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:12,620
Speaker 1: Yes, but the thing with Tron right is I don't expect the plot.

1086
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:15,012
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a new trailer out that shows you some of the plot.

1087
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:19,366
Speaker 0: It's a basically what I expect Some fucking light cycles.

1088
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:26,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a generic and black plot, you know, it's probably not gonna be something That's like oh my gosh It might have a twist ending or something like that But big deal.

1089
00:58:27,223 --> 00:58:35,090
Speaker 1: the reason that I'm holding all the eggs in the basket for Tron right is because a Daft Punk music B 3d IMAX.

1090
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:43,482
Speaker 0: holy shit This scout pilgrim man, wouldn't it be awesome if they got like on him on a Gucci to do the music for the game Tron Man.

1091
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:46,495
Speaker 0: what if they got like Daft Punk to do the music for Tron?

1092
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:46,876
Speaker 0: they did.

1093
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:53,677
Speaker 1: and Right fucking if I could go into any sort of world, you know that I would live in the Tron world.

1094
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,720
Speaker 0: really Tron world.

1095
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:03,748
Speaker 1: Yes, if there's any fictional world that I if they're not forgotten I would not pick Forgotten Realms You might you might be a peasant.

1096
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:04,772
Speaker 0: What about Inception?

1097
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:06,700
Speaker 0: No, yo dog.

1098
00:59:07,132 --> 00:59:12,712
Speaker 0: Yeah Of all the fictional old matrix if you're neo no, why not?

1099
00:59:12,812 --> 00:59:15,360
Speaker 1: No, I would rather be in Tron world.

1100
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:18,873
Speaker 0: What if Tron is just the first the alpha version of the matrix?

1101
00:59:19,335 --> 00:59:20,399
Speaker 1: I've been Tron world.

1102
00:59:21,242 --> 00:59:24,854
Speaker 1: Tron world is the world to be in disc throwing by Scott Yahtzee.

1103
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:26,760
Speaker 1: Plus didn't you see in the trailer?

1104
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,545
Speaker 1: There's a new.

1105
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:29,560
Speaker 1: it looks like there's a new flying thing.

1106
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,971
Speaker 1: So it's like you might be a third Tron sport.

1107
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:35,139
Speaker 0: I kind of want to play some ricochet.

1108
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,306
Speaker 1: suddenly I want to play ricochet all the time.

1109
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:38,992
Speaker 1: That's why I want to go to Tron world.

1110
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:43,520

Speaker 0: It's.

1130
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:29,430
Speaker 0: this is why We're so good at advertising things.

01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,800
Speaker 0: when we do like burning wheels sells so much when we talk about it.

1132
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,994
Speaker 1: I can advertise anything that is legitimately I believe in.

1133
01:00:35,074 --> 01:00:37,326
Speaker 1: if I don't believe in it and it sucks I can't advertise.

1134
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:42,970
Speaker 0: so maybe our system should be you give us ten grand We review your thing privately and then we review it.

1135
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:47,206
Speaker 0: Honestly if you if it's good No, we review it.

1136
01:00:47,286 --> 01:00:48,774
Speaker 1: Otherwise, your ten grand is on the whole.

1137
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:52,364
Speaker 0: we review it honestly 100%.

1138
01:00:52,364 --> 01:00:58,227
Speaker 1: someone's gonna be pretty pissed off though if they passed, you know money to Advertise and we say we basically say they suck.

1139
01:00:58,268 --> 01:01:01,560
Speaker 0: so we review it honestly and we say here's what we said.

1140
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:03,266
Speaker 0: Do you want us to put it up?

1141
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:06,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, you paid either way, but we'll we'll just swallow it.

1142
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:08,718
Speaker 0: the ten grand.

1143
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:10,948
Speaker 1: They'll be pretty pissed.

1144
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:14,260
Speaker 1: if they pay you money They expect you to say what they want you to say.

1145
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,659
Speaker 0: I want to say the people who make it through the barrier like they I think those guys I'll talk about it.

01:01:21,474 --> 01:01:23,362
Speaker 1: Yeah Whatever.

1148
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:27,319

1149
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:30,808
Speaker 1: We don't do advertisements on geek nights has to be on.

1150
01:01:30,848 --> 01:01:37,294
Speaker 1: something else would be an advertisement, okay a Paid review is an advertisement not if I'm honest.

1151
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,123
Speaker 1: I Think it is so.
