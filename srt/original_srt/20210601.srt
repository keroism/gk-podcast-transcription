1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,200
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,750
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday June 1st 2021.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,159
Speaker 1: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,129
Speaker 1: We are reviewing the new Pokemon snap.

5
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,126
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:26,036
Speaker 1: It's on one hand It's weird that it's already June.

7
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:31,113
Speaker 1: I feel like time suddenly accelerated like I believe it was March and I thought wow We've spent.

8
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:31,614
Speaker 0: it was March.

9
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:35,587
Speaker 0: It was March in a long time and then it and then it was June 2021 the next day.

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,379
Speaker 1: I think I think what happened is that there was no May.

11
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,246
Speaker 1: May did not actually happen.

12
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:42,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,470
Speaker 1: It's like it's good times cuz it's summer and it's a good numbers are getting better at least in the u.s.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,161
Speaker 0: Like we're doing okay, at least in New York.

15
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like at the same time.

16
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:53,973
Speaker 0: It's like Any play.

17
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:54,496
Speaker 0: I'm getting old.

18
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:55,480
Speaker 0: I need life to slow down.

19
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,324
Speaker 0: I want to live more.

20
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:58,595
Speaker 0: I don't want Stop speeding up.

21
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,202
Speaker 0: Go slow slow shit dad.

22
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:08,550
Speaker 0: Yep, but at the same time I don't need to be like in the in the arena retirement home tomorrow You know, I want to be there eventually so I could play a bunch of RPGs that haven't go to work.

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,895
Speaker 1: But I'll think of it this way.

24
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:14,780
Speaker 1: think back all of you the listener to the one listener on the live stream because I started It suddenly without any warning.

25
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:22,690
Speaker 1: Uh Think back to this moment when you're in the retirement home alone and you're 99 and think back to this exact moment.

26
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:26,511
Speaker 1: You just teleported from here to there Instantly.

27
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,098
Speaker 1: all that time just passed.

28
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:37,262
Speaker 1: That's my go-to taunt when I'm losing a board game As I watch this train game slip away from me pretty rapidly slip.

29
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:39,410
Speaker 0: It's it think it's gone past slip.

30
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:41,495
Speaker 0: This isn't.

31
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,349
Speaker 0: this isn't a slip away situation.

32
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:49,190
Speaker 1: This is more like the guy in the stands who got hit in the nuts by that home run that made the rounds earlier.

33
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:50,555
Speaker 0: You wouldn't you?

34
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:53,189
Speaker 0: may you spent all your you know, I won three in a row, right?

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,419
Speaker 0: And then you won what?

36
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,530
Speaker 0: three or four in a row, right?

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,610
Speaker 0: And now your load has your load has blown and I think I'm taking this one even though I didn't think I was gonna take it.

38
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:01,695
Speaker 0: I'm suddenly taking it.

39
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,307
Speaker 1: I think PD is what a priority deal.

40
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:04,930
Speaker 1: made you take it.

41
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:10,490
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're talking about a train game because we got some train game news.

42
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,799
Speaker 0: Whoa train news choo-choo.

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, so check this.

44
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:24,070
Speaker 1: there is an expansion an official one to 1846 the faint train game we played first the one that set us down this dark rail.

45
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,372
Speaker 0: Right

46
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:29,152
Speaker 1: now 1846

47
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:44,910
Speaker 0: is the one that we recommend people start with not because it's the simplest it actually has a few little bits that make it A little tricky compared to some of the simpler ones like 1889 or whatever But it is the most forgiving right and is the most one that one that makes a lot of sense.

48
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:49,190
Speaker 1: It makes a lot of sense when you lose the game ends pretty quick.

49
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:54,229
Speaker 0: You're not like stuck there and you can't if you go bankrupt, you know, it doesn't end the whole game, right?

50
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,910
Speaker 0: It's very forgiving to people new players.

51
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,435
Speaker 0: So that's the one we recommend you start with.

52
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,438
Speaker 0: and it just got.

53
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,842
Speaker 0: an upgrade to.

54
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:14,490
Speaker 0: new private corporations have been added to the game Which sort of helps one of the public corporations CEO, which was kind of meh And I guess it maybe could help you eerie even a little bit too because that one's also meh.

55
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,446
Speaker 1: I've definitely noticed eerie rarely gets a lot of like serious play except maybe you have to be.

56
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,096
Speaker 0: we don't play with enough players Often enough to even have eerie.

57
00:03:22,117 --> 00:03:24,207
Speaker 0: you have a possibility being in the game true

58
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:24,548
Speaker 1: lately

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,368
Speaker 0: But you know, there's no reason to take eerie when New York is available

60
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:37,150
Speaker 1: true But if PRR and area are both not in the game, New York is extra powerful because it just basically doesn't have to worry about tokens

61
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:38,592
Speaker 0: Sure.

62
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:44,410
Speaker 0: I mean if there's not enough players in the game and not enough players in the game You don't have to worry about tokens as much just generally.

63
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:58,114
Speaker 1: But anyway with the up trend that a lot of people have noticed was that In like the center south of the board around Cincinnati There'd rarely be a lot of play except in the late-game like rush to get a route to st Louis because everyone has three.

64
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:03,590
Speaker 0: this three like super tiles the Cleveland tile the Detroit tile and the Cincinnati tile and the cleat.

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,869
Speaker 0: They could end Chicago like.

66
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:18,928
Speaker 0: well, Chicago is different, but there's this 3z tiles, right and The Cincinnati one didn't usually gets the least action because see you know That's right near it is weak and it has to bust through a bunch of mountains to get there, right?

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,190
Speaker 0: So they the new private corporations.

68
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:28,490
Speaker 0: One of them is Little Miami which adds the ability to like lay free tiles down in that area.

69
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:29,755
Speaker 0: And what's the other one?

70
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,080
Speaker 0: It's something else, right?

71
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,430
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I know is down there if you teleport.

72
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,902
Speaker 0: No, the other the other new private corporation.

73
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:36,324
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

74
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:36,525
Speaker 1: Yeah.

75
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:39,249
Speaker 1: So the brother the other private corporation Little Miami in boomtown.

76
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:40,954
Speaker 0: All right, boomtown.

77
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:41,336
Speaker 0: That's right.

78
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:41,838
Speaker 0: What does it do?

79
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,866
Speaker 1: boomtown puts a $20 token in Cincinnati?

80
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:48,205
Speaker 1: And that company gets 20 bucks added to all of its routes.

81
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:49,330
Speaker 0: There you go.

82
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,309
Speaker 0: Almost yes, if both of those are or one or both of those are in the game.

83
00:04:55,891 --> 00:05:02,730
Speaker 0: Suddenly now the area of the board that didn't get a lot of activity now gets is now equally hot compared to the other areas.

84
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:10,929
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and that can make a lot more dynamic play by giving you you know Putting basically all the different kinds of routes closer to the Pareto frontier.

85
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:24,332
Speaker 1: so yep, so it actually just seems to balance the game out a little bit and break the Somewhat stable meta or at least make it a little less locked into what's gonna get IPO to end Mmm.

86
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:27,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's interesting that we it's available.

87
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,667
Speaker 1: I didn't know it was even coming.

88
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,367
Speaker 0: this news I didn't know it was coming either and suddenly was added to the train game website 18xx games.

89
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,133
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I would.

90
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:43,790
Speaker 1: I would suspect that there have been more games of 18xx games played on 18xx games.net That have ever been played physically.

91
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,196
Speaker 0: That's probably correct.

92
00:05:46,297 --> 00:06:00,610
Speaker 1: I would bet on that as I personally I feel like 1846 and maybe 1889 are the most complex training games I would ever physically play like I would never ever in my life consider playing 1817 with physical pieces of paper.

93
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,168
Speaker 0: No a Chesapeake is very playable just because playable.

94
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:04,470
Speaker 1: you're right.

95
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,429
Speaker 0: CE is a very is really also the you know.

96
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:14,223
Speaker 1: But even then it would be hard because one of the problem You know, this is something that we didn't talk about as much when we reviewed these games early on.

97
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:15,950
Speaker 1: but I noticed this playing online.

98
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:31,508
Speaker 1: While it is public information how much money everyone has and how much money they make the fact that you would have to keep track of it on a piece of paper or ask people or Like look and count things in people's boards meant people didn't do it.

99
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,664
Speaker 1: So with the online version because all the numbers someone does it and wins.

100
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:39,071
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not worth it to do that It's just.

101
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,096
Speaker 1: it's such a pain.

102
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,070
Speaker 1: but online all the numbers are there.

103
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,890
Speaker 1: I can even click on a little spreadsheet and it shows me everyone's trajectory.

104
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:49,790
Speaker 1: Yep, like that's how I make decisions.

105
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:59,410
Speaker 1: I spend most of this game looking at the map and looking at the spreadsheet and occasionally looking at the entities tab Mm-hmm, and you can't get that in person.

106
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:06,288
Speaker 1: I think these games are not easily objectively better as digital games Even if you played them in person a hot seat on a tablet or something.

107
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,430
Speaker 0: Well, I mean imagine if you wanted it you could play a game.

108
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,906
Speaker 0: For example, you could play Master of Orion 2 completely tabletop without changing any rules whatsoever.

109
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,390
Speaker 0: It's a turn-based game, right?

110
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:22,200
Speaker 0: You know, there's no real-time element to it whatsoever But there are just so many numbers to deal with.

111
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:23,645
Speaker 0: it would be impossible.

112
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:25,250
Speaker 0: You wouldn't get through turn one, right?

113
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,050
Speaker 0: You know get to manage how much you know science is coming from every single colony and every single plan.

114
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,445
Speaker 0: Take your whole life to do so.

115
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,918
Speaker 0: There are some board games out there that have sort of.

116
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,270
Speaker 0: obviously they're nowhere near the complexity of Master of Orion 2 or a civilization.

117
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,026
Speaker 0: You know computer game in terms of all the.

118
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:57,650
Speaker 0: you know The the things going on but they push the limits of how many different numbers there are going on And so you can't really even if you can play them in person quite easily.

119
00:07:58,192 --> 00:08:06,942
Speaker 0: You don't have all of the metrics available to everyone unless you really spend You know the time to calculate them or you just have a computer there.

120
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,889
Speaker 0: in which case why aren't you just playing on the computer?

121
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,936
Speaker 1: Yep, but that gets something.

122
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:31,692
Speaker 1: we talked about a lot on geek nights as especially in our panels around tabletop games and what it means to be a tabletop game and how they sort of enforce a certain Simplicity and elegance at least if they're designed well and Honestly, these 18xx games kind of make terrible pen and paper games in a computer-driven era Like they're.

123
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:36,730
Speaker 1: like the design is not informed by the usual constraints of tabletop.

124
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:39,988
Speaker 1: They're constrained by the.

125
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:44,810
Speaker 1: They're constrained more by the same things that constrain stuff like chainmail and Dungeons & Dragons.

126
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:50,750
Speaker 1: Like one of the components is a bunch up like a calculator and a bunch of pads of paper and pencils and stuff.

127
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,890
Speaker 1: But regardless I really like playing these games online.

128
00:08:56,292 --> 00:09:00,429
Speaker 1: I feel like if we ever played one of the packs we would get out laptops and just sit there playing them on the laptop.

129
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:02,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds good.

130
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,700
Speaker 1: So on some other news, I really quickly.

131
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,490
Speaker 0: it would go by really quickly not having to like, you know Wait for anybody.

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,230
Speaker 1: I feel like we might do that when we're waiting in line for something or while we're waiting for someone else to take their.

133
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,710
Speaker 0: We could go to a pecs, right?

134
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,570
Speaker 0: We could start one and cuz since you can play it on your phone so easily?

135
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically be like while we're anytime you're waiting.

136
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,250
Speaker 0: It's like check to see if it's your turn and just keep it rolling to fill in all the pecs gaps.

137
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:25,537
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

138
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:26,463
Speaker 1: and at pecs unplugged.

139
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,046
Speaker 1: We should do this.

140
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,724
Speaker 1: make it a thing Mmm, I'll make it a thing.

141
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,070
Speaker 1: So in some other news, uh, I have not played it yet.

142
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,939
Speaker 1: It just came out but we're gonna play it to review at some point soon.

143
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:39,410
Speaker 1: an airport for aliens currently run by dogs.

144
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:40,855
Speaker 1: It's apparently out.

145
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:41,980
Speaker 1: I forgot this game was coming.

146
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,570
Speaker 0: I've been I've been talking about this game for a long time.

147
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,260
Speaker 0: I've been so hype about this game and it is out now.

148
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:52,401
Speaker 0: and not only is it out but there was a patch so It's even better than it was when it was released.

149
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,449
Speaker 0: Not just some days ago, right?

150
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:55,487
Speaker 0: most.

151
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,579
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's basically I've played it.

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,529
Speaker 0: I haven't beat it yet, but it's a game.

153
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:02,760
Speaker 0: it's exactly what I thought it was gonna be.

154
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:41,966
Speaker 0: you are a person and You're you have a woken I guess in an airport and you have a spouse who is also in the airport clearly something you don't have a great memory of like the before times but somehow you're the last two humans in a universe in which there are only airports and horrifying things outside of the airports and Their airports are being run by dogs who are stock photos of dogs and The aliens if they ever existed don't exist now, or at least you don't see them.

155
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,169
Speaker 0: So you don't know what happened to them.

156
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:53,020
Speaker 0: And yeah, you go around Helping out dogs flying around meeting dogs Talking to your spouse, right?

157
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,950
Speaker 0: Who's doing some kind of research or something?

158
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,590
Speaker 1: And if you have not seen this game, like it's got a very like part of the reason we all get excited about it.

159
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,020
Speaker 1: You know, you look at a game.

160
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,449
Speaker 1: You're like that's an indie game.

161
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:08,484
Speaker 1: This game has got that feel all over like the dogs are literal stock photos of dogs.

162
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:12,477
Speaker 1: just right lain into the game The the aesthetic.

163
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:14,870
Speaker 0: it looks like the kind of game that you would just like.

164
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,668
Speaker 0: You know buy on itch IO that like some kids slap together, right?

165
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,190
Speaker 0: Who you know was managed to be able to use some 3d like map level generator.

166
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:28,228
Speaker 0: Right the kind of level like I'm not high school me would have made for quake one or something.

167
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:33,465
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, everything's a square but it's not like.

168
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:34,408
Speaker 0: it's not the.

169
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:34,810
Speaker 0: you know.

170
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,053
Speaker 0: The cause of it isn't?

171
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,442
Speaker 0: Oh some amateurs made this right?

172
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,390
Speaker 0: It's they did it that way on purpose, right?

173
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,189
Speaker 0: It's like if you have some master animator and they intentionally do stick figure on purpose sort of like.

174
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:56,848
Speaker 1: well It's the difference between the boom Coming into the shot because you are terrible at making films versus the boom came into the shot because you're trying to make a point About how this film is poorly made.

175
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, Don Hertz feels like my spoon is too big, right?

176
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:04,101
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just a little blob guy with a spoon.

177
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:09,510
Speaker 0: But yet that's like an oscar-winning Animation, I think it won't do that one, right?

178
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,085
Speaker 0: It's sort of uh, oh and the the humor is actually not too far off from that.

179
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:24,250
Speaker 0: it is it is very Humorous sort of game and it's it's great because a we don't see a lot of comedy games these days, right?

180
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:30,720
Speaker 0: I think a lot of comedy in general these days is you know Not funny?

181
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:37,584
Speaker 1: or Try to think of kind of games that were primarily funny to me like Hypnospace outlaw was close.

182
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:39,890
Speaker 0: This is by the same, right?

183
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:47,318
Speaker 1: But people are like some of these reviews up.

184
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:53,248
Speaker 1: multiple reviewers have said we haven't played it yet that it brought them to tears That it's there's a lot going on.

185
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:59,750
Speaker 0: Well, because it does have you know, like a like a meaningful message to it, right?

186
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:10,337
Speaker 0: It's like, you know in your life You've experienced at least some people have many people have experienced sort of like these transient Places right like airports, right?

187
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:11,200
Speaker 0: It's like you're in them.

188
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,070
Speaker 0: You're somehow familiar with them or at least part of them.

189
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,678
Speaker 1: Well, cuz any airport you go in the world, like if it's a major international airport They're all kind of the same.

190
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:22,230
Speaker 1: like your brain almost feels like they're all just directly connected.

191
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,743
Speaker 1: Like if you walk far enough at JFK, you'll end up in the Seattle Airport.

192
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:32,697
Speaker 1: somehow like your brain just can't quite parse directly intuitively that there's a plane in between them.

193
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:40,330
Speaker 0: because they're so sort of these feelings you have for places like that that you go to More than once but you don't really, you know, you're not like working there.

194
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,558
Speaker 0: I guess people who work in airports probably feel differently about.

195
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,669
Speaker 1: well think about difference on packs looks like having enforced much.

196
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:56,090
Speaker 0: But the point is you you have that combined with like this sort of long-distance relationship with your Spouse there, right and it's sort of you know.

197
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,750
Speaker 0: It's like even though the game is so ridiculous of these stock photo dogs handing you guns and and you know all this other nonsense.

198
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:07,410
Speaker 0: It's a cage dog locking you in a cage and all sorts of nonsense like that is going on.

199
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:16,381
Speaker 0: It's that thread that like main thread of the game is actually very you know Sentimental meaningful and sincere right?

200
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,404
Speaker 0: It's it, you know.

201
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:26,013
Speaker 0: in terms of you know Poking a particular feeling people have that I don't think any other game tries to poke that particular Feeling right?

202
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,177
Speaker 0: It's like it's like they.

203
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:31,530
Speaker 0: this is very specific feeling that you experience in certain circumstances in life.

204
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:48,512
Speaker 0: And this game was like we're gonna write a story that pokes that exact very precise area like Hokuto pokes Pokes that exact area As someone who's approaching 40 and who's oh, you know as we were saying before the show started Running out of time.

205
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:53,320
Speaker 1: I appreciate games and media in general that just poke one thing very well.

206
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:59,780
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're we'll talk about this little right give it a full episode when he beat it completely Yeah, and complete our proper Dex's.

207
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:09,725
Speaker 1: this is worth a full playthrough Yeah, so in some other news Nvidia has announced now that the 3080 T eyes are coming out for 1200.

208
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:17,823
Speaker 0: Well, so many Will be 1200 bucks Right, well so good I guess is that there's more cards.

209
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,990
Speaker 0: I guess right and also good.

210
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,057
Speaker 0: There's faster better cards.

211
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:22,519
Speaker 0: That's nice.

212
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:22,780
Speaker 0: Yep.

213
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:26,533
Speaker 1: They're going to my default with the Nerfing.

214
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:28,561
Speaker 1: that limits how useful they are for coins.

215
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,790
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone will see how that much that matters.

216
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the.

217
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,670
Speaker 0: I guess that's okay if it helps.

218
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:39,470
Speaker 0: They also have a higher MSRP, which is good and bad.

219
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,050
Speaker 0: It's bad because it makes them less accessible to people right which is not great.

220
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,223
Speaker 0: You know people actually want to play games aren't made.

221
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:49,749
Speaker 0: I'm not necessarily made of money So it's not that cool.

222
00:15:50,454 --> 00:16:05,450
Speaker 1: But it might actually keep the price down Overall because the people who have money are buying that one and there's more supply of the cheaper ones that could Eventually be bought at their actual MSRP, but it's also less profitable to scalp, right?

223
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:09,777
Speaker 0: So if the supply can't be raised Does you know?

224
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,970
Speaker 0: then at least the price can be raised?

225
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,930
Speaker 0: So that way at least if they're gonna sell they're gonna sell to someone who wants them.

226
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,550
Speaker 0: They're not gonna sell to someone who just wants to resell it because there's no point.

227
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:27,901
Speaker 1: I mean frankly the price should be raised even with the collateral damage to gamers and professionals just to Cripple the coin industry.

228
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:29,330
Speaker 1: that is continuing to be a problem.

229
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,219
Speaker 0: Well, I mean all you'd be doing then is be taking it wouldn't?

230
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,102
Speaker 0: I don't?

231
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:38,828
Speaker 0: you wouldn't cripple the coin industry because coin people If at least if they were useful for coins, they would still buy them.

232
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,550
Speaker 0: Yeah But they were basically just transfer.

233
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,192
Speaker 0: It's just does.

234
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:48,110
Speaker 0: the money you spend for the price of the thing is effectively gonna be constant unless you get lucky.

235
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:48,952
Speaker 0: It's just.

236
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:55,430
Speaker 0: does the money you spend on the card go to Nvidia or does it go to some second third-party reseller, right?

237
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,094
Speaker 0: Yeah That's what the it's like.

238
00:16:57,154 --> 00:17:00,406
Speaker 0: what portion of the money it costs to buy the card will go to Nvidia?

239
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:10,250
Speaker 0: or and the card makers like aces and gigabyte and whoever EVGA all them and Versus what percentage of the money you pay goes to just some guy who bought one and then evade it?

240
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,217
Speaker 1: But at least the other thing is these are the TI's.

241
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:20,821
Speaker 1: so these are the special cards that are usually only used by people who have a lot of money to waste or Professionals who are doing something serious with them.

242
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:22,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never bought a TI.

243
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,910
Speaker 1: I've never needed a TI like my 1080 was fine.

244
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,635
Speaker 1: This thing is basically.

245
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:43,051
Speaker 1: the only real difference between the 3080 TI and the 3090 is that the 3090 is Three slots wide and uses a crazy shit ton of power Like you need a 750 watt power supply minimum to put a 3090.

246
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:48,888
Speaker 1: You can get comparable performance with a much more reasonable power profile and physical profile with the 3080 TI.

247
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,196
Speaker 1: That's kind of the big difference.

248
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,510
Speaker 1: I'm on a waiting list for both the 3080 and a 3090.

249
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,796
Speaker 1: I'll take whichever one I can get first.

250
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,273
Speaker 0: I'm on a waiting list for a 5080 or a 60.

251
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:01,604
Speaker 1: Not sure which one I mean, I only got a.

252
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:08,869
Speaker 0: My 1070 has not, you know found anything that causes it a problem.

253
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:15,508
Speaker 0: yet I mean I played do the newer doom right the internal one and the 1070 was just fine even with the 4k monitor.

254
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,713
Speaker 0: So I'm not gonna.

255
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:21,003
Speaker 0: I'm not really seeing a need for me to upgrade.

256
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,470
Speaker 0: it can still encode videos in Premiere.

257
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:33,191
Speaker 1: Well, we're our household is two professionals who need video Card stuff and between us we have a 1080 and a 770.

258
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,620
Speaker 0: Yes, you probably you need to replace the 770.

259
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,571
Speaker 1: We need at least one 3080 or 3090.

260
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:42,107
Speaker 0: My 1070 is gonna carry me for a long ass time and in the living room.

261
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:43,974
Speaker 0: I got a 1050 So that's gonna carry.

262
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:48,370
Speaker 1: for yeah, I'm still rocking out GTX 450 in the living room.

263
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:52,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was actually feeling you know when I bought that 1050 for the living room.

264
00:18:52,684 --> 00:19:05,090
Speaker 0: It felt like sort of an unlike an exert of like a Excessive purchase because the I the integrated graphics and the HD PC were just fine You know for watching a YouTube or most 90% of what I was doing in there.

265
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:11,754
Speaker 0: But it was like I was occasionally and I still occasionally play a game on the HD PC That's a 3d game.

266
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:15,788
Speaker 0: And that's when that the IGP was suffering in the in the HD PC.

267
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:18,530
Speaker 0: So I'm like, alright I'll just get the cheapest like 1050.

268
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,808
Speaker 0: It's like that'll last me forever right and you know, it felt a little bit like to my.

269
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:24,816
Speaker 0: really wait, you know I don't do it that often right?

270
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:25,459
Speaker 0: It's like a mom.

271
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:27,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I could to go with the lower frame rates in the living room.

272
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the future-proofing ends up saving you so much money in the long run.

273
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:36,770
Speaker 1: It turned out to be a good good Bye, I've generally like now that I'm old enough to have had a lot of computers.

274
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:48,330
Speaker 1: the one thing I can say is that Every time I have spent what felt like too much money and future-proof something even if that harmed me in the short term It is always in retrospect been the right decision.

275
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:56,744
Speaker 1: Like I've never regretted Spending more than I needed to on a computer and I have 100% of the time regretted when I cheaped out on a component.

276
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,129
Speaker 1: It has always come back to bite me.

277
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:00,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think I've regret it.

278
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,130
Speaker 0: Like if there's a thing that I need, right?

279
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:13,186
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever regretted an instance in which I bought the thing but bought like, you know an upgraded more expensive Better one of the thing, right?

280
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:19,630
Speaker 0: The only regrets are like bowling ball where you bought a thing and didn't use the thing enough, right?

281
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,530
Speaker 0: And therefore it was like an unused thing and then it didn't matter whether you bought the cheapo.

282
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,350
Speaker 0: I guess cheapo would have been okay because you barely spent any money on it.

283
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,030
Speaker 0: But it wouldn't matter if you bought like the medium or the high tier.

284
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you equally regret spending money on an unused thing.

285
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:36,250
Speaker 0: But if you buy like, you know about bicycle, right?

286
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:46,350
Speaker 0: It's like if you buy the medium Bicycle or the high tier bicycle or the doctor level the dentist level bicycle as the the they like to say in the biking community.

287
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:54,745
Speaker 0: As long as you're riding that bike a lot, I don't think you're gonna regret, you know any level.

288
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:57,370
Speaker 0: because if you buy a level too low Well, okay.

289
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:13,908
Speaker 0: well you know you bought a. It's eventually like it's gonna serve you well for a long time and eventually you'll upgrade it and get to the correct level of bicycle For you and if you get one that's too high it's like as long as you're riding it a lot you'll never Outgrow it because it's you know, even if even if it's too extreme for you.

290
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:17,169
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like you'll be fine with that for the rest of your life.

291
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:22,169
Speaker 1: So as long as I have the privilege of the money to afford it I'm gonna continue with what I've been doing my whole life.

292
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:26,630
Speaker 1: I'm always getting either the cheapest piece of crap or exactly what I want to need.

293
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,695
Speaker 1: I'm never gonna go into that middle of the road.

294
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:38,868
Speaker 0: I Ridiculously overpriced for no reason usually was like brand stuff.

295
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:42,842
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, there's the same thing with flying like as much as like.

296
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:45,230
Speaker 1: oh, yeah business class is better than premium economy.

297
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,842
Speaker 1: I'm not fucking paying $10,000 to fly anyway.

298
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:50,376
Speaker 0: Yeah a good example.

299
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:54,350
Speaker 0: I always look at as is it in cameras as like the Leica cameras, right?

300
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,869
Speaker 0: It's like they're way fucking nice, right?

301
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,823
Speaker 0: I would if you wanted to give me one I would take a like an m6 or an m10.

302
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,790
Speaker 0: It's like yes, I want one, right?

303
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:20,630
Speaker 0: But you know a used old like an m6 is probably two or three thousand dollars You can buy and that's like a 35 millimeter film camera that just takes the same Film photos than any other like a. you know a $10 point-and-shoot or a disposable does right?

304
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,970
Speaker 0: You could just put lenses on it and the lenses cost a fortune.

305
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:42,590
Speaker 0: also, they're thousands and thousands of dollars to get a lens to go on that camera at least if it's a like a lens and You can just buy a much cheaper camera that takes the same photo and with for the amount of money it cost to get That camera because of its name brand and its fanciness you could get like a brand new ridiculous digital camera.

306
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:50,058
Speaker 0: Right, that's like, you know, there's 4k video and all this other, you know It's not that the price is too high for it to.

307
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,436
Speaker 0: it'd be like if you bought an Apple to GS and it cost $10,000 right?

308
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:58,450
Speaker 0: It's like but you bought it because it's an Apple to GS as this mystique, right?

309
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,368
Speaker 0: There's nothing else like it.

310
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:03,653
Speaker 1: it's that's why I made that distinction of not the best as much as The one.

311
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:05,642
Speaker 1: that is what I want and need like.

312
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:07,410
Speaker 1: if I cuz if I don't know what I want to need.

313
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,992
Speaker 1: I'm definitely not buying the expensive one Right.

314
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:14,885
Speaker 0: The point is is that it's the expensive one doesn't always line up with the.

315
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,770
Speaker 0: you know, the better the better one.

316
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are.

317
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:23,979
Speaker 0: there are things in the world that you can buy that are just overpriced because of brand right name recognition Or some other reason.

318
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:32,469
Speaker 0: that makes no sense And you could have regrets blowing the money on those Because you spent a bunch of money and got way less for your money.

319
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:41,550
Speaker 1: So in some other news, I feel like this is almost feels like news from I don't know 1997 but There was a giant ROM site.

320
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:42,874
Speaker 1: I mean I can't.

321
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:46,290
Speaker 1: I don't think I've been to this ROM site because I already have every ROM.

322
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,953
Speaker 0: Well, I think what.

323
00:23:47,295 --> 00:24:00,190
Speaker 0: so I think it's like I used to go to ROM sites all the time back in the day but what happened is eventually we had bit torrent and when bit torrent came around and Obviously there weren't new old games not that many at least and the ones that are new you can get by other means there

324
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,502
Speaker 1: was This one torrent that was like every Atari NES NES gate.

325
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,650
Speaker 1: There was this one torrent that we all got.

326
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,196
Speaker 0: It's just I got a torrent.

327
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,602
Speaker 0: it had every NES game in it.

328
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,330
Speaker 0: I'm like, well, I don't need to go to ROM sites anymore.

329
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:12,000
Speaker 0: I have every NES game I have.

330
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Speaker 0: I could make a ROM site if I wanted to And that that was the end of ROM sites, right?

331
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,687
Speaker 0: Why picking out individual ROMs?

332
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,310
Speaker 0: What's the point of that?

333
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:31,530
Speaker 1: So I did run into a situation remember when I was trying to get fightcade working which fightcade is an online service where you can be like I want to play a Genesis game or an SNES game with another human and It's designed for fighting game people to play fighting games remotely.

334
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:37,090
Speaker 0: You can imagine I heard about it from people in the fighting game community because they were using it big time during the pandemic.

335
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,290
Speaker 0: Yeah to play a lot of fighting games with each other, which is totally awesome.

336
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:46,910
Speaker 1: and it's cool like you go in and you just Join the room of the game you want to play and you can just like start a game with someone random and it just works.

337
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:47,528
Speaker 1: It's great.

338
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,420
Speaker 1: but the ROMs From that ancient ROM pack we have don't work.

339
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:56,450
Speaker 1: There's a slightly different format of ROM that everyone's been using.

340
00:24:57,411 --> 00:25:02,710
Speaker 1: Interesting, so I had to go get that format and they are trivial to get even without this website.

341
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,650
Speaker 0: But is there some sort of convert?

342
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,170
Speaker 0: It feels like there could be some sort of converter where like you take an app you load a ROM in.

343
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:14,109
Speaker 1: I think you could just like move some files around like create a file of a certain kind Zip them up just the right way and it would work.

344
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:19,510
Speaker 1: I have not actually yet compared the full differences between the two to see if I could figure it out.

345
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,130
Speaker 0: It might not be too hard to make that app or to make just a mod for fightcade itself.

346
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,918
Speaker 0: Yeah automatically convert any ROM on low.

347
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:30,227
Speaker 1: I feel like this could just be a Python script that I run once.

348
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:30,708
Speaker 0: Yeah,

349
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:38,050
Speaker 1: but regardless The news here is that Nintendo went after this ROM site and they won

350
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:39,415
Speaker 0: Like they do and

351
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:51,442
Speaker 1: they've been awarded 2.1 million dollars in damages because the person running the ROM site Kind of tried to fight back and tried to like make an argument like pirates used to do in the 90s Like oh, it's not technically illegal to run this site.

352
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:52,588
Speaker 1: I didn't take okay.

353
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:53,010
Speaker 0: We'll see here.

354
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,217
Speaker 0: There were two problems here, right.

355
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:55,639
Speaker 0: problem.

356
00:25:55,879 --> 00:26:02,549
Speaker 0: one is that this ROM site was actually not just Freely distributing ROMs or try, you know, anything like that.

357
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:18,930
Speaker 0: They were charging membership fees to people if you if you bought a membership you could basically download ROMs faster and unlimitedly and If you didn't buy a membership you could download ROMs slowly and shittily with some sort of bandwidth caps and limits.

358
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,400
Speaker 1: Also, most of the sites.

359
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:21,669
Speaker 0: that makes no sense, you know.

360
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,228
Speaker 0: First of all that makes no sense in a world where there's a torrent of all every ROM ever.

361
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,169
Speaker 1: Remember a lot of people are too young to know the ways of old pirates.

362
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,470
Speaker 0: true A lot of people have bandwidth limits.

363
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,310
Speaker 0: They might just need the super Metroid ROM and that's it, you know.

364
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,403
Speaker 0: Or they just want to put a link to the past randomizer only.

365
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:39,470
Speaker 0: they just need that one file.

366
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,457
Speaker 0: I don't need anything else.

367
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,267
Speaker 1: I found if you need just that one file You just type that file name into Google and you'll find it.

368
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,881
Speaker 0: Someone will DM it to you on discord.

369
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:47,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll happen, too.

370
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:52,270
Speaker 0: But yeah, the discord server might ban you for asking.

371
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:58,570
Speaker 1: This site had movies and ebooks and this was just a full-on like sleazy pirate site, right?

372
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,769
Speaker 0: And then the second mistake the big mistake.

373
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:07,150
Speaker 0: The person decided to represent themselves in court and not get a lawyer.

374
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:15,017
Speaker 1: so there's a. there's a saying in the legal community that I encountered when I was a kid because For various reasons.

375
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:20,178
Speaker 1: I was aware of sovereign citizens when I was very young Girl up in Michigan until much later.

376
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:22,004
Speaker 1: Yeah sovereign citizens were.

377
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:37,713
Speaker 1: I encountered a few in my childhood like they were a thing and a Lawyer friend of the family who dealt with them said something that I see repeated often on the internet to this day Pro-c is Latin for bring popcorn Pro-c and it's process.

378
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:40,217
Speaker 0: I thought it's pretty after say yeah proceed.

379
00:27:40,337 --> 00:27:41,158
Speaker 0: I don't know all the lawyers.

380
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,120
Speaker 1: I don't say I've heard both.

381
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:46,470
Speaker 0: If you see lawyers can't even agree on whether it's pleaded or pled guilty.

382
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:53,002
Speaker 1: So, uh Basically, if you do this, you don't have a lawyer.

383
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:58,198
Speaker 0: You just defend yourself in court and You can always be your own lawyer.

384
00:27:58,238 --> 00:27:59,724
Speaker 0: You have the right to do that if you want.

385
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:02,496
Speaker 1: Uh, I I'm not giving legal advice.

386
00:28:02,736 --> 00:28:03,439
Speaker 1: I'm not a lawyer.

387
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,250
Speaker 0: do not ever give you advice never do it.

388
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:13,441
Speaker 0: Do not never ever unless you and let even if you are a lawyer Right get a different lawyer to be your lawyer.

389
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,850
Speaker 0: I even I've seen like lawyers do that, right?

390
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:17,479
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever.

391
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,509
Speaker 0: you know, it's very the kind of lawyer that you know.

392
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:27,650
Speaker 1: Well, usually when someone goes proceed they are a lawyer and usually this is a terrible decision because they're a bad lawyer.

393
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:30,589
Speaker 0: Yes, usually bad lawyers do that, right?

394
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:35,370
Speaker 0: Good lawyers get another lawyer to be their lawyer in court.

395
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:41,030
Speaker 0: They're not their own lawyer and there's a lot of raising never never be your own lawyer in court ever ever.

396
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:44,796
Speaker 0: It is it is always Almost always a bad idea.

397
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,970
Speaker 0: The only exception would be small claims court where I think you can't bring a lawyer.

398
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:57,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but the other fascinating thing about this is this site was a massive piracy ring with a ton of crap on it But it got shut down by Nintendo.

399
00:28:58,077 --> 00:28:59,300
Speaker 1: They only had that.

400
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,045
Speaker 1: There's a number here.

401
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,866
Speaker 1: There were 49 Nintendo ROMs on this site.

402
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:06,838
Speaker 0: Well, I cuz I mean most of.

403
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:09,110
Speaker 0: I mean there were probably the full NES library.

404
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,460
Speaker 0: But how many games in the NES library were Nintendo games right versus Capcom?

405
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,327
Speaker 1: Well, looks like these were mostly Nintendo switch Rob's.

406
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,592
Speaker 0: Oh Fancy.

407
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:21,139
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm looking at the sizing fire emblem.

408
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,706
Speaker 1: three houses Sid Meier's civilization six.

409
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,524
Speaker 1: Oh So, uh, yeah, but it was 49 games.

410
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:29,870
Speaker 1: I assumed they were all switch games.

411
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:39,030
Speaker 1: So they were to Nintendo thirty five thousand dollars for each game Saying that since he already shut the site down and was currently unemployed that figure was sufficient.

412
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:46,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nintendo asked for a bigger amount and they the guy was only making on the site from membership fees like 30k a year.

413
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,181
Speaker 1: It might have been 30k ever.

414
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,273
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, I can't.

415
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:52,002
Speaker 0: I just saw a 30k number.

416
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:58,100
Speaker 1: But yeah, 2.1 million Made between thirty thousand and thirty six thousand dollars.

417
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:01,169
Speaker 1: It appears that this was total in the history of the site.

418
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:10,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't understand, you know again this again, you know, don't do a crime if it's not a big enough payout To not have to keep doing crime.

419
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:24,690
Speaker 0: But also I think it shows yet again how the copyright system, you know is not Measuring the worth of things right in any sort of reasonable way.

420
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,067
Speaker 0: It's like the person didn't do two point one million dollars in damages, right?

421
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,205
Speaker 0: You know some of it's gonna just be punitive to be like.

422
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:32,990
Speaker 0: hey stop doing that.

423
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:38,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but oh they got another four hundred grand out of him for statutory trademark damages.

424
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:43,970
Speaker 0: Sure, right, but you know the most of the day, you know, did they do some damage?

425
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,190
Speaker 0: How many people right went to this ROM site and got ROMs and would have?

426
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,527
Speaker 0: Purchased a any of these games had that site not existed, right?

427
00:30:56,691 --> 00:31:02,839
Speaker 1: Apparently thirty thousand dollars worth, you know, so But at the same time the fact that people I've all.

428
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:15,749
Speaker 1: I'm always amazed at the people who will pay for pirated things When often the pirate the thing you're paying for for the piracy site Doesn't really cost that much less than just buying the thing unless you're pirating a lot of things.

429
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:19,486
Speaker 1: Mmm, like a lot of people buy pirated manga.

430
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:20,470
Speaker 1: It's a host a whole thing.

431
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,102
Speaker 0: Now, you know, some people don't know and there's all kind of.

432
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,608
Speaker 0: there's all kinds of situations out there.

433
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:33,273
Speaker 1: So, uh in one last little bit we reviewed a game not too long ago March 9th 2021.

434
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:34,983
Speaker 1: So, I guess we reviewed that yesterday.

435
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:37,433
Speaker 1: the way my brain thinks Moonhunters.

436
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:38,218
Speaker 1: pretty cute game.

437
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:39,405
Speaker 1: We talked about it.

438
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:39,929
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

439
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:50,749
Speaker 1: One of our complaints though was that the worlds you explore the actual levels where you're fighting we're very uninspired and kind of boring and slowed the game down to an unreasonable degree and

440
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:56,826
Speaker 0: The maps where you were doing the combat like yeah things when you ran into a person.

441
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:57,910
Speaker 0: it would be kind of interesting.

442
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:04,870
Speaker 0: Some of the little mini boss fights are kind of interesting But the map itself was pretty much just like this open sort of thing, you know.

443
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,410
Speaker 0: You just do like a depth-first search and you find everything.

444
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,568
Speaker 1: Yep, you know and there were it reminded me but I couldn't find a link to it then so I found it.

445
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:17,256
Speaker 1: Mammon machine wrote an article called nobody cares about it But it's the only thing that matters.

446
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:27,548
Speaker 1: pacing and level design and JRPGs back in Okay, and it breaks down like this article with some diagrams from some games that did this poorly.

447
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:31,942
Speaker 1: like All the beginner naive mistakes people make.

448
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:43,628
Speaker 1: designing levels for things like RPGs and Moonhunters is like a textbook example of how to make bad levels Mmm, like those levels are procedurally generated.

449
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:46,076
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Well, the problem is procedural generation is fine.

450
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:50,350
Speaker 1: But what was procedurally generated ended up being depth-first search.

451
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:53,539
Speaker 1: You know, what is not fun and almost any game depth-first

452
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,702
Speaker 0: search that

453
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:58,950
Speaker 1: is like that is almost guaranteed to make your game unfun and tedious

454
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,311
Speaker 0: Mmm,

455
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:13,830
Speaker 1: and this article just does a really good job of pointing out how bravely default Which made a lot of these same mistakes has some of the worst level design ever Mmm, so it's worth reading if you wanted to follow up to a review of moon chasers

456
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:21,964
Speaker 0: things Of the day,

457
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:24,013
Speaker 1: so I found this channel recently.

458
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:24,696
Speaker 1: It's just delightful.

459
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,800
Speaker 1: This is the really short video.

460
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:36,960
Speaker 1: They got a bunch of videos, but this is titled things in music that are the same but art If you've if you don't know anything about music, you won't understand this at all.

461
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:41,539
Speaker 1: If you know a lot about music, you will understand this video and appreciate it.

462
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:52,236
Speaker 1: but if you know a moderate amount about music like you got to the level where you can read music and you were like Why the fuck is there a double flat just to put a single flat and draw the different note?

463
00:33:52,296 --> 00:34:01,727
Speaker 1: like all the weird stuff like when people talk about in augmented seconds as opposed to a minor third and like all the weird Technicalities and transposition and everything.

464
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:08,147
Speaker 1: this channel does a very good job of pointing out Exactly why all of that is funny.

465
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,960
Speaker 1: and I laughed out loud way too hard at this video.

466
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:13,900
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna try to do it justice.

467
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,645
Speaker 1: It's a minute and 45 seconds long.

468
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:20,016
Speaker 1: just watch it and I promise if you know anything about music you will enjoy it.

469
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:25,239
Speaker 0: I Would always ask when I remember back in the middle school days, right?

470
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,366
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you have it like.

471
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:29,179
Speaker 0: say you have the note a right then you got a sharp.

472
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:35,435
Speaker 0: Well, it's a little bit a little bit higher than a right between A to B. Yes between an A and a B, but a B flats between an A and a B.

473
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:36,139
Speaker 1: They're the same note.

474
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,565
Speaker 0: They're the same note.

475
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:38,492
Speaker 0: Why do you even have both?

476
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:38,754
Speaker 0: Why not?

477
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:39,458
Speaker 0: Just only have sharp.

478
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:45,840
Speaker 0: You will like this video a lot because the video saying that video is clearly that about that exact question.

479
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,032
Speaker 0: That's why I came up with it.

480
00:34:47,154 --> 00:35:02,913
Speaker 1: Yep I Caught like this and they draw it the way Scott suggested And they basically their joke is something like but that'll only serve to get you.

481
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,679
Speaker 1: get you attacked by the people around you.

482
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:14,832
Speaker 0: Yep So yeah, so I don't like to reuse YouTube channels and things like that for thing of the day, but something extraordinary happened, right?

483
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:25,038
Speaker 0: So lock picking lawyer everyone's favorite YouTube channel The master of lock picking who doesn't do any lawyering on the channel other than to tell you don't pick locks You don't own.

484
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:33,413
Speaker 0: There was a another channel Completely unrelated to lock picking lawyer called stuff made here.

485
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:38,152
Speaker 0: I believe I think the guy's name is Shane maybe But he just makes he makes stuff.

486
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:39,280
Speaker 0: He's got a good YouTube channel.

487
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,766
Speaker 0: He's got like, you know, he's like seeing seeing stuff in his house, right?

488
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,670
Speaker 0: He's like, you know making stuff for real, right?

489
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,200
Speaker 0: His workshop and the idea that he came up with was that he wanted to make a lock.

490
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:59,555
Speaker 0: He's not a locksmith, but he's you know, making locks like, you know King Herb the derp No one on Tuesday geek nights, I'll get that no one on Tuesday.

491
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:00,920
Speaker 0: Nice to know that joke, but too bad.

492
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:04,740
Speaker 0: And his idea which is a genius idea, right?

493
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,200
Speaker 0: Now I want you to think about like you're trying to hack into a computer and you want to guess someone's password, right?

494
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,099
Speaker 0: Well, you type you have to type in the whole password and you either you know, if you're right or if you're wrong, right?

495
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,242
Speaker 0: You that's it.

496
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,828
Speaker 0: That's all you know, you don't know.

497
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:21,177
Speaker 0: you can't guess a password and it'll it doesn't.

498
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:25,934
Speaker 0: it's not like playing the game Mastermind where it's like, oh you got the first letter, right?

499
00:36:25,974 --> 00:36:27,420
Speaker 0: You don't have the rest of them, right?

500
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,365
Speaker 0: It does not how it works.

501
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,180
Speaker 0: You're either right or wrong when you're picking a lock.

502
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,060
Speaker 0: Let's see you have like a six, you know, it doesn't matter which kind of lock it is.

503
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:38,290
Speaker 0: But let's say it's like a six pin tumbler lock, right?

504
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:42,246
Speaker 0: Well, you might not get all six pins But you might know all right.

505
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,774
Speaker 0: I got pin one at the right height.

506
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,879
Speaker 0: We're good with pin one.

507
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,248
Speaker 0: now I just get to get five more.

508
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:49,404
Speaker 0: right you can hack it When you're picking a lock.

509
00:36:49,444 --> 00:37:02,740
Speaker 0: that's sort of how it works is you're you're guessing one part of the password at a time And if even if you've got, you know, if you got some parts, right and some parts wrong You know which parts you have right and you can narrow it down and break in very quickly.

510
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:18,380
Speaker 0: So the idea he had was to make a lock whereby the pins would only engage with the gate when you rotated it and So once it would once it was rotated you could no longer interact with the pins while they were over being tested by the gate.

511
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:28,758
Speaker 0: and there you couldn't do both things at the same time and Therefore you would have to guess the heights of all the pins correctly all at once and you wouldn't know which one.

512
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:32,473
Speaker 0: you would either Know if you're right or wrong, but you wouldn't know which ones were right or wrong.

513
00:37:32,814 --> 00:37:36,387
Speaker 1: the way you are in a normal lock I want to say there's a kind of lock.

514
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,174
Speaker 1: I think it's traveling keyway.

515
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:39,920
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about locks.

516
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:40,743
Speaker 0: What do I know?

517
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:45,922
Speaker 1: but there's a kind of lock where you put a key in and you rotate the thing and the key Leaves.

518
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:47,226
Speaker 1: you don't have control over it anymore.

519
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:51,459
Speaker 1: The key itself goes deep into the lock and then tries to open itself or not.

520
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:59,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that He finally manufactured that lock to a sufficient degree.

521
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:13,080
Speaker 0: You can see there's a whole series of YouTube videos on the made stuff here channel about coming up with the idea for these locks Making them right and then finally sending off the original version and the upgraded version which is to core to lock cores.

522
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:22,092
Speaker 0: Yeah they interact with each other and Sending them to the lock picking lawyer and then the finale the the video that makes it so that we can now make it thing of the day.

523
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:31,748
Speaker 0: Lock picking lawyer received the locks and on Memorial Day open to both And then suggested improvements.

524
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:37,572
Speaker 0: and then I really wonder with those improvements I want to see if he can you know, if they're fully improved.

525
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:38,356
Speaker 0: Can he open them?

526
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:39,179
Speaker 0: I don't know.

527
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:42,342
Speaker 0: We'll see about that now.

528
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:52,020
Speaker 0: the whole internet wants them to team up and Patent, you know the lock design and refine it and make a product right that we can then buy and put on our houses.

529
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:57,118
Speaker 0: So I think if you put this lock on your house people just bash your door in like this.

530
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:59,065
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, like a deviant.

531
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:05,370
Speaker 1: Ooh, along the other guy I follow who like is that's the kind of Infiltration lock stuff that I'm more interested in.

532
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:13,976
Speaker 1: they never pick locks and when he gives talks He talks all the time about oh, yeah, if I'm actually doing a job Picking a lock is like the 98th thing on my list of things.

533
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:15,973
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try Yep.

534
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:25,092
Speaker 0: So, yeah to his credit the maid stuff here guy because he sent a little a little tiny door along with the locks and I'm little tiny door.

535
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:27,365
Speaker 0: He Welded the hinge pins.

536
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:34,859
Speaker 0: I couldn't be popped out and the lock picking lawyer was like, oh I see you That's good because I absolutely would have tapped those.

537
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:48,520
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment We're mostly stuck inside but stay tuned for PAX East Online in July where there's a pretty good chance.

538
00:39:48,961 --> 00:40:00,120
Speaker 1: You're gonna see between one and three all new panels because we only submitted either new stuff or One of them is the same title as an old panel, but it would be basically completely different content.

539
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:03,500
Speaker 0: Pax West may or may not happen.

540
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,360
Speaker 1: It has not been decided yet nor have we decided if we would go because we don't have enough information yet to decide that.

541
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:18,660
Speaker 0: I'm leaning heavily towards not go even if it happens, but Not only for safety reasons, but because there would not be enough time to prepare and plan for it.

542
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,546
Speaker 0: It's already June.

543
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:26,816
Speaker 0: I feel like it's too late to plan impacts West But the odds of packs unplugged happening are significantly greater.

544
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:27,980
Speaker 0: So that is interesting.

545
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:39,240
Speaker 0: So I'm not saying we're going to that but I'm saying the odds are Much higher that we will be at packs unplugged and I feel like well that packs unplugged will happen.

546
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:48,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, if that happens and we are there I feel like I'm gonna get there Early and do a lot of additional gaming around that packs.

547
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:52,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe show up a whole day early and leave a whole day late.

548
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:53,280
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know.

549
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,327
Speaker 0: I got all kinds of days.

550
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:55,856
Speaker 1: All right, I got 30 vacation days.

551
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,268
Speaker 1: I got to use All right metamoment.

552
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:02,865
Speaker 0: the book club book is The tale of Genji.

553
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:07,363
Speaker 1: I paused only recently because I wanted to read a bunch of spider-man 2099.

554
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:09,055
Speaker 0: I read all the spider-man 20.

555
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:09,660
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess not.

556
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:15,381
Speaker 0: There's technically even more but I read all of the comic books of which the title is spider-man 2099.

557
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:16,475
Speaker 1: That's as far as I plan to go.

558
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:20,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I found out sadly that it ends.

559
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:22,719
Speaker 0: I didn't know this because I didn't finished it when I was a kid.

560
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,325
Speaker 0: Is that basically what happened?

561
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:29,877
Speaker 0: is they fired the editor because spider-man 29 was the only 2099 book.

562
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:33,699
Speaker 0: that was like selling well And the editor was editing the whole line.

563
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:38,096
Speaker 0: so they fired him and then the writers revolted basically and bailed.

564
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:50,939
Speaker 0: so Peter David's last issue is like two or three issues before the end and there's sort of a semi ending at that point And then there's a couple more issues and then another sort of end that's you know.

565
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:55,184
Speaker 0: And then that's like the end of the But then there's more.

566
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:59,437
Speaker 0: there's like a 2099 unlimited series that goes on after that and some stuff.

567
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:02,349
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever Yep, but it's warm out.

568
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:03,734
Speaker 1: I can read on the balcony.

569
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:04,799
Speaker 1: I can read at the park.

570
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:08,112
Speaker 0: I'm reading on the balcony for sure.

571
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:11,629
Speaker 0: I'm still I still think Except eat and read on the balcony.

572
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,774
Speaker 1: I'm confident in July.

573
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:13,839
Speaker 1: We'll do this book club book show.

574
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,486
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see.

575
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:19,439
Speaker 1: It's not a slow read unless you like really obsess over it.

576
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:21,939
Speaker 0: No, it's a I can read a few chapters at a time.

577
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I blew through the count of Monte Cristo pretty quick back in the day.

578
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,907
Speaker 0: Otherwise, let's be once you get used to reading it.

579
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:29,971
Speaker 0: It reads faster.

580
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, but otherwise just stay tuned.

581
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:33,100
Speaker 1: follow us on the internet.

582
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,043
Speaker 1: We'll be doing things.

583
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:37,557
Speaker 1: we're doing more and more things as soon as discord stages.

584
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:38,360
Speaker 1: support video.

585
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:44,040
Speaker 1: You're gonna see us doing some live streams and some things in discord as well in the geek nights community discord.

586
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,177
Speaker 1: So stay tuned for all that.

587
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,467
Speaker 0: Also Panasonic announced a new camera.

588
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:53,440
Speaker 0: if we get it and it works then it is capable right on rims.

589
00:42:53,902 --> 00:43:00,888
Speaker 0: Rims camcorder can live stream on its own with no additional equipment But it needs a wired ethernet connection to do so.

590
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:12,170
Speaker 0: the new Panasonic gh2 gh5 - that was announced can stream on Wi-Fi Directly to YouTube or twitch or even Facebook or anywhere.

591
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,660
Speaker 0: that's our CMP on its own with no additional hardware.

592
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:19,079
Speaker 0: You might want to use your phone as like a Wi-Fi hotspot to help it out, right?

593
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,046
Speaker 0: But it could just stream.

594
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:24,540
Speaker 0: I could just walk outside go to like the park turn it on and boom live stream.

595
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,040
Speaker 0: That's it with holding nothing else other than as long as it's Wi-Fi in the park, which there is in New York, right?

596
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,355
Speaker 0: So if we get that camera, you might want to follow us on our twitches.

597
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:35,317
Speaker 0: slash youtubes.

598
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:39,009
Speaker 0: cuz Spontaneous unannounced streams may happen.

599
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it'll be so easy to do.

600
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:41,480
Speaker 0: Why not?

601
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,110
Speaker 1: Ah, I just can't wait for that first packs, right?

602
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,880
Speaker 1: I'm back just dreams about nonsense.

603
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,225
Speaker 0: It could be anything.

604
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:49,268
Speaker 0: who knows what kinds of content.

605
00:43:49,288 --> 00:43:51,054
Speaker 0: it'll be not even geek nights related.

606
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:53,686
Speaker 0: Just like hey check out the park Whatever.

607
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,260
Speaker 0: Let's have a good nice review this park.

608
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:59,325
Speaker 0: Relax in the park ten minutes stream Talk to me.

609
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,953
Speaker 1: That's our equivalent of lo-fi beats.

610
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:02,340
Speaker 1: just stream us lounging in the park.

611
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:06,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, New York New York low-vis low-vis beats.

612
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:08,684
Speaker 0: So you'll be.

613
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:09,387
Speaker 0: it'll be in 1080p.

614
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:10,652
Speaker 0: It won't be low-vis.

615
00:44:11,476 --> 00:44:16,959
Speaker 1: and in the year 1999 a game called Pokemon snap was released.

616
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:19,133
Speaker 0: You did not have an end.

617
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:19,597
Speaker 0: Do you have an n64?

618
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,384
Speaker 1: No, I had never played.

619
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:26,360
Speaker 1: I did not play Pokemon snap during until at any point during its real run.

620
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,908
Speaker 1: I played it on an emulator way later.

621
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:32,983
Speaker 0: I Don't.

622
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:37,000
Speaker 0: I don't remember if like my brother my brother had the n64 by played it a bunch, right?

623
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,947
Speaker 0: I don't remember if he actually bought that game But I may.

624
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:48,878
Speaker 0: I think I may have played it like if not 1999 then like coming home from college at some point maybe played it in like.

625
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:51,872
Speaker 1: the thing is 2000 even though I was by the year 1999.

626
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:57,532
Speaker 1: I was like 100% PC gamer and I didn't really care about anything else except tabletop.

627
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:58,194
Speaker 0: I played.

628
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:01,792
Speaker 0: I was actually you know Most of my gaming.

629
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:04,766
Speaker 0: I keep forget, you know I keep forgetting this and then remember it's like.

630
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:11,012
Speaker 0: most of my gaming from like the late 90s through the mid 2000s was GBA DS gaming.

631
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,828
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, I was.

632
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,320
Speaker 1: I even got the GBA late.

633
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:23,011
Speaker 1: I got when the platinum GBA came out is when I got one because my mom even you know When there was counter-strike and tribes - you know all that stuff.

634
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:26,462
Speaker 0: most of my gaming was GBA and then DS You know.

635
00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:39,120
Speaker 1: and until the phone came along right pretty much once the before the n64 even came out I went full PC and never looked back And I didn't play console games again with any regularity until your game of cube.

636
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:47,494
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Pokemon snap was out But even at the time despite not playing it not having an n64 and not liking consoles.

637
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,727
Speaker 1: I was aware of Pokemon snap I appreciated it.

638
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:57,644
Speaker 1: I like I thought it was a brilliant idea and It was really surprising that There weren't any sequels like.

639
00:45:57,684 --> 00:46:02,059
Speaker 1: it was the first Pokemon first-person shooter and they just never made another one.

640
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:05,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Sun I always talk about which is that?

641
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,600
Speaker 0: back in the early days of video games, right?

642
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,068
Speaker 0: There weren't so many genres right?

643
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:15,247
Speaker 0: Like I guess there was the Space Invaders genre of you know, little shoot-em-up Yeah, but it's like what genre is pac-man?

644
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:16,793
Speaker 0: what genre is Dig Dug?

645
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:18,820
Speaker 0: What genre is root beer tapper?

646
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:20,304
Speaker 1: Sorry games were like.

647
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:25,140
Speaker 1: the genres that they'd list were like sports games action games puzzle games.

648
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:27,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there wasn't really like.

649
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:35,660
Speaker 0: the genres may be based around the theme of the games But mechanically all those old classic games were like very very different from each other, right?

650
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,877
Speaker 0: You couldn't categorize the mechanically speaking the way that like you'll have today 20 different first-person shooters.

651
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:45,800
Speaker 0: They're all Visually and aesthetically completely different from each other.

652
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,130
Speaker 0: Yeah from cartoons to like serious warship But mechanically are all almost identical.

653
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,060
Speaker 0: right and not into the control schemes everything.

654
00:46:55,621 --> 00:47:04,625
Speaker 0: Pokemon snap was sort of a rail shooter in a way, right but really was a Game in 1999.

655
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,049
Speaker 0: That was its own genre.

656
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,100
Speaker 0: the way that Dig Dug is its own genre, you know, it's like mechanically speaking.

657
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:11,989
Speaker 0: It's like you don't see that right.

658
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,821
Speaker 0: that what other what game has come out in the past you know.

659
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,589
Speaker 0: whenever that it you could say is its own genre.

660
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:24,535
Speaker 0: and then not only did it not sequel but No other games even like tried to copy it.

661
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,019
Speaker 0: yet I don't know if it was super popular but it was popular enough and it was really good and fun.

662
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:37,465
Speaker 0: and now finally in 2021 so 22 years later.

663
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:44,903
Speaker 0: Yeah They've made another one for the switch and oh my god It's pretty much.

664
00:47:44,923 --> 00:47:52,550
Speaker 1: in fact, there was an article in the Seattle Times that had the best headline about this game Pokemon new Pokemon snap strikes.

665
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:54,539
Speaker 1: exactly one note.

666
00:47:55,784 --> 00:48:00,051
Speaker 0: Yep, it does that well Yep, but it's like hey, there's.

667
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:02,681
Speaker 0: it's like if you released a Dig Dug in 2021.

668
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,109
Speaker 0: It's just you know, we're bomber.

669
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:06,019
Speaker 0: our man's his own genre, right, you know.

670
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:12,020
Speaker 1: But bar men keep getting sequels, yep, but Pokemon snap somehow didn't and I don't have a slide for it.

671
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:18,336
Speaker 1: But way back we did that panel egregiously unrealized potential where we talked about all the games that like no one ever remade.

672
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:20,586
Speaker 1: that would just probably make Ridiculous amounts of money.

673
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:24,948
Speaker 1: and we did talk about Pokemon snap a little bit but we didn't actually have a slide for it.

674
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:31,240
Speaker 1: it came up organically, but I Was surprised that it took this long.

675
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:36,100
Speaker 1: But the Nintendo switch is honestly the best possible form factor to bring this game back.

676
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:40,814
Speaker 1: No, other than VR, but VR is not accessible enough yet, right?

677
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:45,469
Speaker 0: So if you don't know anything about Pokemon snap It's a game where it's sort of a rail shooter.

678
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:46,192
Speaker 0: Like I said, right?

679
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:48,519
Speaker 0: You don't control your movement that much.

680
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:49,563
Speaker 0: You're always.

681
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:50,285
Speaker 0: you're on that.

682
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:53,454
Speaker 0: you're in this 3d world and you're always moving forward.

683
00:48:54,156 --> 00:49:05,660
Speaker 0: in the original Pokemon snap I believe there's a button you could press to go forward faster, but you can never go backwards and you can never stop Unless like a Pokemon got in your way or something, which wasn't which is only in certain scenarios, right?

684
00:49:06,302 --> 00:49:08,790
Speaker 0: And the current one I haven't unlocked I haven't beaten it.

685
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,797
Speaker 0: So I haven't gotten a move faster button yet.

686
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:13,646
Speaker 0: There may be one But you're on rails.

687
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:17,476
Speaker 0: You're just moving and you can't control where you move, but you're taking photos.

688
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:18,720
Speaker 0: You're you're a photographer.

689
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:29,828
Speaker 0: So while you're in this little bubble that just moves without beyond your control you can look around in 360 3d degrees, right Anywhere you want.

690
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:30,917
Speaker 0: you can just free.

691
00:49:30,997 --> 00:49:31,340
Speaker 0: it's free.

692
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,540
Speaker 0: Look, you can just look wherever you like and you can take photos almost as you almost infinity photos.

693
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,600
Speaker 0: You do have a limit but you can just go for another ride if you run out of film and take photos again.

694
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you take photos of Pokemon this Pokemon fucking everywhere.

695
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,717
Speaker 0: They're just coming out your ears, right?

696
00:49:45,737 --> 00:49:46,580
Speaker 0: You're in Pokemon land.

697
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,026
Speaker 0: It's Pokemon fucking everywhere.

698
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:49,252
Speaker 0: take photos of them.

699
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:51,100
Speaker 0: You know, you try to get good photos of them.

700
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,388
Speaker 0: You want them in the middle of the frame?

701
00:49:52,408 --> 00:49:54,260
Speaker 0: You want them to get you want to get close to them?

702
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,727
Speaker 0: You don't want it to be like a speck on the her.

703
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:59,759
Speaker 1: I want to get all different kinds of star ratings Like catch them doing different stuff.

704
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:05,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want the you know, the Pokemon when it's using a special move when it's flying when it's sleeping, right?

705
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:13,336
Speaker 0: well, you know you want Pokemon in groups interacting with each other right and When you run down the track There's sort of like these.

706
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:18,173
Speaker 0: you know The Pokemon are gonna do the same thing basically every time you go down the track with the caveat

707
00:50:18,194 --> 00:50:24,560
Speaker 1: that there's different like iterations of Each world where slightly different things will happen like you saw a lot of those as the game progresses

708
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:32,600
Speaker 0: But they you know the Pokemon are generally doing the same things You know in the same spots and you figure out how to manipulate the Pokemon, right?

709
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,466
Speaker 0: It's like well if I take a photo of this guy, for example in the original Pokemon snap I think it was.

710
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:45,620
Speaker 0: I don't remember the exact details But it's like you would take a picture of like a Magikarp and like several different spots and then when you got to the waterfall The Gyrodos would be there.

711
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,190
Speaker 0: But if you didn't take all those Magikarp photos on the way.

712
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,920
Speaker 0: if you missed one of them the Gyrodos wouldn't be there.

713
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:55,999
Speaker 1: This one has like the scanner and some of the things you scan will cause the environment to change a little bit around you.

714
00:50:56,902 --> 00:50:58,940
Speaker 0: Yep, you have there's a scanner.

715
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:06,428
Speaker 1: There's the apples that you can throw at Pokemon and I love how the game goes out of its way to tell you that the Apples aren't actually apples.

716
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:13,336
Speaker 1: They're a soft light Non-harmful like special fruit that will not in any way hurt the Pokemon.

717
00:51:13,757 --> 00:51:16,420
Speaker 1: but in game You're just talking apples at a Pikachu.

718
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:18,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you hit them they go out.

719
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:19,975
Speaker 0: they like bonk, right?

720
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:22,599
Speaker 0: They're not like, you know You see the Pokemon have been hit by it.

721
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,059
Speaker 1: I do enjoy that like I was throwing them at a big Pokemon and it just fucking ignored me.

722
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's these glowy balls that you get that are part of the lore of the game.

723
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:33,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a whole story.

724
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:37,030
Speaker 1: You're trying to get the luminescent Pokemon But I mean it's Pokemon snap.

725
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,219
Speaker 1: the plot is about as exciting as you could expect.

726
00:51:40,002 --> 00:51:45,326
Speaker 0: yeah, your research, but the thing is, you know part of the Universe of Pokemon right?

727
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:48,697
Speaker 0: is that there's so many different things you can do as a Pokemon trainer.

728
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:51,486
Speaker 0: right battling You know clothing.

729
00:51:51,506 --> 00:51:54,700
Speaker 0: you're caring for your Pokemon breeding Pokemon, right?

730
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,520
Speaker 0: But the core is really studying Pokemon, right?

731
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,022
Speaker 0: It's like you're.

732
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:02,740
Speaker 0: it's always a professor right right from the beginning of Pokemon to first game.

733
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:05,620
Speaker 0: It's like Professor Oak is like we are here to study Pokemon, right?

734
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,343
Speaker 0: I want to learn about.

735
00:52:06,685 --> 00:52:09,377
Speaker 1: none of that is really reflected in most Pokemon games.

736
00:52:09,397 --> 00:52:09,920
Speaker 1: You're out fighting.

737
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,975
Speaker 0: No, I mean you are learning about Pokemon as you play.

738
00:52:14,035 --> 00:52:14,156
Speaker 0: right.

739
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:18,329
Speaker 0: you're not doing research No, but you're in effect, right?

740
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:18,771
Speaker 0: It's like you.

741
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:19,856
Speaker 0: you got into the field.

742
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:22,165
Speaker 0: you see a Pokemon You've never seen before right?

743
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:23,911
Speaker 0: you learn what its types are right.

744
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:43,587
Speaker 0: It's like you as a player are Studying Pokemon when you play a Pokemon game, but in Pokemon snap It's more the your the activity that you're actually engaging Right your character in the game and you play regular Pokemon your character like red or whoever ash Whatever you want to call your Pokemon trainer.

745
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:50,411
Speaker 0: That's you isn't actively studying their catching battling right bicycling etc.

746
00:52:50,973 --> 00:53:03,564
Speaker 0: in Pokemon snap you are actively Studying the Pokemon as your in-game activity by photographing them Observing them in their habitat like, you know a nature photographer Basically, yeah, which

747
00:53:03,604 --> 00:53:09,960
Speaker 1: is extra interesting in terms of like hucking apples or pester balls or whatever that it's very much even real wildlife photography.

748
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:14,319
Speaker 1: You do things to get the animals to behave in a certain way to get the shot you want.

749
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:16,293
Speaker 0: That's yeah, it's how it is.

750
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:19,792
Speaker 0: Only you're not on rails, which is the most annoying part.

751
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,700
Speaker 0: It's like you can just walk around to do whatever.

752
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,355
Speaker 0: Yep, but I guess in terms of making this game too easy.

753
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:29,813
Speaker 1: The game is definitely designed to be playable by kids of all ages like it's very.

754
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:34,248
Speaker 1: it guides you very well and The things that are difficult don't like.

755
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:37,820
Speaker 1: if you don't get them doesn't quite prevent you from advancing.

756
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can definitely like even though I have been very there's like these Requests and I've got like 70 or 80 requests and I've only completed like seven of them.

757
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,120
Speaker 0: They're hard some of them, but it is not impeded my progress through the game.

758
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:57,179
Speaker 0: So if you suck at the game Or if you're just a child you will progress through the game and get to the end.

759
00:53:57,641 --> 00:54:13,853
Speaker 0: But to be good at the game to complete requests to get all the different Pokemon and you know All the different things and bonus point get high score photos is quite challenging You know even for me, so maybe someone else out there thinks it's easy.

760
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:14,797
Speaker 0: Okay, great.

761
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:15,540
Speaker 0: It's easy for you.

762
00:54:15,782 --> 00:54:16,896
Speaker 0: So I had a hard time.

763
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:23,920
Speaker 1: Yep Well, cuz it's partly a rail shooter like your your FPS thing skills actually do matter, but it's also a puzzle game.

764
00:54:24,201 --> 00:54:27,259
Speaker 1: You're trying to figure out how to get the shot that you need.

765
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:40,343
Speaker 0: Yep And sometimes I know in the aiming sometimes, you know, it's like, okay I know to get this shot I have to like Throw an apple and get it to land like inside that Bidoof's dam which is a hole in the top like sort of playing Basketball.

766
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:41,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

767
00:54:41,688 --> 00:54:46,549
Speaker 0: you don't just aim at the top of the hole and press shoot, you know You have to arc it right and it's not easy.

768
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,875
Speaker 0: and the thing it keeps moving.

769
00:54:47,895 --> 00:54:48,980
Speaker 0: you're constantly moving.

770
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:57,251
Speaker 0: So imagine like if you can't if you're in a car and you're not driving it You don't know what the driver is gonna do necessarily and you have to end as a basketball hoop that doesn't move.

771
00:54:57,552 --> 00:55:06,122
Speaker 0: and you have infinite basketballs and you've got to get just One in there and then after you get it in there the Pokemon comes out and now you got to switch to the camera and Get a photo.

772
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:12,366
Speaker 0: the sooner you get it in the hole the sooner you get to take the photo you get more photo Opportunities for the better shot.

773
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:17,007
Speaker 0: if you get it in at the last second and the Pokemon comes out The car is already driving away.

774
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:19,155
Speaker 0: You get like this is far away shot.

775
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,260
Speaker 0: You got no zoom lens.

776
00:55:21,461 --> 00:55:22,945
Speaker 0: It's a great but it's like.

777
00:55:23,005 --> 00:55:23,346
Speaker 0: don't it.

778
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:27,637
Speaker 1: but don't underestimate the difficulty of this game because it seems like a simple concept.

779
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:34,989
Speaker 1: the game has significant challenge even for skilled gamers and also Every moat time like playing it.

780
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,619
Speaker 1: so far I start to get a little bored Like I go through one area too many times.

781
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:48,400
Speaker 1: Like the game is tuned very well and at the moment I feel any amount of hesitation to play again the games like oh, hey, by the way new area.

782
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:58,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's night now there's a boss And even when there isn't a new area sometimes that it'd be like, okay, you know, you're at the the coral reef.

783
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:01,360
Speaker 0: great Well, you've got enough points in the coral reef.

784
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:01,862
Speaker 0: Guess what.

785
00:56:02,003 --> 00:56:06,120
Speaker 0: coral reef is now updated to level two and you can choose whether to go through the coral reef.

786
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,582
Speaker 0: You know what.

787
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:10,720
Speaker 0: any location has levels now that it upgrades to when you do get enough good photos.

788
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:15,720
Speaker 0: So like you see any area starts at level one and it's like there's a few Pokemon around.

789
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:20,578
Speaker 0: Then it when you get enough good photos with a high enough total score in that area.

790
00:56:20,598 --> 00:56:22,244
Speaker 0: it Unlocked that level.

791
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:26,277
Speaker 0: you can visit it at level two or level three or even higher levels.

792
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:36,264
Speaker 0: I think Depending on which area it is and when you visit an area at a higher level you see more, you know more Pokemon there You know, it starts off.

793
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:37,168
Speaker 0: There's like one bull.

794
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,695
Speaker 0: you come back again at level two.

795
00:56:38,715 --> 00:56:39,840
Speaker 0: There's like a whole field of bulls.

796
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:42,178
Speaker 0: It's like all that You know.

797
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:50,876
Speaker 0: There's different stuff is happening and that keeps to the air as a way to keep the areas fresh even though you're revisiting the same Place over and over again, right?

798
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,153
Speaker 0: Imagine if you're playing counter-strike and it's like dust again.

799
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:58,450
Speaker 0: It's like nope upgraded dust Yeah, and then you play upgraded dust 20 times.

800
00:56:58,510 --> 00:56:58,911
Speaker 0: It's like man.

801
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:00,015
Speaker 0: I'm bored of upgraded dust.

802
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:01,340
Speaker 0: Okay, we upgraded dust again.

803
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,446
Speaker 0: It's upgraded twice now.

804
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,820
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, it just keeps getting better.

805
00:57:05,484 --> 00:57:07,720
Speaker 0: It's still dust but it's like now there's more crates.

806
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:14,575
Speaker 1: Yeah new bomb spot But I appreciate to how they kept the camera.

807
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:19,472
Speaker 1: like one Mistake a game like this could make is make the camera itself too complex.

808
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:24,247
Speaker 1: You're not fussing around with like Brightness and worrying about focal length.

809
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,753
Speaker 1: You can pretty much use a little bit.

810
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:27,520
Speaker 0: Come on didn't do that either exactly.

811
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,074
Speaker 1: But once you get the photos the game is a lot of quality of life stuff.

812
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:37,073
Speaker 1: one to make it quick Take till I get them all ranked like it has like the gates it puts around.

813
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:45,400
Speaker 1: what photos you can submit after a mission Are pretty good to keep you from sort of doing the unfun kind of min maxing that you could possibly do.

814
00:57:45,801 --> 00:57:51,320
Speaker 1: You can only submit just like in the old game one image of each kind of Pokemon from that run.

815
00:57:51,427 --> 00:58:08,140
Speaker 1: Yep so pick the best one from each one kind of like what I do with real photos in a pre kovat world and hopefully a Post-covid world where I sit in Lightroom and I say alright of all these pictures I took a Scott pick at his nose, which one is the one that I'm actually gonna like save and do something with.

816
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:09,477
Speaker 0: That's right.

817
00:58:10,752 --> 00:58:11,000
Speaker 0: But yeah.

818
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:20,846
Speaker 0: So the problem is is that you can sit there and you can by hand pick the best photo of each Pokemon to submit and get scored And that's kind of tedious.

819
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,240
Speaker 0: But if you want to win you kind of got to do it to get the best scores.

820
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:27,920
Speaker 1: Yep, but I kind of enjoy that like looking at the phone.

821
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:30,007
Speaker 1: I like looking at the four photos.

822
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:33,820
Speaker 1: I took it like some Pikachu and being like, that's the one that's gonna get me a new star.

823
00:58:34,584 --> 00:58:37,660
Speaker 0: See, I'm just lazy and I'm like screw that I picked the auto option.

824
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,000
Speaker 0: The auto option is apparently not the way to win the game.

825
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,329
Speaker 0: The auto option is gonna.

826
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:48,700
Speaker 0: I don't know what its logic is But it does not always pick the best highest scoring photo of the ones you have chosen.

827
00:58:49,843 --> 00:59:02,007
Speaker 0: It has some other criteria But it saves you a lot of time and you can go right back to taking photos and skip the sorting photos phase basically completely And it costs nothing to do.

828
00:59:02,027 --> 00:59:07,447
Speaker 0: and it often does pick higher scoring photos Just not necessarily the best ones.

829
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:11,120
Speaker 0: So but it's there for you if that's how you want to play which is really nice.

830
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:17,580
Speaker 1: I also like how you choose like which four photos represent that Pokemon in your particular playthrough of the game.

831
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:23,459
Speaker 1: So if you hang out with someone else, they might have they'll have very different photos of that same Pokemon likely.

832
00:59:24,781 --> 00:59:30,416
Speaker 0: Well, I think usually each Pokemon has like four different types of photos you can get up like like.

833
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:31,900
Speaker 0: they'll be like regular Pikachu.

834
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,828
Speaker 0: I don't know.

835
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,079
Speaker 0: I'm just coming over like often.

836
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:43,740
Speaker 1: It'll be like a regular one one where it's eating or sleeping or something one where it's doing some sort of Interaction with its environment and then one that's like hyper specific to that Pokemon.

837
00:59:44,662 --> 00:59:47,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like doing some major special attack, right?

838
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,164
Speaker 0: so it's like you have to get.

839
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:58,160
Speaker 0: each Pokemon has basically four photos you can get of it and then of The four photos you can get a higher point value for each of the four scenarios, right?

840
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:05,920
Speaker 0: so it's like you want to get four different photos of the Pokemon one for each category and You want to get in within each category?

841
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:13,440
Speaker 0: You want the best like the best sleeping Pikachu the best eating Pikachu the best electrifying Pikachu and the best normal Pikachu, right?

842
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:18,315
Speaker 0: So if you take like your electric one that can't count as your normal one, right?

843
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:23,020
Speaker 1: No matter how good it is It sucks when you take two really good photos of the same Pokemon in one run.

844
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:27,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh, I got a great sleeping Pikachu and I get a great electric Pikachu.

845
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:29,300
Speaker 0: Which one do I submit?

846
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:34,327
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know how the auto chooses But if you're doing manually, it could be a tough choice.

847
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:35,049
Speaker 0: Yeah,

848
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:49,778
Speaker 1: and it seems to make it relatively easy by Nintendo Standards to touch up and share your photos just with people because while I'm playing this game to like play it for real I'm also taking photos of things that will not score high but are just hilarious to me.

849
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:52,643
Speaker 0: Yeah You can all.

850
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:57,900
Speaker 0: yeah, there's a lot of funny photos you can take with all the different situations the Pokemon in the way They interact with each other.

851
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:08,009
Speaker 0: It's like even though it's the same thing every time you go down that track basically unless you level it up Even you know, it's like if you go to the beach at level 3 It's always the same beach at the same level 3.

852
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:11,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, like unless you do something different It'll be exact same.

853
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:16,356
Speaker 0: things will happen Right in the exact Pokemon in the exact place at the exact times and the same thing.

854
01:01:16,397 --> 01:01:22,060
Speaker 0: it's pre-programmed But it's somehow every time you go down that track different stuff happens.

855
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:30,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see you see something you didn't see before because the car is moving just fast enough to where you can get your photos.

856
01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:36,519
Speaker 0: but if you're too slow you'll get a shittier photo or you might miss something or turns around a corner and you have to like.

857
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:42,520
Speaker 0: Sometimes you want to be looking behind you and you sort of learn by doing the same course over and over again.

858
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,283
Speaker 0: Okay, like okay.

859
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,469
Speaker 0: This is the spider.

860
01:01:44,509 --> 01:01:45,634
Speaker 0: Pokemon is gonna be on the left.

861
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:46,357
Speaker 0: I'm ready for it.

862
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:50,099
Speaker 1: this time That bird's gonna swoop down right after that tree.

863
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:58,255
Speaker 0: So I guess the high level play in this game is really a memorization game of like knowing exactly What to do when to get the highest points.

864
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,959
Speaker 0: Yep But I'm not interested in that.

865
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:01,843
Speaker 1: Well, there's enough.

866
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:10,431
Speaker 1: like if you just play the game going for like normal scores and just try to play it the way it tells You to play it You'll just progress at a pretty natural steady comfortable pace.

867
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:13,160
Speaker 1: and so far I'm having a lot of fun with this game.

868
01:02:14,002 --> 01:02:17,976
Speaker 0: You'll also discover, you know, the mysteries of the luma or whatever it is.

869
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:22,451
Speaker 0: as you're studying the Pokemon right and every each different is like these.

870
01:02:22,953 --> 01:02:26,913
Speaker 0: each different area has like Or like is in a group, right?

871
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:28,080
Speaker 0: There's like several different islands.

872
01:02:28,722 --> 01:02:35,990
Speaker 0: So like in each of the areas like the volcano area, I think is like, you know entry volcano In the actual lava.

873
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:42,993
Speaker 0: and then the third one is like, okay This is an area that's completely devoted to like this mega Pokemon.

874
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:47,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, these are like boss fights almost Yes, basically like a boss fight.

875
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:52,759
Speaker 0: But so you go in and you're driving around and there's only like really one Pokemon to take photos of.

876
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:55,027
Speaker 0: It's a magical Pokemon.

877
01:02:55,047 --> 01:03:02,531
Speaker 0: you're trying to study and you have to sort of figure out its mysteries Right by throwing stuff and taking photos at the right times.

878
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:07,968
Speaker 1: and figuring out the mysteries is almost entirely Done by throwing stuff at these Pokemon.

879
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,820
Speaker 0: Well, you know, sometimes you got to figure out like this also the environment, right?

880
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:21,506
Speaker 0: It's not just the Pokemon But there's things to throw stuff at in the environment that could make stuff happen or that the Pokemon will then respond to And you can figure out their behaviors.

881
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:25,439
Speaker 0: And so it's kind of it's like a fun little nature nature ride.

882
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:32,460
Speaker 0: Yeah like You know like a safari almost right, you know, it's the original Pokemon at the Safari zone.

883
01:03:33,062 --> 01:03:37,441
Speaker 0: And so when you go in those nature safaris at like, you know Disney World this kind of lay You know, it's.

884
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,847
Speaker 0: you're just seeing animals out there, right?

885
01:03:38,867 --> 01:03:39,409
Speaker 0: You're not really.

886
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:51,652
Speaker 0: but imagine if you did that like a real person You know a real, you know zoologist or you know, whatever, you know out in the wild actually observing animals Right in your little Jeep where you drive around.

887
01:03:52,235 --> 01:03:52,938
Speaker 0: That's what this is.

888
01:03:55,678 --> 01:03:57,994
Speaker 0: So Yeah, I'm glad they made another one of these.

889
01:03:58,054 --> 01:03:58,960
Speaker 0: it was long overdue.

890
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:05,920
Speaker 0: I think they can now wait a long while before making another one because this one will suffice for quite some time.

891
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,910
Speaker 1: Not only will it suffice but it's digital.

892
01:04:07,971 --> 01:04:08,795
Speaker 1: It's on a switch.

893
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:09,760
Speaker 1: It's a modern world.

894
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:14,280
Speaker 1: They could easily add content to it like they do to the games like Animal Crossing.

895
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,800
Speaker 1: I don't think they need to but they could I bet they will just to keep people excited about it.

896
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:22,193
Speaker 1: It generates a lot of good social media.

897
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:23,260
Speaker 1: We'll see how this goes.

898
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:34,375
Speaker 0: It's not doesn't seem like the kind of game Nintendo will DLC but I do wish That Nintendo would make more games that are genres of their own the way Pokemon snap is.

899
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:39,664
Speaker 0: there aren't too many of these right, so Not that you know.

900
01:04:39,785 --> 01:04:41,449
Speaker 0: there I have been other people who've made like.

901
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:48,785
Speaker 0: I've seen some indie games that are sort of in the the photo genre But not too many.

902
01:04:48,825 --> 01:04:51,836
Speaker 1: I keep wanting to bring up Fatal Frame, but it's actually not it's.

903
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:55,219
Speaker 1: it's not even related to involve taking photographs.

904
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently the most recent Fatal Frame was in 2014.

905
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:02,319
Speaker 1: Okay, I did not know they kept making those.

906
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,668
Speaker 0: I mean there was a spider-man game for Genesis.

907
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:06,574
Speaker 0: We had to take photos of all the guys.

908
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:08,240
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there was.

909
01:05:08,765 --> 01:05:09,879
Speaker 0: You need photos of spider-man.

910
01:05:12,972 --> 01:05:21,765
Speaker 1: But I think photography games even if they're if they're well made would either be too fiddly for a lot of people or Pokemon snaps magic is.

911
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:22,507
Speaker 1: it's not just that.

912
01:05:22,547 --> 01:05:30,789
Speaker 1: it's like this simple puzzle slash photography slash first-person rail shooter game But it's also that it's the Pokemon intellectual property there.

913
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:32,894
Speaker 1: people love the Pokemon.

914
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:39,672
Speaker 1: if it was the exact same game But it was like just non-descript generic monsters.

915
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:44,040
Speaker 0: I don't think just animal real-world animals I think that would be even less popular.

916
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:45,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

917
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,185
Speaker 0: So Yeah, Pokemon snap.

918
01:05:48,246 --> 01:05:55,700
Speaker 0: Oh, I think one last thing is that you know, obviously You know, we have created so many video games and video game.

919
01:05:56,282 --> 01:06:09,614
Speaker 0: I guess infrastructure around, you know pointing guns at people Right and a camera is one of the few tools in the world that you point at things and push a button Activate right and it has sort of that same, you know, even talk.

920
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:11,200
Speaker 0: we even call it shooting, right?

921
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:12,519
Speaker 0: You know you go and you shoot photos.

922
01:06:12,981 --> 01:06:18,160
Speaker 0: So it's that one of the few things we have as humans that has that sort of same.

923
01:06:18,762 --> 01:06:27,412
Speaker 0: You know interactive language of point at a thing and activate it so that you can use You know a first-person shooting engine for a photography game, right?

924
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:29,840
Speaker 0: You're just replacing guns with cameras.

925
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:33,020
Speaker 0: What else can you replace guns, you know with that makes sense?

926
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,140
Speaker 0: Like we've had some firefighting games a little bit right, you know.

927
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:44,160
Speaker 1: Well in VR it gets interesting because I remember I was talking to some VR designers God in a time when I could go to conventions.

928
01:06:44,702 --> 01:06:54,696
Speaker 1: But yeah, there was a complaint that a lot of VR like all the controllers for VR are very gun like and how they work Mm-hmm, but that is not because the games are all guns like.

929
01:06:54,816 --> 01:06:55,720
Speaker 1: people make gun games.

930
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,439
Speaker 1: But most games on VR are not like you using a gun.

931
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:08,916
Speaker 1: It's that guns evolved to be the way they are because that is a fantastic UX for humans interacting with things generally Yep, especially anything that needs to be pointed at something.

932
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:11,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know But you know you how?

933
01:07:11,764 --> 01:07:19,614
Speaker 0: there are so many things that aren't guns that have pistol grips that you can get Right for them because that's just a way to hold a thing.

934
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:20,800
Speaker 0: That's really convenient.

935
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:29,860
Speaker 1: But I feel like a lot of interesting games that are not guns but are like in the adjacent orthogonally adjacent to things like Pokemon snap.

936
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:39,080
Speaker 1: They're arising primarily in VR right now because that's the kind of interaction that's easy to do But I think there's a lot of ground that's still left unexplored.

937
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:42,812
Speaker 1: Even just games about photography could be made that I think could eat.

938
01:07:42,852 --> 01:07:48,508
Speaker 1: despite my people only care about this because it's Pokemon Complaint not complaint but observation.

939
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:51,217
Speaker 1: I think you can make games that do some of this stuff.

940
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:52,000
Speaker 1: That would be popular.

941
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,159
Speaker 1: I just don't think they get explored that much for a lot of reasons.

942
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:57,163
Speaker 0: It's just again.

943
01:07:57,203 --> 01:08:07,959
Speaker 0: It's nice to have a game where you can get the mechanics of pointing and shooting right which is fun Just physically, but not have the metaphor of violence and murdering with guns.

944
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:11,594
Speaker 0: Which we want to you know I think is it's we have enough gun games.

945
01:08:11,614 --> 01:08:12,959
Speaker 0: Do we really need any more?

946
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:15,071
Speaker 0: Really, you know portal.

947
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:18,310
Speaker 0: I guess kind of it was like okay It's a gun, but it makes portals doesn't kill.

948
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,279
Speaker 1: I'd say portal is very much an example of that.

949
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:23,152
Speaker 1: It's the first-person shooter where you're not shooting guns.

950
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:24,920
Speaker 0: sure it's still of it.

951
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,627
Speaker 0: It's still sort of.

952
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,586
Speaker 0: you know it's a little bit of a gun Just not completely.

953
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:32,180
Speaker 0: It's you know fires a projectile which a camera does not do.

954
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:46,219
Speaker 1: Now I just imagine counter-strike, but in the opening scroll It's just like these guns actually fire fluff bullets that look and sound and act like real bullets But are actually harmless and people just fall into a jealous sleep.

955
01:08:47,243 --> 01:09:00,201
Speaker 0: so if you have a switch And you know you got to follow my policy of buy a game and download it only at the exact moment when you were going To start playing it right that way you don't buy a bunch of games and fill up your game library and never play all Games.

956
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,269
Speaker 0: yeah this policy has been working great for me.

957
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,080
Speaker 0: my steam library has basically been cleared out effectively.

958
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,457
Speaker 0: You know my sweet pre-order this game.

959
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:10,984
Speaker 1: one day I decided I want to play Pokemon snap And I immediately bought it.

960
01:09:11,265 --> 01:09:16,692
Speaker 0: I waited until the moment where I said I'm gonna now play Pokemon snap And I bought it installed it and played at that moment.

961
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:23,656
Speaker 1: right all one two three well It took a little while to download, but then I saw I actually bought a physical copy because I imagine I might sell it or give it away at some point.

962
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:29,300
Speaker 0: But anyway I recommend you follow that policy.

963
01:09:30,444 --> 01:09:41,060
Speaker 0: but also Yeah, if you have a switch and at any moment you're sitting there, and you're like man I'd like to play a single-player game right now, and I'm not any of the ones that are on my switch.

964
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,323
Speaker 0: I'm not too excited about.

965
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:44,631
Speaker 0: I recommend Pokemon snap.

966
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:45,613
Speaker 0: that is a good choice.

967
01:09:45,634 --> 01:09:52,035
Speaker 1: if you liked the original Pokemon snap It's the same goddamn game, and if you've never played the original well.

968
01:09:52,395 --> 01:09:54,209
Speaker 1: This is a unique experience You're not gonna.

969
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:54,940
Speaker 0: don't really need to play.

970
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:57,940
Speaker 0: I don't know you need to play the original like you can see it on YouTube.

971
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,812
Speaker 1: I think there's any reason to play the original.

972
01:10:01,555 --> 01:10:05,839
Speaker 0: you can't mean it's still fun If you really want more, but the newer one is I think just better.

973
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:07,541
Speaker 0: Smoother.

974
01:10:07,963 --> 01:10:10,510
Speaker 0: you know easier right, but you know the original.

975
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:17,019
Speaker 0: I think the value I guess of the original one would be It still holds up You know just not as good.

976
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:22,600
Speaker 0: But also the Pokemon in it are gonna be more of the earlier gen Pokemon in that first one.

977
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:27,215
Speaker 0: So it depending how old you are right your nostalgia level now.

978
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:32,940
Speaker 0: those Pokemon in that first one Which are mostly or maybe entirely gen 1 Pokemon if I'm not mistaken?

979
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:38,320
Speaker 0: Might appeal to you more than this one which has Pokemon across many generations.

980
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:45,750
Speaker 1: So I just learned something that I can't believe I didn't know Pokemon snap the original was not a Pokemon game.

981
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,880
Speaker 1: It was intended to be some other game to use some peripheral.

982
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:51,271
Speaker 0: I do remember this now.

983
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:52,820
Speaker 1: It's Jack and the Beanstalk thing.

984
01:10:54,003 --> 01:10:54,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

985
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:55,451
Speaker 0: I think I remember this.

986
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:56,820
Speaker 1: it was developed at hell.

987
01:10:58,085 --> 01:10:59,080
Speaker 1: There's a whole story here.

988
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:12,830
Speaker 1: I'm not just gonna read a Wikipedia to you But basically the game was like this Jack and the Beanstalk thing intended to use the 64 DD peripheral for the Nintendo 64 and Later the game freak.

989
01:11:12,871 --> 01:11:17,680
Speaker 1: There's a whole story where they were like oh We need a Pokemon game and they came to some sort of deal.

990
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,873
Speaker 1: But that that Jack and the Beanstalk game was just a failure.

991
01:11:19,894 --> 01:11:20,819
Speaker 1: it wasn't gonna come out.

992
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:26,540
Speaker 1: So they just decided to take that game turn it into a Pokemon spin-off, and that's what Pokemon snap became.

993
01:11:27,462 --> 01:11:28,406
Speaker 0: Very nice, okay.

994
01:11:29,129 --> 01:11:34,360
Speaker 0: I think also just worth noting there is I've seen oh, there's a quote from a water.

995
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:40,940
Speaker 1: Originally Pokemon snap for the Nintendo 64 wasn't a Pokemon game, but rather a normal game in which you took photos.

996
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:44,079
Speaker 1: But the motivation for playing the game wasn't clear.

997
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:51,460
Speaker 1: We wondered what players would enjoy taking pictures of and later we made a somewhat forced switch to making them take pictures of Pokemon.

998
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,771
Speaker 0: okay, but there is a heart.

999
01:11:54,791 --> 01:12:01,920
Speaker 0: you can't find it, but There's like a hardware Pokemon snap arcade thing and I think it prints photos.

1000
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,204
Speaker 0: I was never entirely sure.

1001
01:12:03,264 --> 01:12:05,350
Speaker 0: I've seen the device like in the wild.

1002
01:12:05,932 --> 01:12:08,760
Speaker 0: it looks like a little like kiosk of Pokemon snap.

1003
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,420
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can like play Pokemon snap on it and print photos or put an n64 memory card in it or something.

1004
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:25,533
Speaker 0: But there is some sort of Pokemon snap arcade ish hardware thing And you can probably google find a YouTube video of someone demoing it.

1005
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:28,060
Speaker 0: that would explain it because I've only seen that it exists.

1006
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:34,048
Speaker 0: I've never used it, and I don't know anything else about it, but if you're really into it It's worth probably worth investigating.

1007
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:35,956
Speaker 1: yep, and I think they did something.

1008
01:12:36,237 --> 01:12:37,040
Speaker 1: they did some events.

1009
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,367
Speaker 1: I don't know if you can still get this but some particular Line of mini printer.

1010
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:45,683
Speaker 1: we had a thing with a special app that will just print your Pokemon Photos like.

1011
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:46,405
Speaker 1: it's a Polaroid.

1012
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:49,994
Speaker 0: that might have been related to the arcade device thing.

1013
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:52,280
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, it was part of a promotion.

1014
01:12:52,842 --> 01:12:57,018
Speaker 1: There's a whole thing here that I'm skimming but the reality is the game's just good.

1015
01:12:57,098 --> 01:13:03,696
Speaker 0: just play it Don't worry about all that other stuff Mm-hmm, and if you get good funny Pokemon photos right share them around.

1016
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:04,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Photoshop.
