1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,116
Speaker 1: It's Monday, September 28th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:10,498
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:13,185
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek knives.

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:20,568
Speaker 1: tonight We were talking about source code leaks and why they aren't always a big deal, but sometimes they are.

5
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:22,587
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:36,510
Speaker 1: So I've had a problem for Not a while, but just recently like over the last couple months That was very like infuriating to troubleshoot and it's a very domain specific problem.

7
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:39,550
Speaker 1: The problem was I would get ready to record geek nights.

8
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:45,107
Speaker 1: You know like we do with this kovat error remote setup and I turn on all my stuff.

9
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:53,190
Speaker 1: I got all my templates I got audition open I got OBS open and I joined the discord channel to be able to talk to Scott and so Scott could send me his video.

10
00:00:54,136 --> 00:01:00,121
Speaker 1: And I sound like a robot in discord But only in discord when Scott hears me.

11
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,470
Speaker 1: if I preview myself in discord, it sounds fine.

12
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,665
Speaker 1: Mmm, it's like this really weird problem.

13
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:21,603
Speaker 1: now Being an audio engineer and knowing a lot about audio hardware The one thing I do know the way I am able to engage with this problem at all because you google for robot sound Most people will think it's a bandwidth issue or a.

14
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:32,748
Speaker 0: so many people are Describe their audio problems differently and so many people are having different problems And it's like you can tell that what the problem they have is not the problem you have.

15
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:40,289
Speaker 1: Yep Like when someone somebody who's not in an audio engineer describes a problem to me I can be like it's this or I can just listen to it be like it's this.

16
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:49,161
Speaker 1: But if someone describes it to me and they're not an audio engineer if they say robot sound 99% of the time They just don't have enough bandwidth or their CPU.

17
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:51,410
Speaker 0: We should have actually recorded some noise.

18
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:57,430
Speaker 0: I could actually intentionally record some with the actual robot sound and it's basically a specific kind of robot.

19
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,925
Speaker 1: It's like stuttery like but a bit a bit a bit a bit.

20
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:03,734
Speaker 1: Uh like you sound like The whole time it's.

21
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:08,250
Speaker 0: it sort of gets increases though as like you're it's like if I don't talk you won't hear it.

22
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,707
Speaker 0: But as soon as I talk and or talk louder or more you'll hear it more.

23
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,997
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like it's a kind of distortion almost like a.

24
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:19,770
Speaker 1: yeah, so distortion is how I would describe it to an audio engineer.

25
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:27,250
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I know this is a sample rate mismatch and I have fancy professional hardware using ASIO.

26
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:31,503
Speaker 1: So I suspect that what's happening is some bullshit.

27
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:49,582
Speaker 1: application running on my computer is Telling the hardware to use the wrong sample rate compared to what the rest of my software told it or Some software I have is stupid and is assuming that the audio hardware is using one sample rate But the audio hardware is actually set to a different sample rate.

28
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:53,374
Speaker 1: That is usually the cause of that Specific kind of distortion.

29
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:59,390
Speaker 0: however, your microphone is sending an audio at 48 kilohertz sample rate, right?

30
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,830
Speaker 0: And you know the device your sound card is set at that sample rate.

31
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, and audition is using that sample ray and you know all your applications like, okay We know.

32
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:11,589
Speaker 0: to read data from this audio buffer, right?

33
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,539
Speaker 0: 48,000 times per second.

34
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,082
Speaker 0: Okay.

35
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:24,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, if something reads from that 44,100 times a second It's gonna be all messed up because it's out of sync with all the other ones.

36
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:27,213
Speaker 0: and that's the specific kind of noise you hear when that happens.

37
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:36,690
Speaker 1: and the magic part was my local recording and audition is fine because Audition is the thing that is controlling my sound device through the ASIO direct drivers.

38
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:41,826
Speaker 1: So it's some fuckery and some poorly written applications somewhere and I can't figure it out.

39
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,130
Speaker 1: So I need to test it.

40
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:57,069
Speaker 1: I just didn't test it because I didn't have time Like I had a plan to try to replicate the problem reliably and do like the technologist process of elimination to figure out What is causing this problem figure out what software is being stupid and then figure out how to fix it.

41
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:00,222
Speaker 1: But I could not replicate it reliably and I hadn't tested.

42
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:21,858
Speaker 1: just before we recorded this show I was changing an unrelated setting for an unrelated thing and I noticed something I Noticed that the sample rate that my pre-sonus universal control Which is the device driver that gives my software direct access to my audio hardware Said that the sample rate was 44.1 kilohertz.

43
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,862
Speaker 1: and motherfucker.

44
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:23,825
Speaker 1: I'm looking at it right now.

45
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:24,306
Speaker 1: It's back to 44.1.

46
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:24,547
Speaker 1: God damn it.

47
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,334
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's.

48
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,982
Speaker 1: I also saw that I could not change it.

49
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:39,685
Speaker 1: So the software was the driver was saying that Some software has instructed it to set the device to 44.1 kilohertz.

50
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:48,514
Speaker 1: So I go in all my software and I'm trying to troubleshoot this and I Close everything.

51
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:49,897
Speaker 1: I set it back to 48.

52
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:57,090
Speaker 1: It stays at 48 and then one by one I open software until eventually.

53
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:58,969
Speaker 1: OBS.

54
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:11,810
Speaker 1: As soon as I open OBS the video the video I'm usually used to this in the discussion of video card drivers The audio driver goes oh shit and switches in the UI to 44 and I'm like, you're the culprit OBS.

55
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:17,431
Speaker 1: It's like going to OBS settings and OBS says 48.

56
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:22,955
Speaker 1: OBS says it's using 48 of setting 48 and it's not even fucking using ASIO It's using MME.

57
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:26,107
Speaker 1: So it shouldn't even be able to set that sample rate.

58
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:26,850
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

59
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:31,626
Speaker 1: So then I close that OBS and I set it back to 44.

60
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,308
Speaker 1: I open the OBS.

61
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 1: it goes to 48.

62
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,852
Speaker 1: I'm finding the problem.

63
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,617
Speaker 1: then I open discord.

64
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:39,613
Speaker 1: It goes back to 48.

65
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:43,269
Speaker 1: So I found something online while I was talking to Scott getting ready to set up the show.

66
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:45,615
Speaker 1: It's a reddit post.

67
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:48,949
Speaker 1: Why does opening discord change the audio sample rate?

68
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,575
Speaker 1: Discord requires 48k for reasons.

69
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,820
Speaker 1: I do not care to inspect at this time.

70
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 1: I suspect that is discord.

71
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:00,650
Speaker 1: I don't know why discord is that way.

72
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,001
Speaker 1: I don't even know if it is that way but that appears to be the answer.

73
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,208
Speaker 1: Someone said discord only supports 48k.

74
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,595
Speaker 0: I think I've had it working in 44.

75
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:16,076
Speaker 1: I have to through MME Because MME abstracts a lot of this stuff.

76
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:21,109
Speaker 1: This is all the kind of problem that only happens when you were using direct driver access.

77
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:38,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, so anyway the problem I had was that disk, you know, I was having the same problem whenever I open disk OBS robot noise right and I thought it was a sample rate mismatch Because OBS only lets you set one sampling rate globally for all of its things.

78
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, which can't mix in my head set to 48 even though that wasn't working but separate.

79
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:50,009
Speaker 0: I had it set to 48. so then I went and I tried to set everything in the whole computer to 44 and OBS still was making robot noise.

80
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:55,228
Speaker 0: Then I said everything in the whole computer to 48 every single thing and OBS still made robot noise.

81
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:56,592
Speaker 0: when I turned it on I'm like what the hell.

82
00:06:57,113 --> 00:07:03,610
Speaker 0: and I found out there's actually a second setting where you can increase the buffer size on the ASIO device.

83
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:10,996
Speaker 0: So I raised it from 16 bits and I kept raising it step by step because I'd you want it You don't want to set it too high.

84
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,765
Speaker 0: It's like well, why not set a huge buffer?

85
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:13,910
Speaker 0: It's only a few bits, right?

86
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,570
Speaker 0: It's because a larger buffer means more latency.

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:29,922
Speaker 0: Yep, and the whole point of ASIO and fancy audio devices is to have as little latency as possible exactly, so I increased it one step at a time and every step I increased it the Robot noise decreased eventually, I think at 160.

88
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:32,030
Speaker 0: It was like an occasional pop.

89
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:34,514
Speaker 0: It was like sounded normal But occasionally just like.

90
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,679
Speaker 1: see that was the phrase.

91
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:41,085
Speaker 1: when you say pop that kind of distortion Will be like intermittent popping like it's a different.

92
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:48,830
Speaker 0: Yeah sounds different But anyway, so I just put it up at 192 and that seemed to be enough bits to avoid the robot noise.

93
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:49,779
Speaker 0: So I think I'm good.

94
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,547
Speaker 0: Everything's working.

95
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:58,170
Speaker 1: Yep so so I Figured out just before the show the specific problem that was going on and I'll link you all to some of these sources.

96
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:10,584
Speaker 1: Because if you're interested Windows if you have a Windows computer, it uses MME which is like this generic super abstracted Windows API and Subsystem for audio and it kind of just works.

97
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:11,730
Speaker 1: but it's also super shitty.

98
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:23,502
Speaker 1: And ASIO is the thing that the Chad hardware uses to do like real direct access and all the other things are usually just a mistake like WAS API.

99
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:30,990
Speaker 1: basically is What if you had an ASIO like version of MME that crashed your computer all the time and sucked?

100
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:32,990
Speaker 1: and caused problems?

101
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:44,650
Speaker 1: but these are the kinds of things you need to know if you're using expensive fancy audio hardware and you're trying to figure out why You have two different microphones and you can't only record from one or the other at the same time.

102
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:52,926
Speaker 1: This is the stuff you just have to learn about audio engineering But the final bug in the end is something so specific and annoying.

103
00:08:53,267 --> 00:09:02,101
Speaker 1: the problem was before at the beginning of COVID Scott and I set up a pipeline where Scott will stream to me with OBS.

104
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,870
Speaker 1: I will stream to me with OBS.

105
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:15,366
Speaker 1: I'm running a server that takes those two streams Merges them together with stuff and sends them to an OBS that goes out to YouTube.

106
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,279
Speaker 1: I Needed to run multiple OBS's on the same computer.

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,849
Speaker 1: I have enough power and hardware to make that happen.

108
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:33,143
Speaker 1: However, I had to set up a special OBS where my OBS's are all running in a local mode where they store all their settings locally in a subdirectory and don't store stuff in the Windows registry.

109
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,235
Speaker 1: the bug appears to be Portable OBS's.

110
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:40,370
Speaker 0: if I change the sample rate, I don't think it stores them in the registry.

111
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,601
Speaker 0: I think it stores them in like your personal app data folder or something.

112
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't actually look at the details of that.

113
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:51,290
Speaker 1: All I know is that if you run OBS in portable mode, it will store everything for that OBS.

114
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, the portal the portable OBS is designed to be put on like a USB stick.

115
00:09:55,751 --> 00:10:00,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, that way you could theoretically if you're like a streaming, you know Think about a streaming gamer type person.

116
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:04,996
Speaker 0: right you go on a trip to a convention You bring a USB stick with you.

117
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,562
Speaker 0: You sit down at a streaming station.

118
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,790
Speaker 0: You stick the stick in there you turn it on.

119
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,450
Speaker 0: Boom, it's your OBS with your sources and your scenes and everything already set up, right?

120
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,268
Speaker 0: So you're good to go.

121
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,670
Speaker 1: You also use it if you want to have like because OBS has a lot of annoyingly universal settings.

122
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:21,889
Speaker 1: So you might have two different portable ones.

123
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:27,169
Speaker 1: Like I have a very different OBS setup if I'm streaming a video game versus if Scott is streaming stuff to me.

124
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:51,730
Speaker 1: yeah, so It appears that if I don't run the portable OBS with administrative privileges Whatever setting I tell it to use for audio will just like not get applied and it'll force everything to 44 one no matter what I've set and I can replicate this Reliably with a portable OBS not running in administrator mode.

125
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:57,310
Speaker 1: That's the kind of fucking bug you get with that kind of open source software that you cannot Google for the answer to.

126
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:00,076
Speaker 0: Maybe OBS is the problem.

127
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:03,967
Speaker 0: Yep, of course OBS was a lot of things and OBS is really.

128
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:04,328
Speaker 0: it's just.

129
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:10,270
Speaker 0: I'm mad at them All the time because their software is bad, but it's still better than most of the other streaming software.

130
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:14,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know twitch is making an official one.

131
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's a thing, right?

132
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:20,341
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah the moral of that is I don't know.

133
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:26,196
Speaker 1: learn how to troubleshoot and gain the expert knowledge You need to troubleshoot the areas that you are doing Non-standard things in.

134
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:32,119
Speaker 0: but you look at you look for OBS problems on the internet and you find way old Posts that do not have good information in them.

135
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,760
Speaker 1: Yep wrong answers like Googling for OBS problems is literally just wrong answers only.

136
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,110
Speaker 0: and even if you're Google just for like what does this setting and OBS do?

137
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:44,068
Speaker 0: You can't even get a straight answer from anything.

138
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,330
Speaker 1: There are two different delays that do radically different things and I still am not clear on which one is which.

139
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:54,316
Speaker 0: Despite having read OBS source code, I guess We should.

140
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:57,450
Speaker 0: we should read the OBS source code, even though it's probably horrible.

141
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,950
Speaker 0: Write good OBS documentation selling.

142
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,477
Speaker 1: There are entire companies that do that.

143
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,862
Speaker 1: for remember Magento.

144
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:19,939
Speaker 1: there was a company that would sell me lessons on how to set up Magento come including Documentation that was accurate as opposed to the Magento documentation (laughter) Shop.Fur Elise.com.

145
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,570
Speaker 1: there's a reason why I never set that shit up.

146
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,160
Speaker 0: So the last geek nights Monday episode was so long ago.

147
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,550
Speaker 0: It was the day before the Apple whatever, right?

148
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,208
Speaker 0: So we got tons of news.

149
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,060
Speaker 0: There's so much tech news.

150
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,310
Speaker 0: Let's try to go through it quickly.

151
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,356
Speaker 0: All right, really starting.

152
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:38,125
Speaker 0: start as quick as one with the Apple thing.

153
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,090
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to the other thing first?

154
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,630
Speaker 0: All right, cuz it's so alright.

155
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:51,870
Speaker 0: So it was Apple watches and iPads right and the thing that stood out to me the most about that was obviously iPhones are delayed but iPhones have been delayed in the past, right?

156
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,572
Speaker 0: It's like they.

157
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:53,215
Speaker 0: you know, they're.

158
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,610
Speaker 0: they've always announced iPod in September for back to school.

159
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:59,907
Speaker 0: They replaced that with iPhone when they replaced iPods with iPhones.

160
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:05,010
Speaker 0: Yep And then it's been even in years where they had problems, right?

161
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:21,496
Speaker 0: Like where they ran out of rose gold or whatever or they didn't have enough glass for the screens or something Right, there were times where the iPhone itself was delayed But they still always had that announcement at the September Apple event right from the new iPhone every year like clockwork for them.

162
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:29,963
Speaker 0: to not announce iPhone means that delays For the new iPhone are much more severe than we have been led to believe.

163
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:37,610
Speaker 0: obviously delays because the world life Right, but this is Apple the largest most powerful company on the whole world.

164
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:42,150
Speaker 0: And they still couldn't do it to the point at which they didn't even announce the new iPhone.

165
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:45,010
Speaker 0: Right, that's that's a big deal, right?

166
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,083
Speaker 0: So it's like people said that's what it was only gonna be watches and iPads.

167
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,826
Speaker 0: and I said that may be true But if it is true, that's a huge deal.

168
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:52,230
Speaker 0: and it is.

169
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,840
Speaker 0: And as far as what they did announce, right?

170
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,563
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

171
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:01,921
Speaker 0: Most of that stuff was Stuff that we already stuff.

172
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:02,666
Speaker 0: we already learned.

173
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:03,330
Speaker 1: you need an eyewash.

174
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:19,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, we already learned when we were learning about you know, the new version of iOS, right but The advertisement, you know because Apple always has the you know videos they show right there commercials to convince you to buy their product.

175
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,525
Speaker 0: Yep, and the sales pitch is almost always it's magical.

176
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:24,850
Speaker 0: It'll change your life.

177
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,335
Speaker 0: Here's happy people.

178
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:31,210
Speaker 0: Look how the Apple devices are improving their life experience, you know.

179
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:44,670
Speaker 0: Just turn it on a wedding or a vacation or some other life thing and or everyday life chillin at home and look how the Apple Device and software makes everything magical and amazing and beautiful, right?

180
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,037
Speaker 0: That's Apple's marketing slogan.

181
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:53,197
Speaker 0: the marketing pitch for the new Apple watch was Not even joking at all.

182
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,890
Speaker 0: Not no sarcasm is get an Apple watch or die.

183
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:01,421
Speaker 1: Yep, because they added blood oxygen sensing right thing.

184
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:03,868
Speaker 0: So the Apple watch it already has heart rate monitoring.

185
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,437
Speaker 0: it has Sort of an EKG thing.

186
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,510
Speaker 0: It's an EKG and now it's can monitor your blood oxygen level.

187
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,930
Speaker 0: They had people come on who weren't lying.

188
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:16,450
Speaker 0: They were like, hey my Apple watch told me my heart rate was elevated and I wasn't exercising.

189
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:19,059
Speaker 0: So I went and I went to the hospital.

190
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,925
Speaker 0: They told me I was going into cardiac arrest.

191
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:21,989
Speaker 0: The Apple watch saved my life.

192
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then they're like, hey, we got these new cheap Apple watches.

193
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:30,269
Speaker 0: strap them on your kids And you'll be able to track them and know what happens to them.

194
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:34,324
Speaker 0: Right, if get an Apple watch for your kids so they could die be kidnapped.

195
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:40,956
Speaker 0: It was like a fear-based campaign rather than a Hope and magic based campaign.

196
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:47,090
Speaker 1: That's what's interesting because that is such a market departure from basically all Apple marketing up to this point.

197
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:52,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if Steve Jobs could have noticed or approved of that.

198
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:53,935
Speaker 0: Yeah I was not a.

199
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,763
Speaker 1: now the technology is cool.

200
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,390
Speaker 1: But of course there are caviar.

201
00:15:57,672 --> 00:15:59,281
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with the technology.

202
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,870
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm wearing an Apple watch right now.

203
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,374
Speaker 1: Yeah But also the health technology like.

204
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,822
Speaker 1: on one hand this is collecting very personal sensitive data.

205
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:09,070
Speaker 1: on the other hand that type of data Tends to be very heavily regulated.

206
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,010
Speaker 0: Like there's a reason why Apple is much better and the privacy game than everyone else, right?

207
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,988
Speaker 1: But if there's been Apple seems to be working and other companies doing this to.

208
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:37,383
Speaker 1: Increasingly people are trying to actually get permission to do actual health stuff in technology because usually it is not legal or allowed to do health stuff or make health claims or even track health data with Software or hardware without FDA approval or other special things.

209
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,790
Speaker 1: I'm being vague here because I do not want to get into the legal.

210
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:47,732
Speaker 0: Every time Apple does something like that, right and they always say oh you were partnering with such such hospitals such and such People.

211
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:48,678
Speaker 0: they don't do that on their own.

212
00:16:48,698 --> 00:16:50,809
Speaker 0: They always partnering with someone on all their health stuff.

213
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:55,218
Speaker 1: Yeah because HIPAA and Related things are really really hard to deal with.

214
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,947
Speaker 0: it always asks you permission if right and it does.

215
00:16:57,987 --> 00:16:58,508
Speaker 0: they don't share.

216
00:16:58,529 --> 00:16:59,893
Speaker 0: they don't sell Your data with anyone.

217
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:04,549
Speaker 0: they just use it to improve the product and I actually believe them on that and that alone.

218
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,037
Speaker 0: But yeah, they have.

219
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:13,650
Speaker 0: there are many criticisms to go at them But that is you know, you're paying them a fortune for the product.

220
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,952
Speaker 0: Why?

221
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:14,555
Speaker 0: because you're not.

222
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,030
Speaker 0: they're not advertising or stealing your data, right?

223
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,323
Speaker 1: they're not lying about that like a fundamental rule of all technology if you pay for it.

224
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:24,258
Speaker 0: if they were right if they were they Would be people.

225
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:25,670
Speaker 0: technologists would know about it.

226
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,078
Speaker 0: If they're all the eyes are on Apple.

227
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,359
Speaker 1: if they if they're lying about that right now granted other companies Just steal your data and throw it around all the time.

228
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,330
Speaker 1: They tell you they're doing it and most people don't care.

229
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,321
Speaker 1: But yep, they're not hiding the fact that they're doing it.

230
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,770
Speaker 0: Nope if but they're having you shit for free.

231
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fact that Apple instead of charging you $1,000.

232
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:52,821
Speaker 1: But as soon as Apple says they're private then people very much care that that is not a lie Yep, especially when they paid so much money to be private.

233
00:17:53,362 --> 00:18:01,650
Speaker 1: So in some other really really brief news You might have seen last time we talked we said we're pretty sure Firefox send is never coming back.

234
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:08,490
Speaker 1: They announced like right after we did that show that Firefox send is in fact never coming back.

235
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,550
Speaker 1: They basically said what we said, this is why we can't have nice things.

236
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mozilla is having all kinds of internal drama lately.

237
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Firefox is still the thing.

238
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,319
Speaker 0: I still use it, but we'll see.

239
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:22,970
Speaker 0: we'll see what happens to them.

240
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:23,592
Speaker 0: We need that.

241
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:29,759
Speaker 0: it says it's weird because as much as their drama gives you reasons to be anti Mozilla It's like we kind of need them.

242
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,570
Speaker 1: We need a chrome alternative.

243
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:43,826
Speaker 0: I'm sure even if they died right like the Mozilla Corp died completely like a hundred percent dead that the Browser that Firefox would carry on as in just an open source project with a foundation.

244
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,010
Speaker 0: So I'm not too concerned.

245
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:48,850
Speaker 0: I think it might actually do better as an open source project with a foundation.

246
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:51,115
Speaker 0: And it's like people.

247
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:54,606
Speaker 0: I still think it's funny that my Firefox is the alternative to Chrome.

248
00:18:54,887 --> 00:19:00,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Most of Firefox corpse money as far as I can tell comes from Google.

249
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:05,027
Speaker 0: paying them to keep Google is the default search in Firefox every year.

250
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:10,030
Speaker 0: So that's all I got to say about that, yep, so the video cards.

251
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,363
Speaker 1: I would like to get a 3080 and you can't get them.

252
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:14,547
Speaker 1: You just can't get them.

253
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:15,270
Speaker 0: I don't need one.

254
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:16,924
Speaker 0: I'll wait for like a 5080 or a 6080 or something.

255
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:26,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only the sole reason I want one is that I do have specific things I cannot do today that I could do with one.

256
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:35,305
Speaker 1: But also it's not just that that alone is not a reason to want a 3080 right now Because you can get like a 1080 and do a lot of things.

257
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:38,680
Speaker 0: but I also Have a 70 still killing it.

258
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,656
Speaker 0: I was playing doom eternal full frames Yeah, but whatever.

259
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:46,404
Speaker 1: well my 1080 so I can do V. I can do like VR up to like the most.

260
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:52,530
Speaker 1: you can drive a rift with But I could not drive like an index to its maximum like higher end index.

261
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,019
Speaker 0: The index is a better resolution.

262
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,297
Speaker 1: The index is like the best Consumer money can get.

263
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:08,974
Speaker 1: like if you want something that's better than the X you're getting an installation Like that's where we are right now and the 3080 can fully drive it like you can get the maximum Experience.

264
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,309
Speaker 1: and I'm really like invested in VR right now.

265
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:12,274
Speaker 1: There's a read.

266
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,530
Speaker 1: there are reasons why I want that but that is not enough by itself.

267
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,130
Speaker 0: The other reason I want a lot of money even if you do get one is that it's got to be worth.

268
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:24,283
Speaker 1: I do need to replace my HDPC because it's starting to die.

269
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:30,743
Speaker 1: It's so old like it's failing me And it has a GT 450 M in it right now.

270
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,317
Speaker 0: So mine has a. mine is like a 1050.

271
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,562
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna last forever.

272
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:42,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, a GT 450 is like Multiple order of orders of magnitude slower than a 1050.

273
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:43,754
Speaker 0: Also, it's like a lope.

274
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:44,818
Speaker 0: It's like a low profile.

275
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, this this is an old.

276
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:47,508
Speaker 1: there's like an i3 in there.

277
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,195
Speaker 0: No, no, it's not my.

278
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:52,068
Speaker 0: my HDPC case lets you put the video card in sideways.

279
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:52,470
Speaker 0: That's right.

280
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,237
Speaker 1: My HDPC case does not.

281
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:54,980
Speaker 1: that's how old it is.

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,442
Speaker 1: It's tiny.

283
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,567
Speaker 0: I thought it's the same case.

284
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,715
Speaker 1: the no It's like this VCR looking thing.

285
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,141
Speaker 0: Yeah, so is mine.

286
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:00,603
Speaker 1: It takes us.

287
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,270
Speaker 1: It doesn't let me put something in sideways.

288
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,275
Speaker 0: No, my video card goes inside.

289
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:07,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, my video card is in straight on and it's a half length video card.

290
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:09,759
Speaker 0: Okay It's the low profile.

291
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:09,860
Speaker 0: Okay.

292
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:19,730
Speaker 1: Yep, so I do need to build another HDPC and I want to be able to do tethered VR There and I want to be able to offload rendering to it.

293
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:22,170
Speaker 1: So I don't want to buy a video card for this thing.

294
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:31,864
Speaker 1: So buying a 3080 means I can take my 1080 put it in that thing and actually save some money and be good for a Long long time, but I can't get a 3080 by the time I can get.

295
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:37,649
Speaker 1: by the time I can get a 3080 I worry that 4080s will be on the horizon and I might as well just wait.

296
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:41,382
Speaker 0: No, but you're gonna get one of those so you won't be able to get that either.

297
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:42,245
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:54,257
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know Exactly what's causing these shortages because this feels like the worst shortage is the Nvidia misunderestimated demand And then they didn't put a day.

299
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:57,430
Speaker 0: So they started selling them before they had built up a large enough supply.

300
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,313
Speaker 1: Well, I think there were.

301
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:00,802
Speaker 1: previous shortages were caused more by like.

302
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,845
Speaker 1: there was a time when it was.

303
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,968
Speaker 1: people are doing the stupid coins mining coins.

304
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:04,919
Speaker 1: We're not really.

305
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:05,969
Speaker 1: that's not a problem anymore.

306
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:16,389
Speaker 1: No But I think the 3080 is just such a leap forward compared to the 20 series that it's like the time for people who have an older video card.

307
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:27,845
Speaker 1: like We always say when you're upgrading certain computer components like a video card if you're gonna upgrade during a cycle Get in as soon as possible to get the maximum value because things don't get cheaper over time.

308
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:32,228
Speaker 0: you buy a 3080 six months from Now it's gonna cost the same and you're gonna have six months less.

309
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:35,970
Speaker 1: Yeah of it and there won't be something better for a while yet.

310
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:40,690
Speaker 1: So like the 3080 like literally I saw the 20s come out and it wasn't enough.

311
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:44,621
Speaker 1: The 2080 did not do enough for me compared to the 1080.

312
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,364
Speaker 0: I did not like.

313
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,006
Speaker 0: I did not like.

314
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:50,015
Speaker 0: the Nvidia went from 1080. right.

315
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:55,335
Speaker 0: then they instead of going to 1180 they went to 12.

316
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:55,615
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:56,297
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,382
Speaker 0: I'm also annoying 30.

319
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:02,430
Speaker 0: So when they get to 90 what the fuck are they gonna do 180?

320
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:02,976
Speaker 1: But I at least do.

321
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,188
Speaker 0: and then are they gonna go?

322
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:09,110
Speaker 0: 283. how they gonna start going up by a hundreds and then by a thousands a thousand eighty.

323
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:27,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at all the trouble people are having figuring out what Xbox or PlayStation to buy again should have gone After 1080, it should have been 11 80 12 80 30 14 because they have been very consistent with what 50 60 70 80 90 means in the last two digits like that is Well known.

324
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:29,641
Speaker 1: the 50 is the low end or the mobile.

325
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,910
Speaker 1: the 60 is like the normal budget one.

326
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,119
Speaker 1: The 70 is for gamers the 80 is for pros.

327
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 90 is a little bit faster for twice as much money.

328
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's talk about the fiasco that's going on.

329
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:40,928
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

330
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,635
Speaker 1: So even when people can get these chips

331
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:53,051
Speaker 0: or so people got the the the board and some people were reporting that it was like You know, they have things happen such as like crash to desktop like you're playing a game and the game just disappears That's

332
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:53,955
Speaker 1: no bueno

333
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:55,140
Speaker 0: or weird.

334
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:03,310
Speaker 0: artifacts appear on the screen like, you know That show that there's like rendering errors in the math that the GPU is doing now the kind of video artifact you would see.

335
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:09,190
Speaker 0: So if you paid a lot of money and fought You know tooth and nail to get one of these and you were having that kind of problem.

336
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:11,220
Speaker 0: You're upset about that, right?

337
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:22,330
Speaker 0: So it was discovered That on the back of the GPU are the six capacitor banks basically and it on the reference board.

338
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:26,465
Speaker 0: So the one that Nvidia designed the founders edition is what right?

339
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:28,433
Speaker 1: the founders call it Right.

340
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:33,170
Speaker 0: So basically Nvidia makes a video card to go because Nvidia only makes money really selling the chips.

341
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:33,751
Speaker 0: Right.

342
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,276
Speaker 0: other people make boards, right?

343
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:39,409
Speaker 0: You could buy a board with a chip from Nvidia if you want to but people don't.

344
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,401
Speaker 1: yeah You don't want to with the key exception.

345
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:42,287
Speaker 1: I'll get to in a bit.

346
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:48,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, people buy gigabyte EVGA aces, you know MSI you buy your video card from someone else.

347
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,250
Speaker 0: They buy chips from Nvidia, right?

348
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,045
Speaker 0: That's how it's always worked.

349
00:24:51,892 --> 00:25:00,406
Speaker 0: so on the if you look at the Nvidia made board the reference board that Nvidia makes an Example to show the other companies how to make one right.

350
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:06,509
Speaker 0: to start with You can see these six capacitor banks and on the Nvidia board, right?

351
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,953
Speaker 0: Was it one or two?

352
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:17,344
Speaker 0: at least one of these capacitor banks is not just a single capacitor but is like a set of like a whole bunch of little guys.

353
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:21,988
Speaker 0: those little guys are Better and more expensive than the one big one.

354
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:32,286
Speaker 0: So you could if you wanted to just like all six of the banks filled with the fancy expensive ones But that would just be a pin in the ass and cost a lot of money.

355
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:35,550
Speaker 0: Yeah Or you could do six cheap ones, right?

356
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,415
Speaker 0: Because it's the same capacitance.

357
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:39,819
Speaker 0: The thing is what are?

358
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,507
Speaker 0: what is the point of capacitors usually in a computer?

359
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:43,390
Speaker 1: our regulation?

360
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:44,891
Speaker 0: Exactly.

361
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:55,450
Speaker 0: You're smoothing out the the the electrical signal because there's all sorts of electrical noise just in the world Right and you got this electrical signal coming in at a very high clock frequency.

362
00:25:55,592 --> 00:26:01,804
Speaker 0: So you can if you look at you know The oscilloscope you see like a line and it's going up and down five volts zero volts.

363
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:26,307
Speaker 0: five volts zero volts five zero up and Down and it's if it's a megahertz of like or gigahertz of very high speed that line is moving very quickly Right through your computer circuits and if any noise interferes with that Electrical signal there might be a one where there should have been a zero or maybe a zero where there should have been a one Right a capacitor right or a whole bunch of them really good ones.

364
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:31,180
Speaker 0: a raid Appropriately so can help eliminate noise from that signal.

365
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:34,709
Speaker 0: make sure that the five volts is five volts for a one and there's.

366
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:44,570
Speaker 0: you know The zero volts is zero for a zero right and that you know any noise that was in there earlier Doesn't make it through to the the actual transistors where the the signal matters.

367
00:26:45,852 --> 00:27:00,368
Speaker 0: So if you put in these shitty capacitors and the clock frequency gets high enough Where the sensitivity to small amounts of noise would be increased right if it's running slowly Right at a lower because these all these GPUs and CPUs these days is.

368
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:05,687
Speaker 0: but also When they detect a high load and they say well, it's not I'm not too hot yet.

369
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:06,430
Speaker 0: What's the temperature?

370
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:12,680
Speaker 0: all right, the temperature is not too high and The CPU is not messing up and everything's looking good.

371
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,847
Speaker 0: I can go faster and it's it's looking.

372
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:15,790
Speaker 0: it's like oh, we're too hot.

373
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,940
Speaker 0: All right, we can't go any faster.

374
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,929
Speaker 0: It's too hot now, right?

375
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,097
Speaker 0: We have enough electricity right.

376
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,650
Speaker 0: is the power and coming from the power supply powerful enough to go faster?

377
00:27:23,771 --> 00:27:24,032
Speaker 0: It is.

378
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:25,340
Speaker 0: it's not too hot yet.

379
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,528
Speaker 0: Let's go faster, right?

380
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:34,050
Speaker 0: And they go faster and they go faster and especially these cards made by not Nvidia have sorts of overclocking features, right?

381
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,970
Speaker 0: They're trying to go faster on purpose to make you buy an EVGA instead of an MSI.

382
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:48,926
Speaker 0: So those boards they're going faster and faster and faster you go The more a small amount of error in the signal is likely to cause problems.

383
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:50,370
Speaker 0: right stability decreases.

384
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,172
Speaker 0: All right.

385
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:54,861
Speaker 0: noise in a more sensitive system matters more.

386
00:27:55,403 --> 00:28:03,445
Speaker 0: and if you put in the shitty capacitors the cheapo ones Then a zero becomes a one and you got problems and then your game could crash or who knows what.

387
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:05,050
Speaker 0: and that's exactly what happened.

388
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:06,754
Speaker 0: There's a video.

389
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,861
Speaker 0: We'll probably link to it where they broke.

390
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,908
Speaker 0: They opened up a whole bunch of video cards.

391
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:12,036
Speaker 0: They made a 3080 graveyard.

392
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:28,950
Speaker 0: Add a video cards and they showed you which ones had the the reference design Which ones actually put an even more expensive capacitors than they had to good on you Yeah, and which ones put in six shitty capacitors?

393
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,509
Speaker 0: well, not shitty but cheaper than the reference design and neglected to use any of the expensive ones.

394
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:55,122
Speaker 0: and there seems to be looking at reports a very strong correlation between reports of crashing and other problems with the ones That have the cheaper components on them and in the tests run by various Gaming, you know hardware outlets that do that sort of thing.

395
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:57,430
Speaker 0: They have also agreed with this data.

396
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:09,633
Speaker 0: So if you're going to buy a 3080 you need to do your research on whether that card you are buying Which you know make sure that it's one of the ones that is made with the more which we haven't Had

397
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:11,821
Speaker 1: to do for a while when I bought my 1080.

398
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,290
Speaker 1: I didn't care if EVGA or someone else made it.

399
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,958
Speaker 1: I just bought whichever one because they were all pretty.

400
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:20,590
Speaker 0: you're not even using the EVGA driver or whatever using a video driver.

401
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you care?

402
00:29:21,334 --> 00:29:24,290
Speaker 0: right who makes the card, but now we care again.

403
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:28,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I only cared like how many display ports does it have?

404
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:29,647
Speaker 0: what cooler does it have?

405
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:30,650
Speaker 0: that sort of thing, right?

406
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:32,209
Speaker 0: I didn't care about who made it.

407
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:45,890
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think also what you're gonna see is that the next round of cards they get delivered or you know Maybe one or two shipments from now They're all gonna realize that that's a problem and they're all gonna shift to the more expensive design

408
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:48,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're gonna make a big deal about it, too.

409
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

410
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,649
Speaker 0: So basically if you buy one right away, you're just gonna make sure you get a good one.

411
00:29:53,092 --> 00:30:02,254
Speaker 0: But if you buy one months years from now, whatever you'll be All right, you'll all of at least even as long as you buy a new one and not like an old model that someone's reselling Or something.

412
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:19,990
Speaker 1: it is interesting though that this is the one time The one time I actually wanted the founders edition because usually the founders editions I'll link to a thing that explains this from the 1080 era Tend to have like shitty heatsinks and cooling or they're loud or like they're not really intended for normal people to use.

413
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:27,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's meant to be a reference design for the actual video card Manufacturers to copy from.

414
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,971
Speaker 0: but it's also the benefit of it is that it's stable Right.

415
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,330
Speaker 0: Nvidia tested the hell out of it and they're the ones who made the chip.

416
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:37,645
Speaker 0: So it's like yeah, it might not be that great from a customer's perspective.

417
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:41,760
Speaker 0: It won't have overclocking features It won't have the most video RAM.

418
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,004
Speaker 0: It won't have the best cooler.

419
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:50,710
Speaker 0: It won't look the nicest It won't have fancy lights or anything right, but it's gonna work Stably, it's gonna be rock-solid.

420
00:30:51,071 --> 00:31:04,359
Speaker 1: Right because this time through the most testing the founders edition looks like it actually has a more novel and innovative cooling system Than all the other party Book cards do like Nvidia.

421
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:05,463
Speaker 0: seen Nvidia looks like.

422
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:06,024
Speaker 0: I've seen it.

423
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,590
Speaker 0: Nvidia did try a little harder this time.

424
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:13,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's the first time I actually wanted the founders edition and then when this cap thing happened I really want the founders edition.

425
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:17,287
Speaker 1: Guess what is literally impossible to get the founders edition.

426
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:19,880
Speaker 0: Yeah So it is kind of it does?

427
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,624
Speaker 0: it does look.

428
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:26,808
Speaker 0: in my opinion at least I'm the kind of person who doesn't like, you know, lots of LED colors and and Plastic.

429
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:32,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, the founders edition looks like a classy normal computer component.

430
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:35,010
Speaker 0: it's like yeah, that's what computers look like.

431
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:43,204
Speaker 0: It's not like some outrageous things some teenager would buy while they're for the computer that they use while they're in their Race car chair or whatever.

432
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,534
Speaker 0: Yep No I would everyone else is selling.

433
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:51,939
Speaker 1: one thing I will say is people who are trying to get these things now like people are complaining That scalpers are the problem.

434
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:57,350
Speaker 1: There are a lot of scalpers but Scalping only happens when there is lower supply than demand.

435
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,662
Speaker 1: So that is the scalpers are not causing this problem.

436
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:01,907
Speaker 0: talk about this every time.

437
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:02,550
Speaker 0: the scalping.

438
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:09,320
Speaker 1: I just gotta remind you can I see some of you some people I know who listen to the show Complaining about the scalpers.

439
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,589
Speaker 1: They are not causing this.

440
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:28,450
Speaker 1: However, it's interesting that they're selling these cards for about the price of a 30 90 And the 30 90s just came out and I thought well if I can't get a 30 80 Usually the 90 is like not worth the money pay twice as much for like 10% more performance.

441
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:32,070
Speaker 1: But if I can only get a scalp 38, I might as well as to get a 30 90.

442
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,643
Speaker 1: Nope, people you can't get the 30 90s either.

443
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:35,828
Speaker 1: They made even less of those.

444
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:37,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz who wants this?

445
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:41,721
Speaker 1: Well gamer nerds want them and gamer nerds made the same calculus.

446
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:49,645
Speaker 1: I made if a scalp 30 80 cost 1500 bucks Why don't I just buy a 30 90 for 1500 bucks MSRP?

447
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,090
Speaker 0: I just buy nothing.

448
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:54,363
Speaker 0: Buy it via, you know, a 1070 that I have.

449
00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:55,730
Speaker 0: that's perfectly fine and wait it out.

450
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,484
Speaker 1: Yep, the tricky the hard part is brand new old video cards.

451
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,150
Speaker 1: Don't get cheaper when new ones come out.

452
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,604
Speaker 1: That's one of the things that you can't.

453
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:03,028
Speaker 0: you got it.

454
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:07,069
Speaker 0: You got to get a used one that someone else is dumping because they successfully got.

455
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,750
Speaker 1: yup Our friend chase got to 1080 titanium's for not that much money.

456
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:12,854
Speaker 1: Yep, just SLI.

457
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:14,820
Speaker 1: Um, that won't be as fast as the 38 of it.

458
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,282
Speaker 1: You know what?

459
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:16,265
Speaker 1: That is great.

460
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:19,178
Speaker 1: I'm crazy fucking fast That's fine.

461
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:25,310
Speaker 1: You're gonna be good with that for a long time Unless you're trying to drive an index at full steam, but not many people have that use case.

462
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,800
Speaker 0: All right, is that enough news?

463
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:28,966
Speaker 1: unless you want to talk about?

464
00:33:29,046 --> 00:33:29,730
Speaker 1: if this then that?

465
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:31,433
Speaker 0: Just quickly.

466
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:32,176
Speaker 0: So there's a website.

467
00:33:32,236 --> 00:33:37,763
Speaker 0: I've been using for a very long time probably since beacon days Called ifttt.com.

468
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:38,930
Speaker 0: you may have heard of this website.

469
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:44,207
Speaker 0: If this then that and what the website does is basically they on their end on their servers.

470
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:57,529
Speaker 0: They have implemented Libraries to interface with the API's of most web applications as well as many other things and They allow you to then create rules on your own.

471
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,439
Speaker 0: You know you off that you get using OAuth.

472
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:19,790
Speaker 0: you give them authentication to the various services like there So their servers can for example tweet on my Twitter account or you know, read from my reddit account or whatever And then you can create rules if this then that to connect services together in ways That would be difficult for someone who doesn't know how to write software.

473
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,661
Speaker 0: So for example, you can create a rule like if I like a YouTube video tweet about it.

474
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:30,156
Speaker 0: if I like something on Facebook tweet it.

475
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:34,659
Speaker 0: if I If someone tweets at me text me.

476
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:40,817
Speaker 0: if somebody you know emails me Tweet the text of their email to the whole world.

477
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:55,290
Speaker 1: you can if the weather is cold on Tuesday text rim It's you know, if you're if like if you're not like enterprise people or business people This is no code integration One of the biggest things people want to do with computers.

478
00:34:55,571 --> 00:35:05,870
Speaker 1: The reason why computers can't do what people want is that they want to integrate things They do with other things they do and for reasons that is actually really really hard.

479
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,998
Speaker 1: That's what developers do.

480
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:07,804
Speaker 1: most coders.

481
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:12,390
Speaker 1: all the code They're writing just takes two things and makes them work with each other.

482
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,507
Speaker 1: That is like 90% of all code that anyone writes in the world pretty much.

483
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:19,710
Speaker 0: Yeah So anyway, so this is a great service.

484
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,732
Speaker 0: I've been using it for a long time and most of what I use it for is Backups.

485
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:29,269
Speaker 0: what I do is I say if I if I like a tweet as pin board, which is basically delicious, right?

486
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:33,633
Speaker 0: so I Remembers my business Right.

487
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:37,030
Speaker 0: So I say well, I think pin board finally bought the remains of delicious.

488
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,538
Speaker 0: So I have it set up to where it's like.

489
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:41,263
Speaker 0: if I like a tweet pin board.

490
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:44,112
Speaker 0: if I like a YouTube video Pinboard.

491
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:50,750
Speaker 0: if I upvote something on reddit pin board everything goes to pin board and then on pin board I back up pin board.

492
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:57,142
Speaker 0: So and I basically saved in some sense most of my web activity all Aggregated in one spot.

493
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:57,888
Speaker 0: It's really great.

494
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,881
Speaker 0: So I had about seven rules different ifttt rules to do this.

495
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:06,030
Speaker 0: ifttt was basic was free free service.

496
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,154
Speaker 0: You could pay.

497
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,558
Speaker 0: I don't know what you got for paying.

498
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:10,866
Speaker 1: That's actually why early on I didn't trust it.

499
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:14,179
Speaker 1: I Did not trust it to be secure in the early days.

500
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:14,841
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't.

501
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,790
Speaker 0: I didn't use it in the early days.

502
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,879
Speaker 0: I didn't use it for much.

503
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,430
Speaker 1: but oh, yeah, I use it for things I didn't care about but I wouldn't use it for like anything sensitive, right?

504
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:22,912
Speaker 0: I own.

505
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:26,790
Speaker 0: this is literally the only thing I use it for is backup to pin board feature, right?

506
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,767
Speaker 0: I don't do anything else with it.

507
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,148
Speaker 0: So they they're changing their mind about a few days from now maybe a week.

508
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,500
Speaker 0: for now I don't know the exact date.

509
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,430
Speaker 0: You can look it up yourself.

510
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:45,266
Speaker 0: They are going to a different model where you have to pay if you have more than three rules three rule limit And then you got to pay and I was like, alright, you know what?

511
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:46,070
Speaker 0: This is a great service.

512
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,070
Speaker 0: I've been using it for a long time, you know, it does this one simple thing for me and that's it.

513
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,514
Speaker 0: I'm not using it like crazy.

514
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,323
Speaker 0: So I will pay you.

515
00:36:55,564 --> 00:36:56,788
Speaker 0: I'd be willing to pay like what.

516
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:57,450
Speaker 0: ten bucks a year?

517
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:59,014
Speaker 0: Right something like that.

518
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:04,328
Speaker 0: twelve bucks a year fifteen maybe right, you know dollar a month for such a small small thing.

519
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:07,972
Speaker 0: Yeah They're charging They're.

520
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:20,577
Speaker 0: the price that they're they're asking for is like, you know, almost like ten dollars a month, but because I'm like an existing user Right, I Can name my own price.

521
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,305
Speaker 0: is their site back up yet or is it still?

522
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,250
Speaker 1: their site is still down?

523
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,481
Speaker 0: 502 her side is besides been down.

524
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:26,949
Speaker 0: They're having problems right now.

525
00:37:29,793 --> 00:37:38,310
Speaker 0: But yeah the They allowed me to set my own price and they'd said they would lock that price in forever because I'll make an existing person.

526
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:41,057
Speaker 0: but the minimum was still two bucks a month.

527
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:45,028
Speaker 0: and I'm like, that's like slightly more than I'm willing to go for.

528
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:59,925
Speaker 0: so What I did is I cut myself down to only three rules and I wrote software to replace all the remaining rules For does and now I'm gonna pay them nothing instead of $24 a year.

529
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:04,956
Speaker 0: So That's a thing IFT TT.

530
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,321
Speaker 0: We'll see how they do.

531
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,450
Speaker 0: Are they gonna get anyone to pay for it?

532
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:17,353
Speaker 1: So I am actually more inclined to use them if I am paying them and they are having a more professional operation That's true.

533
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:25,110
Speaker 0: And you are gonna get more because part of their their thing is that when you use them, you know You don't have a lot of flexibility, right?

534
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:40,609
Speaker 0: so like the rules that I replaced with my own code are actually much more powerful because I was able to fully customize the integration between the API's Your your integration options are much more limited when you use IFT TT because your interface is more limited, right?

535
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:47,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, but supposedly if you pay it'll be more powerful, I guess in some ambiguous way.

536
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:59,049
Speaker 1: now what's interesting is outside of if this than that like this is like the the lowest Consumer friendly option in this space for generic like web stuff that normal people do.

537
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,000
Speaker 0: This is one of the fast growing sectors of the economy.

538
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:12,978
Speaker 1: is no code integration for enterprises for companies for small shops for people like this is a Weirdly big and growing space.

539
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically have no competition, right?

540
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,485
Speaker 1: Well, they do but they don't have competition at the consumer level.

541
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:20,830
Speaker 0: right consumer level.

542
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:29,985
Speaker 0: But they don't have any direct competition except the only direct competition They have are other services that compete with specific rules.

543
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:35,822
Speaker 0: For example, maybe somebody out there is using IFT TT to as like.

544
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:41,389
Speaker 0: they're a social media person at their job or something or Personally for their own project for their podcast, right?

545
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:52,666
Speaker 0: And they're using IFT TT rules to like, you know organize their various social media accounts to be like All right, when I tweet post it on Facebook post on Instagram post it on whatever.

546
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:54,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just use code Like.

547
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:56,610
Speaker 0: you could just use code to do that.

548
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:04,813
Speaker 0: But there are other programs out there that are like social media managing programs that do that specifically Right.

549
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:07,310
Speaker 0: So I have TT could do a lot more than that.

550
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,310
Speaker 0: You could use it to you know, turn on your toaster when you get a text, right?

551
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:18,210
Speaker 0: But if you're only doing one kind of rule, right maybe you're using it for backups.

552
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:21,326
Speaker 0: well now I have TT's competing with a backup tool, right.

553
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:30,641
Speaker 0: so If you're only using IFT for one thing there may be a better tool But if you're using it for the wide variety of powers, it has.

554
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,530
Speaker 0: yep as soon as you're doing it doesn't have many competitors.

555
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:43,024
Speaker 1: If you're stepping across like domains like you're stepping across types of things to do It's really inventing new and creative things to do that.

556
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:43,807
Speaker 0: No one has thought of.

557
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:46,376
Speaker 1: Yeah Auto-flushing toilet based.

558
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:48,544
Speaker 1: Ah, I can think of some fun ones.

559
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:52,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah if you If this than that is actually pretty cool.

560
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:56,473
Speaker 1: I'm really curious to see where they go when they're actually gonna charge money for it Like I'm gonna look into.

561
00:40:56,674 --> 00:41:04,330
Speaker 0: I'm curious to see if they'll stay if they'll get people to pay because obviously if they don't get people To pay they're gonna be in trouble more than their website being down for a few hours.

562
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:17,570
Speaker 1: Yeah because the danger is are they going this route because they want to like make money professionalize the service etc, or Are they going this route because they are not making money and this is a last-ditch effort to survive?

563
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:19,057
Speaker 0: I think it's the second one.

564
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:25,464
Speaker 0: I think they need money to pay the bills because if it's the second one Moving a workflow here is really dangerous.

565
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:32,969
Speaker 1: if they go away Yep, because then you have nothing and now you have to pay someone like Scott to write you code.

566
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:37,304
Speaker 1: Or learn to write code yourself or find it or start a company that's gonna make.

567
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:40,355
Speaker 1: if this then that too and probably run Into the same problems they had.

568
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,387
Speaker 0: it only took me a couple hours to replace those rules.

569
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:53,870
Speaker 1: So yeah Well, anyway, it's time for things of the day.

570
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:57,703
Speaker 1: So this was posted like in our forum and I saw it around like.

571
00:41:58,044 --> 00:41:58,647
Speaker 1: it's pretty cool.

572
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:02,250
Speaker 1: But content warning It's got some flashing and it plays noise and it does some nonsense.

573
00:42:02,798 --> 00:42:10,130
Speaker 1: But okay It's this website that is basically like Lane from the wire like the anime Lane serial experiments Lane.

574
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:11,836
Speaker 1: It's like this I am.

575
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,662
Speaker 0: if you don't remember that anime you're young.

576
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:14,445
Speaker 1: Yep.

577
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,750
Speaker 1: That's a good way to put it.

578
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:25,050
Speaker 1: It's like this weird cool Glitchy website that is like wired sound for wired people and it's like playing music from a lane.

579
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:30,070
Speaker 1: But if you click on it, it says you are invisible and if you tell it you want to go visible.

580
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:36,561
Speaker 1: it's just a series of Fascinating like art experiments in a web browser.

581
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:40,190
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe like just go check this thing out.

582
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:46,636
Speaker 1: It's beautiful and weird but do not check it out if you have photosensitive epilepsy Mm-hmm.

583
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:47,907
Speaker 1: All right.

584
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:52,639
Speaker 0: Yeah My thing of the day is actually kind of old.

585
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,703
Speaker 0: it's not a thing of the day.

586
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,190
Speaker 0: really it's a thing of a few months ago.

587
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:57,366
Speaker 0: I just forgot to use it as thing of the day back then.

588
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:59,915
Speaker 0: I'm sorry But anyway, what this is?

589
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:01,863
Speaker 0: apparently the per this.

590
00:43:01,984 --> 00:43:03,490
Speaker 0: this seems a hundred percent legit.

591
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:08,274
Speaker 0: I have no reason to doubt it based on the information You know on Windows.

592
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:13,190
Speaker 0: Microsoft Windows is like a. you know, there's a lot of Windows applications, right?

593
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,764
Speaker 0: They come with Windows right that are sort of legendary even if you don't use them.

594
00:43:16,904 --> 00:43:18,049
Speaker 0: MS Paint, right?

595
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,293
Speaker 0: Microsoft what's the?

596
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:20,856
Speaker 0: what's the thing?

597
00:43:20,876 --> 00:43:24,590
Speaker 0: that's not notepad, but it's also not Microsoft Word WordPad, right?

598
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:27,318
Speaker 0: You know solitaire.

599
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:31,604
Speaker 0: There's a lot of Microsoft Windows applications and somebody made those.

600
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:33,314
Speaker 0: It's like.

601
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,743
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, you don't think about it But it's like.

602
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:42,630
Speaker 0: yes Someone's job was actually to make those things that every single person in the world uses pretty much sure has used at some point.

603
00:43:43,312 --> 00:43:44,329
Speaker 0: Someone wrote that software.

604
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:51,250
Speaker 0: You could go to you know Apple and you could work on iPad iPhone notes, that could be your job, right?

605
00:43:51,790 --> 00:44:02,330
Speaker 0: So here on reddit is a post from the person who among other things wrote Mostly on their own the Windows task manager, right?

606
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:19,227
Speaker 0: You press ctrl delete you click on task manager and it pops up and this person wrote that software That is that thing and they shared some amazing and excellent information that is relevant to Everyone who uses Microsoft Windows because if you use Microsoft Windows you use has been

607
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:19,528
Speaker 1: yep

608
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,043
Speaker 0: You use the software that this person created.

609
00:44:22,063 --> 00:44:23,150
Speaker 0: It's kind of amazing.

610
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:24,694
Speaker 1: Like reading.

611
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:27,025
Speaker 0: I wish I could write a software that that many people used.

612
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:42,250
Speaker 1: that would be something Like if test manager ever hangs or crashes do this thing old task manager will Have to respond and start making sense with a secret code within a certain amount of time or it'll launch another one.

613
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:42,512
Speaker 1: Like.

614
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,448
Speaker 1: I want to know more about the secret code.

615
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:45,011
Speaker 1: now What did he?

616
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:45,212
Speaker 1: what?

617
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:51,310
Speaker 1: what's coded in there for a new task manager to not like run into an old task manager?

618
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, you know, the task manager was written for like Windows NT.

619
00:44:56,086 --> 00:45:04,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, right So it's from the the late 90s, basically He said this is all based on XP as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app.

620
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:11,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the task manager that you run today has obviously been patched heavily since then But it's it's.

621
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:18,510
Speaker 0: if you go back in that history of the code repository It's that original one from Windows NT is still the one that's in Windows 10.

622
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,449
Speaker 0: It's just been patched and modified and edited over many years.

623
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,119
Speaker 0: So, there you go.

624
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,439
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm All right in the meta moment.

625
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,764
Speaker 1: I'm still stuck inside.

626
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:33,764
Speaker 1: We're gonna be live to tape Real soon like next weekend on Saturday at magwest.

Speaker 0: Is it like twitch TV slash mag west?

652
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:37,164

Speaker 1: It's in the main mag fest twitch.

654
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,760
Speaker 0: Okay So yeah, I guess we'll hang out in that twitch there.

655
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,443
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

656
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:48,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then beyond that We don't have any more cons coming up yet.

657
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:51,018
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start working on some other projects We've been talking about.

658
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,110
Speaker 1: so just keep watching Mine and Scott's youtubes and hang out in our discord and you'll see what happens.

659
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,865
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about any of these other things until we do it.

660
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:11,943
Speaker 0: Yep I do want to let people know though that you know Essen the board the World biggest board game convention also just known as spiel Which we've planned to go to didn't go to right whatever.

661
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:17,863
Speaker 0: It's usually an S in Germany is Obviously not being held in person this year.

662
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:21,117
Speaker 0: Yeah But they're having a spiel online.

663
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:24,848
Speaker 0: It's going online just like all the other conventions, but it's a hundred percent free.

664
00:47:24,868 --> 00:47:26,657
Speaker 0: So Check that out.

665
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:27,545
Speaker 0: It's gonna be in October.

666
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:30,830
Speaker 0: Yeah We're not gonna appear there I guess but it's a thing.

667
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:35,747
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not gonna appear there unless we have a game to Hawker of some kind pretty much.

668
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:39,569
Speaker 1: It's for game Hawkers Yeah, and we have a lot of half-finished games.

669
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:41,560
Speaker 0: That's the only kind of game.

670
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,710
Speaker 0: I think I know how to make it's a half.

671
00:47:44,472 --> 00:47:48,170
Speaker 1: If only you could just take two half-finished games, then that turns into a whole game, but that is not true.

672
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:49,650
Speaker 0: That would be so great.

673
00:47:50,552 --> 00:47:52,886
Speaker 1: You actually just have 60% of a game.

674
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:57,220
Speaker 1: if you do that All right, let's just get right into it.

675
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,910
Speaker 1: because we've gone on for a while.

676
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,549
Speaker 1: There was a lot of news, but I wasn't allowed to do a tech news roundup because it's not time for that.

677
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:03,715
Speaker 0: That's right.

678
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,650
Speaker 1: So source code leaks.

679
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,190
Speaker 1: We talked about a specific one of these a while ago when there was like our source.

680
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:12,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was also a source engine one.

681
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:13,225
Speaker 1: There's a bit.

682
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:13,828
Speaker 0: these have happened.

683
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:14,290
Speaker 0: That's true.

684
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:14,772
Speaker 0: Yeah,

685
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:34,570
Speaker 1: these have happened off and on but a part that we kind of glossed over was the sort of the generic ramifications of source code leaks like why do source code leaks matter and what Actually happens when source code gets leaked generically not like a specific instance of some game engine or something

686
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:35,586
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:42,353
Speaker 0: Okay So the first of all you had to you can't gloss over the fact that a source code leak can only happen when you're closed To begin with.

688
00:48:42,835 --> 00:48:46,286
Speaker 1: yep open source, like I can go to get and just get your source code.

689
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:47,430
Speaker 0: I can look at it exactly.

690
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:55,546
Speaker 0: so a source code leak is when a company usually a company because it's very rare for Individual person to have a closed source to application.

691
00:48:55,566 --> 00:49:05,461
Speaker 0: but it could happen Is you know, you have a whole team or a whole huge company working on a project Most of the developers you work on a project Almost all the time.

692
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:12,206
Speaker 0: unless it's very high security You have access to all the source code, even if you're not working on all the source code.

693
00:49:12,307 --> 00:49:19,970
Speaker 0: if you come and work at my company It's like I have access to tons of source code of parts and programs that I don't work on at all, right?

694
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:25,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you work at Google, I've been told that at Google they have all their code in one repository.

695
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:30,950
Speaker 0: They must have some sort of controls that keep people out of certain parts of that repository.

696
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:40,821
Speaker 1: I mean I work in regulated markets where like some source code like source code is very very granularly Like broken up based on who should have access.

697
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:43,050
Speaker 1: Sarbanes-Oxley starts to become a factor.

698
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:50,177
Speaker 0: Yes, but I'm sure though even if you did work at Google even though let's say my first day on the job at Google and I'm working on Google Maps.

699
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,410
Speaker 0: Let's say right they hire me for the Maps team.

700
00:49:53,154 --> 00:49:55,487
Speaker 0: I probably have access to all the Maps code.

701
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:56,795
Speaker 0: even parts I'm not working on.

702
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,270
Speaker 0: but you know, maybe I'm working on the restaurant review part.

703
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:06,209
Speaker 0: I probably have access to the directions part And I you know, probably won't have access to like, you know the search engine algorithm.

704
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:09,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's going on at Google, but I will.

705
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:10,247
Speaker 0: you'll have access to code.

706
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:10,870
Speaker 0: You're not working on.

707
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,856
Speaker 0: That's just how it is Even at a Google type place.

708
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,285
Speaker 0: So you have a big company.

709
00:50:16,385 --> 00:50:18,372
Speaker 0: The source code is secret You're not.

710
00:50:18,573 --> 00:50:19,957
Speaker 0: it's not shared outside the company.

711
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:23,790
Speaker 0: the company compiles their code and delivers only that to the world.

712
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:26,980
Speaker 0: And that's all the world sees are compiled binaries.

713
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,342
Speaker 0: you have.

714
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:29,489
Speaker 0: everyone has access to the assembly code.

715
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:31,586
Speaker 0: Yep but good luck with that.

716
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:36,649
Speaker 1: and All we'll say is decompiling is not the magic that non coders think it is.

717
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:38,736
Speaker 0: Filing does not compile.

718
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:42,229
Speaker 0: they can reverse engineer, but it's a pain in the ass.

719
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:51,229
Speaker 0: It's a big pain in the ass Yeah for reasons that are way beyond the scope of the show, but I want to learn about how an application how it works, right?

720
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,999
Speaker 0: Decompiling it is gonna be a pain.

721
00:50:54,019 --> 00:51:04,990
Speaker 0: and also these days, you know in the 2020s a lot of the source code you want is Web applications and that code is not delivered to you, right?

722
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,175
Speaker 0: You make a Google search.

723
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:08,625
Speaker 0: you send your search query to Google.

724
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,790
Speaker 0: They send you back answers.

725
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:14,550
Speaker 0: You don't even have the assembly code of the Google search engine to decompile in the first place.

726
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have a black box of data in data out.

727
00:51:17,482 --> 00:51:18,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't access that.

728
00:51:18,968 --> 00:51:37,110
Speaker 0: so Accessing that source code is incredibly valuable to a know how it works without and not you know If it's even if you have access to the assembly Knowing how it works without having to go through a whole pain-in-the-ass process of decompiling and reading assembly code and figuring it out.

729
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:44,749
Speaker 0: So it's extremely valuable to get this source code if this if it's a valuable worthwhile program that people use.

730
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:50,597
Speaker 0: So it usually happens because Someone who works for you leaks it.

731
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:51,119
Speaker 1: Yep.

732
00:51:51,259 --> 00:52:03,614
Speaker 1: It's almost common way ninety percent of the time when source code gets leaked It's an inside job almost all the time and the rare cases where it isn't Well, we'll get to that later.

733
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:06,123
Speaker 0: how it gets out it's not a rare case is where it isn't.

734
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:11,009
Speaker 0: are you usually sometimes I see Like old source code get leaked after a very long time.

735
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:19,986
Speaker 0: That's because maybe somebody who had the code work there at some point Stopped working there had a copy and then leaked it.

736
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:22,194
Speaker 1: way later Yep, got disgruntled.

737
00:52:22,214 --> 00:52:33,552
Speaker 1: a lot of reasons why someone bought a laptop that wasn't erased, you know stuff like that Laptop not erased or hard drive not erased used to be a primary source of that stuff Yep.

738
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:36,662
Speaker 0: Now you got to turn your computer in when you you leave a job.

739
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:39,030
Speaker 1: Yep, but what do you think?

740
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:45,150
Speaker 1: Why why do we even care like what are you gonna do if you have source code like the thing most people assume is?

741
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:53,906
Speaker 1: Oh if the source code of something gets leaked then that thing is easily hacked Which is probably the biggest myth of source code leaks.

742
00:52:54,307 --> 00:53:03,196
Speaker 1: because yep We have the source code to like TLS security type stuff and encryption and yet you can't break the encryption Despite knowing the source code.

743
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:03,497
Speaker 0: Yeah.

744
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:04,019
Speaker 0: Yep.

745
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:09,216
Speaker 0: This comes down to people misunderstanding the term Security by obscurity, right?

746
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:14,530
Speaker 0: So people think that like moving SSH to a different port is security by obscurity?

747
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:15,173
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

748
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,639
Speaker 0: That's not security by obscurity.

749
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:17,522
Speaker 0: That's just hiding.

750
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:19,410
Speaker 0: Yeah hiding is good security.

751
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:31,165
Speaker 0: actually, we use hiding as a security a lot of times for example when a Important VIP individual is riding through town and black limos that are armored.

752
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:32,629
Speaker 0: They have a decoy limo.

753
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:34,658
Speaker 0: That's good security.

754
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:37,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't know which limo to blow up, right?

755
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,035
Speaker 0: That's hiding.

756
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:39,781
Speaker 0: That's right.

757
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:50,246
Speaker 0: security by obscurity refers to somebody being able to Breaks your security mechanism simply by knowing how it works.

758
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:51,210
Speaker 1: It's so nice and point.

759
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:51,492
Speaker 1: You know what.

760
00:53:51,512 --> 00:53:53,689
Speaker 1: the best example of this is any lock?

761
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,939
Speaker 0: Pretty much any physical almost physical locks.

762
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, arguably all physical locks.

763
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,684
Speaker 0: But arguably if you watch lock-picking lawyer, there are some he can't pick.

764
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:09,943
Speaker 0: He usually just doesn't show him on his channel - yeah Yeah, but basically even lock-picking lawyer says there's no lock.

765
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:10,584
Speaker 0: He can't pick.

766
00:54:10,605 --> 00:54:11,307
Speaker 0: there are just locks.

767
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:25,336
Speaker 1: He can't pick yet Yeah but basically with a lock like if the only the thing that opens the lock is the key and the key is a Standard like how keys work for this lock system and then the code Embedded in the key.

768
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:35,830
Speaker 1: as a result both the lock and the key Have to basically know their own code and thus you can access that code or learn that code somewhere.

769
00:54:36,152 --> 00:54:38,829
Speaker 1: Like if I learn the code for a lock I can make a key for that lock.

770
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:40,455
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do to stop me.

771
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:44,790
Speaker 0: But also if you just know how a particular lock works, right?

772
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,121
Speaker 0: You don't need the key just by knowing how it works.

773
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:57,796
Speaker 0: You can manipulate the bits inside of it You know with the correct tools to get it to open right and figure out what the key was You don't necessarily need to have the key.

774
00:54:58,037 --> 00:55:02,996
Speaker 1: Yeah and code like a lot of security like encryption What it's really doing.

775
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:04,443
Speaker 1: we've done a show on encryption a long time ago.

776
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:07,211
Speaker 1: We're not gonna dwell on this but Doesn't?

777
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:19,588
Speaker 1: you could use the math to feel like if you know how the encryption works, you could do something to decrypt it except for the fact that the amount of work that we're taking is Disproportional and impossible in a reasonable time frame, right?

778
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,690
Speaker 0: So for example, if I have a secret code, right and it's like aha, you don't know my secret code, right?

779
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:26,264
Speaker 0: Your secret code is rot 13, right?

780
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:35,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like as soon as you know how rot 13 works, you don't need to know that 13 was the code They might have done rot 12.

781
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:35,742
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

782
00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:43,470
Speaker 0: as soon as you understand rot If you don't know it's let's say rot one is to take every letter of the alphabet and increase it by one.

783
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:47,050
Speaker 0: No, the word ass would become the word BTT, right?

784
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,008
Speaker 0: Cuz a B comes after a and T comes after s. that would be rot.

785
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:53,582
Speaker 0: one Going came out around the alphabet.

786
00:55:53,823 --> 00:56:01,237
Speaker 1: rot 13 came out of usenet culture primarily as a way to mask spoilers because rot 13 It doesn't you don't need to worry about.

787
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,250
Speaker 1: is this coded or in code like coded or decoded tags?

788
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:09,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, all you need to know is that looks like rot 13. just rot 13 and again and it'll be readable.

789
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:13,207
Speaker 1: So you could post a spoiler in an all text bulletin board in like the 80s.

790
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:18,170
Speaker 0: The point is if you know what rot 13 is you understand how it works now, you can break it, right?

791
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:25,199
Speaker 0: They're they're right, but if you know how public-private key encryption works You can just watch a YouTube video that explains how it works.

792
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,709
Speaker 0: that won't help you break into someone's SSH.

793
00:56:28,672 --> 00:56:29,494
Speaker 0: Yep, you can know.

794
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:31,079
Speaker 0: I taught you how it works.

795
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,763
Speaker 0: Look you can't break in.

796
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:35,090
Speaker 0: you absolutely must have the key, right?

797
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,899
Speaker 0: That's the difference between security by obscurity and not so.

798
00:56:38,682 --> 00:56:52,030
Speaker 0: if you are using security by obscurity Right where someone knowing how it works Allows them to break in it's not actually secure then having the source code means you're fucked because now they know how it works.

799
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,824
Speaker 1: You know keeping that a secret, but the other area is actually secure.

800
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's a vulnerability Right.

801
00:56:58,572 --> 00:57:03,570
Speaker 0: Well, if you're actually secure, you're not just obscurity then having the source code doesn't help them at all.

802
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,582
Speaker 0: They're like, oh look, it's an implementation of a Diffie Hellman key exchange.

803
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:07,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't help.

804
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:10,480
Speaker 0: great They did it properly and I can't break in.

805
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,404
Speaker 1: but that's where now.

806
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:16,084
Speaker 1: you're not attacking the lock You're not attacking Diffie Hellman that you're not attacking that because that's rock solid.

807
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:17,470
Speaker 1: obviously you're attacking.

808
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,576
Speaker 1: Did they use it wrong?

809
00:57:19,877 --> 00:57:21,441
Speaker 1: Did they implement it wrong?

810
00:57:21,762 --> 00:57:23,587
Speaker 1: Is there a library they're using that?

811
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,830
Speaker 1: lets me bypass it.

812
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:28,149
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff you can figure out from source code.

813
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,881
Speaker 1: You can figure that out without source code.

814
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:32,770
Speaker 1: most hacking does not involve source code.

815
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:36,540
Speaker 1: You figure it out by hacking at the system, but the source code.

816
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:44,919
Speaker 1: you might more quickly find one of those vulnerabilities Mm-hmm However, or it's basically just allows you.

817
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:46,423
Speaker 0: it just makes life easier.

818
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:48,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't make doesn't really change the game.

819
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:50,000
Speaker 0: It just makes it easier.

820
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:53,378
Speaker 0: so it can be like All those security vulnerabilities.

821
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:56,229
Speaker 0: people find vulnerabilities and stuff all the time without source code.

822
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:00,970
Speaker 0: They're sort of come as people are working at them slowly over time.

823
00:58:01,171 --> 00:58:04,627
Speaker 0: If your source code leaks then they'll be just a pile of vulnerabilities all at once.

824
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,190
Speaker 0: you have to fix.

825
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, because people will find them all very quickly.

826
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:10,485
Speaker 1: In fact, they might find ones that you know about and already have a plan to fix.

827
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:11,470
Speaker 1: You just haven't fixed them yet.

828
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:13,655
Speaker 0: Yep, that's that's a thing.

829
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:15,861
Speaker 1: but look at other things like.

830
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:20,917
Speaker 1: the other aspect people talk about with source code leaks is oh Well, if I have the source code I can make the thing.

831
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:36,310
Speaker 1: and that's where it gets a little complicated because just having the windows source code Without having some knowledge in context of the development environment It might be difficult for you to just quote-unquote compile it and have windows working.

832
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:39,141
Speaker 0: Now, I mean, it's it depends.

833
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:45,226
Speaker 0: it might be difficult for a normal person But I think as long as the source code is complete a lot of source code leaks are partially.

834
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:57,526
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, they're missing lots of pieces or they're only like they don't bring the entire source code repository They're just bringing like one particular build and that build might be a failing build with problems.

835
00:58:57,566 --> 00:59:03,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're like, oh, yeah This is Windows except half of this stuff is just references to libraries in other parts of the code.

836
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,894
Speaker 1: I don't have the source for.

837
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:09,148
Speaker 0: here's a leak of you know, Windows NT except it was halfway through development.

838
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:10,956
Speaker 0: at this point It's not the final version.

839
00:59:10,976 --> 00:59:17,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's like it's not perfect enough It's not complete enough that it's really giving you the whole picture.

840
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:23,149
Speaker 0: So, you know a per someone who really works hard at it who has the skills is gonna be able to get value from it.

841
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:29,350
Speaker 0: But you know, even if it's a perfect leak, they'll get even more value, but there's still not a complete picture.

842
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:35,840
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you do have the source code and it's legit and you get it to run now You can start doing fun stuff, right?

843
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,590
Speaker 0: You can make your own windows.

844
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:47,069
Speaker 1: You can make a fan windows mods that you couldn't make without the sort of make a windows that looks and acts like windows 100% except it logs keys and sends them to you.

845
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:49,550
Speaker 0: You could find Easter eggs that were so hidden.

846
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:54,409
Speaker 0: No one would have guessed them in a zillion years, but because you have the source code you can now find them instantly.

847
00:59:55,411 --> 00:59:57,599
Speaker 1: But what yeah often can't do that easily.

848
00:59:57,699 --> 00:59:58,803
Speaker 1: like games are a good example.

849
00:59:58,823 --> 01:00:10,269
Speaker 1: if a game source code gets leaked even with all the assets and environments There's not much you can do with that too Like you can't just take that and make another different game that easily because a lot of that code a lot of right.

850
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:16,751
Speaker 0: It's still a lot of work to make a game, but you could let's say you had the source code - What's a game?

851
01:00:16,772 --> 01:00:18,159
Speaker 0: but that doesn't have open source code?

852
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,245
Speaker 1: Oh slay the spire.

853
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:19,990
Speaker 1: There's an example.

854
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:32,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can make us I mean but slay the spire allows like modding kind of true true what's like a super closed source game That we care about and have an interesting Right.

855
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:34,363
Speaker 0: It can't be a cookie cutter genre game either right?

856
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:36,050
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, you got the source code to an FPS.

857
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,250
Speaker 0: It's like nothing was stopping you from making it FPS.

858
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:43,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, the work you'd have to do to make the FPS is like the work you have to do any amount.

859
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, right I guess.

860
01:00:46,616 --> 01:00:48,524
Speaker 0: what's a game with valuable source code?

861
01:00:48,564 --> 01:00:50,030
Speaker 0: League of Legends, maybe right?

862
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:52,830
Speaker 0: You get the source code the League of Legends you run your own, you know What.

863
01:00:52,871 --> 01:01:01,153
Speaker 1: some examples are some of these sub components of games like highly proprietary very good netcode Sure.

864
01:01:01,173 --> 01:01:03,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of thing or like real.

865
01:01:04,024 --> 01:01:05,410
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of secrets to that.

866
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,609
Speaker 0: It's just hard no matter even if they tell you how it works.

867
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:20,435
Speaker 1: It's more like you might be able to see a clever implementation of something but to understand it enough to use it You're probably gonna have to learn so much that you spent the same amount of time You would have spent just building something

868
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,590
Speaker 0: and even if you got it you suddenly now you need the hardware to run it on.

869
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,789
Speaker 0: Right, so running, you know a local like application That's fine.

870
01:01:28,211 --> 01:01:34,089
Speaker 0: If you got the source code to Google and wanted to run your own Google you don't have the computers to do that.

871
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:38,084
Speaker 0: You just wouldn't yeah, you wouldn't be able to run that on your own computer.

872
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,690
Speaker 0: Okay, it's just not gonna work.

873
01:01:41,272 --> 01:01:46,773
Speaker 0: You know you need like this huge Google, you know enterprise cloud deal to run the Google Like.

874
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:49,150
Speaker 1: oh I got the source code to a stock exchange.

875
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like regulated code.

876
01:01:51,357 --> 01:01:53,444
Speaker 1: Like yeah, the government's got that too there.

877
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:54,989
Speaker 1: You know exactly how it works.

878
01:01:55,069 --> 01:01:57,355
Speaker 0: like Yeah, there's no secrets.

879
01:01:57,395 --> 01:01:58,459
Speaker 0: They had to publicize how.

880
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,523
Speaker 1: yeah that by law.

881
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:00,608
Speaker 1: they have to tell you how it works.

882
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,090
Speaker 1: casino Is that the software in a slot machine?

883
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,409
Speaker 1: They'll tell you exactly how it works and what the odds are.

884
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:08,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

885
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:18,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, getting source code is not necessarily that valuable But you still want to protect against it if you are closed source for a good real like.

886
01:02:19,032 --> 01:02:30,410
Speaker 1: one of the example that causes the most trouble in the open source world specifically is Drivers for hardware that are not well supported on Linux like video card drivers.

887
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:40,209
Speaker 1: Yep, that's when you need like a weird Linux distro with like oh everything's open source And then I go somewhere else to get the closed source binary to make my video card work.

888
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:52,748
Speaker 0: Yep, and this gets you into like the final area of source code leaks and that's intellectual property problems, so Obviously the company that lost their intellectual property that was their trade secret or whatever.

889
01:02:52,788 --> 01:02:54,033
Speaker 0: They're upset Right.

890
01:02:54,093 --> 01:02:56,403
Speaker 0: So because now they're thinking they didn't want is leaked out.

891
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,347
Speaker 0: whatever who screw them.

892
01:02:57,367 --> 01:03:03,349
Speaker 0: Yep But now the problem is Not so much for them.

893
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:09,190
Speaker 0: It's actually that you want to look at the source code to learn and to do fun things.

894
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:11,630
Speaker 0: Right make your own mod of Windows or whatever.

895
01:03:12,212 --> 01:03:17,306
Speaker 0: But looking at that source code now legally taints you as a developer.

896
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,409
Speaker 1: I used to work at IBM.

897
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,430
Speaker 1: Do you know much I had to sign to prove that I had never worked on Java?

898
01:03:23,571 --> 01:03:25,758
Speaker 0: Right, exactly so.

899
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,964
Speaker 0: for example SQL SQLite, you know SQLite that's an open source program.

900
01:03:32,686 --> 01:03:33,048
Speaker 0: Well, it's an.

901
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:39,340
Speaker 0: it's an but they do not take Developer contributions right.

902
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:56,607
Speaker 0: if you want to commit code to SQLite Right, like you have a patch for them Like you have to become an approved developer to prove to them that they trust you and you're not someone who has seen Proprietary like code like you didn't work at Oracle or something that cannot.

903
01:03:56,647 --> 01:04:04,930
Speaker 0: that's gonna taint SQLite, you know and get them sued because they're including code that is somehow belongs to some other company.

904
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:15,283
Speaker 0: Right, if you looked at like the mario 64 source code leak and then you go work for a different game company Right, and then something in your game is looking like mario 64 like you're.

905
01:04:15,464 --> 01:04:17,470
Speaker 0: hey, why is that character jumping so well?

906
01:04:17,914 --> 01:04:19,449
Speaker 0: What much better than all other games?

907
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,670
Speaker 0: Endo games right that jump is just such a good jump.

908
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:27,611
Speaker 0: What whoever did that must have must have played, you know must know the code of mario 64.

909
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:34,390
Speaker 1: You just made mario 64 and by play and analysis reverse engineered the exact jump timing.

910
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:35,395
Speaker 1: That's cool.

911
01:04:35,656 --> 01:04:36,440
Speaker 1: But as soon as you?

912
01:04:36,641 --> 01:04:37,465
Speaker 0: really it is really hard to do.

913
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:50,370
Speaker 1: But as soon as you saw that source code, even if you figure this out on your own It's hard to prove that you didn't use that proprietary knowledge you had To make your implementation, right?

914
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:58,282
Speaker 0: So whether you're working at a company or for yourself or for an open source project You could taint the open source project or your company's work.

915
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:00,109
Speaker 0: If it's your own personal code, you're running at home.

916
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:00,510
Speaker 0: Who cares?

917
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:04,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're not a software developer, you'll never have a job being a software developer.

918
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:18,955
Speaker 0: Maybe you don't care either Right, but it could open up the open source projects you work on or the non open source projects You work on at your job to legal liability if you have seen Proprietary leaked code.

919
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:23,208
Speaker 0: so you might want to stay away from it or at least stay away from code.

920
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:24,030
Speaker 0: leaked code.

921
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:28,730
Speaker 0: That is in any way similar to code you are writing for something else, right?

922
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,004
Speaker 0: So if you're working in operating systems, don't look at a Windows leak.

923
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:39,408
Speaker 0: if you're working on games Don't look at a mario64 leak, but if you're working in operating systems, you're probably okay to mess around with a mario64 leak.

924
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:41,816
Speaker 0: You know, just don't go then man.

925
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:48,649
Speaker 1: The taskbar jumps at this perfect height like Exact exactly.

926
01:05:50,372 --> 01:05:51,097
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

927
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:52,063
Speaker 1: We've gone on over an hour.

928
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:53,190
Speaker 0: we have and yeah.

929
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:58,785
Speaker 0: But if you are a company or you are an open source project You got to watch the people coming in to make sure they haven't.

930
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:07,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Hey check out my performance optimization code for your database and that turns out to be code They literally copy pasted out of Oracle.

931
01:06:08,362 --> 01:06:09,628
Speaker 1: You're in deep shit now, too.

932
01:06:10,654 --> 01:06:12,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't don't accept that patch.

933
01:06:12,728 --> 01:06:18,380
Speaker 1: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

934
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,180
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

940
01:06:45,856 --> 01:06:53,020
Speaker 1: It's actually recorded at night And the patreon patrons for this episode of geek nights are Alan Joyce, I mean Nicole Marty green.

941
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,369
Speaker 1: You're just like a dude guy Graham Finch.

942
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:55,779
Speaker 1: You'll the key to my heart.

943
01:06:56,282 --> 01:07:08,999
Speaker 1: There was a dude looked like cop standing there with my name out Clinton Walton J Banch from New Zealand Ryan parent Nicholas Brando Chris mint give dread Lily Turner by Chris Reimer Finn Sherman von Harel and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

944
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:12,327
Speaker 1: Scott has new audio equipment.

945
01:07:12,347 --> 01:07:15,280
Speaker 1: So I got a futz with the pipeline yet again because his levels are different.

946
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,283
Speaker 1: So stay tuned on that.

947
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:22,704
Speaker 1: at least convinced him to not send me audio that was muxed through his camera Which adds its own compression.

948
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,030
Speaker 1: He's learning audio engineering bit by bit.

949
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:29,480
Speaker 1: But anyway for right now, I'll leave you with something upcoming.

950
01:07:52,945 --> 01:08:02,222
Speaker 1: My mouth is dry My mouth is numb My mouth My mouth set on overdrive.

951
01:08:11,512 --> 01:08:22,298
Speaker 0: My mouth is laughing in my face a Crooked spine Crooked mouth.
