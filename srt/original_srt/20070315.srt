1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,305
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 15th.

2
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:12,188
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,835
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,600
Speaker 1: We ramble a bit about vacationing.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,415
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:35,639
Speaker 0: So I'm on the train on the way home reading this book that I'm reading the adventures of Cavalier and clay and it's a damn good book and it deserved its Pulitzer Prize, but I'm not done with it yet Uh-huh, but anyway, you should all read it.

7
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:40,160
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the cover of the book and on the cover of the book is the Empire State Building.

8
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:46,753
Speaker 0: I'm just looking at it and I'm like, you know what I Can go there if I want to any time you want.

9
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,260
Speaker 1: it's right there you pay a fee.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,813
Speaker 1: They let you go up and look at the city and I've only been up there once.

11
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:57,400
Speaker 0: my grandma took me there when I was I don't know how young real young maybe eight maybe ten, you know, I don't know.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,212
Speaker 1: I've never been in the Empire State Building let alone up it.

13
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,020
Speaker 0: So I said to myself, you know what?

14
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,587
Speaker 0: No reason I can't go up there.

15
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,576
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna I'm gonna go up there.

16
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,865
Speaker 0: Maybe tomorrow No one could stop me.

17
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:09,948
Speaker 1: well, I don't know.

18
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,296
Speaker 1: maybe it'll be closed maybe it's it's.

19
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,560
Speaker 0: actually I went to the website.

20
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:18,119
Speaker 0: it's surprisingly open like half for half of the week.

21
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:24,140
Speaker 0: You can go up there like 1 a.m And they'll let you up in the elevator all the way to the the observation deck.

22
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:26,995
Speaker 1: Now maybe the one day you decide to go be the day.

23
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:27,578
Speaker 1: There's a jumper.

24
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,451
Speaker 0: If there's a jumper that how does that bother me?

25
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,800
Speaker 0: Who's at the top when the jumper is at the bottom?

26
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:38,260
Speaker 1: I'll bet if someone jumped off the Empire State Building they would close it for at least a few hours.

27
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:40,988
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go look up and see what happens.

28
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:41,731
Speaker 0: besides it's real.

29
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:44,580
Speaker 0: It's actually from what I remember when I went there.

30
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:45,083
Speaker 0: I don't know.

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,419
Speaker 0: I guess almost 20 years ago.

32
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:53,720
Speaker 0: I don't know how old but it's pretty hard to actually jump off the highest observation deck.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:05,386
Speaker 0: that's like a hundred something floors up is inside you're looking out windows and The observation deck where you're outside is like on the 80th something floor And there's big fences.

34
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,860
Speaker 0: You'd have to be pretty awesome to get over that fence.

35
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:17,428
Speaker 1: I remember when I was up in Canada and I went to the CN Tower with a bunch of kids from my high school and Not only is it difficult to jump off the CN Tower.

36
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,953
Speaker 1: It's impossible.

37
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:26,260
Speaker 1: the observation deck the highest one They let us get to actually had this cage kind of around the entire thing all the way out to the edge.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,849
Speaker 1: There was no way to get out.

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:42,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only other really tall building I've been to the top of is the tallest building in Israel and The observation deck was basically you're on a floor and you went out and there was sort of like a balcony You know around the edge of the floor.

40
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:45,660
Speaker 0: so you could go all around the building, but it was like a balcony.

41
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:52,100
Speaker 0: So there was actually a roof above your head the next the bottom of the next floor and there was a fence around the side.

42
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:55,815
Speaker 0: So you would have to basically break open the fence to get out and fall off.

43
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,510
Speaker 1: the one thing I learned I mean, I didn't actually see anything from the CN Tower.

44
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,096
Speaker 1: There was nothing but clouds.

45
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,224
Speaker 0: I Remember I saw a lot.

46
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 0: I still remember I've only been to the Empire State Building once all to the top of it once.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,980
Speaker 0: I've been near it a zillion times and I've went in the bottom part a couple times.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Speaker 0: But I've only been to the top once and I still remember that all the little cars they were so small.

49
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:32,939
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the cars are so small and you can see pretty much everything like you walk around to one side Statue of Liberty is over there and you walk around the other side and you're like, oh look There's the rest of New York over there and there's New Jersey over there and there's the boats over there.

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:44,780
Speaker 1: And but the primary thing I learned was that most people are Incredibly skittish even if all signs and all knowledge and all engineering point to perfect undeniable safety.

51
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:46,003
Speaker 0: Yep, there.

52
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:53,655
Speaker 0: I mean if you look over the edge, it's just sort of like this natural sort of vertigo inner ear kind of feeling That you know, it's like whoa.

53
00:03:54,267 --> 00:04:02,392
Speaker 1: I don't know I didn't get maybe was just because I couldn't see anything but clouds but I actually on a dare Me and another friend of mine climbed out onto the fence and then back.

54
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the fence was solid steel There's no way that was gonna break.

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, some people like whoa and then they run away.

56
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:21,040
Speaker 0: But like if I I look over the edge and there's sort of a natural internal subconscious Whoa, but then if I just stay there for a few seconds, it's like alright cool Yeah, but there were a lot of people who wouldn't even go near that fence.

57
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:31,740
Speaker 1: They kind of hugged the wall ten feet back and obviously were shaken Wusses and it wasn't just like one person who's afraid of heights cuz that I can understand but it was the vast majority of people.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,442
Speaker 0: Wusses.

59
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:38,360
Speaker 1: more interesting was inside that floor cuz you know the top of the CN Tower is like this UFO kind of thing.

60
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,432
Speaker 0: Yep, it's still like the Space Needle but not inside it.

61
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,280
Speaker 1: There's glass under you.

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,439
Speaker 1: You can walk on glass and just look down at the ground.

63
00:04:46,184 --> 00:04:48,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and times glass elevators can get you.

64
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,712
Speaker 1: You know how many people would not walk on that glass.

65
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,640
Speaker 1: and at one point I had nothing to do with this.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:07,013
Speaker 1: But I was standing on the glass looking down and a couple of my friends were standing on the glass looking down and an unnamed other friend of mine walked over and stood on the glass and then proceeded to Get everyone's attention and then jump up and down as hard as he

67
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,199
Speaker 0: was about to say.

68
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,578
Speaker 0: But that's the thing about standing on glass is I you know?

69
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:16,240
Speaker 0: Looking down of course would be the same as the you know the whoa and then you get cool.

70
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:20,655
Speaker 0: But I would you know glass is sort of fragile most glass.

71
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:22,020
Speaker 1: It was like six inches.

72
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:30,816
Speaker 0: I know I know but most glass you encounter in your everyday life is fragile and easily Breakable and like if you stood on say the windows to your house, you might break them.

73
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:44,440
Speaker 0: So When you encounter something that looks almost exactly the same Like even I would sort of have to get down and test it and be like, okay It's six inches thick and then I would stand on it, you know, well it was expected that you stand on it.

74
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,033
Speaker 1: It was all over like the floor was covered in these giant tiles.

75
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:48,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I've been.

76
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:57,832
Speaker 0: I'd be fine with it as long as I trust that the engineer of the building and the fact that I don't see dead bodies or anyone else falling down is enough for me.

77
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,657
Speaker 1: It's always like I remember we were at the New York Comic Con and they're all.

78
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:07,518
Speaker 1: there's rails everywhere to make sure you don't fall off all those balconies and walkways.

79
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:11,240
Speaker 1: and Imagine any modern public building like a mall.

80
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:11,801
Speaker 1: Yeah You

81
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:26,760
Speaker 0: know in a shopping mall when you're on the second floor Like the hallways in the mall are only on both sides of the mall and in the middle There's usually like a big hole and you can look down Into the first floor of the mall and there's a railing that goes around to keep you from falling onto the first floor.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,580
Speaker 1: Imagine if there were no rails.

83
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been in a couple of buildings that were kind of like that and it's always a little bit not necessarily unnerving.

84
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,259
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just because so few buildings are like that.

85
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:46,280
Speaker 1: But also at the same time I can't really bemoan that fact because without the railings I wouldn't really blame someone for just walking off because sometimes you just stop paying attention.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, see if it didn't have the railings like I if I was alone in the mall I would be pretty confident just walking down the hallway with no railings.

87
00:06:54,056 --> 00:07:03,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe all right But there's other people there and also, you know I don't like to I don't like to have to really pay attention to not falling off.

88
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,019
Speaker 1: It'd be like if you were driving without the lines on the road.

89
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:14,020
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz while I might not You know be stupid enough to walk off the edge and fall down to the first floor and hurt myself or possibly die.

90
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:22,362
Speaker 0: I might slip and fall or I might bump into someone or someone that might bump into me or who knows that lady might ricochet Something.

91
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:27,460
Speaker 0: someone might drop something like what if I drop something, you know, and I get down on my hands and knees.

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,159
Speaker 1: It's like what if you're just walking and then your cell phone rings So you reach to grab it and in that second you just walk right off the edge?

93
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see that happening all the time.

94
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,738
Speaker 0: It's it's good to have railings like that there.

95
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,790
Speaker 0: Yeah It's good to have a fence around the top of the Empire State Building.

96
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,340
Speaker 1: But yeah, anyway a little bit of news here.

97
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:54,657
Speaker 1: this is kind of close to home because I was looking on dig for stories to bury and I saw a story involving some sort of crazy voodoo ritual.

98
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:55,279
Speaker 0: what?

99
00:07:55,299 --> 00:08:00,560
Speaker 1: and I would have just I wouldn't have buried it because it just looked like an interesting story.

100
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,399
Speaker 1: But I was drawn to it because I thought I saw the word Yonkers.

101
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:18,111
Speaker 1: So upon further investigation I see the word cemetery and I think back that whenever the sawmill Parkway floods I have to take this little detour around and right next to my work There's this big cemetery at Yonkers and I'm thinking there's no way.

102
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,154
Speaker 1: there's no way.

103
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:26,175
Speaker 1: and I read the story and sure enough this happened Right next to my work and it wasn't just any normal voodoo ritual.

104
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,660
Speaker 1: I suppose I should start from the beginning.

105
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:40,753
Speaker 1: so police were called because apparently there had been some suspicious people around and Then upon investigation they noticed that six of the headstones had been knocked over face down grave tipping.

106
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:48,680
Speaker 1: now As of the time of this posting they hadn't actually looked to see whose names were on those gravestones.

107
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,619
Speaker 1: They're gonna investigate that to try to you know, figure out who did this.

108
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,367
Speaker 1: But that wouldn't have been a big deal.

109
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,080
Speaker 1: in and of itself vandalism happens in graveyards fairly often.

110
00:08:56,705 --> 00:09:04,800
Speaker 1: they also noticed that there was a pumpkin and Inside of the pumpkin was some animals heart covered in pepper and full of needles.

111
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,458
Speaker 1: alrighty Also was were various accoutrement of some sort of voodoo or Santeria or whatever.

112
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,460
Speaker 1: all those Interesting religion.

113
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:21,543
Speaker 0: It's someone who spells You know like magic with a CK at the end and says I'm a Wicca It has a pentagram neck.

114
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,710
Speaker 1: or at least someone who believes that they're a practitioner.

115
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:34,672
Speaker 1: because actually I've read many stories recently where especially in Florida there has been a rise in Finding the evidence of those sorts of rituals as immigrants conduct them at night.

116
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:35,494
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

117
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,316
Speaker 1: It was just.

118
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,683
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like they're harmful It's not gonna hurt you.

119
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:47,049
Speaker 1: if you see someone hung a small piece of chicken from a tree in the middle of the woods Well, it might get you with its bad odor.

120
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:51,036
Speaker 1: Yeah or rotting or if you're running through the woods You just kind of smack into it.

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:11,852
Speaker 1: So they found a bunch of other things and I think the thing that they found that was most interesting Was and I'm quoting effectively a plastic rooster wrapped in a red bandana Buried halfway into the ground Also wrapped in some Calvin Klein underwear and pinned to.

122
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:14,099
Speaker 1: this was a note with a person's name on it.

123
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,549
Speaker 0: So do you remember that episode of Ren and Stimpy?

124
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:20,439
Speaker 0: That was my thing of the day with the bad juju on Tuesday the 17th.

125
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,980
Speaker 0: That the fact that that reality is crazier than that episode of Ren and Stimpy.

126
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:38,953
Speaker 1: Wow investigators believe that they looked at well that the heart was actually outside of the pumpkin and Forensic analysis revealed that the heart was in the pumpkin and then was taken out.

127
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:44,760
Speaker 1: and they believe that that was a ritual symbolizing ripping the victim's heart out of his body.

128
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:46,591
Speaker 0: So the guy's a pumpkin.

129
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:59,002
Speaker 1: I guess The funny thing is there's a reasonable chance They're gonna catch whoever's involved because they knocked down the six gravestones and they wrote the name of their victim on the thing and all This stuff.

130
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:04,360
Speaker 1: so all they have to do is find the people who had the things done to them or the families.

131
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:13,425
Speaker 1: Find out who's enemies of this family and then I'm sure along with the descriptions of the shady individuals who were hanging around that night I think it's gonna be funny.

132
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,894
Speaker 0: I just want to see these voodoo people.

133
00:11:15,954 --> 00:11:16,797
Speaker 0: cuz voodoo people.

134
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,680
Speaker 0: they gotta look funny.

135
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,763
Speaker 0: There's no way.

136
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:23,660
Speaker 0: there's no way that it's gonna be like some clean-cut guy and wearing like a suit and a tie.

137
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,539
Speaker 1: It's not like the Mormons.

138
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:30,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna be some crazy Baron Samity type shit, and it's gonna be mighty entertaining to see voodoo people.

139
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:42,258
Speaker 1: What if it's just an immigrant and he had a kid here and the kids just a dumb funk and he tried to do some Old ritual that he didn't know anything about and he's just some 13 year old going to high school.

140
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,247
Speaker 1: That's our middle school or whatever.

141
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:46,151
Speaker 1: that'd be middle school.

142
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:47,858
Speaker 0: That'll be kind of I don't know.

143
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,083
Speaker 1: I don't know I could.

144
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,577
Speaker 1: half of me would say these are this is people who have some sort of crazy religion.

145
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,920
Speaker 1: half of me would Say these are punk kids who read something on to internet.

146
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you know Randy doesn't Randy sell those Randy voodoo dolls say voodoo me haha doesn't work.

147
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,787
Speaker 1: I don't know if he's sold him, but I've seen him.

148
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:05,309
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,640
Speaker 0: He's like yeah here go voodoo me all you want.

150
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:19,351
Speaker 0: I'm not worried about it It's not real All right, so rim we've often talked about the fact that you know It's kind of sad that it's easy to get away with murder.

151
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is pretty easy to get away with murder.

152
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:38,132
Speaker 1: I mean Scott and I have conversations like this a lot and along with the front row crew where if you if Someone wanted to commit a murder and they didn't and they wanted to get away with it And they actually didn't have a motive other than getting away with it There's no way they'd be caught if they're even halfway intelligent.

153
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:38,714
Speaker 0: Yep.

154
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:50,497
Speaker 0: But anyway, so one thing you're gonna want to do to make sure you don't get caught if you're planning on murdering someone is To go on the Google and search for how to commit murder.

155
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,860
Speaker 0: I Recommend actually doing the search You know so that you can get away with it and perhaps learn something about murdering.

156
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:08,315
Speaker 0: Well, I guess if you want to be successful, I don't know even though I don't want you to be okay anyway But make sure that you delete your search histories and perhaps.

157
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,445
Speaker 1: Okay, so your hard drive So Google didn't give it up.

158
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:15,580
Speaker 1: It was just whoever knotted the murder was Google didn't give it up.

159
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,410
Speaker 0: Basically, you know, they were suspected of murder.

160
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,268
Speaker 0: the cops came and took the computers the cops Investigated the computer and oh, let's see.

161
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,453
Speaker 0: What's in this search history?

162
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:34,833
Speaker 0: how to commit murder instant poisons undetectable poison Fatal digoxin doses Wow, huh?

163
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,480
Speaker 0: I wonder who killed this guy.

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,420
Speaker 0: Could it have been his wife who searched on Google for how to kill?

165
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,524
Speaker 1: This is interesting because what how to kill from tank, please Kill.

166
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:46,147
Speaker 1: see.

167
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,856
Speaker 1: she should have just bought that book with cash.

168
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:48,680
Speaker 1: She would have been all set.

169
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, then burn the book when you're done.

170
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,417
Speaker 1: actually, I don't think in tank police.

171
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:52,960
Speaker 1: that was a book.

172
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,208
Speaker 1: I think it was a periodical.

173
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,819
Speaker 0: It was definitely a magazine.

174
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:07,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is an interesting dichotomy because at one on one hand this woman was smart enough to use Google as opposed to any other Search engine and was smart enough to do her research.

175
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,287
Speaker 0: Then she was also stupid enough to get caught.

176
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,420
Speaker 1: You know what she might be smart and just not computer savvy.

177
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:26,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean even without this incredibly damning testimony that you know be of the people who investigated the computers They suspected her enough to take the computers and get a warrant to search them in the first place.

178
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,839
Speaker 0: So she can't be that smart.

179
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:37,778
Speaker 1: See, that's the one good thing is while it's easy to get away with murder nominally It's not nearly as easy to get away with murder where you have an actual motive.

180
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:39,645
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like if I killed a rim.

181
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,036
Speaker 0: that's real hard to get away with.

182
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:51,760
Speaker 0: if I killed Random guy who lives in another state while I was passing through the town on a road trip There's almost no chance of getting caught less as a camera.

183
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,960
Speaker 1: That's why serial killers are so scary because a lot of times they don't have any connection to their victims.

184
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:09,140
Speaker 1: They pick them semi randomly or maybe based on you know, they want to kill blonde Asian pygmies or whatever there and they also barely leave any evidence behind or they leave a ton of evidence.

185
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,637
Speaker 1: But because there's no lead the evidence is useless.

186
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,300
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, all right, you got fingerprints You got DNA got a picture of the dude with his mask on.

187
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:22,939
Speaker 1: That doesn't help you at all If you have no idea who it is have no lead at all don't even know what state to look in.

188
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:26,673
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah one thing you're gonna I guess.

189
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:37,229
Speaker 0: if you don't want to get caught You should search on Google for how to do your crime better and maybe you'll find this episode That will tell you to keep your computer secure.

190
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:43,104
Speaker 0: perhaps deban them or something, but don't do that because uh I want you to get caught.

191
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:44,810
Speaker 1: Well, don't do it to commit murder.

192
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:46,335
Speaker 1: do it for something good.

193
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:47,138
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:56,347
Speaker 1: Yeah Things of the day.

195
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,254
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of roller coasters.

196
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:03,900
Speaker 1: when I was in high school I was a much bigger fan of roller coasters mostly because back then I could still ride them.

197
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,405
Speaker 0: We can still ride them now.

198
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,572
Speaker 0: We don't even though we want to.

199
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,040
Speaker 1: well because they're all very far away.

200
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:18,294
Speaker 0: Well, I tried to get everyone to go that this past summer and we ended up not going Partly because every time we all got together we had better things to do.

201
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: that didn't require as much travel.

202
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:21,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we could have done it.

203
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:25,400
Speaker 0: just people didn't you know want to put in the requisite time and effort in money?

204
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,243
Speaker 1: well I hate to say it.

205
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:32,570
Speaker 1: the real issue for me is that I've been to Cedar Point and I really if I'm gonna ride roller coasters again.

206
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,416
Speaker 1: I want to go to an equivalent park.

207
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,669
Speaker 0: I Think it's just because you've only been to Cedar Point.

208
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,320
Speaker 0: You don't realize that other places also have good rollercoaster?

209
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they only have one or two.

210
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:49,073
Speaker 0: Cedar Point has more roller coasters in one place than any place in the world Perhaps but other you know crappy places only have one or two like Six Flags.

211
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,060
Speaker 0: New England has like five or six.

212
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:56,010
Speaker 0: Oh, oh five or six have a lot Maybe even ten.

213
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,040
Speaker 0: I don't know I haven't counted.

214
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,993
Speaker 0: But yet there are other places have enough roller coaster point.

215
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,319
Speaker 0: is there's rides to be worth it?

216
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:03,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the problem is they're all kind of far away.

217
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,830
Speaker 1: We'd have to drive a couple hours, and they'll cost a lot to get into.

218
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,319
Speaker 0: that's what it cost to do those things.

219
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:13,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cheaper than Disney World Which is like hundreds of dollars to get in first.

220
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,765
Speaker 1: actually if you like roller coasters There's no reason to go to Disney World.

221
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,030
Speaker 1: as much as I like Disney World.

222
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,720
Speaker 1: They they pretty much have crap for roller coasters.

223
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:22,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a roller coaster park.

224
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:23,952
Speaker 0: It's a theme park.

225
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, big difference you go there for a different reason.

226
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you go to Cedar Point.

227
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,040
Speaker 1: you pretty much have to be hardcore about roller coasters.

228
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,004
Speaker 1: You're not gonna have fun.

229
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:31,867
Speaker 1: There's nothing else there.

230
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, these are the most.

231
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,400
Speaker 0: other places tend to have more of a variety.

232
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:36,616
Speaker 0: They have other things.

233
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,914
Speaker 0: Concentrate just on the roller coaster.

234
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:40,740
Speaker 1: well when I was a kid.

235
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,525
Speaker 1: That's what I was into.

236
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,739
Speaker 1: I really liked roller coasters for a variety of reasons.

237
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:48,000
Speaker 1: But anyway this I've ridden almost every kind of roller coaster.

238
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:52,860
Speaker 1: I could go at great length about all the different kinds, and how you might think one's one kinds the other whatever.

239
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:56,878
Speaker 1: There's a kind of roller coaster that I did not know existed until now.

240
00:17:58,062 --> 00:18:09,630
Speaker 1: I guess you would call it a human-powered steel coaster meaning Effectively you get in these bicycle like contraptions And you ride it on a roller coaster track.

241
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,699
Speaker 0: now, what if you're not strong enough to make it up the hill?

242
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,751
Speaker 1: I Imagine that either there's a lift to get you to the top Then you only have to get up the little bits.

243
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:21,812
Speaker 1: if I designed it I mean the website doesn't say no one answered that question for me.

244
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:28,873
Speaker 1: if I designed it I'd make it with kind of a ratchet mechanism like you know when the roller coaster clicks going up You know what that clicking is.

245
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:33,040
Speaker 1: in most cases It's actually little hookies going click click click click click.

246
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,418
Speaker 1: So if the chain breaks or they lose power or whatever instead of falling back down it just sits there.

247
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,044
Speaker 1: Yep That's what that is.

248
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,852
Speaker 1: I would put the same thing on this.

249
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:46,038
Speaker 1: so if you get tired going up the hill You just stop as opposed to falling to your death.

250
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,529
Speaker 0: ah That's a good idea, but what if you like?

251
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,038
Speaker 0: what if one person is really you know unfit?

252
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,668
Speaker 0: And they take forever to get up the hill?

253
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,460
Speaker 0: they're blocking the person behind them and that could ruin your ride.

254
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,100
Speaker 1: I also imagine that they have contingencies in place or maybe because it's Japan.

255
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,312
Speaker 1: They just don't let fatter unfit people on.

256
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,620
Speaker 0: oh, it's Japan all right.

257
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:08,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually at a washes on high land park in okayama.

258
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,840
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and the thing is most roller coaster parks are built in flat open land.

259
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:18,440
Speaker 1: This thing is built like on the side of a mountain and this roller coaster just on this mountain.

260
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:26,534
Speaker 0: Maybe it's easier to build then because you can use the mountain as the support for the higher parts of the roller coaster And that's you have to build less supporting poles.

261
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:26,695
Speaker 1: Well.

262
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,540
Speaker 1: They did that in Vegas.

263
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:32,851
Speaker 1: They built a roller coaster whose hill was on top of a big building Yeah, which was kind of cool.

264
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:37,252
Speaker 1: the roller coaster was kind of crap But that was just the fault of the roller coaster design not the idea.

265
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,440
Speaker 1: yep, but check out these pictures this thing.

266
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:44,680
Speaker 1: It's very difficult to frighten me or to a nerve me or anything all right any amusement park ride.

267
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:49,780
Speaker 1: I once rode a ride that is banned in every state of the Union except Michigan and Kentucky.

268
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,623
Speaker 0: What ride is that?

269
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,899
Speaker 1: it's this carney ride that basically you spin around in a big?

270
00:19:55,261 --> 00:20:02,729
Speaker 1: Circle and inside of the circle there are four pods and the pods spin around Independently and the ride is not controlled by a computer.

271
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:17,716
Speaker 1: the ride is controlled manually by a carney with three big levers Uh-huh, and he has to manually Spin all the different bits and move it around and time it and if he does it wrong the ride can generate enough force To actually crush you.

272
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,027
Speaker 0: You ever ride the roundup.

273
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:21,111
Speaker 1: I don't know.

274
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,740
Speaker 1: I know I don't know much about carney rides.

275
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,167
Speaker 1: I only know a lot about roller coasters.

276
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,137
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I found the roundup.

277
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,062
Speaker 0: yep here It is.

278
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:29,187
Speaker 0: I found a picture of it on.

279
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:31,015
Speaker 1: is the round up worse than chaos.

280
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,100
Speaker 0: This is the roundup.

281
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,193
Speaker 1: Oh, I've been on those.

282
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,060
Speaker 1: you base are awesome.

283
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,261
Speaker 0: You're.

284
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:45,057
Speaker 0: basically there's a big ring and the ring has around the edge of it a fence And you stand up against the fence in his little booth.

285
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:49,974
Speaker 0: It's a centrifuge Yeah, and you hold on to it, and it spins around and then it drops out.

286
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:54,752
Speaker 0: no and then it goes up Goes around and up hence the roundup.

287
00:20:55,133 --> 00:21:00,440
Speaker 1: well when I went to space camp One thing that had there was the same kind of deal only didn't go up.

288
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,515
Speaker 1: It just went around in a circle and the floor drops away, and you just kind of get.

289
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,780
Speaker 1: sit there stuck against the wall.

290
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:11,420
Speaker 1: Well while we were riding at the guy running it says well you kids keep quiet if I do something awesome.

291
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,400
Speaker 1: And we all said yes, and he proceeded to because he was in the control booth area in the center.

292
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:19,282
Speaker 1: That doesn't spin or like it spins But at a different rate.

293
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:27,779
Speaker 1: he got up and he jumped over to where we were and stood straight up totally horizontal and ran around The centrifuge jumping over all of us kids.

294
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,847
Speaker 0: Those are good right good time.

295
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:31,111
Speaker 1: and then he pulled out.

296
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:42,759
Speaker 1: he had a can of beer with him and all this other stuff And he's tossed it around with the other guy doing all these tricks and awesome stuff And then he warns us again not to say anything And then he gets back in the center slows the thing down and lets us all get off.

297
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,088
Speaker 0: So a human powered roller coaster.

298
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,035
Speaker 0: you say human powered roller.

299
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,340
Speaker 0: it might be crazy enough to work.

300
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:52,696
Speaker 1: I particularly like the third right-hand corner of fear or whatever.

301
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:53,840
Speaker 1: they call this one corner.

302
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,969
Speaker 0: Do they really call it the third corner of fear?

303
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,254
Speaker 1: they call it something like that.

304
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:58,720
Speaker 0: Do you pass out in that corner?

305
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,431
Speaker 1: Pori katani, okay, couldn't deal with this.

306
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:05,223
Speaker 0: I wonder how many people got that initial D Joke, and how many didn't.

307
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:09,779
Speaker 1: well it's Thursday, so only the coolest of cool people listen to Thursday, okay?

308
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,915
Speaker 0: Anyway, so flicker is obviously the photo album of the 21st century.

309
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:20,020
Speaker 0: if you don't know about flicker Have you been living under a rock or what?

310
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,978
Speaker 1: It's one of those drop the e to talk about the way twit classifies websites.

311
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:42,755
Speaker 0: well You know I don't often usually think about flicker in terms of me putting my photos somewhere so that they can be downloaded a lot without losing bandwidth to me or without costing me a lot of money, and I never really think to go and say I wonder who what really cool people are on flicker like.

312
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:48,737
Speaker 0: imagine if someone was like I don't know like my mom's cousin who's a geologist, and she goes to volcanoes and stuff.

313
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,699
Speaker 0: if she had a flicker That'd be pretty damn cool.

314
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:54,851
Speaker 0: Well, you know it'd be even cooler, and it actually exists.

315
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:58,180
Speaker 0: the Los Angeles fire department has a flicker.

316
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:01,220
Speaker 1: I like I like firemen pictures.

317
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:13,219
Speaker 0: It's really awesome because you have pictures like the pictures that are the newest are of the Los Angeles Marathon of 2007 and all the people who like passed out, and they're wheeling them away on wheelchairs and stuff.

318
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:21,485
Speaker 0: and Then they got slightly less recent pictures of them putting out a brush fire in some park with Helicopters carrying water.

319
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:27,588
Speaker 0: and then they got pictures of some lady who drove a car into a swimming pool And this car is at the bottom of a swimming pool.

320
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:37,740
Speaker 0: and basically any time the Los Angeles fire department sees something crazy There must be someone there who's taking these really good pictures and putting them up in this.

321
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:42,882
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure official Los Angeles fire department flicker And it's.

322
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:46,759
Speaker 0: it's pretty the photos are really high quality, and it looks official to me.

323
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:56,968
Speaker 1: Well my dad is actually I mean he's high up in the Detroit fire department one of the top dogs And when I was a kid I remember whenever we went for walks He he had the nose for cuz.

324
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,800
Speaker 1: actually you'd be surprised how many house fires there are in Detroit.

325
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:10,419
Speaker 1: But if he smelled a fire we track it down, and it may sound weird But a pastime of my family was watching houses burn as firemen tried to save them.

326
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,940
Speaker 1: Hey, he'd also listen to the scanner.

327
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,460
Speaker 1: We drive out and watch fires fairly often more often than you'd think would be prudent or expected.

328
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:26,270
Speaker 0: Well you can relive that by looking at this flicker account because there's a lot of fires and a lot of car wrecks And a lot of firemen putting them out.

329
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:27,920
Speaker 1: I do like pictures of fire a lot.

330
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:35,079
Speaker 1: I mean I remember the the calendar my dad gave me when he was this internal fire department calendar And it was just pictures of houses on fire.

331
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,519
Speaker 0: Here's a car upside down next to a fire truck.

332
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,692
Speaker 0: They're cutting down a tree with a chainsaw.

333
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,220
Speaker 1: they got any of them using the jaws of life.

334
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,609
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are jaws of life pictures.

335
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,994
Speaker 1: I like the jaws of life a lot.

336
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:49,857
Speaker 0: I also like the up.

337
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:56,140
Speaker 0: Here's like Like la fire department command staff salutes chief bamatter.

338
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:59,914
Speaker 0: Okay, fire chief and first lady of the fire department.

339
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,100
Speaker 0: Oh, there's some sort of ceremony.

340
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,319
Speaker 0: They're all wearing their firemen uniforms of fanciness, huh?

341
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,285
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of good pictures in here.

342
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:07,530
Speaker 0: if you like fire.

343
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:08,895
Speaker 0: You like firemen.

344
00:25:08,915 --> 00:25:10,180
Speaker 0: This is a good flicker.

345
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,149
Speaker 0: If you look at it, there's a lot of pictures.

346
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,640
Speaker 1: I don't think there's anyone who dislikes a well-oiled fireman.

347
00:25:15,123 --> 00:25:19,062
Speaker 0: There's 54 pages of pictures here Up.

348
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:24,160
Speaker 0: the very first picture is the official seal of the LA fire department and the second picture is the US flag.

349
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:33,140
Speaker 1: So we were downstairs with Alex and Emily eating tacos that I'd made And we were trying to come up with a show to do tonight as we seem to be doing lately.

350
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:35,159
Speaker 1: We're not really planning ahead these last few weeks.

351
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:37,505
Speaker 0: No, no planning ahead at all.

352
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,993
Speaker 0: We should plan ahead next week this weekend.

353
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:41,217
Speaker 1: I will see.

354
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:44,632
Speaker 1: luckily It looks like all of our plans to go out of town have followed through.

355
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:46,100
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

356
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,559
Speaker 0: I got stuff to do no matter what happens So it doesn't matter to me.

357
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:58,239
Speaker 1: but we realized that pretty much the best resource we have to figure out what to do Thursday shows on is Other people who are in our house.

358
00:25:58,822 --> 00:26:05,036
Speaker 0: Of course usually when we ask people what to do the show on they come up with the same ideas we have or they come Up with no good ideas and it's not very helpful.

359
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:08,937
Speaker 1: tonight We got a bunch of good ideas and probably the best one at least the easiest one to do.

360
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:14,080
Speaker 1: right now We're gonna talk a bit about family vacations and vacationing and travel and all that.

361
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,286
Speaker 0: Well, it is spring break.

362
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,160
Speaker 0: I think for a lot of people if now if not soon.

363
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,728
Speaker 0: So vacations are pretty relevant topic in that regard.

364
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:33,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus it it's kind of interesting how my life as a geek well first as a as a child and then as a geek child and now as and then as a college geek and now as a full-grown geek how Vacationing always has these different connotations.

365
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:37,360
Speaker 1: and it's changed as to what I consider a vacation as time has gone on.

366
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:48,503
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean it went from the family vacations You know driving in a van with the whole family including grandma down to Florida and back and then you know to college where we didn't Have any money.

367
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:52,359
Speaker 1: so vacations were like go to a con and not have food to eat.

368
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,559
Speaker 0: Vacation was sit in the apartment and I'd have to do schoolwork.

369
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:58,451
Speaker 1: I got to admit those are still some of the best vacations I've ever had.

370
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,924
Speaker 0: those were some damn good vacations that summer We spent at RIT.

371
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:06,340
Speaker 1: not going to RIT was probably one of the best summers of my life.

372
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,905
Speaker 0: It's definitely one of the best summers.

373
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:08,808
Speaker 0: I cannot deny.

374
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:13,985
Speaker 0: and then now we have money again sitting around playing putt-putt DDR listening to euro beat.

375
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:14,988
Speaker 0: good times.

376
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd work at de Bella's play order.

377
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:21,919
Speaker 1: You go five times a day Randomly driving to the beach or trying to play badminton with Luke.

378
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:24,827
Speaker 1: Those were good days one time.

379
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:25,449
Speaker 0: We tried that.

380
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,256
Speaker 1: No, we tried to play badminton twice.

381
00:27:27,557 --> 00:27:28,018
Speaker 0: We did we?

382
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:28,500
Speaker 1: we did.

383
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,500
Speaker 1: We didn't succeed in playing the second time.

384
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,100
Speaker 1: We couldn't find all the bits cuz we lost something on the net.

385
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:36,071
Speaker 0: I actually saw a really good badminton video on the internet.

386
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:40,871
Speaker 1: So I'll find it uses thingy today next week, man I was really good at badminton when I was a young kid.

387
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:41,574
Speaker 0: I was also.

388
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,020
Speaker 0: I'm probably still really good at bad.

389
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,024
Speaker 1: I'm terrible at it now.

390
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:47,820
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not good like I could play professionally or a competition.

391
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,412
Speaker 1: No, you ever see my professional badminton thing.

392
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,075
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

393
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,120
Speaker 0: I was gonna use the thing of the day.

394
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,347
Speaker 0: so of course, I've seen it.

395
00:27:53,428 --> 00:28:00,839
Speaker 0: but I'm better than Most at people at badminton because I actually tried to play it a lot.

396
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,474
Speaker 0: Nah, I'm also okay at volleyball a little bit.

397
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:05,056
Speaker 1: I'm.

398
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,080
Speaker 1: it's surprising.

399
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:13,132
Speaker 1: I'm better at volleyball than you'd expect but yet at the same time I often will fail Spectacularly at the critical moment in volleyball.

400
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:13,675
Speaker 0: That's pretty.

401
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:14,540
Speaker 0: I'm equal in skill.

402
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,246
Speaker 1: I think I can serve really well.

403
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:27,540
Speaker 1: really what like people were making fun of me at IBM and the volleyball team where this Intramural thing going because I was generally useless and I could set up for a spike Kinda, but half the time I'd send it off in the middle of nowhere.

404
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:31,714
Speaker 0: See spiking is the only like real deficiency I have in volleyball.

405
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:34,484
Speaker 0: just as I can't jump high enough He's spiking I could do.

406
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:35,367
Speaker 1: I couldn't set up.

407
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,614
Speaker 1: I couldn't return a normal volley.

408
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,220
Speaker 1: All I could do was spike.

409
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,159
Speaker 0: Do you know the technique kinda?

410
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:42,705
Speaker 1: People taught me.

411
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I wasn't good at.

412
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,079
Speaker 1: I always screwed it up.

413
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:46,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't screw up.

414
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,036
Speaker 1: But here's the thing I would surprise everyone cuz the one thing I could do really well is serve.

415
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:52,160
Speaker 0: So everything's not hard.

416
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,109
Speaker 1: Well, no, I could do the jump overhand serve.

417
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,160
Speaker 1: that came in like a bomb and no one ever returned it.

418
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:57,209
Speaker 0: I do that too.

419
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:57,612
Speaker 0: Yeah.

420
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,780
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not difficult.

421
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,840
Speaker 1: So I'd get like eight points for my team and then I'd spend need like the rest of the match until I was losing ten points.

422
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:06,984
Speaker 1: Yes, pretty much.

423
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:07,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, good job.

424
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:09,173
Speaker 1: So as a result, I was useless.

425
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,740
Speaker 0: You're the MVP of the other team.

426
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,263
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

427
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:11,847
Speaker 1: All right.

428
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,583
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, so Vacations.

429
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:17,533
Speaker 1: now we're cons and Wildwood and all that.

430
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,235
Speaker 1: now that we have money.

431
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:22,716
Speaker 1: We're actually considering doing Vacations again actually planning to go somewhere.

432
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:23,380
Speaker 0: I want to go.

433
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:33,171
Speaker 0: I think what I want to do is I want to go far away Because most of the time when I was vacationing as a kid I mean we never left the East Coast pretty much.

434
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:37,660
Speaker 0: I've never been west of Michigan in Ohio I've never been west of Chicago.

435
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:44,300
Speaker 1: Maybe I mean I've been as far west as Chicago in the north and I've been as far west as parts of Tennessee in the South.

436
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:52,150
Speaker 0: I've been as far south as Florida and as far north as Canada Ontario and I've been as far east as Israel.

437
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:55,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of crazy and backwards Yep.

438
00:29:56,204 --> 00:30:06,920
Speaker 1: Well, I mean as a young kid every year our family always went on two vacations And one of the vacations was always to Cedar Point for a weekend Mm-hmm or sometimes just a day depending on finances and time or whatever.

439
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:17,810
Speaker 1: But I went to Cedar Point every single year of my life and when I was two years old My parents brought me along until I moved away to RIT and I haven't been back since See pretty much every year.

440
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:20,303
Speaker 0: My family would go on a Most years.

441
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:22,609
Speaker 0: my family would go on a real vacation.

442
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:29,509
Speaker 0: That was about a week long maybe longer to somewhere often It was a New Hampshire or Florida.

443
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:33,140
Speaker 0: once I think we went to Lake George with some cousins and had a little cottage.

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,083
Speaker 0: that was a fun time.

445
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:44,113
Speaker 0: a lot of a lot of has silly memories for that one power outages and as Result water outages and hilarity my brother stealing M&Ms.

446
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:46,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of good anecdotes on that one.

447
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,267
Speaker 0: But you know also I think probably more than once every year we would go on like a day trip somewhere like oh Let's go to museum.

448
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:56,969
Speaker 0: Let's go somewhere else That's you know, and we just do stuff.

449
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:58,396
Speaker 1: we did a lot of things like that.

450
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:01,146
Speaker 1: that just seems All families do that.

451
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really count as vacation.

452
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:06,379
Speaker 0: But yeah for real vacation We would do it like once a year go somewhere.

453
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:10,808
Speaker 1: See we always had the Cedar Point vacation Which was like the family ritual it came down to.

454
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,400
Speaker 1: they'd always pack up the back of the station wagon in bed.

455
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,380
Speaker 1: So me and my little brother could lay there playing our little games our game gear Gameboy or whatever for the two-hour drive.

456
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:25,413
Speaker 1: It's amazing how when I was a young kid a two-hour drive was this eternity.

457
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:31,436
Speaker 1: and if I wasn't entertained at every moment along The way I would be so crushingly bored that I just couldn't stand it.

458
00:31:31,576 --> 00:31:34,084
Speaker 0: That is true I agree entirely.

459
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,810
Speaker 0: and now a two-hour drive is nothing.

460
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,054
Speaker 1: I know a two-hour drive.

461
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,688
Speaker 1: That's not this less than a day trip That's the normal course of business.

462
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:42,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember driving to New Hampshire.

463
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:47,720
Speaker 0: if I look at a map now It's only like four or five hours to get there to you know to the place you went to vacation there.

464
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,145
Speaker 1: But you remember it being this.

465
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:53,380
Speaker 0: but I remember it being this incredibly long boring drive.

466
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:55,936
Speaker 0: But now I could drive there if I wanted to.

467
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:56,640
Speaker 0: it's not a big deal.

468
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:59,675
Speaker 1: I think part of it to take the adult position here.

469
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:03,300
Speaker 1: when you're a kid You don't have as many memories as an adult.

470
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:08,240
Speaker 1: You don't need to spend as much time in reverie or thinking about your past or recalling things or relaxing.

471
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:13,760
Speaker 1: You were trying to do as much as you can in as little time as possible with spastic kid energy.

472
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:15,226
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is.

473
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,392
Speaker 1: But now I'm older.

474
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,119
Speaker 0: array for portable video games.

475
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:30,560
Speaker 1: Yes but aside from that the big vacation my family went on is we drove down to Tennessee a bunch of times or we went down to West Virginia for the Jeep jamboree so my mom could fiddle around with off-roading and jeeps and all that fun stuff.

476
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,334
Speaker 1: Went on a lot of camping trips.

477
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:39,720
Speaker 1: one time we took my grandparents giant conversion van and drove down to Florida and back for Disney World and a whole bunch of stuff.

478
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:47,446
Speaker 1: I remember going to the Cape Canaveral Space Museum and Space Camp and Huntsville and all sorts of just you know Typical family vacations.

479
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:50,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did the same shit most of the time we want a vacation.

480
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,885
Speaker 0: I don't remember a single vacation.

481
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:55,352
Speaker 0: we went on where there weren't video arcades involved.

482
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:56,294
Speaker 0: It was pretty much.

483
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:57,898
Speaker 0: Hey, let's go play video games.

484
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:04,960
Speaker 1: Yeah Actually, I was spoiled with arcades cuz cedar point has one of the biggest old-school arcades out there.

485
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:06,789
Speaker 0: You haven't been to sesame place.

486
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,814
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not the biggest.

487
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:08,538
Speaker 1: I can't pretend.

488
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:08,980
Speaker 1: It's the biggest.

489
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:17,340
Speaker 0: The place we went to in New Hampshire Was the fun spot is there which is pretty much the arcade of the country perhaps of the world?

490
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,249
Speaker 0: We went there because fun spot was there.

491
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,320
Speaker 0: my parents pretty much like gave up on going to places.

492
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,631
Speaker 0: You know that happened to have an arcade and we went to the.

493
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,080
Speaker 0: we went on vacation to the arcade.

494
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,550
Speaker 0: That was also a lake so my mom was happy.

495
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,760
Speaker 0: there was a lake and there were restaurants and touristy crap.

496
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:37,678
Speaker 0: But we would spend a lot of time playing mini golf and video games.

497
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:42,880
Speaker 1: yep I remember one time when we were at Cedar Point, and it was stupidly hot out in the middle of a heatwave.

498
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:46,430
Speaker 1: It was over a hundred degrees So we had to get out of the heat for a little bit.

499
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:52,780
Speaker 1: we weren't gonna stand in line for an hour and die Even though not too long after that they put in these misters, which are actually really cool.

500
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,676
Speaker 1: They misted you in line with a big fan and water, so you didn't get hot.

501
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,200
Speaker 0: sounds good to me Yeah But anyway.

502
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:10,431
Speaker 1: So we went into this arcade the giant arcade at Cedar Point and me my little brother my mom and two other kids Rotated in and out on a Simpsons arcade machine until we beat it.

503
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:12,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, Simpsons arcade.

504
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:14,172
Speaker 1: Yep It was a dumb game, but you know what?

505
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:17,275
Speaker 1: for some reason It's just the vibe of playing it with a bunch of people.

506
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:17,840
Speaker 1: it can't be beat.

507
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:23,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, all those all those games that ran on the same system Ninja Turtles X-men and Simpsons.

508
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,024
Speaker 0: I'm sure there were others.

509
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:27,754
Speaker 0: the dungeon dragons is similar, but not quite the same.

510
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,440
Speaker 0: better definitely better.

511
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:37,620
Speaker 0: I don't think it's better, but the the Cooperative four or more player beat-em-up arcade games definitely need to see a comeback.

512
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,609
Speaker 1: Well in general any sort of cooperative gameplay.

513
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,378
Speaker 1: I want this more and more and I'm lacking it more and more.

514
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,484
Speaker 1: yeah I mean we ghettoize.

515
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:50,320
Speaker 1: it will play Advance Wars against the AI and teams or things like that, but it's not the same.

516
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:56,011
Speaker 0: No, it's not the same at all Alright, so I remember I never really thought about.

517
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,860
Speaker 1: I mean I just assumed every area summertime time for the vacations.

518
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:00,006
Speaker 1: They're always over the summer.

519
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:02,036
Speaker 0: No they weren't always over the summer with us.

520
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:08,959
Speaker 0: like sometimes we would go on a vacation in the winter you know to go to Florida and Sometimes you go vacation in the summer.

521
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,499
Speaker 0: Sometimes you go vacation in the spring.

522
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:23,680
Speaker 0: Actually, I think most of the vacations were in the spring or the winter vacation You know from school because in the summer we typically went to summer camps and other things and thus it wasn't vacation vacation time.

523
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:31,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I remember the first trip I went on like major trip by myself was flying down to Florida for the citrus bowl with the band.

524
00:35:31,682 --> 00:35:39,800
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't really call that a vacation because while I spend time on the beach in a Disney World and all that I also spent a lot of time working because it was a band outing.

525
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:41,891
Speaker 0: When I went on vacation my family.

526
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:48,558
Speaker 0: if we went to an amusement park It was all is probably one in Florida like a Disney World or Universal Studios or something like that.

527
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:53,271
Speaker 0: Most of the time we went to normal Amusement parks like Six Flags.

528
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:55,260
Speaker 0: it was never with my family.

529
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:07,980
Speaker 0: It was always with summer camp or with school or with some other you know group that didn't involve my Blood relatives see that wasn't until I had a car and then because I guess I didn't go to camps or anything.

530
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:17,579
Speaker 1: But I remember once I had a car and I realized that wait a minute I can go to Cedar Point or the beach or whatever anytime I want.

531
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:21,897
Speaker 1: My junior year of high school, I went to Cedar Point like 12 times.

532
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:37,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically if you went to school in Connecticut or at least where we went to school It was pretty much a close to 100% guarantee that your school was gonna take you on some vacation Somewhere if you paid.

533
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,332
Speaker 0: and you know, what's funny side of the permission slip?

534
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:47,380
Speaker 1: all the schools in southeast, Michigan Every single one of them at least all the public schools all the trips other than you know field trips and everything in the summer.

535
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,469
Speaker 1: We're always to Cedar Point and nowhere else.

536
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, they typically always took us to Riverside But which is became Six Flags New England.

537
00:36:54,701 --> 00:37:04,580
Speaker 0: They also would take kids to Boston and when you're at elementary school in Connecticut They will take you to the freakin mystic aquarium and mystic village like a thousand times.

538
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,548
Speaker 0: You will get so sick of going to mystic.

539
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:07,793
Speaker 0: You'll just want to kill yourself.

540
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,668
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there is one other place We always went to always there.

541
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,800
Speaker 1: I forget what it was called, but there was this historical reenactment village.

542
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:15,992
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Sturbridge Village.

543
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:16,679
Speaker 0: you would go there too.

544
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:26,819
Speaker 1: Yeah I forget what ours was called but we'd have to live there like the pioneers for a whole day and it was this Competition and at the end the judges based on what you had done would decide whether or not you lived.

545
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:28,106
Speaker 0: Oh, it wasn't like that.

546
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:30,580
Speaker 1: But I remember bartering with the Indians.

547
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,980
Speaker 1: I end up giving the Indians guns so we could get food and then the Indians used the guns to raid the village and took The food back and then we all died.

548
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:39,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was awesome.

549
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:40,849
Speaker 0: That sounds more awesome.

550
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:41,230
Speaker 0: what we had?

551
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,720
Speaker 0: we typically cuz it's all colonial up in New England.

552
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:48,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, so everything it tends to just be like you go to Sturbridge village.

553
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:54,879
Speaker 0: It's a village and like you'll go into say the Baker and they're actually just selling cookies in there.

554
00:37:55,342 --> 00:38:01,995
Speaker 0: But the lady's dressed up like a colonial lady and she's you know teaches you about colonial baking and tries to sell you cookies.

555
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:04,565
Speaker 0: and then you go into like another building and like.

556
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:08,498
Speaker 0: this is what schools were like in the when it was colonial times.

557
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:17,794
Speaker 1: and But for the mess blacksmith day to skip a bit for the last several years Vacations for us at least for Scott and me and the rest of the front row crew.

558
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:24,956
Speaker 1: front row crew have basically become Going to Wildwood for a week after Otacon because conventions are not vacations for us.

559
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:25,478
Speaker 1: their work.

560
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,260
Speaker 1: They're fun.

561
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,047
Speaker 0: Well their work now they used to not be work.

562
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:31,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if they weren't work, I don't know how many I would go to.

563
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:32,547
Speaker 0: That's true.

564
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 0: I mean once you've been to some It like there's not much for us to do outside of work at conventions any.

565
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I would go to Otacon or I'd pick one or two conventions and go to them every year no matter what.

566
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,578
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't go to 10 or 20 conventions a year like I do now.

567
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,536
Speaker 0: No that pretty much if I wasn't doing anything conventions other than being an attendee.

568
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,288
Speaker 0: at this point I'd pretty much only go to Otacon.

569
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it seems like there's a definite distinction between Vacations for relaxing and vacations for doing.

570
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,640
Speaker 0: well if you're doing is it really a vacation?

571
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:05,383
Speaker 1: I don't know.

572
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:12,344
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people seem to look at vacation as time away from their mundane work life Enjoying themselves somewhere Mmm.

573
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,760
Speaker 1: I mean I've gone on some vacations where I did stuff the whole time.

574
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:24,216
Speaker 1: I crammed as much as I could in and I've been on vacations Particularly that half a month or so where we lived in Wildwood where I didn't do anything.

575
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:27,936
Speaker 1: I just laid on the beach and That's what we've been doing a lot lately.

576
00:39:27,976 --> 00:39:32,239
Speaker 1: every year It's like we do Otacon the big trip, and then we just lay on the beach for a week.

577
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:34,270
Speaker 0: I think that's the way it's got to be.

578
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,248
Speaker 0: if we didn't land a beach for a week after Otacon We would be DED yep.

579
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,052
Speaker 1: Well remember.

580
00:39:39,092 --> 00:39:40,940
Speaker 1: We couldn't talk for about three days.

581
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,528
Speaker 0: It's true the most recent one.

582
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:48,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not looking forward to what's gonna happen at this Otacon Especially if they let us do all the stuff we've proposed to do.

583
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:54,537
Speaker 0: yeah You know actually I think there's a kind of vacation that we haven't really gone on at least yet is business trips.

584
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:59,276
Speaker 0: like my dad Goes to a lot of places on business like to do business.

585
00:39:59,376 --> 00:40:00,120
Speaker 0: I want that work.

586
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:09,440
Speaker 0: I've done that for IBM several times Yeah, but you've never gone on like a business trip to say Ireland or California or actually South America.

587
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,120
Speaker 1: I probably could have if I'd stuck around IBM longer because we did do a lot of work with some people in Dublin.

588
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,564
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

589
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:20,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact a guy from there came to our department a bunch of times to do business trips.

590
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:21,904
Speaker 0: That's cool.

591
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:25,940
Speaker 1: all I remember is that because IBM paid for it he got a rental car.

592
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:27,520
Speaker 1: That's the only way to get around in America.

593
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:39,878
Speaker 1: He got a sports car and I remember one day I was walking out of the office And I'm ready to go home and I see him getting into his little sports car that he's rented and he tore out of that Parking lot at over a hundred miles an hour.

594
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:42,713
Speaker 1: He was enjoying that.

595
00:40:42,794 --> 00:40:46,860
Speaker 0: I definitely Eventually wanna if I have to keep working for a long time.

596
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,015
Speaker 0: I want to have a job where there's some sort of business trips going on.

597
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:52,466
Speaker 1: a lot of jobs I've looked at but didn't apply to.

598
00:40:52,526 --> 00:41:08,599
Speaker 1: they always say, you know a percentage of travel like this job involves 40% Travel or 20% travel and they always present it like it's a bad thing Like somehow that's gonna be some sort of detriment that I'm gonna have to go into Interesting places as opposed to just sitting in a cube all day.

599
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,391
Speaker 0: I think the problem is a lot of business travelers.

600
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:16,600
Speaker 0: when they travel, you know A lot of people are just too serious about their work.

601
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,209
Speaker 0: They go somewhere they do their work.

602
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,340
Speaker 0: Maybe they're the kind of people who are afraid of being someplace new.

603
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:33,418
Speaker 0: You know that the traveling itself actually not always pleasant, you know, not everyone likes to fly on planes Yeah, but you always get to fly business class yeah, but that's not always that exciting trust me.

604
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,712
Speaker 0: and You know you're tired when you get there.

605
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:38,079
Speaker 0: you have business to do.

606
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:43,780
Speaker 0: You don't get a whole lot of time to hang out and do what you want because they make you come back pretty quickly.

607
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,693
Speaker 1: Well the same time a lot of people do business traveling.

608
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,277
Speaker 1: they spend a lot of time doing nothing the whole evening in the hotel, what are you gonna do?

609
00:41:50,297 --> 00:42:02,830
Speaker 1: and That's not a problem for people like us because we have things like Ds's and the internet so we can enjoy ourselves no matter where we are We can always do something if nothing else.

610
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:07,900
Speaker 1: if I had to go on a two-week business trip I could catch up on all my reading and I could catch up on all my video games.

611
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:15,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that is one thing is that I think a lot of business travelers might not make the most of their time in other places.

612
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:22,498
Speaker 0: But I could also see that it'd be upsetting if you were someone who tried to make the most of your time and you didn't Get enough time out there.

613
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:23,604
Speaker 1: Well what you do?

614
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:27,480
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people do this like say you got a business trip to I don't know Japan.

615
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:29,227
Speaker 1: So and the business trip is a week.

616
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,999
Speaker 1: take a week's vacation right after it.

617
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:35,679
Speaker 1: Stay in Japan on your own dime for the rest of the week and enjoy it.

618
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could try and go for that.

619
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,242
Speaker 0: It's not always easy You know.

620
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:41,492
Speaker 0: but and plus you have to you got.

621
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:47,139
Speaker 0: usually when you spend your vacation days You're planning that well in advance and business trips seem to sort of come up.

622
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:48,147
Speaker 1: No, they don't.

623
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:49,580
Speaker 1: only if it worked for a weird company.

624
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think they would tell you about your trip somewhere else like a year in advance.

625
00:42:55,957 --> 00:43:00,559
Speaker 1: I have most business trips I've known generally when I'd be going months and months and months ahead of time.

626
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:01,924
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

627
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:06,480
Speaker 1: granted all my business trips were two super lame places, but I'm not gonna get into that.

628
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,234
Speaker 0: I guess we just won't know enough about business trips until we go on some.

629
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:10,696
Speaker 0: though.

630
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:21,240
Speaker 1: whenever hotels I mean whenever we get hotels for Otakana Katsu Khan, and you know the hotel always has business or pleasure I always say business because I'm doing more business than I have anything else.

631
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:23,110
Speaker 0: It's a funny one.

632
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:28,200
Speaker 1: Yeah But honestly we're and we're gonna see who else wants to go in on us.

633
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,256
Speaker 1: But probably next summer we're thinking of actually going on a trip to overseas somewhere.

634
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,000
Speaker 1: We're not sure where.

635
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,206
Speaker 1: yeah We got a lot of vague ideas.

636
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,680
Speaker 1: I guess this isn't a contest or anything.

637
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,109
Speaker 1: But where do you guys think we should go?

638
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,619
Speaker 1: where should rim and Scott spend a week?

639
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think my ideas are pretty much to go see ancient shit like go to Greece Go to Rome and go to South America.

640
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,736
Speaker 0: Yep anywhere where there's ancient stuffs.

641
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:52,120
Speaker 0: I want to see old shit.

642
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,473
Speaker 1: I mean not to say that I don't want to go everywhere.

643
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:59,020
Speaker 0: I mean I'd love to spend time in Ireland If I had a plane I would just fly around the world and see everything.

644
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:02,980
Speaker 1: But I mean really we're thinking Italy Greece and somewhere along the Mediterranean.

645
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,030
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go to Turkey.

646
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:06,236
Speaker 0: Turkey is not so bad.

647
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:06,597
Speaker 0: I'll go.

648
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:07,120
Speaker 0: something's warm.

649
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:11,000
Speaker 0: No warm is good, so the Alps are out.

650
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,742
Speaker 0: So it's Everest.

651
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,089
Speaker 1: Everest can wait didn't you want to climb Mount Everest?

652
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,151
Speaker 0: I do, but it's cold.

653
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:17,254
Speaker 0: I?

654
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,079
Speaker 0: Want to go up there because I didn't realize that you could see space from up there.

655
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:29,839
Speaker 0: But I also don't want to go because it's hard and it's cold Yeah, and a lot of people die and a lot of you will die and they just leave you there.

656
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:41,440
Speaker 1: Yeah plus I mean think about it all the technology we've got and all the Massive amounts of planning and engineering and time and effort you can put into climbing Mount Everest and a lot of people just still die.

657
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:45,359
Speaker 0: Couldn't we just make like an Everest evader or something all right?

658
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,832
Speaker 0: Just like fly up there with a helicopter, and I fly back down.

659
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,720
Speaker 1: I don't think you could do helicopters.

660
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,830
Speaker 1: I don't think it would be too wise.

661
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:53,352
Speaker 0: why not?

662
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:53,815
Speaker 1: well one.

663
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:54,940
Speaker 1: the air is thinner that high.

664
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,551
Speaker 1: I don't know how high helicopter you can go.

665
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:57,517
Speaker 0: bring some air with you.

666
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,468
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the air.

667
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,594
Speaker 1: the helicopter flies in.

668
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:01,699
Speaker 0: I know bring some with you.

669
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:05,795
Speaker 1: So you're saying pressurize the earth.

670
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:12,660
Speaker 1: yep, yeah Plus wouldn't taking an escalator kind of defeat the point of climbing Mount Everest?

671
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:19,075
Speaker 1: Uh if the point is to see space then no I think the point is more to prove that you can do it.

672
00:45:19,156 --> 00:45:20,140
Speaker 0: see I don't really care about that.

673
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,164
Speaker 0: I just I was.

674
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:24,579
Speaker 0: actually I had no interest in seeing Mount Everest until I heard that you could see space.

675
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:26,466
Speaker 1: You heard that from an anime.

676
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:27,067
Speaker 0: That's right.

677
00:45:27,188 --> 00:45:28,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

678
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,157
Speaker 1: I think we've gone off to some tangent.

679
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,662
Speaker 1: so before we wrap this up Don't forget.

680
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,206

Speaker 1: if it's a popular podcast that sucks But you're up against some pretty stiff competition.

696
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:17,868
Speaker 0: Also, it's gonna take us a while to listen to all these podcasts and judge based on your descriptions and the podcasts Which one is really the worst and who should win.

697
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:20,820
Speaker 0: yeah, so don't expect a winner to be announced very soon.

698
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:24,591
Speaker 1: Also, I gotta say some of these podcasts.

699
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:27,259
Speaker 1: I listen to them a little bit and some of the write-ups you guys sent in.

700
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:31,552
Speaker 1: I Am dumbfounded at how bad some of these podcasts are.

701
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:33,460
Speaker 1: I really didn't expect it to be that bad.

702
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:34,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

703
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,034
Speaker 0: it's sort of like I can draw.

704
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:40,020
Speaker 0: if I try to draw something I'll draw some stick figures, maybe something a little better than a stick figure.

705
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,259
Speaker 0: It's bad, you know.

706
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:55,400
Speaker 0: But imagine if I drew that bad stick figure Put it up on a deviated art and said check out my awesome arts and then kept drawing them For weeks and weeks and weeks without acting like they were awesome and was totally serious about it.
