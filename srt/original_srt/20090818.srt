1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,407
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday, August 18th.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:12,088
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,360
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight games of Tron.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:33,595
Speaker 1: When I play Civ 4 I'd like to be the good guy.

6
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,199
Speaker 1: I like to think I am a good leader.

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,785
Speaker 1: I like to build libraries And universities and have all this culture and I generally try to like.

8
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:49,650
Speaker 0: I played kind of this really nice Standard game that I always know and you know you always play and there's always one AI does the jerk.

9
00:00:51,111 --> 00:01:00,648
Speaker 1: I'm looking at you, and you don't want to be the jerk right, but today You know I've been playing on the train And I decided for once to really just go all out because I just can't.

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,090
Speaker 0: I tried.

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,937
Speaker 0: I just can't be the jerk.

12
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:07,816
Speaker 0: like every time I try to attack people and pester them It's like you know.

13
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,443
Speaker 0: I noticed that the computer when they're a jerk.

14
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:10,890
Speaker 0: They never actually give a real attack.

15
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,730
Speaker 0: They just sort of pester.

16
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:16,887
Speaker 0: I Try to do a real attack and I always expend all my resources attacking and I fall behind that I lose.

17
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,797
Speaker 1: you haven't played much Civ 4 have you because when?

18
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:33,630
Speaker 1: when the AI attacks especially if it's Tokugawa They tend to wait and wait and wait and then one round you see like 40 elephants sitting right on the edge of your borders, and then they'll ask you for like can you spare some optics?

19
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,835
Speaker 1: And if you're like no, they're like okay war.

20
00:01:36,176 --> 00:01:37,580
Speaker 1: and if you're like yes, they're like okay war.

21
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:45,590
Speaker 1: But on the train I was Zulu and I had these all these spearmen.

22
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,730
Speaker 1: I'm trying to play my normal standard game, and I kind of almost roleplay when I place it for.

23
00:01:50,673 --> 00:02:01,109
Speaker 1: But then I'm looking at all these Spearmen that I built and I noticed that the neighboring civilization Which is currently the number one civilization of Charlemagne has nothing but horse archers.

24
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:08,401
Speaker 1: and Yeah, I destroyed his civilization And I'm rolling across the time being the jerk.

25
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,410
Speaker 0: That's just taking the low-hanging fruit.

26
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:11,476
Speaker 1: He was more.

27
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,870
Speaker 1: He was far higher than me more powerful than me.

28
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:19,288
Speaker 1: He just happened to have an army that consisted primarily of horses, and I happen to have almost nothing but spearmen.

29
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,801
Speaker 0: no Well, then you had an army of horses and spearmen didn't you?

30
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:34,966
Speaker 0: so then I invaded everyone else on the continent And I've basically been alternatingly declaring something if you can conquer someone else early in a game of Civ 4 especially if they have a bunch Of technologies you basically have this huge upper hand.

31
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:36,472
Speaker 0: now for the rest of the game It's game over.

32
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:42,670
Speaker 1: especially Civ 4 has all those cool options like having them capitulate to you or becoming a vassal state of yours.

33
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:44,505
Speaker 1: Yeah, all sorts of cool stuff.

34
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,004
Speaker 1: The moral is I got to stop playing so far on the train.

35
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:49,130
Speaker 1: I'm not getting anything else done.

36
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:52,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I knew it was gonna happen.

37
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,686
Speaker 0: You know I've been riding this train for a bajillion years.

38
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,010
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen one day.

39
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,869
Speaker 0: It's gonna have some stomach trouble on the train.

40
00:02:59,231 --> 00:02:59,934
Speaker 0: It was unpleasant.

41
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,209
Speaker 1: have you for the first time in your life pooped on a metro north train?

42
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,060
Speaker 0: now I've pooped on the train a handful of times before.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:14,250
Speaker 1: I'm talking about in the bathroom not in the vestibule But This is an unpleasant pooping on the train.

44
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:19,030
Speaker 1: Is this gonna be one of those epic stories like Scott naked on the bathroom floor when he's sick?

45
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,150
Speaker 0: No, it was more like I was walking towards the train.

46
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,444
Speaker 0: I sat on the train as soon as I sat down.

47
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,470
Speaker 0: I didn't feel so right.

48
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:32,940
Speaker 0: I got up, and I had to pester the guy next to me which I was like sorry whatever I went to the bathroom, and I pooped.

49
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:35,448
Speaker 0: and you know those train toilets.

50
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:45,930
Speaker 0: luckily I got one that was pretty good and worked and no one else needed to use it during the whole train ride But you know they don't have a lot of water in them, so you can really see your poop pretty well.

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,619
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna gross anyone out though.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,686
Speaker 1: as we know from German toilets It's good to see your poop.

53
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:57,816
Speaker 1: in fact You should look at your poop because it's a good indicator of your health And it's nasty.

54
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:01,650
Speaker 0: poop looks a lot different when it's just sitting there than when it's falling into a big pool.

55
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,785
Speaker 1: Part of it is there's something clean and sterile not really, but just viscerally.

56
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,334
Speaker 1: when you see poop, and it's in like water It's like all right.

57
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,565
Speaker 1: It is in a toilet where it should be.

58
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:21,430
Speaker 1: all is right with the world But when you see human poop And it is not submerged in water that most of the time indicates a severe dysfunction in some manner.

59
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, either someone is pooped where they should not have pooped.

60
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,162
Speaker 1: So At least you did not lose.

61
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:29,989
Speaker 1: don't shit your pants.

62
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,269
Speaker 0: No, no, but I had to pester the guy next to me again when I had to poop a second time.

63
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,715
Speaker 0: Oh, but one.

64
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:39,869
Speaker 0: the interesting thing right is not the pooping right which is just what was it?

65
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,366
Speaker 1: Dave Riley said the best thing in the world is pooping and the worst thing in the world is too much pooping right.

66
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,772
Speaker 0: so it's that You know.

67
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:50,883
Speaker 0: when I had to poop the first time the conductor was coming down to collect the tickets And I passed him on my way to the toilet.

68
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:51,849
Speaker 0: It was in the rear car.

69
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,616
Speaker 0: He didn't ask for my ticket.

70
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,630
Speaker 0: when I walked past him all right, I pooped all right.

71
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,489
Speaker 0: I came out of the pooping and went back to my seat.

72
00:04:58,712 --> 00:04:59,950
Speaker 0: He never came and asked for my ticket.

73
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,497
Speaker 1: How far were you along the way?

74
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,170
Speaker 1: because I've noticed there's a point after which they don't seem to care anymore.

75
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,039
Speaker 0: Well, it was just like a one-stop train.

76
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,084
Speaker 0: It was beacon first stop.

77
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, they only check once on that train.

78
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,418
Speaker 1: It'd be trivial to get where I'd that train without paying as long as you're willing to Sit in that bathroom for a little while.

79
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,643
Speaker 0: so I did, but it's like.

80
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:21,190
Speaker 0: I walked right past him right He was going from the back of the train to the all right Scott conductor on a train.

81
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,870
Speaker 1: Here's what he thought that guy has to poop.

82
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:34,273
Speaker 1: Nothing in the world will put me in between him and pooping in the place He should be pooping because I'm a conductor and I've encountered after there should be after I poop the second time Right.

83
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:41,349
Speaker 0: instead of going back to my seat and pestering the other guy again I just sat down on the floor outside the bathroom just in case you know.

84
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:42,695
Speaker 0: But I made it to beacon.

85
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:45,770
Speaker 0: sitting there also was really weird when I sat in my seat.

86
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,090
Speaker 0: It was a window seat that saw like it was cool The air conditioning was working but that Sun hit my face to the window is just like murder.

87
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:59,341
Speaker 0: so it was better to sit on the floor so the Sun couldn't get me and Then poop on one side on the other.

88
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,747
Speaker 1: you had no way to win.

89
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,850
Speaker 0: the conductor Right was right there when I was sitting on the floor didn't pester me.

90
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,250
Speaker 1: So again Scott you see a guy get up on the train where people normally don't get up and head to the bathroom twice.

91
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:15,061
Speaker 1: Then he sits down outside the bathroom on the floor.

92
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:17,007
Speaker 1: You did not want to disturb that man.

93
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,808
Speaker 1: less poop appear also, I.

94
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,870
Speaker 0: It seems like the people who'd run the parking at the train station.

95
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:30,250
Speaker 0: They it seems like they're only coming to like write tickets like once like every few weeks.

96
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, they call me for that.

97
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,662
Speaker 1: I got a ticket today.

98
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:38,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, really today Yeah, cuz I parked up on the street cuz I didn't get a spot.

99
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,609
Speaker 1: I think they back right like they only go and check like a spot check.

100
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:50,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that I parked up on the street today And I did not get a ticket cuz I ran onto the train so fast without paying.

101
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,570
Speaker 1: they just didn't care.

102
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,610
Speaker 0: No, I think they're not checking up on the street.

103
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,324
Speaker 0: We should just park up on the street and get.

104
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:56,029
Speaker 0: we'll get away with it.

105
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,897
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do that.

106
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:57,341
Speaker 0: why not?

107
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,374
Speaker 1: cuz I like parking, you know Remember I get there early enough.

108
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:00,679
Speaker 1: I can park like right.

109
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,600
Speaker 0: next to the thing is the trick is most people try to park up On the street near the right-hand entrance.

110
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:08,952
Speaker 0: I park up on the street on the left-hand Hill.

111
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:14,310
Speaker 0: so basically I just walk up the steep hill and I'm at my car And I walk down the steep hill and I'm at the trains, you know.

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,945
Speaker 0: And it's actually not really any farther than say parking in the faraway parking spots.

113
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,650
Speaker 0: It's just uphill.

114
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,346
Speaker 0: So that'll deter many a larger individual indeed, but you know as long as it's not raining.

115
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,430
Speaker 0: It's totally awesome.

116
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,303
Speaker 1: Thing is if I get that house, I'll be living so close to the train station.

117
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,610
Speaker 1: I'll just walk or bike every day.

118
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing Really?

119
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,946
Speaker 0: Well, I might permit expire because they didn't want to have to deal with it.

120
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,340
Speaker 0: if I you know Cuz I'm gonna move hopefully relatively soon.

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,650
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start turning up the heat on my Investigations even though I got a ticket But I don't want to bet to pay a bunch of money for parking in the meantime.

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,984
Speaker 1: The ticket was so cheap that the fact that I have not paid for much was the ticket.

123
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,831
Speaker 1: It's like 40 bucks 40.

124
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,313
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

125
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,430
Speaker 1: I'm not paid for parking in over a year of parking.

126
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,606
Speaker 0: Wait, so it was 40 for parking in a metered spot without.

127
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,299
Speaker 0: yeah Whoa, cuz it was only 20.

128
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,890
Speaker 0: I got 20 for parking in a permit spot without a permit.

129
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,779
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know why it was 40, but it was there.

130
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:12,015
Speaker 1: and the thing is I didn't pay the $3 or whatever For over a year.

131
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:13,264
Speaker 1: so kind of add it up.

132
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:14,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still win.

133
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,577
Speaker 0: Yeah But now I'm gonna go to.

134
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:17,119
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

135
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:21,138
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get parking up on the street and I'm not gonna pay until I get Another ticket up there.

136
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,481
Speaker 1: too bad.

137
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,510
Speaker 1: I can't do the RIT thing.

138
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:30,670
Speaker 1: I know it wouldn't work of where I used to keep a bunch of parking tickets and whenever I parked illegally I would just put one on my car and then no one would bother to run me another one.

139
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I already had the policy of one ticket per violation per day.

140
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:40,669
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That worked real well until one day I saw a guy standing there holding the ticket waiting for me to come back to my car.

141
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,668
Speaker 1: He was like, what's all this?

142
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:44,837
Speaker 1: And my response.

143
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,562
Speaker 0: I don't know.

144
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:46,830
Speaker 1: I left my car here for like a week.

145
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,193
Speaker 1: You got any gaming news Gaming news.

146
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,341
Speaker 1: I don't think people want to hear more about pooping and parking.

147
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is one gaming news.

148
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,210
Speaker 0: That was today.

149
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,233
Speaker 0: That was gigantic.

150
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:07,029
Speaker 0: I guess to some people is that the slim ps3 rumor is for real.

151
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,722
Speaker 1: Let me tell you I was surprised at how slim it is.

152
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,830
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually not that slim.

153
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,710
Speaker 0: I think the pictures make it look a lot better.

154
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:20,590
Speaker 0: When you look at it in pictures next to the actual three original ps3, it's not that slim.

155
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:25,786
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's basically like original ps2 sized, you know, it's.

156
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,050
Speaker 0: it's not like this is tiny.

157
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,341
Speaker 0: It's just tiny compared to the gigantic monster.

158
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,689
Speaker 0: That is you know, the original ps3.

159
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:37,685
Speaker 0: It's like calling a camera tiny because you know next to Godzilla it's like oh, yeah sure.

160
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:38,528
Speaker 0: Camera is tiny.

161
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure Okay, fine compared to the original Xbox.

162
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,150
Speaker 1: It is perhaps portable perhaps.

163
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:48,490
Speaker 0: The thing is is actually, you know, it actually looks a lot more pleasant.

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,225
Speaker 0: You know, it still doesn't have any freaking games and the price is I guess reasonable.

165
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,330
Speaker 0: now, right at what?

166
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,057
Speaker 0: $300 with 120 gigs that's not bad.

167
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,310
Speaker 0: But so the system I guess doesn't suck anymore, but still has no games.

168
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,222
Speaker 0: So, I guess it's a blu-ray player if you really want one.

169
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,850
Speaker 0: but digital is the win and blu-ray is to dead.

170
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,956
Speaker 0: So that's all I got to say.

171
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:24,726
Speaker 0: I mean, you know if there were good games of the ps3 and I Had video games and I needed more video games because I have more video games than I know what to play Right, then I might consider one if I already had a 360, you

172
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,268
Speaker 1: know, it's funny.

173
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:36,450
Speaker 1: thinking back It's amazing how much people seem to be vested in this fight between Sony You know the HD DVD and the blu-ray when really it was kind of like the Crimean War there were no winners.

174
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean blu-ray is sort of the quote winner.

175
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,279
Speaker 0: The thing is right blu-ray still isn't.

176
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,110
Speaker 0: you know, there aren't enough players first of all, right?

177
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,461
Speaker 0: they're not cheap enough even though they're getting cheaper and the discs are still too expensive for anyone to care.

178
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:52,169
Speaker 0: and most people are happy with DVD.

179
00:10:52,189 --> 00:11:02,210
Speaker 0: and I think I read somewhere that you know Even though blu-ray is quote one there are more HD DVD players out there in people's homes than blu-ray players.

180
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,196
Speaker 1: Where'd you get that?

181
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:04,101
Speaker 1: some guy on the internet?

182
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,430
Speaker 0: There was some guy on the internet.

183
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:06,114
Speaker 0: It was an.

184
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:06,899
Speaker 0: it was like a little stuff.

185
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,630
Speaker 1: Are you sure it was some guy on the internet?

186
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,698
Speaker 0: I can show you the link.

187
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,667
Speaker 1: Are you sure it wasn't?

188
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,571
Speaker 0: Nothing.

189
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, believe it if you want to.

190
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:25,570
Speaker 0: but it said a thing on the internet said that there were more HD DVD players in people's houses and blu-ray players in people's houses, so There's this article and I'm not going to talk about the article.

191
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,008
Speaker 1: The article is well-written and there's a lot of good discussion about it.

192
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:40,190
Speaker 1: But on Tetenhammer the question that has been asked the the the point of all this is quote The balancing act the challenges of class balance in massively multiplayer online games.

193
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:47,810
Speaker 1: so there's this huge article and People talking about the article on slashdot and other places.

194
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,395
Speaker 1: It's like every.

195
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,005
Speaker 1: there's this monkey in the room that no one's looking at the monkeys pooping on everything.

196
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's destroyed the walls.

197
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:55,569
Speaker 1: He's parked his car.

198
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,253
Speaker 1: We shouldn't have.

199
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,550
Speaker 1: but no one is talking about the the monkey or maybe the monkey shouldn't be doing that.

200
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:05,489
Speaker 1: They're all debating like the the hat the monkeys where they can't think outside the box.

201
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:15,870
Speaker 1: But this whole thing the whole discussion hinges on the age-old That the problem that has existed since the first mud the very first mud when they're in since freaking.

202
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,818
Speaker 0: You know hero quest or D&D.

203
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,630
Speaker 1: it's existed in the first game where there were classes.

204
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:25,124
Speaker 1: some guy playing a fighter looked at some guy playing a wizard and said this is bullshit.

205
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:26,649
Speaker 1: wizards are more powerful than fighters.

206
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:41,287
Speaker 1: and There's been this kind of unwritten assumption in all gaming forever that in any massively multiplayer game or even any multiplayer game the classes all have to be either perfectly identical or perfectly balanced equal but different.

207
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:48,550
Speaker 1: and Every piece of gaming literature just about that I encounter on a daily basis or anything anyone writes about or articles like this.

208
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:55,590
Speaker 1: People always seem to just assume this truism guy it brings you back to our packs panel, but I'll get to that later.

209
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:56,793
Speaker 1: I don't know.

210
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:59,641
Speaker 1: Why doesn't anyone ask why classes have to be balanced?

211
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,910
Speaker 1: Why can't you make a game where they're actually unbalanced?

212
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,330
Speaker 1: I think it would make a better game.

213
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,715
Speaker 1: I think make things more interesting.

214
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:17,968
Speaker 0: the reason is because when you're playing a game of combat right say for example D&D fourth edition which is the prime example of this right and the only thing people are really doing is fighting and you get rewards for winning at fighting.

215
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:27,737
Speaker 0: right if One person has like a hundred attacks that are all wicked powerful and awesome and the other person all they can do is like poke things of the stick Right what?

216
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:38,064
Speaker 0: and the whole game is fights the whole time The person with the hundred attacks of awesome is gonna have all this fun doing all this awesome shit and the person who can poke Things with a stake is gonna sit there being bored with nothing to do.

217
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:46,330
Speaker 0: and so When you have a game like that you need all but consider this the common incentive for winning these things.

218
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:58,518
Speaker 1: So what the game gives you in reward for doing what it is that you were doing is usually XP Which makes you level up, but if everything's balanced and everyone levels up at the same rate based on the same stuff You're not really gaining anything.

219
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:04,561
Speaker 0: You're just kind of unlocking content because it's not versus It's just grind your own self hamster in a wheel action.

220
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:04,861
Speaker 1: the other.

221
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:13,961
Speaker 1: the real trouble is that MMOs really if you look at it they don't reward that many behaviors in game and When they do they often do it in a very shallow manner.

222
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,010
Speaker 1: and there are games that have tried to do other things.

223
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:24,354
Speaker 1: I mean I knew someone who very unironically played a dancer in Star Wars galaxies and only cared about dancing But the game.

224
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,390
Speaker 1: how much was there to reward people who are good at dancing?

225
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,466
Speaker 1: Compared to how much was there to roar people who are good at killing shit mm-hmm.

226
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,806
Speaker 1: and What this brings me to is one this article.

227
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:36,290
Speaker 1: you can read it.

228
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:42,317
Speaker 1: I think almost everyone gaming is missing the point and I think There's this almost greater problem of.

229
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:47,642
Speaker 1: there are a lot of assumed arguments in gaming like the console wars No, the PlayStation is gonna win.

230
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:48,710
Speaker 1: No the Xbox is gonna win.

231
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,654
Speaker 1: No, the Wii is gonna win.

232
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,945
Speaker 1: and no very few people make the point of.

233
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:59,461
Speaker 1: maybe There's no such thing as winning or maybe we need to look at this from a different angle And I think that's that's what happens in any sort of realm.

234
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,588
Speaker 0: right is when gaming was new right there was.

235
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,917
Speaker 0: no there weren't even Genres.

236
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,250
Speaker 0: just every game was a game.

237
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,603
Speaker 0: You know like what genre is Donkey Kong?

238
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,790
Speaker 0: I guess a platformer?

239
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:08,894
Speaker 0: Maybe what?

240
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:22,263
Speaker 0: now we have genre is like pac-man a pac-man I mean, but now people look at a game like a war game an RTS once and labels and You know like you know standard tropes.

241
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,917
Speaker 0: They can't escape them They can't think outside of them.

242
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:30,310
Speaker 0: once they have this you know framework to think within Yeah, you get all this can't think of anything else outside of it.

243
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,724
Speaker 1: It's like all this conceptual baggage where you think well Yes, so it has to have this and this and this.

244
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:42,198
Speaker 0: there's this idea I forget what the idea is called that actually like language limits What the ideas people can have like.

245
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,444
Speaker 0: well are you know it's.

246
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:48,870
Speaker 0: I'm not saying whether it's true or not But I'm saying there's an idea out there that I was about to say that there there are many arguments again.

247
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:49,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of thing.

248
00:15:49,690 --> 00:16:01,861
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there's an idea out there that you know people can't think of ideas that they are unable to express with you know languages that they know and True or not that's basically you know.

249
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:10,107
Speaker 0: sort of the same idea that we're seeing here Is that you know people had this sort of like this language of gaming right these ideas of gaming and people can't.

250
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:15,306
Speaker 0: it's very difficult to be able to think of ideas in gaming that are outside of.

251
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:17,627
Speaker 0: you know the nomenclatures

252
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:36,906
Speaker 1: But anyway at the penny arcade expo in Seattle, which is coming up over the holiday weekend It just so happens that one of the panels we're doing there one of three is Losing should be fun which attacks one of the kind of assumed truisms of gaming that Losing socks and winnings awesome and that gave the goal of all games should be to win.

253
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,692
Speaker 0: interestingly enough There's an.

254
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,037
Speaker 0: I looked at the panel schedule.

255
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah some.

256
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,666
Speaker 0: they apparently write.

257
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:51,630
Speaker 0: some other guy He's actually a game industry professional has a panel called winning sucks And I read the synopsis and it sounds like he's got the same idea as us.

258
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,290
Speaker 0: And I wonder why they thought that they should give the same.

259
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,570
Speaker 0: You know two people submit almost the same panel idea, and they schedule both of them.

260
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,381
Speaker 0: I think that was a mistake.

261
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:12,424
Speaker 1: I don't know but whatever I'll go to his panel, and it's hard to say because I kind of you know after packs much like we do with every other convention I kind of sidestep the standard process and just have contact.

262
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:18,885
Speaker 1: so maybe the people I talked to Just gave us the panel, but then the normal process brought this other panel in through the normal channels.

263
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,410
Speaker 0: who knows how it happened?

264
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,150
Speaker 0: But I just think it's kind of weird and it'll be interesting.

265
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:26,983
Speaker 0: And I'm sure the I'm you know the other guy's panel sounds pretty good actually.

266
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:28,470
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna check it out.

267
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,803
Speaker 0: You know to make sure and you know we'll handle it professionally.

268
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:32,505
Speaker 0: It'll be all right.

269
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,770
Speaker 0: It's not like it's a competition.

270
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,816
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we had the same panel.

271
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:39,246
Speaker 0: I guess we had to hate each other and be all versus bloody blood.

272
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,983
Speaker 0: no obviously We agree with this dude from what I can tell.

273
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,189
Speaker 0: so we should be all buddy, buddy.

274
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:52,917
Speaker 1: But in the Raven Theatre on Friday 1130 beyond the Candyland Oh, man, that's us.

275
00:17:53,479 --> 00:18:06,050
Speaker 1: and then in the not the Raven Theatre But the as I'm looking through the schedule over to the sun, maybe Unity Wolfman theater at 1030 on Saturday losing should be fun.

276
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:16,930
Speaker 1: and then Sunday Sunday at 10 a.m.. Our headlining panel the panel that we're hopefully going to retire after next year beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

277
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,710
Speaker 0: So basically we have like the first panel every morning.

278
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:28,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's pretty awesome for us because basically like we show up at the con early every day We do our panel, and then we the rest of the day do whatever we want.

279
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:31,475
Speaker 1: the other thing I'm really excited about is this year We get a privilege.

280
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:36,120
Speaker 1: I don't know if we got this last year and didn't take advantage of it But we actually get a privilege for being panelists.

281
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,332
Speaker 1: we can go into the exhibit hall an hour and a half before the doors Open.

282
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,842
Speaker 1: it's pretty and unknown worlds is gonna be in there.

283
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:43,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna go talk to the NS guys.

284
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,998
Speaker 1: I'm going to talk to them until they get a restraining order.

285
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:51,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, so how's that skull bitey bitey bitey bitey?

286
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,285
Speaker 0: It was just bite them.

287
00:18:55,292 --> 00:19:10,785
Speaker 1: No, I'm going to hold my upper body perfectly stationary and jump very slowly Mmm, and demand that babblers come back, but anyway things of the day.

288
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,930
Speaker 1: What do you have for me Scott?

289
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,340
Speaker 0: So I was looking around for thing of the day.

290
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,204
Speaker 1: that sounds dangerous.

291
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:16,270
Speaker 1: You kind of wound up to that.

292
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,995
Speaker 1: I heard that whole intake of breath like I didn't find much.

293
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,060
Speaker 0: that was gaming related.

294
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,170
Speaker 1: I got like five things of the day.

295
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,843
Speaker 0: Oh my delicious links are like text shit cuz I'm all Tekken lately.

296
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:34,230
Speaker 0: There's that freestyle running guy who like College humor videos, which I didn't watch today, but anyway, I did find this.

297
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,970
Speaker 0: It's actually two things and I'm sure I'm late to the party.

298
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,250
Speaker 0: I'm sure that these are very old and I came to them and discovered them very late, but you know what I'm admitting it.

299
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,958
Speaker 0: So that's fine.

300
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,927
Speaker 0: other people, you know Some people come up, but it's only a problem if you find something old on the internet.

301
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:57,013
Speaker 0: if you're like Hey, this thing's totally new and awesome, you know present it as if it's old and no one will tell you dude That's an antique right?

302
00:19:57,274 --> 00:19:59,863
Speaker 0: So anyway, what this is is two flash games.

303
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,007
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if there's more.

304
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,050
Speaker 0: they're on new grounds.

305
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:07,061
Speaker 0: They're called Megaman verse Ghosts and goblins and Megaman verse Metroid.

306
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:18,280
Speaker 0: and what it is is pretty much you play Metroid Except you're not Samus your Megaman or you play ghosts and goblins, but you're not Samus You're not what's-his-name Maxim is his name, right?

307
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,723
Speaker 1: I don't know Max.

308
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:22,430
Speaker 1: Well, I was never on Maximo.

309
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:27,990
Speaker 1: I think maybe I was never all that up on the quote-unquote lore of ghouls and ghosts and ghosts.

310
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,475
Speaker 0: I can't forget the dude's name.

311
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:30,458
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's man.

312
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,682
Speaker 0: What it's like that game.

313
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,188
Speaker 1: Fuck that game.

314
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:36,429
Speaker 0: That's true But your Megaman is said of that guy.

315
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:44,595
Speaker 0: Basically these games like this is a really great concept really great graphical execution really great remixed music Execution.

316
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,930
Speaker 0: they let you change the controls, which is nice.

317
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:54,230
Speaker 0: They got some nice options, but the controls themselves are shitty and thus the games are relatively unplayable and frustrating.

318
00:20:54,692 --> 00:21:03,043
Speaker 0: but it's still worth, you know a poke at both of them for a few minutes just to check it out and Hope that somebody else comes in and you know makes a fix.

319
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:09,020
Speaker 0: I do want to also say I Don't know the name of this game, but apparently on Xbox Live Arcade.

320
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,802
Speaker 0: There's a new game.

321
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:18,185
Speaker 0: That is a Metroidvania type game And it apparently is the holy shit awesome times a billion from what I hear.

322
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:23,789
Speaker 0: So if you have an Xbox Just go find whatever this game is that I don't know the name of?

323
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:25,899
Speaker 0: That was so helpful, wasn't it?

324
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,045
Speaker 1: That was great.

325
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:27,427
Speaker 1: Yeah.

326
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,070
Speaker 1: All right.

327
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,570
Speaker 1: So for hopefully not all of you read Kotaku, but I have to link this because it's just too cool.

328
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:38,922
Speaker 1: this is a collection of Artistic renderings of link in many different styles.

329
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:40,890
Speaker 1: There are many many pictures here.

330
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,630
Speaker 1: They're all fairly badass.

331
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:50,436
Speaker 1: But I really really have to point out and stress to you the one that is basically link as Thor He's smoking.

332
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:53,670
Speaker 1: He's got a giant sword and more muscles than Wolverine.

333
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,197
Speaker 0: Wolverine doesn't have any muscles.

334
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:58,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know who has muscles.

335
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:58,988
Speaker 0: strong guy.

336
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:06,590
Speaker 1: He's got a beard too, he's very just kind of Scandinavian and badass.

337
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:07,833
Speaker 0: Watch out.

338
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:11,610
Speaker 1: so we we couldn't come up with the show because we could come up with a show.

339
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:18,809
Speaker 1: I came up with it just now we did but prior we couldn't come up with one because I didn't really have a chance to Play Blood Bowl yet, and I'm not really playing any new games.

340
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,237
Speaker 0: I heard of a video game drought right now.

341
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,627
Speaker 1: All my hopes are pinned on Starfy and NS2.

342
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,790
Speaker 0: I downloaded Starfy.

343
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:27,639
Speaker 0: It's just a sort of a platforming game.

344
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,030
Speaker 1: It's like sort of a platforming game.

345
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,318
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you might like Starfy.

346
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:33,150
Speaker 0: But anyway, I only played it for like 10 minutes.

347
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:38,329
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know after PAX which is in like, you know, we'll only have to do one more show before PAX.

348
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:42,806
Speaker 0: So the thing is after PAX there's gonna be a glut of gaming.

349
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:43,910
Speaker 0: I can almost guarantee it.

350
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,462
Speaker 0: It's like every gaming company is holding back for PAX.

351
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:47,166
Speaker 0: I can just tell.

352
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:57,763
Speaker 0: but anyway There is if you don't know there's a. there's a new Tron movie coming out and Tron is like one of the most important geek Things there is in gaming and movies and animation.

353
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:59,450
Speaker 0: It's total crossover in all areas.

354
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,464
Speaker 0: But I watched the trailer and it was totally awesome.

355
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:04,650
Speaker 0: at least the trailer was awesome.

356
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,917
Speaker 0: Who knows if it's actually gonna be awesome, but you know, whatever.

357
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,710
Speaker 0: but yeah Tron is something I like a whole lot.

358
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,394
Speaker 0: You know, I mean like.

359
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:18,510
Speaker 0: I think about video games and it's like you play a lot of video games But you wouldn't actually want to really play a lot of video games, right?

360
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,221
Speaker 0: It's like would you really want to be in the world of Counter-Strike?

361
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:22,566
Speaker 0: No, not really.

362
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:23,350
Speaker 0: That would just suck.

363
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,961
Speaker 0: Do you really want to be in the world of Donkey Kong?

364
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,870
Speaker 0: No, that sucks big time, right?

365
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:28,713
Speaker 1: I don't know.

366
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:35,759
Speaker 0: Hyrule would be too bad to live in not too bad depending on who you were and what was going on at The time but you know what Tron like.

367
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,790
Speaker 0: all I want is fucking real VR Tron.

368
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:44,350
Speaker 0: I would never stop playing that game in a million years just riding bikes and throwing discs.

369
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:45,836
Speaker 1: It's not much better than that.

370
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:51,970
Speaker 0: So the thing is there in honor of this new movie that's coming out Which by the way, we'll have a Daft Punk soundtrack.

371
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:57,583
Speaker 1: You know, what's really funny I Didn't know this and original Daft Punk soundtrack.

372
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:05,417
Speaker 1: Scott comes home and he's like You're never gonna guess who's making the soundtrack for the neutron movie and I'm like, uh, I don't know Daft Punk You totally knew.

373
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,245
Speaker 0: I just saw the tweet or something.

374
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:08,210
Speaker 1: Basically, you know what I thought.

375
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,201
Speaker 1: I thought to myself who would it be awesome if it were that?

376
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,750
Speaker 1: it's definitely not and I was like Daft Punk.

377
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:15,641
Speaker 0: but anyway the.

378
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,936
Speaker 0: In honor of this new movie We will talk about all the.

379
00:24:20,036 --> 00:24:24,381
Speaker 0: there are many video games that are Tron that involve Throwing discs or riding bikes.

380
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:25,950
Speaker 0: let it and many of them are good.

381
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,241
Speaker 1: There's gonna be really through at least in terms of the bus.

382
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:29,844
Speaker 1: start with bikes.

383
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:31,872
Speaker 0: Yeah bikes Definitely.

384
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:38,050
Speaker 1: there are two like completely opposite philosophies about this sort of game the top-down view and the first-person view.

385
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,055
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna say right now.

386
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,749
Speaker 1: I think they're equally awesome and that we should have both.

387
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:47,129
Speaker 0: Yes, in fact, you know, why not have a game where you can just push a button and change the view?

388
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:48,655
Speaker 0: I think GL Tron can do.

389
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:49,197
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

390
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:54,098
Speaker 1: if I can't have the choice and I want to win top-down always There's no reason to ever be first person.

391
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,292
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah first person just makes it harder, but you know It's harder and more thrilling it does.

392
00:24:58,352 --> 00:25:02,909
Speaker 0: it definitely makes a lot more thrilling but it's cool if everyone's playing first person because then it's like it's all.

393
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:13,770
Speaker 0: you're getting closer to the real Tron that I'm looking for and actually didn't the the Arcade guy the retro arcade guy say he had like some crazy diss of Tron machine?

394
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:20,370
Speaker 1: He did but I remember him saying that it was really difficult to move and dangerous to move and incredibly rare.

395
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is I've seen screenshots of the diss of Tron arcade game.

396
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,510
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever actually played it like the original diss of Tron.

397
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,207
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll talk that's that's a disc game and we haven't played it so much.

398
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:35,590
Speaker 0: So, I'm sorry It's probably one of the most important Tron games that we're not gonna talk about.

399
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:43,623
Speaker 1: I mean honestly the one I played the most in my life was snafu for the Intellivision Yeah, which is basically Tron but it was four player Tron and it was in.

400
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:47,899
Speaker 0: it had like a million different modes And there's also Tron for the Atari which is basically this.

401
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,847
Speaker 1: to this day the music just like will pop into my head randomly especially whenever I see Tron related things.

402
00:25:52,867 --> 00:26:03,212
Speaker 1: just The game was cool because not only could it be like many many player and I had these AI that would kind of play With you.

403
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:09,921
Speaker 1: if the game turned out to be just for like computers left It would go in like super fast mode and just they would.

404
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,970
Speaker 1: you would see which one won and it was really cool.

405
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:23,396
Speaker 0: Yeah I spent at least a thousand hours of my life playing that with my little brother and my grandma And I said the thing about the the the bike games right is that it's basically everyone is basically a line that you draw.

406
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:32,670
Speaker 0: you're drawing a line and everyone draws their line at the same speed and you basically If your line bumps into something a wall or another person you lose.

407
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,152
Speaker 1: They're not.

408
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,398
Speaker 1: there are not always walls.

409
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,242
Speaker 1: Sometimes it wraps.

410
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:36,468
Speaker 0: Sometimes it wraps.

411
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:36,810
Speaker 0: It's true.

412
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:45,289
Speaker 0: but if you if you bump into someone's bike or someone's line or you know a wall that doesn't wrap you're dead and it's whoever's alive at the end is the winner.

413
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,419
Speaker 1: and It's funny because it's like this mix of strategy.

414
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like who goes faster, right?

415
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,141
Speaker 0: It's all about positioning and reflexes and well, well, well, it's technically.

416
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:59,930
Speaker 0: it is a perfect information complete information game technically But it has speed to it, right?

417
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,074
Speaker 0: It's like the thing is the same way.

418
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,199
Speaker 0: the Tetris has speed.

419
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:04,590
Speaker 1: the game is still discreet because it's on a computer.

420
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,830
Speaker 1: There are units of movement.

421
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:14,956
Speaker 1: So if you have just like Tetris But if you have the speed down it is literally nothing more than a game of plotting out the perfect strategy and it is Mathematically a solvable game.

422
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:18,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them you can move diagonal and some of them you can't though, right?

423
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,838
Speaker 1: You had the best in.

424
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:20,844
Speaker 1: not one was the Atari one.

425
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:25,625
Speaker 0: when you can move diagonal Yeah cross over other people's like paths diagonally.

426
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:29,282
Speaker 0: as long as you're in the right spot You can turn your path on and off.

427
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:34,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could also like Drive into someone else's bike, you know, but not into the line.

428
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:42,240
Speaker 0: So if you hit the if you crash into them directly and then turn away that you can actually avoid them and snap through to the other side.

429
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:53,537
Speaker 0: and that's really good because it sort of avoids like the Pointless endgame of oh you've cut off, you know 51% of the board on your side and I've got 49% of the board on my side.

430
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:56,410
Speaker 0: if we both play perfectly and don't slip up I lose thing.

431
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,674
Speaker 0: I'll just kill myself.

432
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,099
Speaker 1: Scott never played perfectly.

433
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,363
Speaker 0: So I play perfectly.

434
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,590
Speaker 1: we talking about should we whip out the Atari again?

435
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,497
Speaker 1: Maybe film it.

436
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:04,064
Speaker 1: We'll have a.

437
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:09,847
Speaker 0: Maybe we should play some GL Tron - which is far more exciting and modern it is.

438
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:10,970
Speaker 1: It's also a lot more difficult.

439
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, GL Tron if you don't know is basically a 3d Tron that is open source pretty old Like it's it's.

440
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:18,510
Speaker 0: it's been around for a long time.

441
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:18,871
Speaker 0: It's all.

442
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:20,056
Speaker 0: it's a Linux game, but it's all.

443
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:23,129
Speaker 0: I think you can run it on pretty much fucking any computer that has open GL.

444
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,213
Speaker 0: Alright.

445
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,498
Speaker 0: and basically it's just Tron 3d.

446
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,884
Speaker 0: That's it.

447
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:28,330
Speaker 0: That's all there is to it.

448
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,799
Speaker 0: It's just modern and fast and good-looking.

449
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,950
Speaker 0: and you know, you did it looks like actual Tron.

450
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,048
Speaker 0: In fact, it looks better than the first Tron movie a lot better.

451
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:43,877
Speaker 0: But you know, it's out there and I think if you want to play a Tron bike game You just go get GL Tron.

452
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:46,870
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll put a link to the to the website in the in the show thingy.

453
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:54,274
Speaker 1: But basically, I don't know there's something about these sort of kind of very simple very direct competition games That to this day.

454
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,181
Speaker 1: I always fall back on them.

455
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:56,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

456
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:58,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what it is.

457
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:58,811
Speaker 0: It's like.

458
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:07,476
Speaker 0: it's like just you know, there's a lot of competitive games out there the sort of complex and fiddly part Straight on mono a mono.

459
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:12,710
Speaker 0: They're so simple draw a line versus the other guy drawn a line like outlaw shoot the other dude.

460
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,150
Speaker 1: They're so simple play some fucking out and they're so, you know that minute to learn a lifetime to master situation.

461
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:34,783
Speaker 1: but I think the simplicity of the rules and the directness of the competition creates this sort of Competitive intimacy to where you and the opponent, you know When you play a game of say Puerto Rico or Tigers and Euphrates against three equal Amazingly skilled opponents and it's a completely different game from playing against noobs.

462
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:40,824
Speaker 1: in a game like this You you know that the other player has complete and total awareness of the game.

463
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:42,330
Speaker 1: You cannot trick them.

464
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:44,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you cannot trick them.

465
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:44,932
Speaker 1: It is so.

466
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:50,190
Speaker 1: it's almost like you are both the same person at the same time in the competition.

467
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:56,010
Speaker 1: It's this really weird transference that I've only ever experienced in very simple very direct competition games

468
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:03,830
Speaker 0: I think and I think that is part of the reason why I want to play like Tron in real life so badly, of course without the chance of dying, but you know, yeah

469
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:07,141
Speaker 1: You know what happens when you fall down because

470
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:13,434
Speaker 0: you combine cuz you know Tron even you know Whether you playing this game the game, you know It's like some games.

471
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:17,290
Speaker 0: when you make them 3d or fancier they change fundamentally like say Mario.

472
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:23,390
Speaker 0: Not that 3d Mario is bad, but it's fundamentally different when it's Mario 64 versus Mario 3, right?

473
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:33,938
Speaker 0: But Tron whether it's like VR and you're actually riding bikes with light trails behind them or whether it's Atari with big Pixelated blocks just moving around a grid.

474
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,584
Speaker 0: That's incredibly low resolution.

475
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:37,590
Speaker 0: It's the same exact game.

476
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:48,834
Speaker 0: The only thing is that the 3d VR one adds sort of like the roller coaster thrill of riding a bike at high speeds Whereas the Atari one does not have such a roller coaster, you know Thrill to it.

477
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:53,830
Speaker 0: But otherwise, it is really the exact same thing in terms of the game and the competition.

478
00:30:54,372 --> 00:31:02,986
Speaker 0: It's just so pure that it cannot be spoiled by enhancing it Unless you made it a different game in which case it's no longer pure now.

479
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,939
Speaker 1: disc wise though I got to say my favorite Tron II.

480
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:13,690
Speaker 1: this game even though it's really it captures I guess the spirit and the feel of Tron discs, but yet is nothing like Tron discs at all.

481
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,750
Speaker 1: Yeah is ricochet which was like this mod that came with half-life in like back in 2000.

482
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,797
Speaker 0: I don't know if you could.

483
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,770
Speaker 0: I don't it might cost money now or if it's free.

484
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,433
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

485
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:27,130
Speaker 1: I don't think it's free unless you already have it, but and no one plays it.

486
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,870
Speaker 1: I think we have to go check on steam unlike every other game that we want to play that You know that old games that are difficult to get together.

487
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,355
Speaker 1: We got to set up VPNs or anything.

488
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,145
Speaker 1: If you guys listeners all get ricochet.

489
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,410
Speaker 1: We will play with you.

490
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:39,855
Speaker 0: Ricochet is a game.

491
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:43,290
Speaker 0: That's actually easy for everyone to get together and play ricochet.

492
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:45,559
Speaker 0: Basically, it's a half-life 1 mod.

493
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,530
Speaker 0: It was free for us at least.

494
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:55,374
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's free for anyone else nine years ago nine years ago, and basically the way this game worked is an FPS and You.

495
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,430
Speaker 0: there are different kinds of maps, right?

496
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,741
Speaker 0: There's the dual maps and there's also the free-for-all.

497
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:02,949
Speaker 0: everyone go all the time maps, right?

498
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:14,450
Speaker 0: And you basically this is platforms and every platform is a big disc and Each platform has triangles next to it and you step on a triangle and it bounces you through the air to the next.

499
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:19,770
Speaker 0: You know another platform so you basically bounce between these platforms by stepping on these triangles.

500
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:37,399
Speaker 0: You can't jump all you can do is move and Throw discs and you have three discs that you can throw and once you've thrown the three discs you need to wait for them to regenerate before you can throw them again and The discs bounce off some of these walls like, you know Depending if there's a wall there for you to throw a disc at there's some.

501
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:40,852
Speaker 0: Sometimes the discs might teleport if you throw them into a teleporter.

502
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:45,020
Speaker 0: so you can throw a disc like in one direction But it ends up coming at the guy from another direction.

503
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,520
Speaker 0: That's like power-ups and it is power-ups like freeze discs and triple discs and all that stuff.

504
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:52,620
Speaker 1: He was just again so simple and so direct.

505
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,293
Speaker 1: I mean we used to at our IT and even when we lived here we would play this game for like Six hours without stopping in.

506
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:03,040
Speaker 1: like, you know There'd be ten people on the server and you just all took turns doing duels and watching the duels.

507
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,780
Speaker 0: It was just some of the servers even set up to where I give this ten people.

508
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:11,460
Speaker 0: Five duels happen at once and then it keeps mixing the people up based on who won a new lost.

509
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,636
Speaker 1: This game is just so amazing and it doesn't really need to be updated at all.

510
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:17,920
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't need any changes.

511
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:18,523
Speaker 0: It's already.

512
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:19,146
Speaker 0: it's perfect.

513
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,160
Speaker 1: You could make the graphics better, but the gameplay was absolutely perfect.

514
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,919
Speaker 1: It was a little bit tiny bit not necessarily buggy but fiddly.

515
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:31,719
Speaker 1: Yeah in that, you know There'd be often be the situation where if two players jump and run into each other.

516
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,360
Speaker 1: There was a fine art to making sure that they died slightly before you.

517
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:40,520
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz you could die by either getting a. you could die by getting hit by a chainsaw disc, right?

518
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,779
Speaker 0: And basically if you didn't use any of your discs, you still had all three of them.

519
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:50,200
Speaker 0: You could push secondary attack to throw a chainsaw disc and if that hits someone they were their head just popped off and they died.

520
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:54,060
Speaker 1: Or you could die by being a dumbass and either falling or getting knocked off, right?

521
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,951
Speaker 0: So you could fall off the map just by jumping improperly by stepping on a triangle and then like Pushing some arrows in the air in a way that made you fall off.

522
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,549
Speaker 0: or if you got hit with a regular disc You didn't actually die.

523
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,779
Speaker 0: You just got pushed a little bit.

524
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:12,178
Speaker 0: so if you got you someone can throw their regular discs at you and push you off the edge which would kill you.

525
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,219
Speaker 0: and of Course if you jump up and you bump into someone in the air, you're both gonna probably die.

526
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,469
Speaker 0: But whoever dies first is a loser.

527
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:21,560
Speaker 0: So there's always that situation.

528
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,187
Speaker 1: It's just you know, what it is.

529
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:27,402
Speaker 1: a is an elegant game from a more civilized age Absolutely.

530
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:30,681
Speaker 0: I've always loved how they were like advanced players to do stuff like.

531
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:38,451
Speaker 0: you would hit a triangle to jump in the air and usually you don't want to touch any arrows when you're jumping because That'll just knock out like loop around.

532
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:48,858
Speaker 0: Yeah back on the same platform It's like, you know If you just don't touch any arrows at all after you step on a triangle you will land perfectly on the destination platform Assuming nothing else bad happens to you.

533
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:55,056
Speaker 0: But if you do push some arrows properly you can like land on a platform that you're not supposed to land on.

534
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:58,600
Speaker 0: like, you know Normally this arrow points to that platform over there.

535
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,800
Speaker 0: But if I you know push left when I step on this I'll actually land on that platform over there.

536
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:10,300
Speaker 0: And that's how you get advanced play and just totally own noobs By jumping and landing behind them when they don't think it's possible.

537
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,725
Speaker 1: Plus there was this chainsaw in the back being like fencing where someone could use the chainsaw Which is the instant kill if it hits you.

538
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:21,044
Speaker 1: but you could block discs that were shot at you with your own discs Yeah, and you could.

539
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,660
Speaker 1: you could do like the one two where you block and you also shoot and then it was just so great.

540
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:26,405
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

541
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:27,371
Speaker 1: I want to play it right now.

542
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:27,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should.

543
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:28,800
Speaker 0: we should play it later.

544
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:34,200
Speaker 0: But there's also the kinds of situations like at the beginning of every match if it was a duel, right?

545
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,239
Speaker 0: It's like you get a little bit of time to walk around before the duel starts.

546
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:42,000
Speaker 0: Of course, you can lose the duel before it starts by falling off which you just suck, right?

547
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:47,360
Speaker 0: But you can also sort of posture, you know, it doesn't let you throw discs for like three seconds.

548
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,720
Speaker 0: It counts like three two one go and then you can start throwing discs.

549
00:35:51,181 --> 00:36:03,616
Speaker 0: so what'll happen is either a the players will sort of stay far away from each other and you know sort of go in or They'll get right up on the same platform as each other and sort of go And then maybe start the match off trying to do a chainsaw

550
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,119
Speaker 1: right away.

551
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:05,704
Speaker 1: that's another thing.

552
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:13,509
Speaker 1: that the whole a lot of these old games like NS and this game have the ready room or the like Pre-match stuff for players.

553
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:24,480
Speaker 1: that this whole psychological thing when when you start a match of ricochet Yeah, especially back then when there really wasn't voice chat Yeah, like you just kind of you'd see these two avatars kind of chest bumping and jostling for position.

554
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:34,457
Speaker 0: In the the all the every man for himself mode Basically every time you die You just immediately respawn and it's a gigantic map that's got like multiple levels of altitude.

555
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:38,631
Speaker 1: speaking of altitude I should point out aiming is only in one plane.

556
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:41,240
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the game is effectively two-dimensional, right?

557
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,486
Speaker 0: Even though it's a 3d FPS.

558
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,852
Speaker 0: You can't aim up or down.

559
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:45,057
Speaker 0: You can only aim straight for you.

560
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,640
Speaker 1: Look up or down.

561
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:48,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't duck or jump.

562
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:53,120
Speaker 0: You can only jump by stepping on the triangles But if you shoot it shoots out in a plane.

563
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,820
Speaker 1: So if you shoot in the air and someone else happens to be in the air at the same time you can hit them.

564
00:36:57,043 --> 00:36:57,473
Speaker 0: That's right.

565
00:36:59,081 --> 00:37:01,050
Speaker 1: So play ricochet good God.

566
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like no one playing this game anymore.

567
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Speaker 0: No, but in the in the every man for himself mode when you die you immediately respawn and there's multiple levels of altitude.

568
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:25,735
Speaker 0: So it's like this Platforms in level one two and three depending on the map and it's just a whole bunch of people all at once trying to kill Each other as many times as possible, but it's totally awesome because unlike the dual mode right where you're worrying about one person There's these discs that is coming at you from all freaking directions and like.

569
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:27,060
Speaker 0: there's all about the timing.

570
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,500
Speaker 0: This is in both modes the timing of the power-up.

571
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:34,100
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the power-up will always appear like after this so many seconds.

572
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:37,932
Speaker 0: It's like you'll be like, okay jump jump jump jump.

573
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:40,300
Speaker 0: the power-up should appear now jump grab the power-up.

574
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,791
Speaker 1: You know that's something a lot of old deathmatch style FPS has had would they?

575
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:53,763
Speaker 1: there'd be the quad damage that would appear at a semi-regular or a regular interval and everyone knew where it was and all the advanced players knew exactly what it was gonna appear because they Were kind

576
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:57,460
Speaker 0: they would you know, they wouldn't stand around and camp it like a new wood, right?

577
00:37:58,324 --> 00:38:00,600
Speaker 0: They they would time their mat their way.

578
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:10,779
Speaker 0: They're walking around the map such that they will appear in that room at the time when the thing appears and just grab it Immediately and then be out of the room or they'll pointedly be on the opposite side of the map.

579
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:13,641
Speaker 0: Yep, if they don't think that they can get to it They'll.

580
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:23,240
Speaker 1: they'll be far away from where there were all these ways of Causing this kind of very specific ebb and flow of gameplay that I think a lot of modern games have lost in their rush for complexity.

581
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:33,214
Speaker 0: Hmm one thing that's really cool about ricochet is that you know, you get these different power-ups the ice Disc which would freeze the other player allowing you to easily shatter him with a triple disc.

582
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:46,149
Speaker 0: the the triple disc Which allowed which allowed you to throw three discs at once and sort of you know The joke that only we get There was what were the other power-ups?

583
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,380
Speaker 0: Oh, there were the fastest that you could throw really fast.

584
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,536
Speaker 0: The whole bunch of them power up stacked.

585
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:57,218
Speaker 1: So if you You shot three fast discs, yeah, that was just something so simple.

586
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:57,560
Speaker 0: like that.

587
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,943
Speaker 0: It's like you could get triple speed ice discs and just be like new new new new new new new new and throw like a million Discs everything.

588
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:08,033
Speaker 0: if you manage to collect three power-ups, it often didn't matter.

589
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:12,469
Speaker 1: the power-ups were neat and powerful But they weren't necessarily game winners.

590
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know right?

591
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,400
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, oh no the other guy got the power-up.

592
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,971
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like 30 seconds before another power-up appears.

593
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,980
Speaker 0: He throws like a whole bunch of ice discs at you.

594
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:22,520
Speaker 0: They're just normal discs that happen to freeze if they hit you.

595
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,729
Speaker 0: So just don't get hit.

596
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,072
Speaker 1: and if you're getting hit anyway Don't get hit and don't fall off right.

597
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,440
Speaker 0: the guy might have the triple discs.

598
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,200
Speaker 0: So there's nine discs bouncing around looking for you, but he could just as easily hit himself with those if he's not careful.

599
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:40,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, because one of them might be aimed at you, but the other two might be bouncing off the wall sitting him in the ass.

600
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,798
Speaker 0: So it was always kind of fun like that.

601
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:55,411
Speaker 0: And plus when people get the fast discs that let you shoot a whole bunch of just real quickly they'll tend to just go nuts with them and not be too careful with them and Often hurt themselves because you know your own discs can hit you.

602
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:57,117
Speaker 0: do you remember it's ricochet?

603
00:39:57,137 --> 00:39:58,140
Speaker 0: these discs are bouncing.

604
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:58,943
Speaker 0: No, they did not.

605
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,187
Speaker 1: they didn't knock you back though.

606
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,194
Speaker 0: No, but they you can reclaim them.

607
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:02,676
Speaker 1: Basically.

608
00:40:02,957 --> 00:40:08,577
Speaker 0: No you did you could But you could also hit yourself with a chainsaw, which is not, you know, it didn't kill you.

609
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:09,078
Speaker 0: It didn't.

610
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:21,019
Speaker 1: did Just be a lot of play like I throw just behind me as I'm jumping forward knowing that it'll bounce and land on the platform I'm going toward because I expect him to jump to that platform away from with the chainsaw.

611
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,812
Speaker 1: But then the disc I shot behind me hits him before I get there.

612
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:24,716
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:28,715
Speaker 1: Oh my god You also got more points if you killed someone with more ricochets.

614
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:29,820
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's right.

615
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,840
Speaker 0: Every time you kill someone it tells you how you killed them.

616
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,180
Speaker 0: So it's like you killed him with a chainsaw blade that ricocheted twice big points.

617
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:46,520
Speaker 0: You know you killed him with a direct hit with a normal disc, you know You were standing right on the same platform and you just threw a disc directly at him and hit him straight on one point.

618
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,954
Speaker 0: Big deal, you know, you killed the other guy cuz he fell off.

619
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:56,556
Speaker 0: no big deal at all Really, you know your dis bounced like five times and then hit the guy after going through a teleporter.

620
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:57,900
Speaker 0: a billion points.

621
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,035
Speaker 0: The thing is those things usually have by accident.

622
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:10,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Mean you can usually get one or two ricochets or maybe a teleport kill on purpose But not a multiple ricochet and teleport kill is usually luck.

623
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,433
Speaker 1: So do we have any other disc games to talk about?

624
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,480
Speaker 0: I wish I had played disc of Tron more.

625
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,790
Speaker 0: I mean, I've seen it and it's basically an old arcade game where you know this.

626
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:20,773
Speaker 0: it's really.

627
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:22,438
Speaker 0: it's sort of 2d ish 3d ish.

628
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,700
Speaker 0: You know you stand on a disc you can sort of walk around it and throw discs to the other side But it's I don't really know how it plays.

629
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,000
Speaker 0: I'd have to get like maim and try to play disc of Tron just to see how it goes.

630
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:34,483
Speaker 0: I don't know.

631
00:41:34,503 --> 00:41:36,153
Speaker 0: were there any other Tron games?

632
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:39,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're a whole bunch But yeah, I haven't played enough of them pretty much.

633
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:54,020
Speaker 0: All you really need to know is that the game of riding light cycles Which basically is the game of drawing a line and try and trying to get the other guy to bump into your line is a Great game and the game of just throwing shit the other guy trying to hit him is a great game.

634
00:41:54,941 --> 00:42:00,580
Speaker 0: And those are just these two really pure and simple games that were based off a movie about video games.

635
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:01,658
Speaker 0: Think about that, right?

636
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:10,040
Speaker 0: I mean It wasn't like someone invented these games and then someone made a movie about them like say Mario Brothers the movie Right or doom the movie or Halo the movie.

637
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:10,582
Speaker 0: This is.

638
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:18,145
Speaker 0: there was a movie about video games in general and they came up with these two games for the movie and they happen To be amazing games.

639
00:42:18,507 --> 00:42:19,430
Speaker 0: When does that happen?

640
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,594
Speaker 0: Only once ever.

641
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,060
Speaker 0: That's it right there Tron.

642
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:24,664
Speaker 0: so There you have it.

643
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:38,943
Speaker 0: play Tron games so that you'll actually know what the hell's going on when you watch this new movie That's coming out And if you haven't seen the original movie Frickin see it before you see the new movie because I from the trailer I can already tell The new movie is only gonna make a lot of sense If you've seen the original.

644
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:44,056
Speaker 0: you're like not gonna know who people are and such and such and I like Tron.
