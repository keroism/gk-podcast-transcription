1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,680
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,388
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, January 4th, 2022.

3
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,609
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:13,879
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,288
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:21,314
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about Lost Ruins of Arnak, a 2020 tabletop board game.

7
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:25,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,950
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,279
Speaker 0: Coming straight into the new year.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,171
Speaker 0: COVID is going crazy again.

11
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,479
Speaker 0: Like, we're fully locked down.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,543
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

13
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:37,299
Speaker 1: I don't think people really understand how, you know, ridiculous it is.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:46,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, the number of positive cases in New York today was, like, nearly double the highest number on any day in the entire pandemic.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,803
Speaker 1: No, it's not double.

16
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,217
Speaker 1: It's like eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

17
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,820
Speaker 1: Eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,535
Speaker 0: I was looking just at New York City, specifically.

19
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,380
Speaker 0: If you look at the country...

20
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's eight or nine times what it's ever been, ever.

21
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,839
Speaker 1: Like, if you look at the humps from the past...

22
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:06,460
Speaker 0: I was looking at hospitalizations.

23
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:09,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look at the humps from 2020, 2021, right?

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,560
Speaker 1: It's like those humps got up to, like, you know, thousands per day.

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,069
Speaker 1: It's now, like, 30, 40,000 per day.

26
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:18,363
Speaker 0: Yep.

27
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:23,600
Speaker 0: Well, the biggest, saddest number was that nationally, we're already at a million new cases a day.

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:44,920
Speaker 0: And even though, like, a thing that I'm seeing a lot, especially among people who are justifying their terrible decision to go to But one thing that is not clear at all, and likely not mild, is the chance of having permanent consequences of catching Omicron.

29
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,080
Speaker 1: Well, so first of all, there's a problem that people don't realize.

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,439
Speaker 0: Well, so "mild" to a medical professional means we didn't have to intubate them.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,161
Speaker 1: Right.

32
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:57,360
Speaker 1: Doctors and the CDC have fucked up in using the word "mild," right?

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,728
Speaker 1: It's like they use the word

34
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,372
Speaker 1: "doctors.".

35
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:04,174
Speaker 1: When they say the word "mild," they mean, like, "Oh, you didn't need surgery.

36
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:04,797
Speaker 1: You didn't need a

37
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:05,480
Speaker 1: ventilator.".

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what the doctor said when I had a bicep spoke go through my leg?

39
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,154
Speaker 0: It was a "trivial

40
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:10,518
Speaker 0: wound.".

41
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:12,404
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

42
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:23,040
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, so mild to a doctor means that you didn't need extreme medical interventions to survive and recover, right?

43
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:35,967
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, you could be sitting there, right, like, you know, gasping for breath with extreme pains and suffering and permanent consequences that affect you the rest of your life.

44
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:45,379
Speaker 1: And as long as the doctor didn't put you on a ventilator or have to, like, you know, give you a new lung or some shit, that counts as "mild" medically, right?

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Speaker 1: So they spread around that word "mild," and now people, you know, have the wrong impression.

46
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,090
Speaker 1: I blame the doctors, not the people, right?

47
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,339
Speaker 1: That, "Oh, I guess it's not a big

48
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:56,540
Speaker 1: deal.".

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,828
Speaker 1: It's like, no, it's a really fucking big deal.

50
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:02,500
Speaker 1: If you get sick, it's gonna suck ass.

51
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,050
Speaker 1: It's not just like you got some sniffles, right?

52
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:06,356
Speaker 1: It sucks ass.

53
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,039
Speaker 1: You don't want it.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,913
Speaker 0: But even worse, there's other things going on.

55
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:18,492
Speaker 0: Like, we... Now, I'm not saying be a prepper and go down to the woods, but the last couple of rounds of this, like the two previous peaks, we had supply chain issues.

56
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,340
Speaker 0: Like, you couldn't get toilet paper and flour for a while.

57
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:35,059
Speaker 0: But there weren't actually that many cases compared to what's happening now where so many people are so sick they can't work that the supply chain is probably more at risk now, today, than it was at any point in the pandemic up to this point.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:45,100
Speaker 1: Right, well, the original, right, in the old 2020, right, before pre-vaccine, right, there was more deaths, right?

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,380
Speaker 1: But there was less cases because of more caution and also because the virus was less evil.

60
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:57,720
Speaker 0: But even if this is treatable for a lot of people, there aren't enough hospital staff.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,609
Speaker 1: Right, now we have vaccines which have decreased deaths.

62
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:05,560
Speaker 1: So it's like, yeah, if you're fully vaxxed and boosted, are you gonna die?

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,700
Speaker 1: You could, but it's not super likely.

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,251
Speaker 0: And pre-omacron, it was also radically cutting off spread.

65
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,380
Speaker 0: Like, there were practically no cases for a long period of time over the summer.

66
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,180
Speaker 1: If you are unvaccinated, yeah, omicron might kill you, actually.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,225
Speaker 1: So don't...

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, the difference... Being vaccinated is super important to be vaccinated to prevent dying.

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,990
Speaker 1: But, you know, is it gonna prevent you from getting sick?

70
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,380
Speaker 1: Also, yes, but less so than previously.

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,140
Speaker 0: Yep.

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:49,840
Speaker 0: Well, even more, like, beyond all of that, a big problem is gonna be if a lot of people are sick and out of, like, whatever their jobs are, a lot of those jobs are gonna not happen, which could be way worse than what happened the first two rounds.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,519
Speaker 0: Also, if you get hurt for an unrelated reason, no one at the hospital is gonna be able to help you.

74
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:04,380
Speaker 0: And on top of all that, one thing we do know is that if you're not boosted, you have very little relative protection against the omicron variant specifically.

75
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,580
Speaker 0: You gotta get that booster shot, especially if you didn't get an mRNA vaccine.

76
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,959
Speaker 0: Most of the world did not get mRNA vaccines.

77
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:18,160
Speaker 0: Like, if you got AstraZeneca or J&J, you need an mRNA booster, like, with extreme urgency right now.

78
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,059
Speaker 0: And they are not widely available.

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,339
Speaker 1: A lot of people who just got, like, one J&J, it's like, they got, like, as far as the doctors are concerned, they're like, "Well, that person got

80
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:27,519
Speaker 1: sick.".

81
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,399
Speaker 1: It's like, it barely helped them.

82
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,218
Speaker 0: I'll say this.

83
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 0: My company, my actual day job, their policy now is if you don't have a booster, you count as unvaccinated for all of our policies.

84
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:38,238
Speaker 1: Alright.

85
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:46,860
Speaker 0: So, my advice to you, specifically, is buy a tiny bit ahead on anything that you really need in your life.

86
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,015
Speaker 0: And don't go anywhere for the next month if you can avoid it.

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,480
Speaker 0: Especially, don't go to MAGFest, CES, or ALA, which are all happening this weekend.

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,799
Speaker 1: Don't go to any large gathering of human beings.

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,442
Speaker 0: Yeah.

90
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,320
Speaker 0: I mean, Ontario just locked down.

91
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: They closed all indoor dining, all gyms, all theaters, all venues.

92
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,800
Speaker 1: Well, how come the whole world hasn't shut down?

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,740
Speaker 0: This is what I don't get, right?

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,982
Speaker 0: The U.S.

95
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,139
Speaker 0: morale absolutely not shut down.

96
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,020
Speaker 1: Right.

97
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:18,699
Speaker 1: It's like, if I was just king of the world, I'd be like, "Look, every single person on Earth is on house arrest for two weeks,

98
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,040
Speaker 1: right?".

99
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,639
Speaker 1: It's like, or three weeks even.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 0: If you just did that, it's like, okay, that house arrest- Just doing that would literally be one of the single most challenging endeavors humans have ever done.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,239
Speaker 1: Yes, but- You would need an army.

102
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,280
Speaker 0: You would need literal armies of people who were going out- Well, good.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,220
Speaker 0: -to enforce it, to distribute supplies.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,840
Speaker 1: We have armies, and those armies aren't doing anything fucking useful, right?

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
Speaker 1: They're just conducting evil wars.

106
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,940
Speaker 1: So let's have them put everyone on house arrest instead, and then when we're done, we can disband those armies, right?

107
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:54,520
Speaker 0: So regardless- If you're going to disband those armies, then I just don't disband mine, and now I'm king of the world.

108
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,511
Speaker 1: I'm king of the world already.

109
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,740
Speaker 1: The armies are listening to me.

110
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,223
Speaker 0: How are you still king?

111
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have an army anymore.

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,895
Speaker 0: Now I'm king of the world.

113
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:00,600
Speaker 0: I have the only army.

114
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:11,600
Speaker 1: I don't need to be king of the world anymore because I put everyone on earth on house arrest for three weeks, and that eliminated not only COVID, right, but so much other disease and whatnot.

115
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then I'm king of the world with my army.

116
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,280
Speaker 1: Also, the logistics of the matter are impossible.

117
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,300
Speaker 0: Like, in America, people just refused to follow the orders.

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,353
Speaker 0: Even when we had lockdowns, there were restaurants that were just like, "Fuck you.

119
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:23,916
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

120
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:24,177
Speaker 0: Find

121
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:24,278
Speaker 0: me?"

122
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:24,800
Speaker 0: and just opened.

123
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:25,750
Speaker 1: Shoot 'em.

124
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,203
Speaker 1: Obviously not.

125
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:33,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, you could still punish them in ways or coerce them or just take away your business license, right?

126
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,009
Speaker 1: Well, the real problem- That's it.

127
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:36,580
Speaker 1: No more restaurant.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:50,740
Speaker 0: The world is one thing, but if we just look at the United States, there's a much more pernicious problem in that our legislature, like the Congress of the United States, because of the Republicans specifically, literally can't pass any bill, so there's no way to pass any laws.

129
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:54,228
Speaker 1: It's like, yes, that's a problem.

130
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,680
Speaker 1: We can bring up and blame everything in the world on that.

131
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,219
Speaker 1: But look, even in New York City, where the city council is majority of Democratic women- Because you didn't let me finish.

132
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,609
Speaker 1: We can't even shut the city down, right?

133
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,539
Speaker 1: We can't shut the state down, which is run by Democrats.

134
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,220
Speaker 0: Even if we did that, the Supreme Court is also compromised, and they've been shooting down mandates and things left and right.

135
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:22,039
Speaker 0: Even if we ignored them and deployed the military, nearly half of America would refuse to comply and would require violent coercion, possibly.

136
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,423
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that even very Democratic places that are not compromised and have democracy, and even other countries, right?

137
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:38,626
Speaker 1: It's like Denmark and Sweden, Finland, which just decided to go to four-day work weeks- No, Scott, that's fake news.

138
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,490
Speaker 0: That is bullshit.

139
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,796
Speaker 0: Don't stop spreading that lie.

140
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:41,640
Speaker 0: That is not true.

141
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:42,888
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

142
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,619
Speaker 1: That's a fake news.

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,620
Speaker 0: That was literally a screenshot of an article that had a misleading headline that quoted something that person said years ago in an unrelated context.

144
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,872
Speaker 0: There are no plans for a four-day work week.

145
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:56,877
Speaker 0: That is just bullshit.

146
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:57,460
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,479
Speaker 1: That's a shame, but regardless, those places in Northern Europe are much more socialist than we are, and they're not locking down either, right?

148
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,740
Speaker 0: But they are enacting a significant number of other measures, and they have much higher rates of people seeking out the vaccine.

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:23,800
Speaker 0: The US has a specific problem in that there are people who refuse the vaccine all over the world, but in America, they are a huge, huge population who are also very powerful politically.

150
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,860
Speaker 1: Well, maybe that won't be a huge, huge population anymore.

151
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,159
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna happen, and there's nothing I can do about it except to hopefully enjoy the democracy that follows at some point.

152
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,038
Speaker 1: Maybe.

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:49,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw a terrifying statistic that basically showed you can determine someone's likelihood of dying of COVID solely by knowing their zip code and whether or not they identify as a Democrat, Republican, or independent.

154
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:56,180
Speaker 0: That's all you need to know, and you can have an extremely accurate prediction of their likelihood of getting COVID and/or dying of COVID.

155
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:04,454
Speaker 1: You know, things in general in the world, right, there's causational factors.

156
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,819
Speaker 1: If you know some factors, you know there are factors.

157
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Speaker 0: So the broad thing is we're beyond the point as a society where we're gonna have a near-term societal solution to this, meaning it sucks, but you're kind of on your own, and you've got to protect yourself.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker 0: You cannot rely on institutions to protect you, and you're gonna have to do whatever you need to do to stay safe.

159
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,985
Speaker 1: You don't have to rely on yourself.

160
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:33,340
Speaker 1: You might not be able to rely on institutions, but you can rely on each other, right?

161
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,440
Speaker 1: Just not your institutional each other, your community each other.

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,380
Speaker 0: Yup, but that means things like don't ever, like literally do not, I haven't been inside a restaurant since the week after PAX East.

163
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
Speaker 1: Early 2020.

164
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,040
Speaker 0: I got, we went to Kenka, and that was the last time I've been in a restaurant.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,860
Speaker 1: Well, I went, I've been inside restaurants to grab a bag that had food in it and then walk out immediately.

166
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,114
Speaker 0: Did I ever, I did that once or twice the whole quarantine.

167
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:01,898
Speaker 0: We wouldn't even do that.

168
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:02,420
Speaker 0: We just delivered.

169
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,440
Speaker 1: Oh, one time I was in a restaurant that had the entire front of the restaurant was like open.

170
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,459
Speaker 0: Because at the Huntress, we did do that once, because the Huntress was just an open wall.

171
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,560
Speaker 1: And I was sitting literally on the edge of the inside.

172
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,585
Speaker 0: I bet that we sat at the exact same spot.

173
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:31,700
Speaker 0: Oh, and once we ate outdoors in the doorway of a giant open garage door in Brooklyn at an outdoor restaurant over the summer when cases were basically zero.

174
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, effectively garage door situation.

175
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:38,220
Speaker 1: I mean, I went to two hockey games, but then I said I'm not good anymore.

176
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,883
Speaker 0: That's the thing that I think this is part of.

177
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:47,760
Speaker 0: the problem is even if we're like the government was unified and tried to do a lockdown, a lot of people are reaching their sort of psychological limit.

178
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,846
Speaker 0: And it is hard to tell a lot of people regarding.

179
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,229
Speaker 0: you can tell me this and I'm fine.

180
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:59,380
Speaker 0: A lot of people are fine with this, but a lot of people aren't that I just went to hockey games and now you're telling me I can't anymore.

181
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,345
Speaker 0: Just like it's hard to explain to people.

182
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:06,760
Speaker 0: The vaccine doesn't protect you a hundred percent against Omicron, but you still need it because it protects you to a huge degree.

183
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:10,637
Speaker 0: That nuance is just impossible for a lot of people to handle.

184
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,572
Speaker 1: People don't A) value life over other things, right?

185
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:20,000
Speaker 1: I mean, look at you skiing, not valuing your life over the joy of skiing.

186
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:24,200
Speaker 0: Skiing is way less dangerous than biking, mister doesn't value his own life.

187
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,402
Speaker 1: That's right.

188
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:37,278
Speaker 1: And then B) you have people who, right, their fear level of things is not related to the actual likelihood of fear.

189
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,420
Speaker 0: Imagine being afraid of a terrorist in the United States when you're way more likely to be hit by a car while biking.

190
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:45,444
Speaker 1: Exactly.

191
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:45,947
Speaker 1: Same deal.

192
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 0: Cars can't get me on the slopes, just saying.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,023
Speaker 1: People's fear level.

194
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:51,707
Speaker 0: No, Scott, I will say this.

195
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 0: If a car hits me while I'm skiing, you are welcome to laugh at my funeral.

196
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,815
Speaker 1: Well, the point is, right, while I choose to bike, right, whenever I bike in these cars, I'm terrified the whole time.

197
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,900
Speaker 1: My fear level is correctly aligned.

198
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,700
Speaker 0: Well, case in point, when I'm skiing on a normal trail, it's like whatever, but if I'm in the trees doing something serious, you know what's going through my head?

199
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:14,060
Speaker 0: Turn left, turn right, don't die, don't die.

200
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:25,259
Speaker 1: Right, my fear level is in alignment with, or at least relatively, more in alignment with the actual odds and risks of danger.

201
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:50,460
Speaker 1: Whereas I think for a lot of people, their desires will cause them to intentionally, or for many, many reasons, their illogicalness, ignorance, all kinds of reasons, their fear is not in alignment with the actual risks and consequences.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:02,460
Speaker 1: So people will be really afraid of, and sometimes it can even be like a phobia, like you're just afraid of heights even though you're perfectly safe in a glass overhang that won't fall down.

203
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
Speaker 1: It's one of those buildings with the overlook thing.

204
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:13,000
Speaker 0: But there is also a secondary problem of a lot of people just don't consume a significant amount of external information on a daily basis and just don't know things.

205
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:23,760
Speaker 1: Right, so it could be, you know, the ignorance, phobias, desires, you know, making, you know, it's like I want this so bad that I'll, you know, I'll change my feelings on it, right?

206
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,123
Speaker 1: So many reasons.

207
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:31,460
Speaker 1: Of course, actually, you want to get your, you know, I think what you just need to do is, you know, you can't control anyone else.

208
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:44,880
Speaker 1: But think about yourself and assess risks of things, not just, you know, disease, but everything in life, and get your fear in alignment with reality, right?

209
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:57,920
Speaker 1: Be afraid of things that are likely to happen and will cause severe damage and be less afraid of things that are unlikely to happen and probably won't do that much damage if they do happen.

210
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,224
Speaker 0: And one of those things right now is COVID.

211
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:04,189
Speaker 0: Like, it is, this is the calm before the storm.

212
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,190
Speaker 0: You think it's bad now?

213
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:11,280
Speaker 0: We're not even close to the incubation period and the, like, long tail of what's going to happen from the holidays.

214
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,022
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

215
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:20,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, in some others, you can stay inside and podcast and some other totally safe, extremely shitty news.

216
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:27,880
Speaker 0: So the president of Square Enix made a huge, like, announcement and wrote this giant New Year, you know, New Year's announcement.

217
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,201
Speaker 0: Yep.

218
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:34,956
Speaker 0: But this New Year's announcement was notable in that 100 percent of it was cryptocurrency NFT bullshit.

219
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:36,720
Speaker 1: Like, pretty much it was.

220
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:54,900
Speaker 0: It's it actually earnestly, I'm not even being hyperbolic here, argues that people who play games for fun are kind of not the demographic that games should go after and that the real world is games where you play to earn as opposed to play for fun.

221
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,460
Speaker 1: Like, it is just, I mean, yeah, if you're if you're a game company and you want to make a lot of money, that's absolutely correct.

222
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,879
Speaker 0: I don't know how to make a lot of money, though.

223
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,900
Speaker 1: You don't make that much money from people who are playing for fun.

224
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,140
Speaker 1: You make you make money from people who are addicted or, you know, psychologically.

225
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,523
Speaker 0: Gotcha.

226
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:15,216
Speaker 0: Look at the Genshin Impact, which you should not play.

227
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 0: That game is unethical.

228
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:22,860
Speaker 0: That game is probably more harmful to society right now and also makes way more money than a lot of games.

229
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,045
Speaker 0: You can just buy and play for fun.

230
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, that's how you make a lot of money.

231
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:38,800
Speaker 1: If you make a game that's if you were to make Mario three today, it's like, you know, even assuming it was, you know, as technologically advanced relative to the time with inflation.

232
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
Speaker 0: That game would cost like two hundred and forty dollars.

233
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,163
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:48,680
Speaker 1: But regardless, it's like you would maybe even if you sold a big pile of copies.

235
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:49,282
Speaker 1: Right.

236
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:53,296
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, everyone bought Mario, you know, ten and then that's it.

237
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,932
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the end.

238
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:57,153
Speaker 1: Right.

239
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,839
Speaker 0: But Square Enix, what's interesting is there's a big shift because if you look at the three, we skipped a bunch of episodes the end of the year.

240
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,280
Speaker 0: We didn't even talk about Kickstarter literally destroying itself and moving to block chain yet.

241
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,771
Speaker 0: But basically we saw with this, like there was.

242
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:17,400
Speaker 0: the first wave was Discord hinted at supporting NFTs.

243
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:21,579
Speaker 0: And the blowback from Discord users was so severe that they actually walked it back.

244
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:30,820
Speaker 1: Well, I think everybody, every company, you know, that has, you know, showed their hand got blowback and some of them stand firm and some of them walk it back.

245
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,105
Speaker 1: So some of them didn't make it.

246
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,900
Speaker 1: Some of them didn't, you know, do it, say anything to begin with.

247
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,059
Speaker 0: So Kickstarter was the next one where they got blowback and they doubled down like that.

248
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:49,160
Speaker 0: I cannot believe that I got an email from Kickstarter support that used the word, the term fiat currency to tell me why I'm wrong.

249
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 0: And my concerns about NFTs and cryptocurrency and block chain are wrong and I should keep using Kickstarter.

250
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,325
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

251
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:57,900
Speaker 1: I'm never kickstarting anything ever again.

252
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,141
Speaker 1: Yep.

253
00:17:58,222 --> 00:18:02,480
Speaker 0: In fact, the only reason I haven't deleted my Kickstarter account is I'm waiting on- Because I already kickstarted something.

254
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Speaker 0: I'm waiting on Court of Blades and I think John Company 2 are the last two I have outstanding.

255
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 1: The vast majority of things I've kickstarted, you know, I've had a Kickstarter account since the beginning.

256
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,939
Speaker 1: I've kickstarted like hundreds of things.

257
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,393
Speaker 1: Yeah.

258
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,900
Speaker 1: But most of the things I kickstart these days are indie tabletop RPG PDFs and such.

259
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,139
Speaker 1: And none of those are going to be on Kickstarter anymore.

260
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:32,120
Speaker 0: In fact, that industry, the tabletop industry as a whole basically collectively announced almost simultaneously that we'll never use Kickstarter again.

261
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,403
Speaker 1: That's right.

262
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,759
Speaker 1: So I don't have to worry about kickstarting anything new.

263
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:40,000
Speaker 1: So I'm just going to wait for all the kickstarters I have- I got two left.

264
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,980
Speaker 1: To come through and then delete the account.

265
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,140
Speaker 0: So you have Discord, which went, oh shit, and backed off.

266
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,060
Speaker 0: You have Kickstarter, which when people complained, basically told the children that they are wrong and doubled down.

267
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,140
Speaker 0: And then now you have Square Enix coming in with the in before.

268
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,240
Speaker 0: Their announcement was basically, we know many of you have concerns and we don't give a fuck.

269
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,660
Speaker 0: Like they came out already with the punches thrown.

270
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:11,240
Speaker 0: This is going to get real bad and I think it's going to destroy big swaths of the game industry over the next few years.

271
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:16,700
Speaker 1: I'm actually, you know, I don't want to say this as a prediction, right?

272
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,298
Speaker 1: So much more as a hopeful possibility for a long-term deal.

273
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 1: I see a movement of people who are buying in and going on the blockchain deal.

274
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,680
Speaker 0: And those people are unilaterally all in on all of this.

275
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,080
Speaker 0: And I think they're the same people who would have fallen for the Amway scam if they were a kid in the 80s or the 90s.

276
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:43,979
Speaker 1: I see a majority of people who don't even know what's going on, don't care, and are just carrying on.

277
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,780
Speaker 1: And then I see another group of people, my people, who are basically going back to the old ways, right?

278
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,280
Speaker 1: There's this pushback of like, let's go back to web one, right?

279
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,338
Speaker 1: Websites with no ads and no bullshit on them.

280
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,940
Speaker 1: Things like Project Gemini or IRC instead of Discord, right?

281
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,429
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, what do we need all this shit for?

282
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:10,240
Speaker 1: Let's just go back that we had it right the first time, guys.

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,880
Speaker 1: Or even sort of in-betweens, like, okay, we have better computers now, we have phones now.

284
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:24,000
Speaker 1: We can do these things better, but adhere to the principles and such of the old ways.

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's something like, I think you're right, that reactionary movement is going to be a big movement.

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,047
Speaker 0: I agree with you.

287
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:31,260
Speaker 0: I actually have the same prediction.

288
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:49,260
Speaker 1: When those services made by that group of people become, you know, I guess more widely available and accessible to just the general public, they'll absorb some of that middle group of people just carrying on, right?

289
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,880
Speaker 1: You know, you'll get some people just carrying on with Twitter going over to like, you know, old school Twitter replacement, right?

290
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,359
Speaker 0: And Twitter's actually not that bad compared to everything else.

291
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:11,320
Speaker 1: Sure, but what I could see happening is that movement of people going to the old ways, that will be hard to, that's like, that's gonna work, right?

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,280
Speaker 1: It's like, there won't be that many people there, but they're not going to be easily destroyed, right?

293
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,479
Speaker 1: It's like, 'cause that's old, the old ways are resilient ways.

294
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:26,780
Speaker 1: The people going to the blockchain land, that's gonna beanie baby crash at some point.

295
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:34,040
Speaker 1: Who knows when, it might last a long time, you know, but it's gonna fail because it's not sustainable, right?

296
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,700
Speaker 1: Given just the realities of silicon.

297
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,400
Speaker 0: Remember, there's something just far more fundamental going on that will be a threat to everything you're describing.

298
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:59,676
Speaker 0: The only reason this NFT blockchain stuff is happening, and because it's permeating every industry, the reason is capitalism has finally hit its sort of late stage final form in that the only way to continue infinite growth is with an asset that is 100% disentangled from reality.

299
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:09,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've squeezed the sponge dry, how can we possibly make more money?

300
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,960
Speaker 1: We're already exploiting our workers and our customers and our suppliers.

301
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:16,509
Speaker 1: Where can we get more profits from?

302
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,734
Speaker 1: Let's scam people.

303
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:24,440
Speaker 0: Because crypto bros, what they're doing is not building wealth or decentralizing anything.

304
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:40,120
Speaker 0: The sole reason anyone is doing this is that they're trying to make a brand new modern land rush so they can all buy that limited, I'm making quote noises and rolling my eyes as my soul dies, that limited resource on the ground floor and be the future robber barons.

305
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,479
Speaker 0: They all think they're gonna be the new Rockefeller with their monkey JPEG.

306
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:49,477
Speaker 1: I think that's some of it, but I also think the reason that a lot of those people do.

307
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,285
Speaker 1: it is because, imagine I believed in it, right?

308
00:22:52,907 --> 00:23:01,460
Speaker 1: So if I believed in it, that means that I could go and start a business and all I do is A, buy video cards, that's something I love doing.

309
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,360
Speaker 1: B, build computers, making a big, big giant computer system, I love doing that, that's fun.

310
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:12,180
Speaker 1: And then C, it just prints money.

311
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:16,420
Speaker 0: Like a Captain Planet pollution machine, it just prints out pollution and money.

312
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:24,340
Speaker 1: I don't have to deal with customers, all I have to do is build a computer and make it as big as I can.

313
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:34,020
Speaker 1: It's like this dream job, that's the dream that's been there since the 90s, where they had run this program on your computer that shows you ads and will send you free money.

314
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,780
Speaker 0: I ran like a hundred copies of that software and I didn't see the ads.

315
00:23:38,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Speaker 1: The goal of capitalism is to escape capitalism, and this is the fake money deal, right, has created this pathway that people believe in where, hey, I could make money, the computer will just make money, I won't have to work, the computer will make money for me, and that dream has been around so long, we'll never die, because it's basically trying to shortcut your way to beat capitalism, right?

316
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:10,960
Speaker 1: To win capitalism, you have to be Jeff Bezos, so much money that you don't have to work anymore.

317
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,860
Speaker 1: That's the real winning at capitalism.

318
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:28,580
Speaker 1: There's this sort of shortcut victory where I have found a way to make money without working, and so this offers that possibility, and if anything ever offers that possibility, people are always going to do it unless it is regulated.

319
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,018
Speaker 0: Yup.

320
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,140
Speaker 1: Right, like crime is a way to make money without having to work, right?

321
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:38,400
Speaker 1: I would say, I think it's more-- You're the boss of people who go commit crimes, you just have money.

322
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:46,020
Speaker 0: As long as your crimes are robbing the right people, you are probably less morally wrong to be a criminal than you are to mine NFTs.

323
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,960
Speaker 1: Right, but I think it's true that there's the robber baron thing going on--

324
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,233
Speaker 0: Well, I think they're split, the robber

325
00:24:51,253 --> 00:25:04,319
Speaker 1: baron people-- The people who believe in it and believe that they're going to make money without working, or it's not just one of the coworkers who quit was like, "Oh, I'm going to go

326
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:04,700
Speaker 1: mine.".

327
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,798
Speaker 1: I'm like, "All right, I don't even know who you

328
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:05,880
Speaker 1: are.".

329
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:07,740
Speaker 1: I know people-- Post it on Slack.

330
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:08,619
Speaker 0: I'm going to say this.

331
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:14,480
Speaker 0: I think there's two groups of people, because I know some people who have done just that because they're Wall Street people.

332
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:15,319
Speaker 0: They quit their jobs.

333
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:20,258
Speaker 0: They just have a mining rig that they put like upstate New York somewhere, and it is just printing money.

334
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:28,459
Speaker 0: They're just doing it, but most people don't have the IT skills to make that happen or the seed capital to make it happen.

335
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:33,280
Speaker 1: You've also just got people who, they're not people who had a job.

336
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,219
Speaker 1: Maybe they're people who didn't have a job.

337
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,120
Speaker 0: Those people are mostly speculating on the investments and are part of the wash trade scam part of this as opposed to the mining part.

338
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,960
Speaker 1: You think about other nerdy things.

339
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:48,520
Speaker 1: I think back, who was buying and selling comic books?

340
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,560
Speaker 1: Who was selling their games back to GameStop?

341
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Speaker 1: Who was buying and selling Magic cards at the game store?

342
00:25:54,523 --> 00:26:04,100
Speaker 1: The people who just didn't have a lot of money and they didn't have a job, they were hustling and doing scams and making money in that way.

343
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 0: Do you think I wanted to sell Final Fantasy I back to Funko Land?

344
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,779
Speaker 0: No, I was just desperate for cash.

345
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,900
Speaker 1: Those same people are the people who are doing NFTs.

346
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,394
Speaker 1: It's like, "Ah, I can't get a job or I don't have a job.

347
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:16,260
Speaker 1: My job sucks.

348
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,719
Speaker 1: I need money to live, so here's a scam.

349
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,179
Speaker 1: I can run this scam.

350
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,100
Speaker 1: All I got to do is click on things and money gets moved.

351
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,800
Speaker 1: Why would you buy a GameStop stock?

352
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,780
Speaker 1: You click on something and you can make money just by clicking.

353
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:35,680
Speaker 1: That is the same people doing all those GameStop Magic card comic book deals.

354
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,300
Speaker 0: So anyway, to bring this back around.

355
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,939
Speaker 1: I can make money just by going to the GameStop.

356
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,256
Speaker 0: To move on to other gaming news, the thing that's important here is fuck Square Enix, just boycott them for real.

357
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,179
Speaker 1: I haven't bought a Square Enix thing in a long time anyway.

358
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:51,220
Speaker 0: And never use Kickstarter again for any purpose.

359
00:26:51,581 --> 00:27:01,520
Speaker 0: Absolutely do not use Kickstarter because the one power we have is that some huge companies are going to support this stuff on the side, like big banks and things, but you can't win those fights.

360
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:11,980
Speaker 0: But smaller companies, you can force them into bankruptcy or otherwise significantly harm them and poison the well to make it harder for other companies to make their announcements.

361
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,100
Speaker 0: So my advice is fight the battles against these crypto bros that you can win.

362
00:27:17,443 --> 00:27:19,500
Speaker 0: We can win against Kickstarter, they're going to go under.

363
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,799
Speaker 0: We can win against Discord, they gave up.

364
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,600
Speaker 0: Can't win against some giant international bank, they're going to deal with it in a much different way.

365
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,619
Speaker 0: So fight the battles you can win and boycott the companies that you can win against.

366
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:35,690
Speaker 1: Alright, that's enough of that.

367
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:36,880
Speaker 0: Let's move along.

368
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:40,160
Speaker 0: One last little gaming news, this is sports news, but it's just--.

369
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,299
Speaker 1: How much time are we going here?

370
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:42,659
Speaker 0: Oh, we haven't gone that long.

371
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Speaker 0: So there is a high school football team.

372
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,200
Speaker 0: This was making the rounds for a while, but in December-- This is multi-year old news.

373
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,899
Speaker 1: In December-- This is pre-COVID news.

374
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:54,980
Speaker 0: The investigation completed.

375
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,660
Speaker 0: But I realize a lot of people haven't seen this story.

376
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,720
Speaker 1: The investigation confirmed what we already knew to be true.

377
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,651
Speaker 0: So I'm going to read this one sentence.

378
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:07,659
Speaker 0: that is the final determination, and it'll raise a lot of questions for you.

379
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:20,014
Speaker 0: "The Ohio Department of Education has stated that Bishop Sycamore High School is a scam and a way for students to play football in hopes of increasing their chances of playing at the college

380
00:28:20,054 --> 00:28:20,255
Speaker 0: level.".

381
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,220
Speaker 0: There was a fake fucking high school that ringers were playing in to try to play football professionally.

382
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,240
Speaker 1: Right, so this is an old story, but basically, yes.

383
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:47,529
Speaker 1: Someone made a sports team, and they called it Sycamore High School or whatever, even though no such high school existed, and they got people who were going to play football, and they scheduled games against other real high school football teams in an attempt to--.

384
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:52,300
Speaker 1: You know, football scouts might see them play.

385
00:28:53,202 --> 00:29:05,260
Speaker 1: You can scam people into thinking that you have this avenue for them to get into the NFL or whatever without having to actually go to high school, or maybe they're older than high school.

386
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,600
Speaker 1: You're not eligible, but now you don't have to go to college either.

387
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,960
Speaker 1: You can just play on this high school mistake.

388
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,940
Speaker 0: Basically, it was a real school because private schools can basically just found on nothing because America's broken.

389
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:31,020
Speaker 1: Basically, it was just a football team that called itself high school, scheduled games against other high schools, and what happened was one of their games, A, got scheduled to broadcast on ESPN-whatever at some weird time, somehow, right?

390
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,239
Speaker 1: And two, they got like blowed up.

391
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:35,820
Speaker 0: That's what blew the scam.

392
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,880
Speaker 0: But the scam wasn't that they were succeeding and made this fake avenue for sports stuff.

393
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:52,998
Speaker 0: The scam was tricking kids and parents into paying them to join this fake team to get their kids into the NFL, and that game was 58-0, and that sparked investigations.

394
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,660
Speaker 1: They got destroyed by this other high school, and it was on ESPN, so everyone saw it happening.

395
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:05,004
Speaker 1: Sports news people looked into it for a second and said, "Wait a minute.

396
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:06,032
Speaker 1: Where is this high school?

397
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:08,648
Speaker 1: I can't find that on Google Maps.

398
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,217
Speaker 1: What is going on

399
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:10,438
Speaker 1: here?".

400
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,966
Speaker 1: And then that brought some justice department in the state to be like, "All right, what's going on

401
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:16,148
Speaker 1: here?".

402
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:16,853
Speaker 1: Something's up.

403
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,540
Speaker 0: The reason I bring this up is you can read the article for all the details because it's just fascinating.

404
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,639
Speaker 1: It took them how many years to investigate this.

405
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,359
Speaker 1: It's like there's probably, meanwhile, 20 other people running the same scam which just aren't on ESPN getting away with it.

406
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:47,319
Speaker 0: But I guess the point is if there is any extrinsic incentive in any sort of game, people will absolutely go to extreme lengths to cheat in order to get whatever that extrinsic motivation is.

407
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,400
Speaker 0: If there's money, if there's power, if there's fame, people will cheat.

408
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,350
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

409
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,618
Speaker 0: So you can read this article.

410
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,809
Speaker 0: I'm not going to share all the details because they're great to read.

411
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,889
Speaker 0: But you know Lenin, Vladimir Lenin, his body is just there to look at.

412
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,169
Speaker 0: It's preserved.

413
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,423
Speaker 1: If you go to the Kremlin, it's right nearby.

414
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,650
Speaker 1: It's in the same area.

415
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,990
Speaker 0: I'd like to see it someday, honestly.

416
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,150
Speaker 1: I've never been there, but I've seen pictures.

417
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:26,210
Speaker 0: I had, at two different points in my life, planned trips to Russia that I had to cancel for, in both cases, actually strange reasons.

418
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,169
Speaker 0: But anyways, I've never actually been to Russia.

419
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:31,250
Speaker 1: I don't think we're going to be going to Russia.

420
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:32,094
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

421
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:39,689
Speaker 0: I mean, not that it's a good gig night topic for a Tuesday, but if you didn't read the news, Russia was literally planning to invade Ukraine, like, next week.

422
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:48,050
Speaker 0: And the only reason they're likely not going to is that the US exposed this and there's a bunch of ridiculous drama going on in Europe that you should probably at least keep an eye on.

423
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,730
Speaker 0: But anyway, Lenin's body was not intended to be preserved.

424
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,870
Speaker 0: It was just going to be buried in a tomb, like any state leader.

425
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:03,670
Speaker 0: But for a bunch of reasons that you can learn about by reading this article, if you didn't know, the Russian government ended up preserving his body.

426
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:15,710
Speaker 0: And this talks about the ridiculous lengths Russian scientists and technicians have gone through over the years to continue to maintain Vladimir Lenin's body.

427
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,189
Speaker 1: It is fascinating.

428
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:26,670
Speaker 1: I'm sure that at the original time, right, over 100 years ago already, they preserved it to the best of their abilities.

429
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:38,045
Speaker 1: But then once you've got it there in this sort of tourist attraction, National Monument/National Monument place, it's like, "Well, now we're stuck with

430
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:38,227
Speaker 1: this.".

431
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,550
Speaker 1: We can't be like, "All right, that's enough looking at Lenin.

432
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,546
Speaker 1: Let's put him underground

433
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:42,710
Speaker 1: now.".

434
00:32:43,612 --> 00:32:56,249
Speaker 1: They had to stick with it, so they had to keep basically getting the best embalming body preservation taxidermy, whatever, known to man, and keep reapplying it constantly to keep this place open.

435
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:58,769
Speaker 1: And so that's exactly what they have done.

436
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,423
Speaker 0: So, seriously, read this article about this 145-year-old weird mummy thing.

437
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,530
Speaker 0: It is fascinating.

438
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,649
Speaker 0: So, what do you got?

439
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:11,249
Speaker 1: What do I have?

440
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:17,689
Speaker 1: So, I don't know much about farming, or especially not pig farming, other than don't trust a man who raises pigs.

441
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:35,130
Speaker 1: But I did see this video advertising some actual legitimate farm equipment that you can buy and might be very useful if you run a pig farm, specifically the boar bot, but there are other devices sold by this.

442
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,930
Speaker 0: I could see uses for several of these at nerd conventions.

443
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:39,985
Speaker 1: Quite possibly.

444
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:46,490
Speaker 1: But, yeah, this company, right, they make swine robotics.

445
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,042
Speaker 1: They make several different robots.

446
00:33:49,143 --> 00:34:01,549
Speaker 1: that would be very useful if you run a pig farm to do things like, you know, take your boar and have it pull itself around to go meet all the lady pigs and figure out which ones are in heat or whatever.

447
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:08,061
Speaker 1: Clean all these plastic boards that apparently they have to separate pigs or something.

448
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:09,290
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know what they do.

449
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:16,370
Speaker 1: But they've got a machine that washes many, many plastic boards very, very quickly, among others.

450
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,449
Speaker 1: But the boar bot in particular is just really entertaining.

451
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:28,268
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's like really run of the mill and boring for anyone who actually knows about farming or works on a farm.

452
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:42,030
Speaker 1: But as a nerd who thinks robots are cool and doesn't know anything about farming, there is an element of humor and also, you know, coolness to the products made by the swine robotics company.

453
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:50,570
Speaker 0: Existing technology implemented to solve real problems is way more valuable to society than bleeding-edge technology used to solve bleeding-edge problems.

454
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:52,014
Speaker 1: Yeah.

455
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:53,083
Speaker 1: And it's also kind of funny.

456
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:55,650
Speaker 1: It's like you look at this, it's like how many options do they have for this?

457
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,549
Speaker 1: It's sort of like configuring a PC if you want to buy one.

458
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,610
Speaker 1: It's like you can get the bigger model, the smaller model.

459
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:18,010
Speaker 1: But it also, right, if you apparently, if you believe they're advertising, if you operate your farm with these instead of, I guess, whatever old-fashioned non-robot method, it's apparently better for the animals, right, and better for the safety of the people.

460
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,606
Speaker 1: You know, it's like a, you know, supposedly.

461
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:21,129
Speaker 1: I don't know.

462
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,942
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it's worse.

463
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:23,870
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about farming.

464
00:35:24,995 --> 00:35:25,908
Speaker 1: I just know it's a cool video.

465
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:31,650
Speaker 0: Anyway, in the meta moment, the Geek Night's Book Club book, The Tale of Genji, I continue to steamroll along.

466
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,929
Speaker 0: I'm willing to do the episode at the end of January if you are.

467
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,710
Speaker 0: First week of February.

468
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:38,510
Speaker 1: I am likely to finish the book by the end of January.

469
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:49,410
Speaker 1: I think the Kindle was lying to me about the percentage because I looked, and I've got like less than 10 chapters left, but it's like, oh, you're only like 50-something percent done.

470
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,550
Speaker 1: But I looked at the page numbers, and it's like, I think you're lying.

471
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,070
Speaker 1: I think I'm a lot closer.

472
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,910
Speaker 1: I think it's including some appendices in its estimation.

473
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,149
Speaker 0: I've been burned by that so many times.

474
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I crossed a, you know, I read it a whole lot.

475
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,170
Speaker 1: I've crossed, you know, major thresholds in the plot here.

476
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,828
Speaker 0: I assume Genji is no longer with us.

477
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,489
Speaker 1: Most likely.

478
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:12,605
Speaker 0: Oh, you're just getting that part?

479
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:12,989
Speaker 0: Okay.

480
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, I think I am going to finish this book.

481
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,750
Speaker 1: The end is in sight.

482
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,050
Speaker 1: It's not like, oh, there's a mountain over there somewhere.

483
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:22,850
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I can see the mountain on the horizon.

484
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,010
Speaker 1: I'm getting there.

485
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,190
Speaker 0: All right, let's plan on doing that episode first week of February.

486
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,548
Speaker 1: How's that?

487
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,548
Speaker 1: Are you going to finish it?

488
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, easily.

489
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:30,870
Speaker 1: Are you just going to give up and be like, you know.

490
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,629
Speaker 0: I'm actually, once I got like into a groove on it, I'm really enjoying reading it.

491
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,650
Speaker 0: Really, like I said, it was the point when I stopped trying to do Lit Crit and just write it like a soap opera.

492
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,310
Speaker 1: So I have an idea actually, right?

493
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,550
Speaker 1: How can we possibly do justice to a book?

494
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,909
Speaker 0: I'm trying to take notes on like my top 10 favorite moments.

495
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:56,370
Speaker 1: How can we possibly do justice to a book that took us to who knows how many years to read?

496
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,310
Speaker 1: So I was thinking we're canceling Ignite.

497
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,370
Speaker 0: So we're going to do a two year long Genji podcast.

498
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:03,429
Speaker 1: Or we could kill a few birds with one stone.

499
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:03,870
Speaker 1: Right.

500
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,990
Speaker 1: The fact that we, A, never know what to talk about on Thursday.

501
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:17,729
Speaker 1: I think we could do at least two episodes, if not three on this book by breaking it down as a, we got to talk about the actual story in the book.

502
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:17,906
Speaker 0: Yeah.

503
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:18,289
Speaker 0: Right.

504
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:20,766
Speaker 1: And then we can do a second episode.

505
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:30,470
Speaker 1: that's meta, but the meta could, if we want to be broken into two episodes itself, because this is the first meta, which is, this is the first novel ever.

506
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:31,369
Speaker 1: Right.

507
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,788
Speaker 1: Let's look at where novels came from.

508
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:34,410
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:39,009
Speaker 1: Look at what was the same, what was different in terms of, you know, writing all that long ago.

510
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:43,710
Speaker 1: And the second meta is just, you know, the historical meta, like what was going on at that time.

511
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,170
Speaker 1: Clearly this is not a true story with ghosts and shit.

512
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:47,690
Speaker 1: Right.

513
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,889
Speaker 0: But I mean, the ghosts are just malaria.

514
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,030
Speaker 1: Right.

515
00:37:51,190 --> 00:38:00,150
Speaker 1: But you can learn about what life was like at that time from this book, as much as you can learn about like the eighties by watching dirty dancing.

516
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,341
Speaker 1: Right.

517
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,229
Speaker 1: Which is not a true story, but you learn a lot about what's going on in the eighties.

518
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,249
Speaker 0: It may not be true, but it speaks to truth.

519
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:08,453
Speaker 1: Right.

520
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:08,909
Speaker 1: Exactly.

521
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,830
Speaker 1: So, you know, we can, we could get two to three episodes out of this.

522
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:27,108
Speaker 0: I feel like too, because I am, I have a extremely superficial knowledge of Heian era Japan to the point that I've learned from reading this book more about Heian era Japan than I knew before going in.

523
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:28,490
Speaker 1: That's true.

524
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true of me as well.

525
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,608
Speaker 0: I knew very little.

526
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:37,090
Speaker 1: Do you think, I wonder if, uh, this is probably like never going to happen, but I just, it came to me in the, in the shower.

527
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:37,430
Speaker 1: Right.

528
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:41,480
Speaker 1: The guy who translated it, the Royal Tyler guy, a is he alive?

529
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,970
Speaker 1: B come on nights.

530
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:45,888
Speaker 1: C is he a good person that would actually be good to talk to?

531
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:50,790
Speaker 0: I mean, I feel like we should knowledge the next, uh, the, the translation we read of the Odyssey.

532
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,990
Speaker 0: I feel like that's the kind of person you want to get on geek nights.

533
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,610
Speaker 1: Oh, that, yeah, she would be amazing.

534
00:38:55,071 --> 00:39:04,909
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, but I don't know if, uh, like, well, Tyler Clinton has the knowledge cause he translated this whole fucking thing, but I don't, I don't know what kind of person he is.

535
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:11,350
Speaker 1: It would make a good episode or not, or if, if he's even alive, I don't know anyway.

536
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:12,386
Speaker 0: All right.

537
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,390
Speaker 0: Otherwise we are not going to be at magfest.

538
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,520
Speaker 0: Obviously you shouldn't be either like.

539
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,644
Speaker 0: seriously do not fucking go to magfest right now.

540
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:28,270
Speaker 0: The panel I did effects unplugged during that brief window when I felt comfortable going to a con for 2.5 hours and I'm wearing a mask on stage.

541
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:29,230
Speaker 0: It's on YouTube.

542
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,610
Speaker 0: And, uh, otherwise we're working on a bunch of geek night stuff.

543
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:44,110
Speaker 0: Both of us, Scott more heavily than me right now because Scott's work is way more important, but, uh, I'm working on some things around panels that we might just do outside of cons because might not be any cons for the foreseeable future.

544
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,045
Speaker 1: He's alive, but he's like 86 years old.

545
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:54,077
Speaker 0: So during this whole pandemic, one thing we haven't been doing is playing a lot of tabletop board games for a lot of reasons.

546
00:39:54,259 --> 00:40:02,730
Speaker 0: you can imagine, uh, mostly playing 18 X X games because the reason they do asynchronously, uh, occasionally playing a game and like TTS or something, but not that often.

547
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:09,270
Speaker 1: So, uh, even if we got together, right, the board, the supply chains hurting the board gaming people, you know, so, yup.

548
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:10,537
Speaker 0: But it just so happened.

549
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:18,290
Speaker 0: There's a recent game from 2020, the lost ruins of arnic or our neck or air nake, uh, which is moderately popular.

550
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:20,429
Speaker 0: Got a pretty high rating on board game geek right now.

551
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,350
Speaker 0: And also it happens to be supported on board game arena.

552
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:27,929
Speaker 0: So the stars came together and we played it the other day.

553
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:32,879
Speaker 1: I've only played at one friend who had a friend who learned it and, and went out of their way to teach it to us.

554
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,781
Speaker 0: And that helped a lot, uh, designed by men, Ellen.

555
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:50,050
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so this game is a game that combines basically two of the biggest mechanics in the Euro gaming world, deck building like dominion and worker placement like every worker placement game ever a curricula, right?

556
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,805
Speaker 1: So we had already previously played a game that did a similar thing, the same combination, which is do an imperium.

557
00:40:55,825 --> 00:41:04,521
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't think we did a show on it because I got, I got to play that one again before I have an opinion that I'm going to share public because we didn't do a show right away.

558
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,850
Speaker 1: So it wasn't fresh in our minds.

559
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:12,929
Speaker 0: Not just that, but we are first play through had several errors and issues that I need to play again with knowledge to decide if I like the game or not.

560
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,556
Speaker 1: I need to like reread the rules.

561
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:27,078
Speaker 1: It's been so long, but ruins of our neck, we just played it the other day and it was much simpler and easier to comprehend in our minds as much more streamlined, uh, you know, and whatnot.

562
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,510
Speaker 1: So, uh, I don't feel like we need to play it again to do an episode.

563
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:35,390
Speaker 1: We can't obviously talk about how to win, especially not the way I play it.

564
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,195
Speaker 1: I played like trash.

565
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:36,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

566
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,443
Speaker 1: Okay.

567
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:42,637
Speaker 0: But, uh, but I was, I was basically doing what the player who won was doing, but one round behind worse.

568
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,701
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

569
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:52,254
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, so obviously, you know, it take the two biggest mechanics of Euro gaming that are and combine them into one game.

570
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,882
Speaker 1: That's obviously a great idea.

571
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,730
Speaker 1: It's going to be a winner.

572
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,310
Speaker 1: Uh, I enjoyed both of those games.

573
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,990
Speaker 1: So I don't know if there's any other games that have attempted that combo.

574
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:11,516
Speaker 1: I expect more to come, but you know, both of those games I enjoyed, uh, ruins of our neck, I think was like the, you know, more accessible.

575
00:42:11,536 --> 00:42:21,370
Speaker 1: Uh, the theme is obviously less fun cause it's not doing, there's no worms and whatnot, but it's just, the game is very like elegant for this kind of game.

576
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,789
Speaker 0: Like you're managing all these mechanics together, but they're matched together pretty elegantly.

577
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:26,983
Speaker 0: It's a very fast play.

578
00:42:27,104 --> 00:42:30,950
Speaker 0: Once you know the rules, like this is a 20 to 30 minute game among people.

579
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,327
Speaker 1: I think the reason it's a fast play is, is for two reasons.

580
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:40,316
Speaker 1: Number one, it does the thing I like where on your turn you do an action and then it's the next person's turn.

581
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,710
Speaker 1: You don't take your whole goddamn turn like root.

582
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,610
Speaker 1: And then everyone else takes a nap, right?

583
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,374
Speaker 1: You do one action that it goes around and then you one action that goes around like tickets to ride.

584
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:53,945
Speaker 1: So that makes it feel faster because you're constantly, you're doing actions and you're not waiting too much.

585
00:42:54,469 --> 00:43:00,030
Speaker 1: Um, and two, the game is always a set number of rounds and it's not that many.

586
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:05,078
Speaker 1: It's like five, six, it's not a lot of rounds, five rounds ever, no matter what, it's five rounds.

587
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:17,470
Speaker 1: So you're really only taking, and especially in the early rounds, you're taking like two actions in the later rounds, maybe six or seven, you know, not that many actions and you've got two workers and that's all you ever get.

588
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,330
Speaker 1: You start with two workers and end with two workers.

589
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,574
Speaker 0: So it's sidesteps.

590
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:30,370
Speaker 0: a fundamental issue with most worker placement games is that if they're not designed extremely well, the get more workers action ends up being the most important thing in the game.

591
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:33,409
Speaker 0: And that tends to cause certain styles of play that aren't actually that fun.

592
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:43,727
Speaker 1: In ruins of our neck, you are, you know, the, the, there are some actions where you don't need workers, but of the actions that you do need workers, the big actions, you basically have 10 actions the whole game.

593
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:43,989
Speaker 1: That's it.

594
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,509
Speaker 1: It's take 10 actions game over.

595
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,690
Speaker 1: So it's going to be a quick one and each action is going to matter a lot.

596
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,488
Speaker 0: We'll get back to that.

597
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,470
Speaker 0: Some actions don't need workers because that actually really adds to this game.

598
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,969
Speaker 0: And I will actually, what I would compare this game the most to, of all the games I could say, I don't think, I don't know if you'll agree, but I played this game more.

599
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:09,509
Speaker 0: It does a lot of whatever Dell does in terms of your directional heuristics, but it does them so much better.

600
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:17,129
Speaker 1: I mean, I think I'm going to compare it the most to Dune Imperium still, which is another game that is worker placement and deck building.

601
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:23,730
Speaker 0: So basically the theme is a typical, you're exploring some ancient ruins in some forgotten continent somewhere.

602
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,890
Speaker 1: Some sort of, you know, fantasy, archeology, Indiana Jones deal.

603
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,049
Speaker 1: You know, you know the theme.

604
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:29,990
Speaker 0: But the game at least it makes it clear.

605
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:34,970
Speaker 0: It's not a real world place, nor are there any people there at all.

606
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,449
Speaker 0: Like they're very explicit about that.

607
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:41,209
Speaker 0: And there is a temple with ridiculous magic nonsense in it.

608
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:44,330
Speaker 0: And you're the first people ever setting foot here, basically.

609
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,424
Speaker 1: But you're still looting an ancient or lost civilization.

610
00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:49,750
Speaker 1: that just, you know, of some kind.

611
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:50,047
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:44:50,750 --> 00:45:00,230
Speaker 0: So basically you've got this board that has some near areas that are like a base camp, some kind of far away areas and some really far away areas.

613
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:04,850
Speaker 0: And then an exploration like track on the right.

614
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:11,190
Speaker 0: So on the first part, you can spend movement actions to put a worker in one of these places.

615
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:13,168
Speaker 0: And the further away it is, the harder it is to get to.

616
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,970
Speaker 0: And there could be monsters and there's resources.

617
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:24,990
Speaker 0: And you're basically opening up more spaces to put workers to get resources and also get victory points.

618
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:29,550
Speaker 0: And then the track is the most fascinating thing because it's really the core of the game.

619
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:36,890
Speaker 0: You're basically spending resources to move your book and your magnifying glass up this track.

620
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:48,170
Speaker 0: And there's different paths through the track that require different resources, a little bit clank-like in that regard, like spend two arrowheads and a ruby to move from this space to this space.

621
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:57,090
Speaker 0: And the shtick is that as you move the magnifying glass up, you get increasing numbers of victory points.

622
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,130
Speaker 0: It's clearly the primary way to get victory points.

623
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,530
Speaker 0: And whoever gets to places first gets additional boons.

624
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:04,489
Speaker 0: And then there's some endgame scoring at the top.

625
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:12,370
Speaker 0: Moving your book up gives you way fewer victory points, but it gets you powers on your own board.

626
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:19,770
Speaker 0: And the sort of interesting, fun mechanic there is you can never move your book past your magnifying glass.

627
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,088
Speaker 0: And all that combined...

628
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, the magnifying glass symbolizes like you're investigating, right?

629
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,490
Speaker 1: You're looking at artifacts.

630
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,856
Speaker 1: And then the book symbolizes.

631
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:35,210
Speaker 1: you're recording your findings, publishing what you've learned for the world.

632
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,290
Speaker 0: You can choose to just never move your book.

633
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,430
Speaker 0: Just explore on your own and then go home satisfied.

634
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,297
Speaker 0: Like, you could do that.

635
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:42,290
Speaker 0: That's a valid strategy.

636
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:43,596
Speaker 1: Yep.

637
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,548
Speaker 1: You probably wouldn't win, but you can do it.

638
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:54,890
Speaker 0: And otherwise, the only other thing on the board, really, is a track that has artifacts and items that you can buy.

639
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,690
Speaker 0: Artifacts and items are basically just cards that you put into your deck.

640
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:03,249
Speaker 0: The deck building is important, but the deck you build is extremely small.

641
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the items are, basically early in the game, the card market is mostly items.

642
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,770
Speaker 1: And the item cards are not very powerful.

643
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:16,149
Speaker 1: Some of them can be if you get good combos and whatnot.

644
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,250
Speaker 1: But, you know, they do good stuff, right?

645
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,129
Speaker 1: But they're also easy to get and you just sort of play them.

646
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:26,790
Speaker 1: The artifact cards are very powerful.

647
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,710
Speaker 1: And when you buy one, it activates immediately.

648
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:38,060
Speaker 1: But if you draw an artifact again later, after you bought it, it activated immediately.

649
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:40,129
Speaker 1: It eventually makes its way into your deck.

650
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:41,349
Speaker 1: You draw it again.

651
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:47,770
Speaker 1: If you want to play it again, you actually have to spend a tablet resource every time you play one.

652
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:52,290
Speaker 1: And so it's harder to get the repeat effect on the artifacts.

653
00:47:52,490 --> 00:48:01,530
Speaker 1: And as the game goes on, that card market where you can get new cards from shifts to basically consist of more artifacts and less items.

654
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:07,430
Speaker 1: So it's like eventually at the end of the game, it's like, yeah, you know, first of all, it's late in the game.

655
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,781
Speaker 1: Why are you even buying items?

656
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:09,870
Speaker 1: They're so weak.

657
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:16,090
Speaker 1: But also, right, it's like, here's more artifacts to choose from late in the game, you know, go ahead.

658
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,530
Speaker 1: And especially if you buy them late in the game, you probably will never draw them.

659
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:21,710
Speaker 1: You're just going to buy them, get their immediate effect.

660
00:48:22,251 --> 00:48:27,270
Speaker 1: And there are worth victory points, even though the most victory points comes from the magnifying glass.

661
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:32,470
Speaker 1: There are so much, pretty much everything you do gives some number of victory points.

662
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:35,450
Speaker 0: A good thing about this game, one victory point matters.

663
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,650
Speaker 0: And three victory points is kind of like the unit of significant advancement.

664
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:44,310
Speaker 0: Like three victory points is a big fuck you to everyone else at the table.

665
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,049
Speaker 0: But one victory point could easily make or break the game for you.

666
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,090
Speaker 1: Yep, sure enough.

667
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,809
Speaker 0: So the cards in your deck are interesting, too.

668
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,090
Speaker 0: Because remember what we said earlier, you have two workers, but you could take more than two actions.

669
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:01,069
Speaker 0: Some actions require you put a worker down to do a thing.

670
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:04,070
Speaker 0: Usually the worker things involve getting resources.

671
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:12,450
Speaker 0: And cards can be used as free actions to do a thing, usually give you a resource of a particular type.

672
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,389
Speaker 0: But they can also do other things, depending on what the card says.

673
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:20,790
Speaker 0: And you keep going around, taking turns, until you pass.

674
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,850
Speaker 0: Once you pass, you're out.

675
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:28,050
Speaker 0: So you could use all your cards first, and then use your two workers.

676
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:34,070
Speaker 0: You could use a worker to do a thing, use a bunch of cards, then use your second worker to do a thing you couldn't have done before.

677
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:42,690
Speaker 0: You could mess up and not have any workers left, and then there's a thing you really wanted to do that someone else unlocked or changed the state of the game.

678
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,010
Speaker 0: So you're always having this decision of what do I do and how do I limit my options.

679
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:53,910
Speaker 0: Because every action you take severely limits what additional remaining actions you can take in a given turn.

680
00:49:54,612 --> 00:50:00,430
Speaker 1: So the two workers that you have, basically the actions they do are the ones in the middle of the board.

681
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:07,010
Speaker 1: Go explore a new spot, go collect resources from the camps at the bottom, the easy free spots.

682
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:10,210
Speaker 1: Fight a monster, those sorts of things.

683
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,990
Speaker 1: You could only do that twice per turn, and that's it.

684
00:50:14,413 --> 00:50:15,768
Speaker 1: You got the two workers at the end.

685
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,590
Speaker 1: Moving the magnifying glass, that's just spending resources.

686
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,048
Speaker 1: You spend resources and you move it.

687
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:22,170
Speaker 1: That's just an action.

688
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,270
Speaker 1: Buying a card, you just get the resources and you just buy the card from the market.

689
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,490
Speaker 1: You don't need a worker to do that.

690
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:29,630
Speaker 0: But it is your action.

691
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:36,050
Speaker 0: So for example, if you have no valid actions on your turn, you're forced to pass even if you didn't want to.

692
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:46,710
Speaker 0: So you might do actions that make sure you have additional possible actions to stay in the round hoping someone else will do something, waiting for a new item to come out.

693
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:52,290
Speaker 0: There's a lot of surprising tactical depth for how simple this game is because of that.

694
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,845
Speaker 0: The other thing this does...

695
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,350
Speaker 1: There's that typical balance, right?

696
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:02,470
Speaker 1: Normally in a worker placement game, a lot of them tend to either swing in one direction or the other.

697
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:08,170
Speaker 1: One direction being, I want to get my workers out first to get the spots before they get blocked.

698
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,969
Speaker 1: Because yes indeed, in this game, if someone else went to that spot, you can't go there.

699
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:18,370
Speaker 1: But also, some worker placement games, you're like, well, I kind of want to hold out to the end.

700
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,144
Speaker 1: I have the most information, right?

701
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,948
Speaker 1: Then I can run wild with my workers on whatever remains blocked or not blocked.

702
00:51:28,231 --> 00:51:35,870
Speaker 1: In this game, since it goes around and around and around, you're sort of in this constant struggle between the two, right?

703
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,558
Speaker 1: If I put up my workers quickly, right?

704
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,223
Speaker 1: One, two, then that's sort of it.

705
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:47,530
Speaker 1: And I won't be able to respond to anything else that happens, but I'll get what I wanted.

706
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:53,170
Speaker 1: But if I hold out, well, yeah, sure, you're going to get more info, maybe get what you wanted, right?

707
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,649
Speaker 1: So you actually have both pressures at once.

708
00:51:56,111 --> 00:52:01,130
Speaker 1: Whereas I think in a lot of other worker placement games, only one of the two pressures is present at any given time.

709
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:15,730
Speaker 0: The most important thing this does is that the way these actions play out and the way the magnifying glass and book track works, where you're limited, is once you move onto a space, you can only move to other adjacent spaces as you go up.

710
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:24,630
Speaker 0: So it's constraining what resources you will need, which reduces the cognitive load of considering all the possible options.

711
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:30,390
Speaker 0: If all your biz doesn't need rubies to advance, you don't need to worry about rubies on the board, most likely.

712
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:34,050
Speaker 0: So you can avoid some of the analysis paralysis that happens with more open games.

713
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:38,143
Speaker 1: Well, there's only three, there's two resources, right?

714
00:52:38,163 --> 00:52:39,890
Speaker 1: The compass and, what's the other one?

715
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,830
Speaker 0: Well, there's compasses, there's gold, there's rubies, and there's arrowheads.

716
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:52,710
Speaker 1: So compasses are mostly used for traveling, to get your workers to go to more distant places, right?

717
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:56,050
Speaker 0: But some artifacts use them, some other things use them.

718
00:52:56,691 --> 00:53:00,118
Speaker 1: Gold is mostly used for getting cards, right?

719
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:05,550
Speaker 1: So those are your early game resources that mostly are used to build up your engine.

720
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:18,496
Speaker 1: The other three resources, the tablet, the ruby, and the arrowhead, are sort of the victory point, move your magnifying glass, do research resources, which are mostly used for that purpose.

721
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:22,384
Speaker 1: But then, each resource has a little bit of extra, right?

722
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:29,490
Speaker 1: You're eventually going to need some compasses to go with the magnifying glass, right?

723
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:35,630
Speaker 1: To play an artifact card, like I said before, you're going to need a spare tablet resource left over from somewhere.

724
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:42,368
Speaker 1: So they do mix it up a little bit with the costs to keep it interesting, it's not locked in.

725
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:46,144
Speaker 0: They even have a really clever win more at the very end of the game.

726
00:53:46,164 --> 00:54:03,690
Speaker 0: If you make it to the top of that track, there's like this pyramid of extra victory points you can buy out of, where there's three places that require different amounts of resources, and you can buy one, two, or three of them in any combination every round if you somehow are sitting up there with extra resources at the end of the game.

727
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:13,190
Speaker 1: I guess the last thing is that every card, in addition to having an effect of some kind, if it's like an item, right?

728
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:20,690
Speaker 1: Or even the basic cards the game just gives you from the start, you can spend them for free to get a compass or a gold or whatever.

729
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:26,210
Speaker 1: Every card has some sort of travel possibility on it.

730
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:28,690
Speaker 0: Yep, boots, boats, cars, planes.

731
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,032
Speaker 1: Right, boots, boats, cars.

732
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:57,790
Speaker 1: So it's like when you want to send your worker out into the world, not only do you need enough compasses to get them where they're going, so you have to get those compasses from somewhere, you also have to play cards with enough correct transportation symbols, so now you can't use those cards for what their effect was because you had to use those cards to make the worker go to the spot that you wanted, and so then you get some tough choices as well, right?

733
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,907
Speaker 1: Sometimes you might pick up a crappy item just because, "Well, I'll use it as an airplane on it," right?

734
00:55:03,027 --> 00:55:03,650
Speaker 1: You know, whatever.

735
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:19,347
Speaker 1: So you might be forced to be like, "Oh, I really want to play this good item, but that's the only way I can get that worker out is to use it as a boat, and, well, if I don't do that, then the worker won't even get used this turn.

736
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:19,688
Speaker 1: What do I

737
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:19,889
Speaker 1: do?".

738
00:55:21,010 --> 00:56:05,290
Speaker 0: So this is sort of where the reason I want to compare and contrast this a little bit to Everdell is that Everdell, while it's a very different game, this game and Everdell share a few very core heuristics in that in the early game, you're buying items and sort of either collecting resources or collecting ways to collect resources, and in the later game, you're doing victory points and other stuff, but the big difference is Everdell, as you get into later phases of the game, the possibilities open up and explode and cause extreme analysis paralysis, but in this game, your options are constrained by the decisions you have made up to this point, so it never opens up enough for you to get just completely overwhelmed with options.

739
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:12,430
Speaker 0: If you're in a spot where you need a ruby and you don't have a ruby, you fucked up, you should have gotten a ruby, you could see it coming the whole time.

740
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:20,930
Speaker 1: I do think that is a problem for just many games in general, right, is that, you know, think about like, you know, something like Monopoly or Civilization.

741
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,076
Speaker 0: Well, characters in the games, it's bushiness, the concept of bushiness.

742
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:27,884
Speaker 0: You cannot have a game where bushiness increases over time.

743
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:30,650
Speaker 0: That will greatly extend the length of that game.

744
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:36,624
Speaker 1: A lot of games, the bushiness goes up and up and up and up, like Civ 6, you know, any Civ.

745
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:38,830
Speaker 1: really, towards the end of the game, the bushiness is huge.

746
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,623
Speaker 1: You got a ton of cities, a ton of units, it's just like, it's too big, right?

747
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:44,470
Speaker 1: You got to deal with all this crap, right?

748
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:50,286
Speaker 1: And usually early in games, you don't want to start people out with like a whole pile of resources right at the beginning.

749
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,730
Speaker 1: That's two hits, like you didn't earn it.

750
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:54,210
Speaker 1: So the bushiness is small in the beginning.

751
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,317
Speaker 0: Like a lot of train games, take a loan.

752
00:56:56,337 --> 00:56:58,970
Speaker 0: That's the only thing you can do, take a loan.

753
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:00,471
Speaker 1: Right.

754
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:05,566
Speaker 1: So I think, you know, the ideal game is going to increase bushiness quickly, right?

755
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:07,170
Speaker 1: To get your options out early.

756
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,569
Speaker 0: And then winnow that bushiness down.

757
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:09,271
Speaker 1: Right.

758
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:12,416
Speaker 1: Constrain them and push the game towards the conclusion.

759
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:20,750
Speaker 1: And this constrains you by, A, it's hard to get a huge pile of resources and keep, there's no engine building really, right?

760
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,009
Speaker 1: You just, you don't build, there's like no way.

761
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,830
Speaker 0: You might get one combo between like an assistant and an artifact.

762
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,474
Speaker 1: But I tried it.

763
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:35,310
Speaker 1: when I played, I tried to take the dominion path of aha, I'll build and make a really polished deck of deck.

764
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,768
Speaker 0: Oh, you had the best deck by far.

765
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:37,752
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:39,799
Speaker 1: I was like, I'll clear the crap out of my deck.

767
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,830
Speaker 1: I'll bring in all the really powerful cards into my deck.

768
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,053
Speaker 1: I'll build an amazing deck.

769
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:49,910
Speaker 1: And hopefully then I'll draw this ridiculous hand of amazing cards, play them and score a pile of points.

770
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:50,672
Speaker 1: Right.

771
00:57:50,993 --> 00:57:54,181
Speaker 1: And the thing is, it took so long because you have so few actions.

772
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:55,003
Speaker 1: to build.

773
00:57:55,063 --> 00:57:57,770
Speaker 1: that amazing deck took all five rounds.

774
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:01,621
Speaker 1: And I was never, if there were six or seven rounds, I would have won for sure.

775
00:58:02,122 --> 00:58:03,867
Speaker 1: But there weren't six or seven rounds.

776
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:04,810
Speaker 1: There were five rounds.

777
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:14,750
Speaker 1: And I had not scored basically any victory points worth of shit because I couldn't get the valuable resources because I was spending my resources on polishing my deck instead.

778
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:22,150
Speaker 1: And there was, there aren't a lot of, I had basically all the draw mechanics that you could get and there aren't enough of them.

779
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,562
Speaker 1: So it's not like I could, I was drawing cards during my turn as much as anyone could.

780
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:29,370
Speaker 1: And it wasn't enough to like play some combo.

781
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,537
Speaker 1: It's like, you can only do so much.

782
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:34,146
Speaker 1: You start with two workers, you end with two workers.

783
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,190
Speaker 1: It's like, that's it.

784
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,062
Speaker 1: You're 10 worker actions or the whole game, right?

785
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,789
Speaker 1: Plan those out and you're done.

786
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:46,430
Speaker 0: So second point of comparison between this and Everdell, the cards are the reason the game does not fall into a stale meta.

787
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,663
Speaker 0: The cards are the thing that shuffles the game up.

788
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:49,750
Speaker 0: Same with Everdell.

789
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,469
Speaker 1: Different cards every time.

790
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:55,728
Speaker 0: The cards guide like what's possible, what people are fighting over, et cetera.

791
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:06,490
Speaker 0: But the cards do not use a lot of word language so much as they have a very simple lexicon of very straightforward actions with symbols.

792
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:12,310
Speaker 0: So it takes a couple seconds to figure out what a new card does and no card...

793
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,170
Speaker 1: As long as you have the how to play guide is necessary for some of the symbols, right?

794
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:22,590
Speaker 1: It's not quite a race for the galaxy situation, but you do need a little guide cheat sheet to understand some of the cards.

795
00:59:22,991 --> 00:59:24,361
Speaker 1: But there's not that many symbols.

796
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:25,630
Speaker 1: You'll learn them all pretty quickly.

797
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:29,490
Speaker 0: And none of the cards do anything particularly crazy out of the bounds of what you would expect.

798
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:34,910
Speaker 0: Like if you look at 10% of the cards, you've got a good sense of what 100% of the cards are capable of.

799
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,270
Speaker 1: I think we had one late game card question because there was some bad wording.

800
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:41,027
Speaker 0: But look at Everdell...

801
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,210
Speaker 1: We looked it up and we got an answer.

802
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:50,050
Speaker 0: Everdell, the cards have a whole bunch of language you have to parse and the cards interact with each other in really complex ways.

803
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,170
Speaker 0: That's why Everdell takes four hours to play.

804
00:59:52,730 --> 01:00:01,349
Speaker 0: And while BoardGameGeek weirdly says this game takes 30 to 120 minutes, I cannot imagine a game of this taking longer than 45 minutes.

805
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,965
Speaker 1: No, it's only five rounds.

806
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:05,570
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

807
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:08,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I like it.

808
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,263
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

809
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:10,608
Speaker 0: I want to play it again soon.

810
01:00:11,771 --> 01:00:15,750
Speaker 0: And I think it has a lot of replay value because the cards are key.

811
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:19,230
Speaker 0: They are how you construct the decks, but you make such a small deck.

812
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:23,810
Speaker 0: I don't think this will fall into a hard meta under 10 to 12 plays.

813
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:27,550
Speaker 0: I think you could get 10 or 12 plays out of this and they would all be satisfying.

814
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:28,352
Speaker 1: Right.

815
01:00:28,412 --> 01:00:29,055
Speaker 1: I think it does.

816
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:31,285
Speaker 1: Like you said, I think it has replay value.

817
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:32,490
Speaker 1: You could play this a bunch.

818
01:00:32,772 --> 01:00:33,489
Speaker 0: But you could exhaust it.

819
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,088
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have the infinite replay value of like a T&E.

820
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:38,629
Speaker 1: Or a Hanzo-Tortonica.

821
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:39,671
Speaker 1: Right.

822
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:42,430
Speaker 1: You can play it a bunch, but then you're going to be done with it.

823
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:46,050
Speaker 1: However, it's very obvious if there aren't expansions for this already.

824
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,215
Speaker 0: Well, it comes with an expansion.

825
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:50,470
Speaker 0: You flip over the board and there's like the Temple of the Snake and everything's different.

826
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:51,794
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

827
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:52,882
Speaker 1: So there you go.

828
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:53,950
Speaker 1: There's some replay value.

829
01:00:53,990 --> 01:01:01,230
Speaker 1: But yeah, this game, not only does it come with an expansion, the Temple of the Snake, but it is ripe for further expansion.

830
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,910
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, just release a deck of weird artifacts, another sideboard you can advance on.

831
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,178
Speaker 1: Just put out different cards.

832
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,510
Speaker 1: Be like, all right, play with deck two instead of deck one.

833
01:01:13,111 --> 01:01:15,681
Speaker 1: It's so easy to expand this game.

834
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:17,750
Speaker 1: They absolutely will if they haven't already.

835
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,449
Speaker 1: I just haven't looked up whether they have already.

836
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:24,170
Speaker 1: And I think that's where you can get even more replay value from out of this.

837
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:32,770
Speaker 1: But, you know, even if they never release an expansion and you do play it out, you know, whatever this game costs or whatever it costs to play on Board Game Arena.

838
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:43,570
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's one of the free ones or one of the ones where you have to... Basically, the way Board Game Arena works, if people don't know, is it's a website that lets you play board games against people online and it works.

839
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,915
Speaker 1: So that's really good.

840
01:01:45,116 --> 01:01:48,830
Speaker 1: But the UI is really not great, but it works.

841
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:56,050
Speaker 1: And they have a lot of top tier board games on there, you know, ranging from all sorts of different weight levels and whatnot.

842
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:02,047
Speaker 1: But if you want to start a new game, like if you want to play 6nimped, you can just play.

843
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:02,970
Speaker 1: 6nimped on there for free.

844
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:10,850
Speaker 1: If you want to play some games, like I wanted to play, what was it called, Don't Stop or whatever, or Can't Stop.

845
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:13,170
Speaker 1: It's like, well, I didn't have a premium account.

846
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:19,050
Speaker 1: So if someone else who did have a premium account started a game of Can't Stop, they could invite me to join it.

847
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,930
Speaker 0: Might just be worth it for me to get a premium account.

848
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:27,870
Speaker 1: But if you have a premium account, you can start a new game of any game.

849
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:35,250
Speaker 1: But if you have a free account, you can only join games created by premium accounts or start games if they're free games.

850
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,315
Speaker 0: I will warn you on this.

851
01:02:36,738 --> 01:02:38,850
Speaker 0: If you play this on Board Game Arena, it works great.

852
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:44,170
Speaker 0: But any card, Scott got burned by this, two different players got burned.

853
01:02:44,871 --> 01:02:52,870
Speaker 0: If there's a card where you can get a resource thing or pass to get a different resource thing, you have to pass via the card.

854
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,309
Speaker 0: If you just click pass, you're just SOL.

855
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:57,737
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what happened to me.

856
01:02:58,018 --> 01:03:00,010
Speaker 1: And that's a user interface Board Game Arena.

857
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing to do with the game itself.

858
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:02,669
Speaker 1: The card was really straightforward.

859
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,670
Speaker 1: If we're playing in person, there's no way that can happen.

860
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:06,372
Speaker 0: Exactly.

861
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:11,645
Speaker 0: I don't know if I would buy this game personally.

862
01:03:11,706 --> 01:03:12,628
Speaker 0: Not saying you shouldn't buy it.

863
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:15,021
Speaker 1: Only because, one, It probably takes up a lot of space.

864
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,290
Speaker 1: It's not a small game.

865
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:20,610
Speaker 0: I don't know when I'll be playing games in person anytime soon.

866
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:26,890
Speaker 0: But also, this is the kind of game that the PAX tabletop library will probably have two or three copies of.

867
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,650
Speaker 0: And this is the kind of game, if I was to add any random PAX, I would check it out at least once and play it.

868
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:32,487
Speaker 0: Like every PAX.

869
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:36,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, play it once, put it back, right?

870
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:36,579
Speaker 1: Yeah.

871
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:43,810
Speaker 1: If you're a person who has board game nights still, somehow, and you've got, it only goes up to four players, I think.

872
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, it goes one to four.

873
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,630
Speaker 0: Obviously, one is not the same game.

874
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,361
Speaker 1: Two isn't the same game either.

875
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:50,309
Speaker 1: You want three or four.

876
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:51,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, you definitely want three or four.

877
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:55,730
Speaker 0: Though, I think two is more the same game than other games because it is mostly a race.

878
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,615
Speaker 1: It is mostly a race.

879
01:03:57,655 --> 01:04:03,950
Speaker 1: There isn't too much player interaction other than blocking off other people's spaces with your workers.

880
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:07,669
Speaker 1: And also buying cards before other people can buy them.

881
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:10,949
Speaker 1: Other than that, there's no contention and there's no player interaction.

882
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:14,540
Speaker 1: But you could make an, like, Agricola, right?

883
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,330
Speaker 1: Agricola is a game that has cards, even though it's not deck building.

884
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:23,170
Speaker 1: Where, you know, the main deck of Agricola cards, the basic one, didn't have any player interaction.

885
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,290
Speaker 1: The only interaction in Agricola is blocking.

886
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:27,529
Speaker 0: They could make a player interaction expansion.

887
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,971
Speaker 1: Right.

888
01:04:28,011 --> 01:04:31,590
Speaker 1: Agricola had the alternate deck with player interaction cards.

889
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:39,190
Speaker 1: They could easily, maybe those cards exist and we just didn't see them in our play, but they could easily print more cards that have player interaction.

890
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:46,830
Speaker 1: Like, steal a resource from a friend or, you know, move someone else's magnifying glass backwards or steal someone's book.

891
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:47,696
Speaker 1: I don't know.

892
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,529
Speaker 1: You could do so much stuff with that.

893
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,245
Speaker 1: You know, take someone's monster.

894
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:53,810
Speaker 1: I don't know.

895
01:04:54,151 --> 01:05:00,289
Speaker 0: I would also say that if you like this game, you would probably like Crown of Amara in terms of...

896
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,950
Speaker 1: If you like this game, you're going to like Dune Imperium, which is also deck building and worker placement.

897
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,989
Speaker 0: Well, honestly, if you like this game, you're going to like a lot of classic euros, too.

898
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:11,053
Speaker 1: Yeah.

899
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:12,135
Speaker 1: And vice versa.

900
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:15,623
Speaker 1: It's basically just, you know, it's a solid euro.

901
01:05:15,883 --> 01:05:18,088
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a legendary all-time game.

902
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,071
Speaker 0: Wow.

903
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:20,563
Speaker 0: But it's just, it's polished.

904
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,167
Speaker 0: It's well-made.

905
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,623
Speaker 1: It's a really solid, polished euro.

906
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:24,509
Speaker 1: It's balanced.

907
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,770
Speaker 1: It binds to the top mechanics.

908
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:26,974
Speaker 0: The rules feel right.

909
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:28,601
Speaker 0: Like, everything's elegant about it.

910
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:30,510
Speaker 0: I have no material complaints.

911
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,309
Speaker 1: It's not broken.

912
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:38,390
Speaker 0: And seriously, if you know the rules and your friends know the rules and they're like us, this is a 30 to 40 minute game tops.

913
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,550
Speaker 0: You could crank out a few of these in a row.

914
01:05:41,565 --> 01:05:41,627
Speaker 1: Yep.

915
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:41,708
Speaker 1: Yep.

916
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,050
Speaker 0: I do worry that setup would take a while physically, though.

917
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:51,510
Speaker 1: You don't have to deal out, like, the spaces and the monsters immediately.

918
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:51,872
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

919
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,102
Speaker 0: You deal them when you land on them.

920
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:53,929
Speaker 0: So, I guess it could just be...

921
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,091
Speaker 1: Yeah.

922
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:58,870
Speaker 1: I mean, you could deal them when you land on them or otherwise, but it doesn't matter, right?

923
01:05:59,050 --> 01:05:59,714
Speaker 1: What's the difference?

924
01:05:59,996 --> 01:06:00,720
Speaker 1: There's no difference.

925
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,947
Speaker 1: They're face down.

926
01:06:02,028 --> 01:06:02,450
Speaker 1: So, who cares?

927
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:03,331
Speaker 0: Yep.

928
01:06:03,351 --> 01:06:05,820
Speaker 0: But no, this is a solid game that I recommend.

929
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,690
Speaker 0: And it's not just because we haven't played a lot of tabletop games lately.

930
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,619
Speaker 1: It's like a B, B plus, you know, solid game.

931
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,582
Speaker 1: Worth playing.

932
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:14,810
Speaker 1: Worth owning if you got a lot of Euro players.

933
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:15,426
Speaker 1: Yeah.

934
01:06:16,582 --> 01:06:16,789
Speaker 0: You know.

935
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:23,010
Speaker 0: I feel the same urge to play it that I feel the urge to play things like Honus and Toytonica or like Tempest, like all the games I like.

936
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:25,385
Speaker 0: It's in the class of Games Rim Likes.

937
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:38,636
Speaker 1: The only thing I guess that I think it's lacking game wise is that I don't feel like there's a high... Even though I sucked at it, right?

938
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:43,469
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like there's a lot of room to like for mastery, right?

939
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:49,950
Speaker 1: It's like in a... I feel like with a few more plays, I would... And just knowing all the cards and such.

940
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:52,690
Speaker 0: I feel like I could play near optimally the second time.

941
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,350
Speaker 0: And I feel like I could play optimally within five plays.

942
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:58,016
Speaker 1: There's going to be a huge luck factor and also a turn order factor.

943
01:06:58,337 --> 01:07:12,410
Speaker 1: But beyond that, it's like I'm going to be playing the best that... Figure out intricacies and small details to step up my game and get even better at it.

944
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:22,030
Speaker 1: So if you play games because you're seeking strategic mastery, there's not a lot of high skill cap and a low ceiling, right?

945
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,642
Speaker 1: It's like you're going to play it out.

946
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,620
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

958
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:27,679
Speaker 0: Please don't go to MAGFest and at least not this year.

959
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:32,484
Speaker 0: And for now, I leave you simply with... Please, sir.

960
01:08:33,428 --> 01:08:35,618
Speaker 1: I'm as curious as can be, sir.

961
01:08:36,143 --> 01:08:37,060
Speaker 0: Wait, is he talking to me?

962
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,810
Speaker 0: Could you stop and chat with me for a minute?

963
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,500
Speaker 1: Can you teach me to be a smarter boy?

964
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:43,578
Speaker 0: Smarter boy!

965
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,720
Speaker 0: Okay, what do you want to know?

966
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,643
Speaker 0: Hey, sir.

967
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:51,331
Speaker 0: I have always loved my yum yums.

968
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:53,975
Speaker 1: But I just know how to eat 'em.

969
01:08:54,015 --> 01:08:55,578
Speaker 0: so I ask you, sir.

970
01:08:56,384 --> 01:08:58,639
Speaker 0: Where does food come from?

971
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:00,115
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

972
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,100
Speaker 0: World to this young man, if you could help him understand.

973
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:15,140
Speaker 0: Where all his favorite treats, the things he likes to eat, originate from before he puts them in his dum dum.

974
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,880
Speaker 1: Do you really not know?

975
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,469
Speaker 1: Well, golly, lolly gumdrops, please, sir.

976
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:22,198
Speaker 1: I don't want to be a dum dum.

977
01:09:23,962 --> 01:09:27,773
Speaker 0: I'm just hungry and I want some information, mister, please.

978
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,420
Speaker 0: Where does food come from?
