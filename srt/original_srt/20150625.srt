1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,527
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 25th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:10,747
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:14,356
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,050
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,520
Speaker 0: We are talking about furniture!

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,089
Speaker 0: Exciting!

7
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,038
Speaker 1: We're kind of old now.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,418
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,040
Speaker 1: So Rym, what did you say that, you know, your rib cage, right?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,340
Speaker 1: It's got like two halves that are sort of lung-shaped and then, you know, the two sort of half circle bits, they come, you know, they meet together at the bottom.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,320
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, like you have the solar plexus or whatever.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did you say?

13
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,659
Speaker 1: the name of that area was?

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,199
Speaker 0: The hypochondrias?

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like I got some weird feelings in there lately for like the past few days.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,419
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks like it's actually the hypochondriac region.

17
00:00:56,002 --> 00:01:02,620
Speaker 0: It appears to be the origin of the word hypochondria because that's the place where generic pain that may or may not be bullshit just appears.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:12,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I've been having like, I wouldn't call it pain because I'm not like ow or suffering, but it's like I'm having discomforts and strange feelings.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,080
Speaker 0: Well, I did Google search for baby hands grabbing the inside of my rib cage.

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:29,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, and it's like, well, if you search for chest pain, which I guess, right, it's like the internet's like go to the hospital immediately, you could be having a heart attack and there's no way to know unless you go to the ER, don't die.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,500
Speaker 1: And I'm like, well, it's been three days and I just biked over the bridge like four times.

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,920
Speaker 0: I feel like you gotta be at least 15 or so more years older before that.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,140
Speaker 0: Chest pain equals heart attack is something you gotta really think about.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm like, if I'm having a heart attack, I would be falling on the floor, right?

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,736
Speaker 0: There are like weird partial heart attacks that have happened to people, but again, I don't think you have.

26
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,710
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I don't think that's a problem.

27
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,800
Speaker 1: I guess what else could it be like heartburn?

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,280
Speaker 1: I've never had heartburn in my life and I've tried, I took a Tums and it didn't do anything.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,460
Speaker 0: Well, I've realized that's an interesting problem where there's certain kinds of pain that are very easy to like describe or like certain kinds of discomfort that you might have.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,974
Speaker 0: So like if I have a headache, I can be like, I have a fucking headache.

31
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,200
Speaker 0: It really hurts.

32
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:23,500
Speaker 0: But then there's like, if I have to describe what a heartburn feels like to another human being, it's actually kind of hard to describe it in a satisfactory manner.

33
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:32,440
Speaker 0: So I always wonder, like if I have a lot of weird pains that I didn't have before, are they things that everyone has when they're my age?

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,840
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure a lot of this is just oldening, right?

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

36
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:36,560
Speaker 0: Exactly.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,079
Speaker 1: But it's still, I'd rather not feel this right now.

38
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,214
Speaker 1: And really all I need is confirmation.

39
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:42,960
Speaker 1: I'm not dying.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,299
Speaker 0: I think you just need to go to the doctor and be like, hey.

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,800
Speaker 1: But if I see it now, I would just go to the doctor.

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,280
Speaker 1: And if I was in some country with just awesome healthcare, I would just go to the doctor.

43
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,780
Speaker 1: But in this country, going to the doctor is a huge pain in my ass.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll tell you guys the story.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,080
Speaker 1: So if I go to the doctor for no fucking reason, it's like, God damn it.

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,918
Speaker 0: So I have two stories.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Speaker 1: If I die because I didn't go to the doctor, well, God damn it.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,860
Speaker 0: That is one of the leading causes of death in men is untreated rectal cancer, because guys just don't go to the doctor in the US.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,580
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, if you have rectal cancer, you could have some pretty big butt problems.

50
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of those symptoms get ignored.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,120
Speaker 0: Men in the US, like statistically, just don't go to the doctor until it's way too late.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,980
Speaker 1: Isn't at some point blood going to come out of your asshole?

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,120
Speaker 0: Well, blood will come out for a lot of things, actually.

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,900
Speaker 1: Sure, but I mean, if blood comes out your asshole for any reason, except eating Chipotle, you're going to the doctor like the next day.

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,279
Speaker 1: That's not something we need to be like.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,060
Speaker 1: Do I need to go to the doctor or not?

57
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:40,560
Speaker 1: Like vague, vague discomfort in the hypochondrias is a is questionable.

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,999
Speaker 1: Whether you should go to the doctor.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,957
Speaker 0: I would think about it.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,240
Speaker 0: Everyone, if they have vague discomfort in the hypochondrias, gets to go to the doctor once.

61
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,260
Speaker 0: Because then, you know, because there's only three outcomes.

62
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:54,320
Speaker 0: Yes, you have pancreatic cancer.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,979
Speaker 0: We're sorry.

64
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,177
Speaker 0: You've got a month.

65
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:58,669
Speaker 0: It's no, you've gotten.

66
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,520
Speaker 0: there's nothing wrong with you and that'll go away.

67
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:02,290
Speaker 0: It's this X thing and it'll disappear.

68
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,919
Speaker 0: or there's nothing wrong with you.

69
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:04,854
Speaker 0: Suck it up.

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,800
Speaker 0: That sucks.

71
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,459
Speaker 0: Come back in a month and we'll tell you the same thing.

72
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:10,517
Speaker 0: I don't know what to do about that.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

74
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,140
Speaker 0: But so when I had Lyme disease way back, you know, I had a headache for like a month.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,280
Speaker 1: I mean, if a headache lasts more than a few days and doesn't go away, I at least think I have migraines and I'm going to try to get help with my migraine.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,719
Speaker 0: But that's it.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,980
Speaker 0: I've had headaches that last.

78
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,280
Speaker 0: And that's pain, right?

79
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:29,780
Speaker 1: Like if I had pain in the hypochondria, it's like, ow, ow, ow.

80
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 1: I'm suffering.

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,919
Speaker 1: I would at least want pain reliever.

82
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,160
Speaker 1: I would go to the doctor or perhaps even the ER.

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,180
Speaker 1: Like, but if it's just strange discomfort, like maybe it's a ball of gas.

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,320
Speaker 1: Like if I drink water, like while I'm drinking water, it feels good.

85
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:46,940
Speaker 1: So maybe it's something in my esophagus.

86
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:52,582
Speaker 0: You know, in that region, there's a thing that can happen with a prolapse at the top of the stomach.

87
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:58,968
Speaker 0: that I know about because way back when I had like serious heartburn doctor described all these horrible things.

88
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,380
Speaker 0: that could be wrong and we're causing the heartburn.

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,800
Speaker 0: But then in the end he was like, actually just sleep more and it'll all go away.

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,959
Speaker 1: I've been sleeping a lot lately.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,420
Speaker 0: So in retrospect, I waited a couple, like two weeks before I went to the doctor with that headache because it wasn't like the worst headache.

92
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,460
Speaker 1: I rarely have headaches.

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,880
Speaker 1: So if I have a headache that lasts more than like hours, I will go to a doctor.

94
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:25,040
Speaker 0: If I run like a hard half marathon, I'll have a headache for like the entire next day.

95
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,975
Speaker 1: Uh, that's probably a sign.

96
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,600
Speaker 1: you shouldn't do that.

97
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:28,898
Speaker 1: No.

98
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,940
Speaker 0: Well, that's why I'm never going to run a marathon marathon.

99
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:31,560
Speaker 1: Okay.

100
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,400
Speaker 1: I'll just get a headache, but I'm not going to run.

101
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:43,000
Speaker 0: But at the other time when I, you know, this is a personal story, but I had a lymph node, you know, in my groin, like on your thigh, like in the leg area, like that area.

102
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:47,739
Speaker 0: And that lymph node swelled up one day, like about a year ago, real big.

103
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,680
Speaker 1: How big, like baseball, golf?

104
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,274
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

105
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,019
Speaker 0: Like a large grape.

106
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:53,659
Speaker 1: That's not big.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,690
Speaker 1: I have a lump in my arm.

108
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,760
Speaker 1: that's grape size.

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,458
Speaker 0: No, I'm not big.

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,700
Speaker 0: So more like, oh, you didn't watch for your globe grape.

111
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:04,320
Speaker 0: Like big enough to where I looked at it and thought, wow, that's probably cancer.

112
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:04,939
Speaker 0: Okay.

113
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,560
Speaker 0: And it was great.

114
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,079
Speaker 0: It seemed to be growing rapidly.

115
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:07,759
Speaker 0: All right.

116
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:18,560
Speaker 0: So it actually took me because the American healthcare system, a full month to get an appointment with someone who could look at it other than a GP who said, yeah, you should get an appointment with the specialist.

117
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,020
Speaker 0: So that was fun.

118
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,299
Speaker 0: So I had it for a month.

119
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:26,040
Speaker 0: I got an appointment for, I went to get a doctor's appointment.

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,180
Speaker 0: Another month went by because it takes forever.

121
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,159
Speaker 1: Could have been dead by then.

122
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,460
Speaker 0: And in the last week of that month, like literally a few days for the appointment, fucking thing just went away.

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,180
Speaker 0: It was gone.

124
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,000
Speaker 0: I went to the doctor and I was like, yeah, I have nothing.

125
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,020
Speaker 1: So why did you even just cancel your appointment?

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,279
Speaker 0: Well, I still explained like what happened and I was like, so is there anything you can check?

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,199
Speaker 0: Like, she's like, I don't know.

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,420
Speaker 1: Why even go at that point?

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,020
Speaker 1: Like if I call a doctor and by the time of my appointment, there's no more babies, grab my esophagus in my hypochondrias.

130
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,379
Speaker 1: I'm canceling that shit.

131
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,840
Speaker 0: No, because you could have a situation where you had a problem that is dormant and could come back.

132
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,920
Speaker 0: Like you could have a, like a, what's the name?

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,919
Speaker 1: But if you go when it's dormant, the doctor's like, oh, you got to go.

134
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:10,239
Speaker 1: Like if you've got a rash, you can't go to the doctor when the rash is hiding.

135
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,019
Speaker 1: You got to go and you're covered in hives and shit.

136
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,160
Speaker 0: Well, you can go to the doctor when you say I had this rash.

137
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,399
Speaker 0: It came and went for like a while.

138
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,240
Speaker 1: It's got to see the rash.

139
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:21,260
Speaker 1: That's like if you call me to come fix your computer and you're like, man, sounds not working.

140
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,039
Speaker 1: I come over, you're playing MP3 and I'm like, I can't really fix the problem because I don't see it.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,858
Speaker 0: Scott, you want to know what the problem is?

142
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:30,299
Speaker 1: Check closed.

143
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,597
Speaker 0: Do you want to know what the problem is?

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,700
Speaker 1: Do you want to know the solution to the problem?

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:50,180
Speaker 0: My suggestion to you and based on my experience with our friends who are hypochondriacs and my experience is going to the doctor for nothing is go to the doctor once for vague discomfort in the hypochondriac region.

146
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,140
Speaker 1: I need a regular doctor anyway.

147
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,340
Speaker 0: Let me know who you find because I also need a regular doctor.

148
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,759
Speaker 1: I'm just going to the first person on the list.

149
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:02,740
Speaker 0: One time I did that and I got a kind of a med doctor in a weird building in Manhattan.

150
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,280
Speaker 1: It does by location so it looks in Astoria where I live.

151
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,680
Speaker 1: And then it sorts them based on the insurance company's rating.

152
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wish I could just pick any doctor because then I'd find an awesome tech doctor.

153
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,020
Speaker 1: Is there an awesome tech doctor?

154
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,239
Speaker 0: I don't know a way to find an awesome tech doctor.

155
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,740
Speaker 1: How do you find one?

156
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,559
Speaker 0: Friends, any of you in New York, who is your GP?

157
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,359
Speaker 0: I need a rea- Like Dave, Dave, you have to have a doctor in New York and I trust you.

158
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,200
Speaker 1: I've been- I went to the awesomest doctor when I first moved here.

159
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,100
Speaker 1: It was near my office.

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,679
Speaker 1: It was like the best doctor ever.

161
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,100
Speaker 0: You used to talk a lot about that doctor.

162
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,700
Speaker 1: And I went to him like once and then I got a letter like a few weeks later like, yep, awesome doctor is now the director of some awesome hospital in Florida.

163
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:46,458
Speaker 1: See ya.

164
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:51,640
Speaker 1: I guess I could go to that same office and try to find a doctor in the same office.

165
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,839
Speaker 1: If that office is still there, it was like NYU something something.

166
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:57,320
Speaker 1: It wasn't near NYU, it was up near my office.

167
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:01,960
Speaker 0: So in the news, you might've noticed that we didn't put up an episode on Tuesday.

168
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:03,657
Speaker 0: It's because I fucked up.

169
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:10,940
Speaker 0: So we have lost a grand total in all the years, 10 years of doing geek nights, well over a thousand episodes.

170
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:18,520
Speaker 0: There are five episodes of geek nights where we sat for an hour and recorded and that is gone.

171
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,779
Speaker 1: You know what's really surprising though?

172
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,180
Speaker 1: If you look at like TV, how many TV episodes have been like lost?

173
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,100
Speaker 1: I mean, sometimes South Park didn't get their episode in on time, but they never lost one as far as I know.

174
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,980
Speaker 1: They never had like starred over and reanimated everything.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,780
Speaker 0: There's like tons of Doctor Who episodes.

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,700
Speaker 0: Like literally no human could ever watch these.

177
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:37,200
Speaker 0: They're gone.

178
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,079
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but I mean in recent times.

179
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Speaker 0: Oh, oh yeah.

180
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,560
Speaker 1: Like there's no lost Seinfeld or Simpsons.

181
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 1: Like those people are backing everything up and doing it right somehow.

182
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:50,220
Speaker 1: So whatever they're doing to never ever fuck up, we should also do to never ever fuck up.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,278
Speaker 0: So the problem was complacency because you know, we way back, like we had to fuck up like we lost an episode and I was like, oh, okay.

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:05,198
Speaker 0: Cause you cannot do an hour of like conversation and then replicate that immediately after just having done it.

185
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,680
Speaker 1: Like if your show was scripted, it's like, well, okay.

186
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,679
Speaker 1: Like John Stewart has to do daily show again.

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,704
Speaker 1: He can.

188
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,580
Speaker 0: or like we watched that John Hodgman thing.

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,319
Speaker 0: They did the same bit like 15 fucking times.

190
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:16,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,997
Speaker 0: We just had to sit there and watch it.

192
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,820
Speaker 0: But uh, so way back then I was like, we're never fucking this up again.

193
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,679
Speaker 0: I bought like the $600 Marantz and I like set up this whole side stream and it saved us like three or four times.

194
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,638
Speaker 0: And then it didn't happen again for a long, long, long, long time.

195
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:37,800
Speaker 1: Every few months or so I'd look at the Marantz and if it wasn't on, I'd be like, hey rim, why isn't that backup Marantz on?

196
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:38,739
Speaker 1: Why aren't you backing up?

197
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,614
Speaker 0: And I'd be like, oh shit.

198
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
Speaker 1: What if it fucks up right now?

199
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,680
Speaker 0: And I'd be like, oh shit.

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 0: And I'd turn it on.

201
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,658
Speaker 1: No, sometimes you turn it on and sometimes you do not turn it on.

202
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,240
Speaker 0: Back then I'd be like, oh shit.

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,878
Speaker 0: And I'd turn it on.

204
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,660
Speaker 0: But as more time when I'd say, eh, it'll be fine.

205
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,619
Speaker 1: And I'd be like, really?

206
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,079
Speaker 1: Well, it's going to fuck up.

207
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,179
Speaker 1: Maybe you should turn it on.

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,740
Speaker 0: So this has, it's been years, like years since we've had a problem because one software got better.

209
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:10,520
Speaker 0: Like nowadays, like if my computer crashes or the power goes out, these files are on the hard drive on my computer already.

210
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,520
Speaker 0: Like they're, they can't be lost by those kinds of things.

211
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,380
Speaker 1: You're not using ReSound.

212
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,720
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

213
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,300
Speaker 0: Those days.

214
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:25,220
Speaker 0: I should do a show and talk about if I ever need to do a show, like without you, like we'd like you're out of town or something.

215
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:29,900
Speaker 0: I'll just explain what our pipeline was in like the seven different eras of geek nights.

216
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,731
Speaker 1: Seven eras.

217
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,118
Speaker 0: Cause there was a pipeline that involved me sitting for like three fucking hours, editing a show by hand.

218
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:41,359
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it has not happened in a long, long, long, long, long, long time.

219
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Speaker 0: And on Tuesday when we recorded the show, not only did it fuck up, but it fucked up in a way that I had never even imagined possible.

220
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,500
Speaker 0: So we do the show and I monitor the show.

221
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,120
Speaker 0: Like I look at the mixer, I see all the levels, like while I'm talking the whole time, both on the mixer and an audition.

222
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:06,280
Speaker 0: And I see the wave form is being written, which pretty much meant everything's fine.

223
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,040
Speaker 0: It's not clipping.

224
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:08,260
Speaker 0: I see things being written.

225
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,319
Speaker 0: Those are on my hard disk.

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,700
Speaker 0: So we finished the show and it's a really, really good show.

227
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,780
Speaker 0: I think like I was a really good geek nights.

228
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,336
Speaker 0: Okay.

229
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,851
Speaker 0: And then you think everything is few out.

230
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,340
Speaker 0: now we've had some shit episodes.

231
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,140
Speaker 0: So then a few hours go by and I'm ready to go to bed.

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,554
Speaker 1: Like this one.

233
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,800
Speaker 0: Oh, so I go to like do the edit of the show.

234
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,960
Speaker 0: Like I cut a couple of things.

235
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,398
Speaker 1: Should I not say, Oh, is that too morning radio show guy?

236
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:32,420
Speaker 0: Hey, no.

237
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,800
Speaker 0: Cause I think it's, I think it's ironic at this point.

238
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,145
Speaker 1: Okay.

239
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,706
Speaker 1: Sometimes it just comes out.

240
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:45,837
Speaker 0: So, you know, this is as a side, when I got geek nights back up on iTunes, I was reading those old reviews of us.

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,760
Speaker 0: Multiple people said the same thing.

242
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,397
Speaker 0: Different ways.

243
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:50,478
Speaker 1: What did they say?

244
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,420
Speaker 1: Their complaint was the same person writing a bunch of different reviews.

245
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,760
Speaker 0: These reviews are actually like one, like two are on iTunes.

246
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,900
Speaker 0: One was somewhere else.

247
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:57,960
Speaker 0: They were very different.

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,901
Speaker 0: Their complaint was we sound too professional and we sound like people on the radio and like.

249
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:10,280
Speaker 0: we're too high energy and loud and always talking and there's no pauses or breaks.

250
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,758
Speaker 0: And it sounds too fake.

251
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:16,200
Speaker 1: Well, cause we don't have music or ads to break it up.

252
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,399
Speaker 1: It's too, what do you want?

253
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,420
Speaker 0: Their complaint was we needed to sound more like awkward nerds.

254
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,520
Speaker 1: It sounded like you want us to sound like NPR was quiet.

255
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:28,799
Speaker 0: And then on geek nights, we're going to be talking about some things that have happened.

256
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,317
Speaker 0: But first Scott, Scott's got a story for you.

257
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:38,364
Speaker 0: Gonna pause in between rim story, my story and play a little like some slow jam to like, so, uh, yeah.

258
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,940
Speaker 0: So anyway, I hit play and I'm listening to the show, just like check a couple of things.

259
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,020
Speaker 0: And I hear like the intro play and everything.

260
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,177
Speaker 0: And then I hear robots yelling at me.

261
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:52,240
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

262
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,180
Speaker 1: I am the pusher robot.

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,456
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,899
Speaker 0: So I like, so long story short, I will push you down the stairs.

265
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,818
Speaker 0: I'd look her.

266
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:58,438
Speaker 0: I do.

267
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,320
Speaker 0: I like, I can't like, it's a weird problem.

268
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:06,120
Speaker 0: And I like my filters and we had just upgraded from the terrible secret of space.

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,399
Speaker 0: So I w I thought that maybe like my template for geek nights got messed up in the upgrade or something.

270
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:17,297
Speaker 0: So I check all the effects racks and eventually I turn off all the effects as the problem is still there.

271
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:30,019
Speaker 0: So then I opened the raw wave file and I zoom in and then I see, I'm not going to go into detail beyond this, but I will link to an analysis of what happened, but she went down in the wave file.

272
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,879
Speaker 0: And thanks to our good friend, Tracy, who helped me.

273
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:34,640
Speaker 0: It's a good thing.

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,940
Speaker 1: We know so many experts at various things.

275
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,160
Speaker 0: Yes, because I'm an expert at audio, but I'm not a great developer.

276
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:44,179
Speaker 0: I also have not written Python code in a long time.

277
00:14:45,021 --> 00:15:02,520
Speaker 0: And me fucking around with the wave library and Python is not the most efficient thing in the world, but, uh, Tracy helped me out and removed the repeated segments of 71 null samples that were occurring every like 800 ish samples in the files.

278
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:14,039
Speaker 0: And I had to do a bunch of more work, but the last episode of geek nights from Tuesday will have some audio issues, but will be intelligible and listenable and is going to be up probably this weekend.

279
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:22,940
Speaker 1: Probably put a non horrible disclaimer in the front, like just so you know, this episode might sound really painful to your ears.

280
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,197
Speaker 1: If it does, just stop it.

281
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,899
Speaker 1: Don't listen to it.

282
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,179
Speaker 0: Because we don't want to turn people off because this is the episode where we talk about Wil Wheaton being kind of an asshole at length.

283
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:42,820
Speaker 0: So I suspect, much like how the Go community found our Go is a bad game video recently, I suspect the Wil Wheaton community might find that episode of geek nights.

284
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:49,700
Speaker 1: And we're just saying mostly the same stuff as everyone else, but then adding in the extra stuff about no one knowing how to read board game rules.

285
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:50,360
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

286
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,999
Speaker 0: That part, I think, is going to anger more people.

287
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:52,620
Speaker 1: Maybe.

288
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,099
Speaker 0: Maybe the guy who wrote Hellas will talk to us.

289
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,573
Speaker 0: No.

290
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,320
Speaker 0: So you got some news?

291
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Speaker 1: Yes, I do have some news.

292
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:08,880
Speaker 1: So obviously, you know, something we've known for a long time is that if you put out a Confederate flag in a sincere fashion, you're a bad person.

293
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,140
Speaker 0: Pretty much straight up.

294
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,400
Speaker 1: And the Confederate flag symbolizes racism and wanting slaves.

295
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,899
Speaker 0: There is no debate about that.

296
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: Also, people don't know history.

297
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,140
Speaker 1: They think the Confederate flag is the flag of the Confederacy.

298
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:22,639
Speaker 1: It's not.

299
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,199
Speaker 1: It's the flag of General Lee.

300
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,400
Speaker 1: The actual Confederate flag looked a lot more like an American flag.

301
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,915
Speaker 0: Well, like people like to this day, a lot of people think that the Confederate government used the Articles of Confederation because there's no.

302
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,520
Speaker 1: that was something that happened before he made the Constitution.

303
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,059
Speaker 1: And we were like, oops, that didn't work.

304
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:40,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

305
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,139
Speaker 1: Let's make the Constitution.

306
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,176
Speaker 1: And the Confederacy was like, you know, we kind of like the shitty.

307
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:48,840
Speaker 1: way better than that was already proven not to work.

308
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,507
Speaker 1: Similar to that.

309
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,200
Speaker 0: No, what the Confederacy actually did.

310
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,440
Speaker 0: You don't even know the full story here.

311
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,739
Speaker 0: What they actually did.

312
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,663
Speaker 0: And it's so.

313
00:16:56,084 --> 00:17:01,840
Speaker 0: it would be funny if it wasn't so sad and so tied to one of the most tragic chapters in American history.

314
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,540
Speaker 1: Every chapter of American history is tragic.

315
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:05,438
Speaker 0: We got some good ones.

316
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,659
Speaker 0: OK, we got some good things happen a couple of times.

317
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,184
Speaker 1: So even when we were going to the moon, people were aiming nukes at us, but they didn't launch them.

318
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,818
Speaker 0: We didn't launch them.

319
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,500
Speaker 0: So the Confederacy took the real U.S.

320
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:29,120
Speaker 0: Constitution, copied it with some errors, like copied the whole thing, changed a couple of bullshitty things that didn't matter for no reason just to be different.

321
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,360
Speaker 0: So like instead of a president that have two terms of four years, you can your president is six years, but they can only have one term.

322
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,160
Speaker 0: And then they added and slavery to fucking everything.

323
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:46,740
Speaker 0: They just added all these clauses saying slavery is a God given right.

324
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,280
Speaker 0: Slavery is like an unalienable right.

325
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,419
Speaker 0: Slavery cannot be removed from this from any state.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
Speaker 0: Slavery, slavery, slavery, slavery, slavery.

327
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:04,480
Speaker 1: So all those people who are really don't know history, including one of my history professors at RIT who taught the you have to take this class senior year just to make a requirement.

328
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:12,940
Speaker 1: It's mostly a freshman high school history class who say things like, oh, yes, the Civil War was actually about state rights, economic something.

329
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,519
Speaker 0: John Green said it best.

330
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,040
Speaker 0: A state's right to what slavery?

331
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:22,020
Speaker 0: Oh, there's one other thing they changed, which is extra hilarious.

332
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:34,700
Speaker 0: They added a whole section that basically says you cannot use tax dollars on the federal level or from any one state to help another state with anything.

333
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,334
Speaker 1: We could use that.

334
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,699
Speaker 1: I'm down with that rule.

335
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:37,875
Speaker 0: So bring it.

336
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:38,999
Speaker 1: Bring that rule.

337
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,433
Speaker 1: Yeah.

338
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,060
Speaker 0: See what happens, Texas.

339
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,939
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens in Nebraska.

340
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,920
Speaker 1: How are you doing, Nebraska?

341
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,835
Speaker 0: Actually, Texas is pretty much the only red state.

342
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,399
Speaker 0: that would be OK.

343
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,200
Speaker 1: I'm just saying Nebraska.

344
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,118
Speaker 0: Nebraska not looking so hot like that.

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Speaker 0: Mississippi.

346
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:54,580
Speaker 1: What you doing down there?

347
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,398
Speaker 1: You make anything?

348
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,779
Speaker 1: You got Econ going on.

349
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,644
Speaker 0: But yeah, we're.

350
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 0: I mean, we could do a whole show on this stuff.

351
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,139
Speaker 1: Is there even a business in Mississippi?

352
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,720
Speaker 1: But it's not like a liquor store.

353
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:07,360
Speaker 0: Mississippi is probably the worst state in the union.

354
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,157
Speaker 1: Maybe.

355
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,039
Speaker 0: But anyway, don't worry.

356
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,139
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into all this.

357
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,273
Speaker 0: Like we could do a whole hour.

358
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,400
Speaker 1: The actual news is that Apple and many other businesses have decided to get rid of and states do finally are getting rid of Confederate flags, which is good.

359
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a. it's a great thing in my opinion.

360
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,580
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I guess it's still OK to watch Dukes of Hazzard, but it's not that great show anyway.

361
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,460
Speaker 0: I don't know why you would, but it was kind of like Robin Hood with cars.

362
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,457
Speaker 0: I liked it as a kid.

363
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:33,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe whatever.

364
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:37,820
Speaker 1: But anyway, Apple went all out and was like, you know what?

365
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,552
Speaker 1: We're just anything with the Confederate flag in.

366
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:40,720
Speaker 1: it is banned from the app store.

367
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,080
Speaker 1: They just removed every single app that had that image in it anywhere.

368
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,000
Speaker 1: And it's like, wait a minute.

369
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:53,120
Speaker 0: Now, that would be fine if it weren't for the fact that most of the apps that have that image in it are civil war, like war simulation.

370
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure that somewhere it's being used racistly in the app store, but you didn't even take the time to actually look at each app.

371
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,720
Speaker 1: And it's like, dude, that's just like grog nard war game in there.

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,168
Speaker 1: I mean, what if the board game store?

373
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:14,300
Speaker 1: I mean, if I was at the board game store and they had a game that was like, you know, keep slaves on purpose and had Confederate flags on it and be like, yeah, listen, I'm not putting that game on my shelf.

374
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:15,039
Speaker 1: I'm a game store.

375
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Speaker 0: But if it's north and south, the Battle of Gettysburg or north and south, the NES game.

376
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,697
Speaker 1: It's like, well, yeah, I mean, you play Wolfenstein 3D.

377
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,680
Speaker 1: It has Nazi swastikas in it.

378
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,564
Speaker 0: And I know there's.

379
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,839
Speaker 1: that's different from kill all the Jews the game.

380
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,298
Speaker 1: Which has Nazi swastikas in it.

381
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,760
Speaker 1: Now you have to, you know, use your judgment.

382
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,560
Speaker 1: And instead of, you know, I know a lot of you always cry censorship when it's not.

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,940
Speaker 1: And this isn't because it's Apple, but it's still stupid.

384
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Speaker 1: So Apple completely, it's like if you have a forum and you're trying to ban bad people from the forum and you end up banning perfectly good people from the forum.

385
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,019
Speaker 1: It's like, why did you do that?

386
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,355
Speaker 0: Yep.

387
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,620
Speaker 0: Now here's the problem.

388
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,300
Speaker 0: So there's a bunch of updates to the story.

389
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:04,980
Speaker 0: Apple just pulled literally everything that has any image of the Confederate flag, which is a completely stupid thing to have done.

390
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,396
Speaker 1: Pretty dumb.

391
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
Speaker 0: But the update I see here is quote, this is from the Touch Arcade article.

392
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,780
Speaker 0: We have an official update from an official Apple statement regarding the removal of games.

393
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,900
Speaker 1: If you reapply, they'll actually take a look.

394
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:25,760
Speaker 0: Specifically, Apple states that we have removed apps from the app store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean spirited ways, which is a violation of our guidelines.

395
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,099
Speaker 0: Now, obviously I'm just me again.

396
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:32,599
Speaker 0: That's bullshit because they removed games like ultimate general Gettysburg.

397
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,700
Speaker 1: Which is not offensive in any way unless you really hate any war games.

398
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,540
Speaker 0: I mean, if you hate war.

399
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,820
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's offensive to someone, maybe someone who is actually Confederate and thought the Confederate would win.

400
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,220
Speaker 1: They're upset that they lost.

401
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,719
Speaker 1: They don't want to be reminded that the North is going to kick their ass.

402
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,719
Speaker 0: So sources, this is not an official thing.

403
00:21:53,121 --> 00:22:03,948
Speaker 0: Close to Apple say that actually they're working to find all the apps that are good and bring them back in, but they're still going to require the developers to remove or replace the Confederate flag.

404
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,460
Speaker 0: So Apple is still full of bullshit.

405
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,319
Speaker 1: Why would you remove the Confederate flag from a civil war?

406
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,020
Speaker 1: Serious war simulation, turn based strategy game.

407
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,939
Speaker 0: I think, uh, Maxims, how do I know?

408
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,618
Speaker 1: How do I know what the other team is?

409
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,940
Speaker 0: One of the developers of one of these games said it best.

410
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,429
Speaker 0: I'm quoting Maxims as off Spielberg.

411
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,018
Speaker 0: Schindler's list did not try to amend his movie to look more comfortable.

412
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,899
Speaker 0: So Apple, like, fuck you.

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,339
Speaker 0: What else can I say?

414
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,860
Speaker 0: This is, there is no way to spin this in the right way.

415
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,980
Speaker 0: And it looks like you're literally going.

416
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:46,080
Speaker 1: They're really just being lazy and not taking the time to, it's like, they'll take the time to look at your app to make sure it's not malware, but you won't take the time to look at all these apps to make sure they're not offensive.

417
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:51,300
Speaker 1: And if you were, if this was part of your policy, why didn't you enforce it when these apps are first submitted?

418
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,580
Speaker 1: I guess you didn't have a problem with the Confederate flag yesterday, but you do today.

419
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,240
Speaker 0: Are you, what if I have an app of historical political atlases through history?

420
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,060
Speaker 1: Sure.

421
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Speaker 1: And also, what if my app is flag search?

422
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,498
Speaker 1: You take a picture of flag and then I tell you what flag it is.

423
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:14,880
Speaker 0: What if my app has the Rhodesian flag in it?

424
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,697
Speaker 0: Are you gonna let that in?

425
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll bet you will.

426
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:19,739
Speaker 0: Rhodesian is funny.

427
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,040
Speaker 1: What if I have the Eritrean flag in there?

428
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,840
Speaker 0: Well, it's not funny.

429
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:31,992
Speaker 0: It's actually sad, but the Rhodesian flag is pretty much like, like if you said it was to see some of the Confederate flag, they're like your run of the mill racist or just a moron.

430
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,440
Speaker 1: Yep.

431
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:36,600
Speaker 0: But if they've got the Rhodesian flag out, that's like inside baseball racism.

432
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,520
Speaker 0: That's like racism as a hobby.

433
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,600
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Eritrea is basically North Korea only in Africa.

434
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,900
Speaker 1: What if I have a North Korean flag and I'm waving it?

435
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:45,540
Speaker 0: Yeah.

436
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,020
Speaker 0: What about, I mean, the Soviet flag?

437
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Speaker 1: I mean, it's basically worse than slavery in North Korea right now.

438
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,479
Speaker 1: They just have people in fucking camps.

439
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:01,219
Speaker 0: Now, I'm super glad that the rebel traitor flag is finally getting the disrespect it deserves across the United States.

440
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,320
Speaker 0: That is great.

441
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,240
Speaker 0: But seriously, Apple, like this is almost pathetic.

442
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:09,000
Speaker 0: Is this what happens when you don't have Steve Jobs anymore?

443
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,020
Speaker 0: Like rapidly making poor decisions?

444
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:12,097
Speaker 1: I don't know.

445
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,950
Speaker 0: And now things of the day.

446
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,429
Speaker 0: Scott gave me crap for being too cautious in between that little bit when I stopped to go back and make sure the show sounded good.

447
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

448
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:27,950
Speaker 1: We got the Marantz back.

449
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:30,989
Speaker 0: My audio hypochondrias is acting up.

450
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,289
Speaker 1: It sure is.

451
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,589
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day yesterday was, well, two days ago that'll be up this weekend was amazing.

452
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:40,190
Speaker 0: So I got a crappy thing of the day.

453
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:40,789
Speaker 0: It's not crappy.

454
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,670
Speaker 0: It's just it's sad.

455
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:54,086
Speaker 0: If you live in a city that is small or nice or normal and not a like giant global city of the world, your city might do things like movie nights and little fairs and food things that are free.

456
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,669
Speaker 1: And if they do, the worst part will be parking because there's probably not enough parking and everyone has cars there.

457
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,570
Speaker 1: So you'll probably have like a parking garage.

458
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,590
Speaker 1: They got to pay money to get in.

459
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:11,049
Speaker 0: Like in Providence, there's water fire night where they just like light all these giant braziers on the river and you just like walk along the water and there's music and food and it's great.

460
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:19,370
Speaker 0: In a place like New York, if something is free, you should avoid that area as though Ebola has broken out there.

461
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,710
Speaker 1: Unless it's something you really fucking want, in which case get there early.

462
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,329
Speaker 0: Or it's something so niche.

463
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,370
Speaker 0: Like it's sad to say hockey is like that.

464
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:34,730
Speaker 0: When we saw the hockey games live, it was not a problem, even though it was free, because as much as hockey is great, not that many people care about hockey.

465
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:45,630
Speaker 0: But this is a video for I apologize for the verticalness of it, but from the roof of a building in Bryant Park, Bryant Park is one of the best tiny parks in New York City.

466
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,249
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

467
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:54,349
Speaker 1: It's this big field of grass behind the library and you know, the library from Ghostbusters and underneath the grass is where they keep all the books.

468
00:25:54,971 --> 00:26:02,810
Speaker 1: So on top of that, because you can't really put a building foundation there because there's book storage, there's just a park on top of the library.

469
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,330
Speaker 0: I would eat lunch there like every day.

470
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,810
Speaker 0: It's just such a nice part.

471
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,110
Speaker 1: So it's just a big field of grass.

472
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,249
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can go on the grass.

473
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,849
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can't go in the grass.

474
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,390
Speaker 0: In fact, there's a wonderful day every year because the grass is closed until like a certain day in spring.

475
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:22,529
Speaker 0: And on that day, a bunch of schools bring a bunch of kids to the park and the kids all stand around the edge of the grass.

476
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:27,950
Speaker 0: And then they announce the field is now officially open and there's mad.

477
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,070
Speaker 1: The grass is so nice.

478
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:40,105
Speaker 0: You like it's the highest quality grass to watch the most delightful scene of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of like little kids run out onto this grass and do what kids do for like 20 minutes.

479
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,390
Speaker 1: And around the edge of the grass is all sorts of park shit.

480
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,870
Speaker 1: Chairs and restaurants.

481
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,709
Speaker 0: Ping pong tables.

482
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,950
Speaker 0: Also the nicest public bathrooms in all of New York City.

483
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,364
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

484
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,507
Speaker 0: You need to pee.

485
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:51,590
Speaker 1: Behind the library.

486
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,709
Speaker 0: So they do.

487
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,170
Speaker 0: There is a free movie night in Bryan Park in the summer.

488
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,749
Speaker 0: It's kind of a long standing thing.

489
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,361
Speaker 0: This is a video of what it looks like at 4 p.m.

490
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:05,430
Speaker 0: when they let people walk onto the grass.

491
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,553
Speaker 1: 4 p.m The sun doesn't go down this time of year until about 830.

492
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:11,070
Speaker 1: When's the movie?

493
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:12,388
Speaker 0: After dark.

494
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,970
Speaker 1: The sundown is at 830.

495
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,289
Speaker 1: Sunset.

496
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:32,189
Speaker 0: This video, the most amazing thing about it is that when they start running, it is less than 15 seconds until this motherfucker has a blanket so big you can see it from the sky filling literally the best possible spot.

497
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:33,889
Speaker 1: That guy's pro.

498
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy is pro.

499
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,249
Speaker 0: Someone interviewed that guy actually.

500
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,270
Speaker 1: Anything like this, like free concerts in Central Park.

501
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,790
Speaker 1: I'll be biking through the park.

502
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,269
Speaker 1: I'll see a huge line of people.

503
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,170
Speaker 0: The Japanese Culture Festival?

504
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,170
Speaker 0: Stand in line for an hour to get one free Odongo.

505
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,210
Speaker 1: They got that right now.

506
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,130
Speaker 1: There's a recreation of Seinfeld's apartment.

507
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,869
Speaker 1: I think near Union Square.

508
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,589
Speaker 0: Someone already broke it.

509
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,130
Speaker 1: I know.

510
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,608
Speaker 1: I saw that.

511
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,650
Speaker 1: Union Square.

512
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,890
Speaker 1: That guy who broke it I think waited in line an hour to go in there and Kramer the door just once.

513
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,109
Speaker 0: You know when I'm gonna see that thing?

514
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,350
Speaker 0: Seven years from now, I don't think it'll be there.

515
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:09,429
Speaker 1: I'm not.

516
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,689
Speaker 1: Why should I need to go see it?

517
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,186
Speaker 1: Is it really?

518
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:12,807
Speaker 0: There's the problem, though.

519
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,370
Speaker 1: Do I need to get a Georgia sexy picture taken on one?

520
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,610
Speaker 0: So here's the problem.

521
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,048
Speaker 0: Things like that.

522
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:24,087
Speaker 0: If I could just be like, oh, hey, like I'm in the neighborhood, like walk up, see it and walk out.

523
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,867
Speaker 0: I would totally do.

524
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:25,329
Speaker 0: Sure.

525
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:26,590
Speaker 0: Those are idle amusements.

526
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,309
Speaker 0: That would be totally cool in New York.

527
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,189
Speaker 0: Those are things that you have to wait four hours to see.

528
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,870
Speaker 1: I mean, there are, you know, things vary in popularity, right?

529
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:40,587
Speaker 1: For example, during like the World Series, they'll set up like the Major League Baseball hangout place.

530
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,206
Speaker 0: Yeah.

531
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,169
Speaker 1: And it's like you could just fucking walk in there.

532
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,470
Speaker 1: It's not really a problem.

533
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,839
Speaker 1: There might be a crowded time or two, but for the most part, you can just walk right in.

534
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:52,249
Speaker 1: You know, those Hatsune Miku Expo, you can just walk right into that.

535
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:52,417
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,870
Speaker 0: Unless you went right when it opened.

537
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,488
Speaker 1: It'll be crowded, but you can just get in.

538
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:55,926
Speaker 1: Yeah.

539
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:04,730
Speaker 0: There won't be a line down the street, but anything that is popular and free or anything that is a sit down for a long time event without assigned seating.

540
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,129
Speaker 0: Or anything that has free food.

541
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,390
Speaker 0: Never go for free food.

542
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,888
Speaker 0: That's probably the worst thing you can ever go for.

543
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

544
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,190
Speaker 0: But yeah, this video is horrifying and amazing.

545
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:17,748
Speaker 0: You got to think of the day.

546
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,430
Speaker 1: Oh, think of the day.

547
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,190
Speaker 1: So in Brazil, this guy parked in a handicapped spot because he's a jerk.

548
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:31,089
Speaker 1: And I guess they knew that he wasn't handicapped, you know, because, A, his car didn't have the thing that says you're allowed to park there.

549
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:31,508
Speaker 1: Yup.

550
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:33,349
Speaker 1: B, they think they saw him get out of the car.

551
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,250
Speaker 1: And C, I think he's a repeat offender.

552
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,110
Speaker 1: So a whole mob of people decided to revenge on him for his bad.

553
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:42,539
Speaker 0: Yeah.

554
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:43,410
Speaker 0: Mob justice.

555
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,629
Speaker 1: To teach him a lesson.

556
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,729
Speaker 1: Why?

557
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,310
Speaker 1: Why would I say lesson in a French way in Brazil?

558
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,009
Speaker 0: How do you even know what a Portuguese accent sounds like?

559
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:51,839
Speaker 0: No.

560
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:52,627
Speaker 0: Okay.

561
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,789
Speaker 1: I definitely can't imitate one.

562
00:29:55,571 --> 00:30:00,753
Speaker 1: I might be able to pick one out of someone talking, but I definitely cannot even come close to.

563
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,350
Speaker 0: the proof that this guy is not handicapped is his reaction.

564
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:04,807
Speaker 0: I think.

565
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is so angry.

566
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:07,449
Speaker 1: It is great.

567
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,730
Speaker 1: Watch him and feel there is justice in the world somewhere.

568
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,830
Speaker 0: The best part is the crowd cheering the whole time.

569
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:14,365
Speaker 1: Yeah.

570
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:17,990
Speaker 0: And the fact that there's so many of them that he cannot easily get away.

571
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:19,250
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

572
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,049
Speaker 0: In a moment, the booklet book is the wheel of time.

573
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:23,350
Speaker 1: I read some more yesterday.

574
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,170
Speaker 1: I got to the, uh, the not dragon thing flying down.

575
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:30,850
Speaker 0: Oh, so they're getting, they're almost at, uh, whatever ferry, like the town.

576
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,609
Speaker 1: Oh, they got to the ferry.

577
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,369
Speaker 1: They're, they, they, they're messing with the ferry guy.

578
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,588
Speaker 0: Oh, the first time or the second time?

579
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,310
Speaker 1: Uh, we only knocked on the ferry guy's door.

580
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:38,809
Speaker 0: Okay.

581
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,370
Speaker 0: Let me know if you get to the point.

582
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,610
Speaker 1: Hey, ferry guy, we have gold.

583
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,769
Speaker 1: Make a ferry move.

584
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,199
Speaker 1: The moment when the ferry guy gets fucked is when I, is when I got it.

585
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,208
Speaker 0: Like that's me.

586
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,990
Speaker 0: That's where I am right now.

587
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,750
Speaker 1: He's going to steal his ferry.

588
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,449
Speaker 1: He gets fucked.

589
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,669
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he does.

590
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:54,609
Speaker 0: He deserves it too.

591
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,270
Speaker 0: I think probably.

592
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:55,969
Speaker 1: He doesn't seem nice.

593
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:56,606
Speaker 0: No, he doesn't.

594
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:56,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:59,870
Speaker 1: But I just get an Oregon trail feeling from this ferry.

596
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,989
Speaker 1: I hope it's not a shadow gay feeling from the ferry.

597
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:05,690
Speaker 0: It's not game of thrones.

598
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:06,509
Speaker 0: I think you're okay there.

599
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,429
Speaker 1: Castlevania ferry.

600
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,370
Speaker 0: I uploaded a ton of videos and I'm going to upload more this weekend after I fix our fucked episode from Tuesday.

601
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,487
Speaker 0: I have video.

602
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,689
Speaker 1: It's going to rain all weekend.

603
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,970
Speaker 1: We're going to get shit done, but mostly I'm going to clean my apartment.

604
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,450
Speaker 0: Yup.

605
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:27,830
Speaker 0: I'm going to spend one day doing sports and one day maybe trying to make a video version of Wil Wheaton's tabletop ourselves for a two player game.

606
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,530
Speaker 1: I'm going to spend cleaning my apartment and doing laundry and then we'll see how much time is left.

607
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,829
Speaker 0: I just bought a for real brand new studio light to augment all our other lights to like make this happen.

608
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,910
Speaker 1: A light bulb.

609
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:41,509
Speaker 0: I bought a many hundred dollar light bulb.

610
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,233
Speaker 1: Wow.

611
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,629
Speaker 1: Good choice of money spending by you.

612
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:46,747
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

614
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,229
Speaker 0: We're the kinds of people who get excited about things like lights and furniture, which is proof that we are adults.

615
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,069
Speaker 1: I'm not excited about furniture really.

616
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:58,950
Speaker 0: I am, except I can't even afford the kind of furniture I want.

617
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,270
Speaker 0: So yeah, I guess furniture.

618
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:06,090
Speaker 1: We came up with this show idea because we're literally out of show ideas.

619
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,669
Speaker 0: I had some other ideas, but Scott did not like them.

620
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,409
Speaker 0: So we went with this.

621
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,969
Speaker 0: Like what?

622
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,288
Speaker 0: Let me look at the chat.

623
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,950
Speaker 1: Let's just talk about furniture instead.

624
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,470
Speaker 0: Okay.

625
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,470
Speaker 1: So you have furniture in your house.

626
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,110
Speaker 1: You need it to be comfortable.

627
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,249
Speaker 0: Here's the phases of furniture in your life.

628
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:25,649
Speaker 0: You have whatever furniture your parents had and there's always like the couch you're allowed to sit on or something.

629
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:33,950
Speaker 0: Then you go to college and there's only two options for, well, three options for college.

630
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,670
Speaker 0: Your parents are rich and they buy you a bunch of furniture.

631
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,310
Speaker 1: You take the old furniture from your parents' house.

632
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,930
Speaker 0: That they wanted to get rid of for their entire lives.

633
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,929
Speaker 1: And they buy new stuff.

634
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:43,398
Speaker 0: Yup.

635
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,190
Speaker 0: Or you go to college.

636
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,369
Speaker 1: So you're still stuck with your parents' furniture.

637
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,730
Speaker 0: Or you go to college without furniture.

638
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:50,749
Speaker 0: Those are the three options.

639
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:57,910
Speaker 0: We were kind of lucky in that when we went to RIT, Scott had a bunch of nice furniture, like that big table and everything.

640
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,508
Speaker 0: Remember the table?

641
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,970
Speaker 1: That table wasn't nice.

642
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,990
Speaker 1: That was the old kitchen table from my parents' kitchen.

643
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

644
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,270
Speaker 1: And then we learned- That they replaced just like we said.

645
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,049
Speaker 0: But then we learned how expensive fud tables are.

646
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:11,570
Speaker 1: But I brought because- That was my childhood kitchen table.

647
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:17,870
Speaker 0: So my family had a bunch of tons of extra furniture because we had like a living room, family room, like all in a big giant house.

648
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,389
Speaker 0: So I brought a couch, a loveseat.

649
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:21,981
Speaker 0: A giant La-Z-Boy.

650
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,029
Speaker 0: that was also a bed.

651
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:24,350
Speaker 0: A piano.

652
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:25,770
Speaker 0: A wine cabinet.

653
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,108
Speaker 0: A bunch of dressers.

654
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,810
Speaker 0: So I remember very distinctly this time when we were in Colony.

655
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,809
Speaker 0: We lived there for a couple of weeks.

656
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,470
Speaker 0: And I was wandering around the neighborhood at night.

657
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:36,448
Speaker 0: Just wandering around.

658
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,127
Speaker 0: Because I was kind of still like, "Oh my God, I'm in college in an

659
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:39,510
Speaker 0: apartment.".

660
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:41,869
Speaker 0: And I was looking in people's windows.

661
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:48,210
Speaker 0: And I saw that most people had either no furniture or cinder block furniture.

662
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:54,269
Speaker 0: Like a lot of people had lawn chairs at card tables with computers on them.

663
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:56,929
Speaker 0: And then I saw our apartment through the window.

664
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,230
Speaker 1: We had desks that we bought.

665
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had real desks.

666
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,728
Speaker 1: Purchased desks.

667
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,890
Speaker 0: We had a piano and a wine cabinet.

668
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:07,289
Speaker 0: Real couches.

669
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,708
Speaker 0: A coffee table.

670
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,909
Speaker 0: Like our apartment looked like an actual apartment that humans lived in.

671
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,529
Speaker 1: I mean it was still a college apartment very much.

672
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,549
Speaker 1: But we had real furniture in there.

673
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,870
Speaker 0: I really enjoyed that time as a result.

674
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:21,897
Speaker 0: Yup.

675
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,129
Speaker 0: And in fact that furniture privilege was...

676
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,389
Speaker 1: In fact the bed that I had I bought at a store near RIT.

677
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,510
Speaker 0: I remember when you got that bed.

678
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,509
Speaker 0: Meanwhile I brought this gigantic fucking queen size bed.

679
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,389
Speaker 1: From your parents.

680
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:36,900
Speaker 0: Yup.

681
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,830
Speaker 0: That I still have with the same mattress.

682
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,290
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about replacing the mattress.

683
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,330
Speaker 1: I'm still using the same bed since the first day of college.

684
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,330
Speaker 0: It's a really nice bed.

685
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,208
Speaker 0: In fact remember when I replaced all the slats?

686
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,270
Speaker 0: I bought those super nice slats.

687
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,949
Speaker 0: I spent a lot of money on those slats.

688
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:50,418
Speaker 1: Wood.

689
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,550
Speaker 1: Just cost that much money.

690
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,228
Speaker 0: Good wood.

691
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,047
Speaker 1: Good wood.

692
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:53,827
Speaker 0: But uh...

693
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,449
Speaker 1: Rim likes wood.

694
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,348
Speaker 0: I'm actually at the point.

695
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,629
Speaker 0: The problem is...

696
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,469
Speaker 1: Rim pays a lot for wood.

697
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it.

698
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,550
Speaker 0: I'm much a fan of wood.

699
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,250
Speaker 1: Rim will pay a lot of money for good wood.

700
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,690
Speaker 0: We have a video of me and Scott at PAX South.

701
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,309
Speaker 0: Do you remember this?

702
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 0: Talking to a wood aficionado about the many different colors, sizes, shapes, and grains of wood.

703
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:11,727
Speaker 0: Yes.

704
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,470
Speaker 1: That he used for his dice towers.

705
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,270
Speaker 0: For his dice towers.

706
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,250
Speaker 1: Towers of wood.

707
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:16,950
Speaker 1: Wood towers.

708
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,908
Speaker 0: Tower wood.

709
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,709
Speaker 1: That he threw stones into.

710
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,143
Speaker 0: Yup.

711
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,050
Speaker 1: Two stones.

712
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,790
Speaker 0: I like Matt's idea of growing a bonsai tree to be a dice tower.

713
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,290
Speaker 1: That would be... If he does it, that would be incredible.

714
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,110
Speaker 0: That is the... That is the... That is a power artifact if that has ever happened.

715
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,728
Speaker 0: If that happens.

716
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:36,510
Speaker 1: Dude, any... You could not... You could not argue with the result of any die that emerges from that tower.

717
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,089
Speaker 0: So I really like my bed.

718
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,770
Speaker 0: But it's an old world bed.

719
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,730
Speaker 0: It's like this cherry oak thing with slats and a box spring and a mattress.

720
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,350
Speaker 0: There is modern bed technology.

721
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:59,190
Speaker 0: I kind of want a modern bed with like the integrated nightstand, the drawers of storage under it, the low form factor as opposed to the super high form factor.

722
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,510
Speaker 0: One modern mattress instead of a box spring and a mattress.

723
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:07,070
Speaker 0: But it's a pain in the ass to buy big furniture.

724
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:10,229
Speaker 0: And I got to figure out what to do with the old furniture and I want to just throw it away.

725
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:17,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, furniture's main problem is that it's not... Depending on the quality you get, it could be very, very expensive.

726
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,390
Speaker 1: And but mostly it's also just so big to move around.

727
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:23,310
Speaker 0: Which is not a problem in suburbia.

728
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,429
Speaker 0: It's only a problem for us.

729
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,078
Speaker 1: Yeah.

730
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,070
Speaker 1: And the thing... You're talking about stuff like storage, right?

731
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,050
Speaker 1: It's like if you live in a house, you don't care about under bed storage.

732
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,910
Speaker 1: You have enough room that you don't need to cram stuff into every little space.

733
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,530
Speaker 1: But when you live in an apartment, you need to use every single square inch of air to store things.

734
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:46,030
Speaker 1: Even if you minimize things, you still are going to need more space to put things.

735
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,660
Speaker 0: I got 14-foot ceilings.

736
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,930
Speaker 0: Look, you should see how vertical my desk is and how much shit is up there.

737
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,810
Speaker 1: And it could be even more vertical.

738
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,909
Speaker 1: There's a white space out there.

739
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:54,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

740
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,449
Speaker 0: If I own this apartment, there'd be a fucking loft bed up there.

741
00:36:59,193 --> 00:36:59,338
Speaker 1: Why not?

742
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,096
Speaker 1: Yeah.

743
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:01,690
Speaker 1: Is that even legal?

744
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:03,310
Speaker 0: Sure.

745
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,310
Speaker 1: Whatever.

746
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,570
Speaker 0: Don't really care.

747
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:06,910
Speaker 0: I would have done it anyway.

748
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,070
Speaker 0: I only didn't do it because I'm renting this place and I'd have to undo it if and when I move.

749
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:20,430
Speaker 1: But yeah, so when you go to IKEA and you see all those crazy furnitures that are like storing stuff in weird places and having extra hidden compartments.

750
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,910
Speaker 0: That's for city people.

751
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,807
Speaker 1: That's for city people.

752
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,590
Speaker 0: The problem with IKEA is that IKEA stuff tends to not survive ever being moved once.

753
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:39,429
Speaker 1: I mean, IKEA stuff is really well designed and it's easy to get delivered because it comes apart and you put it together, which makes so you don't like worry about getting it up the elevator, up the stairs or anything like that, which is great.

754
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:44,350
Speaker 1: But it's made cheaply like the wood is not highest quality wood.

755
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,330
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, solid cherry, whatever.

756
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:47,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

757
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,089
Speaker 0: Like I had a big IKEA desk and I went to move it.

758
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,390
Speaker 1: It's not a bonsai tree grown into the shape of a couch, right?

759
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,630
Speaker 0: It literally just fell apart into rubbish.

760
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,049
Speaker 0: Like it was a pile of rubble.

761
00:37:58,913 --> 00:37:59,830
Speaker 1: Like you can't move it.

762
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,030
Speaker 1: I think if you take it apart and make it into a pile of boards.

763
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,330
Speaker 0: I tried to do that one.

764
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,729
Speaker 1: You could probably move it and reassemble it, but good luck.

765
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,650
Speaker 1: We're going to need the instructions to reassemble it.

766
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,287
Speaker 1: You threw those out.

767
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,409
Speaker 0: Oh, I tried to do that once.

768
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:11,388
Speaker 0: Problem is way worse.

769
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,170
Speaker 0: A lot of the piece, like the joining, you lost like one screw and you're done.

770
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,770
Speaker 0: No, the joining pieces had destroyed the inside parts of the wood they connected to.

771
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,489
Speaker 0: So once you took them out, you can never put them back in again.

772
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,228
Speaker 0: Fucked.

773
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,710
Speaker 0: Oh, well, like you couldn't put it back together.

774
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,310
Speaker 1: Cheap, right?

775
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,430
Speaker 1: To buy a quality furniture would cost more than twice the cost of the IKEA furniture.

776
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,970
Speaker 1: So re buying the IKEA furniture is not the end of the world.

777
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:37,930
Speaker 0: My philosophy is pretty much when I move all the IKEA stuff just gets thrown away.

778
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,690
Speaker 1: Well, I did move those IKEA Ivar shelves that my books, my bookshelf.

779
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:45,630
Speaker 1: Those are just pretty much like, that's like the most minimal furniture.

780
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,890
Speaker 1: It's like some pieces.

781
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,889
Speaker 0: I'm talking like computer desk.

782
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:49,950
Speaker 1: Exactly.

783
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:50,990
Speaker 1: Computer desk.

784
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,903
Speaker 1: Got to know if you'll make it.

785
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

786
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,990
Speaker 0: Computer desk was dicey enough.

787
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,430
Speaker 0: Even just installing in this apartment.

788
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,030
Speaker 1: Well, the computer desk I have now is actually really nice.

789
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:08,470
Speaker 1: The main problem with it is that it's IKEA, but the painted surface of it like basically peeled off and it's like, it's like, you know, it's got like some kind of coating on it.

790
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,410
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's wood with like some plastic shit and there's paint on the plastic.

791
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:13,260
Speaker 1: shit eroded away.

792
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,148
Speaker 0: The one thing it's an IKEA, but we got like the upper end IKEA.

793
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,790
Speaker 0: These are like all these chunks are like inch thick, solid wood.

794
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,510
Speaker 0: Like this is actually a for real sturdy.

795
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:28,610
Speaker 1: Imagine if like the black see like it's happening on the corners near yours, right?

796
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,568
Speaker 0: You know why it's happening there?

797
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,610
Speaker 0: Because I have this giant heavy ass microphone boom that I slam in this spot multiple times.

798
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,410
Speaker 1: Mine happens in the spot where I rub my wrists.

799
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,069
Speaker 0: Look, Emily's is the older one because we both have the exact same desk.

800
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,750
Speaker 0: Hers doesn't have any problems.

801
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,030
Speaker 1: She has a keyboard drawer.

802
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,949
Speaker 1: She's not putting her hands.

803
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,510
Speaker 0: I also have a keyboard drawer.

804
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:49,750
Speaker 1: Oh, see mine.

805
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,050
Speaker 1: I'm putting my hands up on the desk.

806
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,830
Speaker 0: When I look for a desk, keyboard drawer is like a deal breaker if it's not there.

807
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,156
Speaker 1: Really?

808
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:58,110
Speaker 0: I really like the keyboard drawer.

809
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,248
Speaker 1: I don't like the keyboard drawer.

810
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:00,810
Speaker 1: I like going up on the surface.

811
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,990
Speaker 0: I like the surface to be a lot higher than I should put my hands when I'm typing.

812
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:07,810
Speaker 0: And I want to type nice and low, lined up with my chair.

813
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:13,366
Speaker 0: And I like to pull the keyboard over my lap, but yet still have everything else be far away from me.

814
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,402
Speaker 0: I have a very, I am.

815
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:26,570
Speaker 0: I'm actually really kind of anally particular about the positioning of my hands, my feet, my mouse, my keyboard.

816
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,610
Speaker 1: I feel like that's a separate show though, right?

817
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,082
Speaker 1: That is.

818
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,489
Speaker 0: So let's skip that.

819
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,409
Speaker 1: So what other furnitures you got?

820
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,469
Speaker 0: Remember the kitchen table?

821
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:34,768
Speaker 1: Which one?

822
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:42,910
Speaker 1: The one that started out and that I grew up with or the one that's currently in my parents' Kitchen table is another thing that only matters to suburbanites.

823
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,450
Speaker 0: I really like having a really nice kitchen table.

824
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,210
Speaker 0: We moved to Beacon.

825
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,250
Speaker 0: We were like, ah, we need a kitchen table.

826
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,810
Speaker 1: There's so many times now I don't have a kitchen table and there's so many times where I want ones like play a board game on, eat dinner on, you know?

827
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,470
Speaker 0: Also a kitchen table is nice because they're like one big piece.

828
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,210
Speaker 0: They're really solid.

829
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,070
Speaker 0: They're really like, they're a fixture.

830
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,980
Speaker 0: They're always really fucking useful to have a big table, but, uh, can't do that in the city.

831
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,125
Speaker 1: There's nowhere to put it.

832
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:16,850
Speaker 0: Instead, I got a crate and barrel collapsing table, which is a, it's great because I can like pull it out and need a big table and put it away.

833
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,829
Speaker 0: We're not using it, but it's actually kind of a pain in the ass.

834
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:23,449
Speaker 0: Like to unfurl it is kind of a big to do.

835
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:24,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

836
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,062
Speaker 1: And so you got to move a bunch of shit out of the way and it's not a lot of room to sit around it.

837
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,410
Speaker 0: And it's nice, but it is not the solid rock of a kitchen table.

838
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,948
Speaker 1: You can't really like lean on it.

839
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:37,468
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest idea.

840
00:41:37,854 --> 00:41:38,770
Speaker 0: Also pretty expensive.

841
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:45,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, it works for our purposes, but it's the, it's the best choice for my life.

842
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,390
Speaker 0: It's not my preference.

843
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,630
Speaker 1: No, it's not ideal.

844
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,189
Speaker 0: My preference.

845
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,430
Speaker 0: Actually, I want a ship's table.

846
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,630
Speaker 0: If I owned an apartment, I would have a ship's table in the kitchen.

847
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,970
Speaker 1: What kind of table is a ship's table?

848
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,170
Speaker 0: A ship's table is on the ceiling.

849
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,069
Speaker 1: Isn't that where they put the maps?

850
00:41:59,650 --> 00:41:59,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

851
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,310
Speaker 0: It's on the ceiling flush with the wall or the ceiling, right?

852
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:08,127
Speaker 0: And you hit a button and it gets lowered down and hangs.

853
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,928
Speaker 0: So there's no legs, no legs.

854
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,189
Speaker 1: So doesn't it swing around?

855
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:16,110
Speaker 0: Make it really, really heavy.

856
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:16,908
Speaker 0: So it's stable.

857
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:19,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd be fine.

858
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:22,610
Speaker 1: I'd rather just have enough room to have a big old table.

859
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:27,708
Speaker 0: I would also rather, my ideal life is actually having, remember that house I bought and then didn't buy?

860
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,246
Speaker 1: My ideal life, a mansion on top of an apartment building in Manhattan that is somehow in a tropical area.

861
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,770
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh, Scott, you probably read that same Gothamist article I did about the people who live in a gigantic, basically cabin on the roof of a building in Manhattan.

862
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:41,525
Speaker 1: Really?

863
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,058
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,949
Speaker 0: It is, imagine the geek house, but twice as big.

865
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:48,229
Speaker 0: And then they have like a garden and a pool and all this stuff.

866
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:48,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

867
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:49,628
Speaker 0: It's huge.

868
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,190
Speaker 0: It's amazing.

869
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,148
Speaker 1: That's how rich people do.

870
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,109
Speaker 0: I would do anything.

871
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,309
Speaker 0: I would, I might turn evil to get that.

872
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,530
Speaker 1: Why don't you start a life of crime right now?

873
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:57,083
Speaker 1: Then you'll get it.

874
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,310
Speaker 0: It'd have to be a life of white collar crime.

875
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,990
Speaker 0: I got to rise higher through the ranks before I'm capable of that.

876
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,949
Speaker 1: You can do that right now.

877
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:03,669
Speaker 1: What's stopping you?

878
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,549
Speaker 0: I got to start.

879
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,769
Speaker 0: Go Joe Asami style.

880
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:06,604
Speaker 1: Do it.

881
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,250
Speaker 0: But yeah, ideally I'm a big fan of having purpose for like rooms with a purpose.

882
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,910
Speaker 0: Like this is the gaming room and it's like a coo-turd a hundred percent for gaming.

883
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:25,769
Speaker 0: And this is the eating room and this is the socializing room and this is the watching media room, but I will likely never be rich enough to have that.

884
00:43:26,082 --> 00:43:26,168
Speaker 0: No.

885
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,230
Speaker 0: So as a result, I have this collapsing kitchen.

886
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,709
Speaker 1: We can have that far, far away.

887
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:34,990
Speaker 0: But then when I still have the money to continue to do all the other things I like to do, because there's no jobs far, far away.

888
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:35,610
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

889
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:42,609
Speaker 0: So the funny thing was when I bought that table, Crate and Barrel does not sell collapsing chairs.

890
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:55,468
Speaker 0: So I would have, so if I'd bought the set, I would have had this table that I can collapse and put away and for like giant fucking chairs that just take up a bunch of space that you can't do anything about.

891
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:58,310
Speaker 0: So I ordered like collapsing chairs on Amazon.

892
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:58,800
Speaker 0: Hmm.

893
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:00,469
Speaker 0: They work okay though.

894
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,527
Speaker 0: They're not the worst.

895
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,650
Speaker 0: I have kind of gone for the minimal style.

896
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:13,550
Speaker 0: Like I tend to like things that are very minimal, sleek, dark colors, thin lines, as little ornamentation as possible.

897
00:44:14,055 --> 00:44:14,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

898
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:23,530
Speaker 1: I never really understood or like how like old people really fucking love ornate furniture, like couches with a pattern on the upholstery and really crazy ornate legs.

899
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,390
Speaker 1: And it's like, that shit belongs in a museum.

900
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:27,885
Speaker 1: That is not actually comfortable to sit on, right?

901
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,526
Speaker 1: It's like, you can't just plop down on that in front of the TV and eating food on it every day.

902
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

903
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,849
Speaker 0: Remember the golden compass where what's her name is?

904
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:42,629
Speaker 0: She comes to the modern world and she's like, you really sure this is a university because everything looks kind of gray and plain.

905
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,669
Speaker 0: That's not how universities work.

906
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:52,170
Speaker 1: But yeah, so I was like, you know, my couch is gray little rectangle.

907
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:55,090
Speaker 1: There's nothing exciting about how it looks, right?

908
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,250
Speaker 1: It's just fancy because the way it folds out and has a little storage.

909
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:00,690
Speaker 0: My desk is black and white.

910
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,660
Speaker 0: My chair black.

911
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,349
Speaker 0: The microphone booth.

912
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,770
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about interior design to not make everything as black as possible.

913
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:08,353
Speaker 0: Yup.

914
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:13,310
Speaker 0: But I like really, really minimalist design.

915
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,490
Speaker 0: Like my ideal furniture is really, really sleek and modern looking.

916
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:21,810
Speaker 0: And the problem is that's actually the most expensive furniture.

917
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,550
Speaker 0: Like I've gotten a few things.

918
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:26,108
Speaker 0: I like those lamps I have out there.

919
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:32,870
Speaker 0: They're like, they're like, I like that style a lot, but those things are like, lean on them the wrong way once and they'll just collapse into Ikea rubbish.

920
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,010
Speaker 1: There's a lot of like fancy furniture places or it's like designer furniture.

921
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,750
Speaker 0: I salivate walking past those places.

922
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:46,145
Speaker 1: It's like they have, you know, the same way that, you know, some people will walk past like the designer clothing store where it's like famous designers.

923
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:47,510
Speaker 1: name is the name of the store.

924
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,690
Speaker 1: They have like one dress and one suit that are like ten thousand dollars each.

925
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:51,410
Speaker 1: Right.

926
00:45:51,791 --> 00:46:04,230
Speaker 1: This furniture store is like, I know one of them is like Bo concept and then some other ones where it's like, maybe they're a chain, but really it's just ridiculously expensive, fancy designer furniture.

927
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:07,170
Speaker 1: Like you'll see in an apartment, in a movie or some shit.

928
00:46:07,774 --> 00:46:08,990
Speaker 1: It's like, man, I want that.

929
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I want a sunken living room and like ultra minimal.

930
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:16,949
Speaker 1: You walk down a couple of stairs to get down to the carpeted area.

931
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,189
Speaker 0: Bocurano, one of the characters, their apartment is like that.

932
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:23,810
Speaker 0: And I just as soon as I like, I remember I was watching the show and I paused it.

933
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,489
Speaker 0: I just looked at it.

934
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,749
Speaker 0: I was like, wow, my God, I want to live in this thing.

935
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:27,288
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

936
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:28,969
Speaker 0: See, we're old.

937
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,989
Speaker 0: This is what we care about now.

938
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,969
Speaker 1: The thing is, though, like couches, it seems to me like the pricing on a lot of couches is sort of backwards.

939
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,330
Speaker 0: The cheaper couches tend to be better.

940
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:38,598
Speaker 0: Yeah.

941
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,470
Speaker 1: I mean, people when they're charging a lot of money for a couch, it's usually leather.

942
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,868
Speaker 1: I see that as a negative because it gets all sticky when it's warm and whatnot.

943
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,750
Speaker 0: And if you if you like and you get it very easily, real expensive.

944
00:46:50,296 --> 00:46:51,630
Speaker 1: You know, you're living in this place.

945
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:52,669
Speaker 1: You're using this couch a lot.

946
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,207
Speaker 1: You're a nerd.

947
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:56,550
Speaker 1: You need a durable couch, not a easily ruined leather couch.

948
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,110
Speaker 1: Also, a lot of them are way too squishy.

949
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:00,110
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,208
Speaker 1: It's like I can't be doing something squishy.

951
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:02,889
Speaker 0: Yeah.

952
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:03,058
Speaker 0: Right.

953
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:09,450
Speaker 1: I need something that's like, well, really, it needs to be somewhat squishy to be comfortable, but a lot of them are like poof and you fall into it.

954
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,226
Speaker 1: It's beyond that.

955
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,770
Speaker 0: Most couches are just too bulky.

956
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,269
Speaker 0: They take up way too much space.

957
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,728
Speaker 1: Well, they're so poofy with air.

958
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:18,085
Speaker 0: Yep.

959
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,550
Speaker 0: But also like they have really, really wide armrests for no reason.

960
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:30,430
Speaker 0: And they tend to be really dense and heavy and have all this like extra stuff like the fold out bed and multiple recliners and like the L-shaped sectional.

961
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,908
Speaker 1: Well, the L-shaped sectional, right, is sort of a good thing because, number one, In suburbia.

962
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can get enough sections to match whatever room you've got.

963
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,650
Speaker 1: So as for the manufacturer, it's like, well, this one couch fits all rooms.

964
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,410
Speaker 1: You can just buy one little section and get your own.

965
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:48,387
Speaker 0: Ah, but that's such a plebeian style of interior design because that's the suburban.

966
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:49,860
Speaker 0: interior design is always the same.

967
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,860
Speaker 0: Every cover, every wall is shit, right?

968
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,420
Speaker 0: And there's nothing in the middle of the room except maybe a coffee table.

969
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,755
Speaker 1: Other thing is the L-shape allows you to have maximum seating where no one is as an obstructed view of the TV.

970
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,278
Speaker 1: Exactly.

971
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
Speaker 1: And but but you have lots and lots of seats.

972
00:48:07,282 --> 00:48:09,099
Speaker 1: You know, where are you going to put two couches?

973
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,040
Speaker 1: You know, one with a space in the corner.

974
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:15,218
Speaker 1: If you have a space in the corner with a coffee table, well, you just lost like two seats over there.

975
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:23,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, the L-shape allows you to get maximum seating all in, you know, no matter what shape your room is, usually rooms or squares or rectangles.

976
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:31,159
Speaker 0: But I guess what bothers me is that that kind of furniture assumes a big living room, not a fan or family room, really.

977
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:37,239
Speaker 0: Well, if you're from the United States Midwest, there's a there's a distinct difference between a family room and a living room.

978
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:41,319
Speaker 0: But I which is weird because the family room is the room that you live in.

979
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,140
Speaker 0: And the living room is the room with the furniture.

980
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:44,040
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to touch that.

981
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:50,032
Speaker 1: Also, you know, some of the features of the L-shaped couch, like the recliners at the end, it's like.

982
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:50,899
Speaker 0: that's not bad.

983
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:58,760
Speaker 1: It's better than having a recliner standing on its own, taking up a whole big area because it's got to spin freely.

984
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:03,180
Speaker 0: And I could not imagine even having a recliner of any kind in New York.

985
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,304
Speaker 0: Yep.

986
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,999
Speaker 0: But because we had this thing, we had this blue recliner, a proper lazy boy that I brought with us to RIT.

987
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,260
Speaker 0: That thing would barely fit in the geek night studio.

988
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:15,599
Speaker 0: It is so big.

989
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:17,759
Speaker 1: It would be like the only furniture in this room.

990
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,138
Speaker 0: It was so comfortable, though, is OK.

991
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,880
Speaker 1: I mean, people you could sleep in it if you really want to recline into a full bed.

992
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:25,787
Speaker 1: But it wasn't.

993
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:27,220
Speaker 1: it wasn't that comfortable.

994
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:28,332
Speaker 0: Well, it was.

995
00:49:28,353 --> 00:49:28,920
Speaker 0: I liked it.

996
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,379
Speaker 0: It was old.

997
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,139
Speaker 0: That was his problem.

998
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Speaker 0: But that style assumes that you have a room with a TV and the TV is the centerpiece of all interaction and that you will never put anything in the middle of the room, except maybe a coffee table.

999
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:47,119
Speaker 0: And you will put the couch at the edge of the room, filling all the walls.

1000
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:59,659
Speaker 0: Better interior design is to have a couch that might still be an L, but it's a chase at the end instead of just a sectional, because then you can lounge on it.

1001
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:04,479
Speaker 0: You can sit in multiple directions and you put that shit in the middle of the room.

1002
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:09,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much the one thing I learned from.

1003
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:12,400
Speaker 1: I didn't you know, I guess my furniture is mostly IKEA.

1004
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,399
Speaker 1: But, you know, I looked in the IKEA catalog and I was like, I want an apartment that looks like this, but I can't hire someone to come and do it for me.

1005
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:24,940
Speaker 1: But I'm looking and I'm like, you know, all these pictures in the IKEA catalog, it's they're always showing rooms full of so much stuff.

1006
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,580
Speaker 1: It's like, man, how do they get all this stuff in all these rooms?

1007
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:32,359
Speaker 1: They're obviously filling the rooms with stuff because they need to show as much stuff as possible in each picture to sell it.

1008
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:32,980
Speaker 1: Right.

1009
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,218
Speaker 1: They're not doing it because anyone should actually live like that.

1010
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,500
Speaker 1: But I realized, hey, in all these pictures, it's like they got shit.

1011
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,140
Speaker 1: You know, like my furniture arrangement used to just be put everything against the wall in the middle of the rooms empty because that's what we all grew up with.

1012
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:46,918
Speaker 1: I didn't know any better.

1013
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,802
Speaker 0: If you grew up in a house where like space is not necessarily at a premium, that's just like.

1014
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:53,520
Speaker 0: that's what all the furniture you will ever see.

1015
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,740
Speaker 1: But I looked at the pictures in the IKEA catalog.

1016
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,000
Speaker 1: I realized, hey, all of these pictures against the wall are shelves and the couch isn't against the wall.

1017
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,859
Speaker 1: The couch is in front of the shelves.

1018
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:09,020
Speaker 1: So my apartment, that's the one innovation I have is that the bookshelves are against the wall.

1019
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,877
Speaker 1: Then there's a space.

1020
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:11,138
Speaker 1: Then there's the couch.

1021
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:15,435
Speaker 1: And because of that, I can fit all those bookshelves in my apartment.

1022
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:20,180
Speaker 1: that otherwise if I put the couch up against the wall, I'd have more room in the middle of the room.

1023
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,940
Speaker 0: That's useless.

1024
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,929
Speaker 1: It might be a little bit more comfortable.

1025
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:27,040
Speaker 1: to like, you know, lay down on the couch or a little farther from the TV is a little nicer.

1026
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,259
Speaker 1: But where would I keep all these books?

1027
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:31,378
Speaker 1: Nowhere.

1028
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,660
Speaker 1: So because we have a much bigger apartment and it would look and looking at the couch, it would look way worse.

1029
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:44,780
Speaker 1: Just looking at me sitting on a couch with a white wall behind me with some art on it versus, you know, couch with bookshelf behind.

1030
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,920
Speaker 1: It actually looks sort of IKEA catalog.

1031
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, a little bit like Scott's apartment, like your apartment is actually pretty classy.

1032
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,659
Speaker 0: Not right now.

1033
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,299
Speaker 1: Right now it looks like a bomb hit.

1034
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,960
Speaker 0: The last time I visited it, it was very classy because you would probably cleaned it recently.

1035
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,359
Speaker 0: There's like garbage all over the sky.

1036
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:01,580
Speaker 0: Take heart.

1037
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,899
Speaker 0: Like you see my apartment now.

1038
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:03,460
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

1039
00:52:05,073 --> 00:52:05,720
Speaker 0: Two weeks ago.

1040
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,317
Speaker 0: That was not the case.

1041
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:08,779
Speaker 1: So bad right now.

1042
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:10,720
Speaker 0: I got I got right.

1043
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,960
Speaker 1: There was no point of such good interior decorating if you just make a big old mess.

1044
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:25,100
Speaker 0: So our apartment, because we have the bigger living room, what we did is we have the same couch as Scott with a chase L on the end, but it's against the back wall.

1045
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,520
Speaker 0: But the chase is not against the window wall.

1046
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,918
Speaker 0: It's actually step back from it to give a sense of space.

1047
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,777
Speaker 0: And then next to it to the right is another chase lounge that comes sticks out into the middle of the room.

1048
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,106
Speaker 0: So the L is really.

1049
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:45,760
Speaker 0: there's a U going into the middle of the room and then to complete the U into a full square.

1050
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:59,414
Speaker 0: If people come over and we're not just watching TV, then we pull out all the floor pillows and the ottoman and we all sit in a square looking at each other because we talk to each other.

1051
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,099
Speaker 0: It's not what it seems like happens at most people's houses in suburbia where everything's facing the TV all the time.

1052
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,839
Speaker 0: We actually put stuff between the TV and us unless we're using the TV.

1053
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,999
Speaker 1: And then the people turn around and look at the TV.

1054
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,799
Speaker 0: Well, because usually around 11 o'clock, someone puts on some gifts with sound and then we all get hypnotized.

1055
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,938
Speaker 0: And that is the end of the night.

1056
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:19,000
Speaker 1: Hypnotized.

1057
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:29,319
Speaker 0: Uh, I'm tired of shelves because I realized that if I have a big shelf, I put stuff on it never to be pulled off again.

1058
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:38,600
Speaker 1: Uh, I just don't like shelves that you mount to the wall because no matter how securely they are fastened to studs, they're going to fall.

1059
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:39,678
Speaker 1: They're not.

1060
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,479
Speaker 1: It's all right.

1061
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,720
Speaker 1: So I need shelves that stand on the floor and I only put books on them.

1062
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:47,380
Speaker 1: We're thinking about trying to clear them out as much as possible.

1063
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:56,840
Speaker 0: We're thinking of folding up the drafting table here because Emily doesn't use it that often and just putting big fucking shelves here and putting all the board games here out in the middle of the room instead of in the closet, instead of in the closet.

1064
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:02,379
Speaker 0: And then I'm going to put all the stuff I don't use that often in the closet and the stuff you don't use ever away.

1065
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,776
Speaker 0: And then anytime Emily needs to use this, the actual drafting table, how often does she use it?

1066
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:08,939
Speaker 0: Not that often on depends on what she's working on.

1067
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:14,592
Speaker 0: She'll just open it in the middle of the room and use it and then put it away when she's done.

1068
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:16,980
Speaker 0: So that's our strategy right now with this room.

1069
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,200
Speaker 0: Now that all that stuff under there can fit in the closet.

1070
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:22,559
Speaker 0: It can actually now.

1071
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,620
Speaker 0: It just couldn't before.

1072
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:24,798
Speaker 0: Also, we had a problem.

1073
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,840
Speaker 0: We accidentally bought way too much paper towel.

1074
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,740
Speaker 1: I can see this has happened.

1075
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,360
Speaker 1: Why didn't you accidentally buy too much toilet paper instead?

1076
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,280
Speaker 0: Those two problems were related and that is the result.

1077
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,839
Speaker 0: And we since fixed it, but we only solved half of the problem.

1078
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:41,619
Speaker 0: Well, no, we solved the full problem and we've been burning through that paper towel stash for like six months.

1079
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:42,900
Speaker 1: How about the toilet paper?

1080
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,040
Speaker 0: We have plenty of toilet paper.

1081
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:44,426
Speaker 1: Sure.

1082
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:45,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, we actually do.

1083
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,219
Speaker 1: Yes, one roll is not plenty.

1084
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,039
Speaker 0: There's way more than one roll.

1085
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:53,320
Speaker 1: I meant one rim roll, which is like three poops, which is three rolls.

1086
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,298
Speaker 0: I don't know why you're obsessed with the fact that I clean my asshole when I also clean my asshole.

1087
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,720
Speaker 1: It does not take me as much toilet paper to clean my asshole.

1088
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,080
Speaker 1: Is your poop really that dirty?

1089
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,600
Speaker 0: I suspect that you do not in fact clean your asshole that way.

1090
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,720
Speaker 1: You want to come look at my asshole?

1091
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,679
Speaker 0: You want to come look at mine?

1092
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,579
Speaker 0: Do we need to have a third neutral third party analyze them?

1093
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,412
Speaker 1: Fast man.

1094
00:55:13,225 --> 00:55:14,658
Speaker 0: Do you want to know what the problem is?

1095
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:16,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1096
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:17,398
Speaker 1: All right.

1097
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:20,679
Speaker 0: But like I'm sick of, you know what I'm really sick of?

1098
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,247
Speaker 0: Cheap shelves lining up the wall.

1099
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:32,019
Speaker 0: because we're like those like that, that one really tall Ikea bookshelf that every nerd is like four of next to each other bookshelf.

1100
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:32,410
Speaker 0: Yep.

1101
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,119
Speaker 0: I'm done with that.

1102
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:40,300
Speaker 1: Actually, I was a kid because we had the Ivar ones, which is sort of like more, you can just look them up online.

1103
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,618
Speaker 0: They're like industrially like, I like them.

1104
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,660
Speaker 0: That's a good kind of shelf, but they're just the VAR part.

1105
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,899
Speaker 1: And flexible and what you can do with them.

1106
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,719
Speaker 1: That's, that's the reason I have those.

1107
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:49,929
Speaker 1: Yep.

1108
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:51,380
Speaker 1: It's like, I need a manga shelf.

1109
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,519
Speaker 1: Let me put more shelves here.

1110
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,659
Speaker 1: Oh, this one has tall trades and is farther apart the books.

1111
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:05,468
Speaker 0: It's, it's barely furniture, but the one furniture item it's, it's, it's, it's either furniture or furnishing depending on the kind of house.

1112
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:12,440
Speaker 0: a kitchen has to have either an island or a butcher's block on wheels in the middle of the room.

1113
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,240
Speaker 1: I need the block on wheels.

1114
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:19,600
Speaker 1: Maybe someone who I've been asking to make me one could actually do that unless they're just shit talking, which case I should buy one.

1115
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,780
Speaker 0: Are you going to follow through and like literally bother them to work on it?

1116
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,340
Speaker 1: Listen, I've been bothering them and they're just like, why is it my job to bother them?

1117
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,319
Speaker 1: It's like, I just want, they're the ones I'm going to pay money to make it, make it.

1118
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:33,538
Speaker 1: I'll give you money.

1119
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,220
Speaker 1: I'm not, not serious.

1120
00:56:35,423 --> 00:56:36,560
Speaker 1: I am a hundred percent serious.

1121
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:38,840
Speaker 1: There is not no lack of seriousness.

1122
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,860
Speaker 1: Whoever I desperately need this article of furniture that I do not have.

1123
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,380
Speaker 0: What I really want, but again, I need to build it is above the island in my kitchen.

1124
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,260
Speaker 0: I want one of those big metal racks that chefs can hang all their pots and pans and things from.

1125
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,660
Speaker 1: I think you should just get the, uh, three baskets, the big basket, medium basket, and small basket that also hang like right on top of each other.

1126
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,900
Speaker 0: We had that for a long time.

1127
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,739
Speaker 0: It was a pain in the ass.

1128
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,859
Speaker 0: We put bananas in it.

1129
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,138
Speaker 1: That's what the bananas go.

1130
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,297
Speaker 0: I got rid of that thing.

1131
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:08,699
Speaker 1: That's what that's for.

1132
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:10,920
Speaker 1: I put my bananas like on top of microwave.

1133
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:13,439
Speaker 0: I put my bananas on top of bananas on top of the bread box.

1134
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,728
Speaker 1: Same thing.

1135
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:23,140
Speaker 0: For me, wine cabinet that also holds like all my fancy glassware is super important.

1136
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:23,818
Speaker 1: I don't need that.

1137
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:28,120
Speaker 0: No, Scott doesn't care about that, but I have the same wine cabinet that I've had forever.

1138
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:30,040
Speaker 0: That was like my parents.

1139
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:36,540
Speaker 1: I should get, I should get a barrel that you normally would put like beer in that has a tap and fill it with like apple juice.

1140
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,260
Speaker 0: Well, the reason you do that is because it's carbonated.

1141
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:43,699
Speaker 1: So you're saying the apple juice won't come out of the tap?

1142
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:46,980
Speaker 0: You know, I'm saying that you would do that if you wanted carbonated apple juice.

1143
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:48,940
Speaker 1: Just putting it in the barrel is going to carbonate.

1144
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,180
Speaker 0: Oh, you only, you're thinking like a wine barrel with like the bunghole.

1145
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,920
Speaker 1: You know, just a barrel that has a tap on the front.

1146
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,193
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1147
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,440
Speaker 0: I see.

1148
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,267
Speaker 1: I was imagining like, I'll take, I'll take a cold frosty mug out of the freezer and then right.

1149
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:01,828
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1150
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,179
Speaker 1: Like a Cooper's barrel with the two metal rings around it.

1151
00:58:04,463 --> 00:58:04,956
Speaker 1: It's sideways.

1152
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,599
Speaker 0: That can be pretty bad ass.

1153
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,459
Speaker 1: I just put it at an apple cider comes out.

1154
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,771
Speaker 1: Things that are not alcoholic will not keep in one of those.

1155
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,298
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't it keep?

1156
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:15,840
Speaker 0: Because it's warm.

1157
00:58:21,203 --> 00:58:22,297
Speaker 1: I'll put water in that.

1158
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:27,220
Speaker 0: So I do have a conundrum there because you know, like I want to get a new bed, but I have a really nice bed.

1159
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,679
Speaker 0: Those have been in my family for a long time.

1160
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,720
Speaker 0: The wine cabinets, the same thing.

1161
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,660
Speaker 0: It's this really nice cherry oak wine cabinet.

1162
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,460
Speaker 0: I've had for a long goddamn time.

1163
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,300
Speaker 0: I like family, family history.

1164
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:36,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1165
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,840
Speaker 1: Furniture is like this antique action that like other stuff doesn't have.

1166
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,680
Speaker 1: You got an old computer, you don't really.

1167
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,180
Speaker 1: It's like, Oh, I'll replace that shit.

1168
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:43,699
Speaker 1: It's no problem.

1169
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,960
Speaker 0: Like the other day I was in a crate and barrel cause like I needed a thing and I looked at like the modern wine cabinet they have.

1170
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,900
Speaker 0: It's not the best wine cabinet.

1171
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,120
Speaker 1: It's way better than the one you have though.

1172
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1173
00:58:51,380 --> 00:59:00,120
Speaker 0: It's like, I wouldn't buy that one, but that kind of wine cabinet, I really, really, really, really want and it would be perfect.

1174
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,659
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with the one you got.

1175
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:06,540
Speaker 0: And I don't want to just throw this away cause it's a really nice piece of furniture.

1176
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,140
Speaker 0: It'll be really hard and a pain in the ass to actually like sell it to someone.

1177
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,080
Speaker 1: Furniture is like so durable that usually there's nothing wrong with it.

1178
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,640
Speaker 1: It's like, just keep using it forever.

1179
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:22,080
Speaker 1: It'd be really, it's really hard for furniture to get to a point where it's like, it needs to be replaced from a couch, from a colony.

1180
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:23,463
Speaker 1: We threw away.

1181
00:59:23,544 --> 00:59:33,359
Speaker 1: either needs to get ridiculously dirty or broken while moving because it's not going to break just sitting there unless it's a couch and someone sits on it too hard or a bed and someone jumps on it too hard.

1182
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:43,639
Speaker 1: I told someone like when they, like they saw those, we were moving out of beak or a chair and someone sits on it too hard and they were like, why aren't you keeping the couch or table and someone bangs on it too hard or flips it too hard.

1183
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,160
Speaker 0: And all I said when they asked, why aren't you keeping the couch?

1184
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,559
Speaker 0: As I said, that couch is white.

1185
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:52,539
Speaker 0: And they looked at it and they said something to the effect of, yeah, you should burn that couch.

1186
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:55,700
Speaker 1: People do burn couches.

1187
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,259
Speaker 1: They're pretty flammable.

1188
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:02,239
Speaker 0: And so that has not happened to us in a long time.

1189
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:03,820
Speaker 0: All right.

1190
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,020
Speaker 0: I think we've talked enough about furniture.

1191
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,820
Speaker 0: Tell us your stories of wheel and woe related to furniture.

1192
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,560
Speaker 1: We don't know that much about furniture.

1193
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,118
Speaker 1: We know what the average person knows.

1194
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,920
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
