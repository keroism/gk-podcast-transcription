1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,608
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 14th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:10,929
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,879
Speaker 1: And I'm Emily.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,860
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,417
Speaker 0: Because Scott's a little baby who won't watch movies that came out within the last 40 or 50 years.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,020
Speaker 0: Emily and I saw Moana and we're reviewing that.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:36,690
Speaker 0: So for any of you who back us on the Patreon, this is Emily and I semi-regularly review all the stuff we watch and do that Scott just won't consume.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,230
Speaker 0: Like he hasn't seen Zootopia, he hasn't even seen Mad Max actually.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like when you recommend stuff, we're like, "Scott, you need to see this movie.

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,161
Speaker 1: We saw it without you.

11
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:46,769
Speaker 1: You should go see

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:46,870
Speaker 1: it.".

13
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,435
Speaker 1: He's like, "No.

14
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:48,849
Speaker 1: No, I don't want

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:48,930
Speaker 1: to.".

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,628
Speaker 0: Watch my hurry.

17
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:54,530
Speaker 1: But it's definitely movie season in our group of friends.

18
00:00:55,311 --> 00:01:01,659
Speaker 1: And part of the reason we've been seeing a lot of movies lately is Judith and Natalie were like, "Eh, let's go see Dr.

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,182
Speaker 1: Strange.

20
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:02,745
Speaker 1: Let's go see

21
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:03,188
Speaker 1: Moana.".

22
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,190
Speaker 0: Well, she needed to see the movie so she wouldn't feel conflicted about selling fan art about the movie.

23
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,779
Speaker 1: It's research, right?

24
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,006
Speaker 1: It's like, "Let's do

25
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:12,550
Speaker 1: research.".

26
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:23,769
Speaker 0: So normally these are just on the Patreon for the Geek Nights Patreon patrons right up there with Rims Rants where I talk about stuff like how I cut my finger open in the dumbest possible way the other day.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,910
Speaker 1: Oh no, did you do a Rims Rant about entering your finger?

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,411
Speaker 0: Of course I did.

29
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:32,690
Speaker 0: There are 17 Rims Rants and like 7 or 8 Rimmly reviews and this one is public.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,222
Speaker 0: But the one we're going to record pretty soon on Dr.

31
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:36,690
Speaker 0: Strange will be back on the Patreon.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,290
Speaker 0: So if you support Geek Nights on Patreon for even $1, you get all that, not just Geek Nights.

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,609
Speaker 1: You're really selling it here.

34
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,970
Speaker 0: Hey, I got a few more pledges recently.

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:54,990
Speaker 1: One of the things that's interesting, I used to be kind of like peeved when I do shows with just you and I because you'd never want to do Thing of the Day and you'd never want to do news.

36
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,681
Speaker 0: You want to do the whole format?

37
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,030
Speaker 0: You got to start with the opening event.

38
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,810
Speaker 0: Then you need to have two main newses and one small news.

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,150
Speaker 1: See, I always have a backlog of Things of the Day.

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,870
Speaker 1: I mean, they're not usually things I found that day because I don't really browse the internet a lot at work.

41
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,050
Speaker 1: I'm busy animating.

42
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,690
Speaker 1: But like I have all this backlog of shorts.

43
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,109
Speaker 1: I've got like this YouTube playlist that I can pull from.

44
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:29,350
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's kind of grown on me that since you and I have a different style when we do the show together, it's like instead of following the Rim and Scott format exactly, the Rim and Emily formats a little bit more loose.

45
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,707
Speaker 1: We don't necessarily have to be like, "What happened

46
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:33,110
Speaker 1: today?".

47
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:35,148
Speaker 0: I cut my finger open.

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,870
Speaker 1: The other good thing about that is that we can take those reviews and put them anytime we want.

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,290
Speaker 1: So like if we go on vacation, we can queue up a bunch of episodes and they're not specifically topical.

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,949
Speaker 0: My hot take is Moana was super good and you should go see it.

51
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:52,748
Speaker 1: What's that hot take?

52
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,410
Speaker 0: It's the second best Disney movie in modern history.

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,830
Speaker 1: That's like, that's not negative at all.

54
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,490
Speaker 0: Hot take doesn't have to necessarily be negative.

55
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,568
Speaker 1: It just means it's hot.

56
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:05,548
Speaker 0: Hot off the press.

57
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,250
Speaker 0: Usually, ironically, like hot take.

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,509
Speaker 0: Twitter has some issues.

59
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, I usually hear it used in the context of saying something vaguely snarky about a piece of media.

60
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:25,290
Speaker 0: So when I was pulling up the stuff for this, the IMDb has a pretty good rating for Moana so far.

61
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:37,848
Speaker 0: But the first and featured review is someone who gave it 5 out of 10. and they're like, "The beginning reminded me of Pocahontas, but Pocahontas was a rich tapestry that drew me into this amazing

62
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,249
Speaker 0: world.".

63
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,790
Speaker 0: And Moana was just like a dumb, boring rehash of that.

64
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,579
Speaker 1: Are you serious?

65
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,349
Speaker 1: It had nothing.

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,530
Speaker 1: You know, like Avatar was like Pocahontas, right?

67
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,070
Speaker 1: This was not like Pocahontas at all.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,089
Speaker 0: They go on to complain that Moana is bad because it's diverse and Disney's trying to be diverse instead of "telling good

69
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:55,410
Speaker 0: stories.".

70
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:56,024
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

71
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,250
Speaker 0: That is the top review on IMDb right now.

72
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:12,829
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, I mean, with a movie like this, which takes very heavily from a specific culture's mythology and aesthetic and everything, I think there's definitely going to be a lot of criticism revolving around that.

73
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:25,750
Speaker 1: Specifically, I've read a few reviews by scholars of Polynesian studies about what the movie got right, what the movie was kind of eh about, what made them mad, what made them happy.

74
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,030
Speaker 0: It seems like the consensus was more positive than negative.

75
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:37,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, on the internet, I've seen some people of Polynesian descent be like, "Oh my god, it was fucking awesome to see my heritage

76
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:38,147
Speaker 1: represented.".

77
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:44,410
Speaker 1: And the whole big theme behind the movie is about Polynesian migration.

78
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,010
Speaker 0: And the great pause.

79
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:46,890
Speaker 1: The great pause.

80
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,170
Speaker 1: Polynesian culture spread throughout the Pacific for like a thousand years and then it stopped.

81
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:04,630
Speaker 0: I remember with navigation techniques and shipwright techniques that basically were not known to the rest of the world for countless, not millennia, but countless centuries.

82
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:19,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like expert sailing culture who had incredible knowledge of the stars and of wayfinding techniques and stuff like that, and built canoes that were fast and very light and versatile.

83
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:28,410
Speaker 1: And they were able to go throughout the entire ocean pretty much, like from New Zealand to Hawaii to just all these different islands.

84
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,510
Speaker 1: And then evidence of that kind of disappeared for a while and then it started up again.

85
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:38,070
Speaker 1: And to this day, there's a lot of theories, but nobody really knows why that happened.

86
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,677
Speaker 1: Well, I saw the movie.

87
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:39,850
Speaker 0: I know exactly what happened.

88
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:48,090
Speaker 1: Because there was a girl and she had to break the magic spell that was causing the fish to die, so she found a demigod.

89
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,037
Speaker 1: But that, just in general, it definitely was kind of like Kubo.

90
00:05:54,238 --> 00:06:09,790
Speaker 1: in that I feel like even if the movie wasn't necessarily perfect on the front of cultural representation, Disney at least did its due diligence, and so it doesn't smack of appropriation quite as much as some of their earlier efforts.

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:20,325
Speaker 1: Because Disney is like, you know, you want to talk about taking a culture and then dressing it up in like, "Okay, now we're going to make a musical with this culture as the

92
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:20,807
Speaker 1: setting.".

93
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:26,250
Speaker 1: And it's not always the most authentic or respectful, perhaps.

94
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:28,409
Speaker 1: I'm looking at you, Aladdin.

95
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, Aladdin.

96
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:31,570
Speaker 0: Snarky teen.

97
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:42,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, Moana definitely, it felt like they were trying to put their effort in to represent Polynesian culture well.

98
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:49,570
Speaker 1: And at least in the island scenes, I really enjoyed all the different characters in the village and stuff.

99
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,047
Speaker 1: I like the guy who was just like, "Are you sure we can't eat that

100
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:53,489
Speaker 1: chicken?".

101
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,879
Speaker 0: On that front, you brought up the chicken.

102
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,890
Speaker 0: I really appreciate the fact that that chicken does not talk.

103
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,950
Speaker 0: There are no talking animals in this movie at all.

104
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,068
Speaker 0: And the posters all show the chicken and the pig like, "Okay, there's going to be animal sidekicks like there always

105
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:10,289
Speaker 0: are.".

106
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,230
Speaker 0: The pig doesn't follow her into the ocean, and the chicken never says a word.

107
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,609
Speaker 0: The animal sidekicks... Maybe other chickens can talk, but that one can't.

108
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:21,049
Speaker 1: They're more like... Actually, Pocahontas was the same way.

109
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,170
Speaker 1: You know, now that brought up Pocahontas and it's in my mind.

110
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,807
Speaker 0: So, I'll admit something.

111
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:32,810
Speaker 0: Despite having played the song from it on the Blue Horn a million times, I've never actually seen Pocahontas all the way through.

112
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,115
Speaker 0: Really?

113
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:41,450
Speaker 0: I saw The Colors of the Wind, I saw the songs, and I just felt like that movie was not for me.

114
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,630
Speaker 1: It's kind of a bastardization of history, and it's basically Romeo and Juliet.

115
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:52,770
Speaker 1: Like, hot Indian lady, and John Smith is like this romance novel-looking dude.

116
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,010
Speaker 1: And they had this...

117
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,010
Speaker 0: You mean that she didn't actually marry because she married that other John?

118
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,407
Speaker 1: She was like 12 years old.

119
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,263
Speaker 0: John Rolfe.

120
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean, actually, I think they made a sequel where she meets John Rolfe or something.

121
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,669
Speaker 1: But I don't think she dies so smallpox in that one.

122
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:08,544
Speaker 1: Like...

123
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:09,768
Speaker 0: If they did, it was made for TV.

124
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:20,188
Speaker 1: I just remember my teacher... I took a class, it was like comparative director series, where they compared... The teacher was a huge Miyazaki scholar.

125
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,069
Speaker 1: He loved the works of Hayao Miyazaki.

126
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,910
Speaker 1: And he also really liked Disney.

127
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,750
Speaker 1: So he did this animation history class comparing the two directors' styles.

128
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:31,130
Speaker 1: And he was a great teacher.

129
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:31,669
Speaker 1: I loved him.

130
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,429
Speaker 1: But he was also of First Nations descent, and so he had some pretty choice words to say about the representation in Pocahontas.

131
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:45,470
Speaker 1: I remember, I didn't watch the movie in his class because I wanted to go to a concert or something.

132
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,886
Speaker 1: And I said, "Can I skip the screening?

133
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:48,148
Speaker 1: Is that

134
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:48,450
Speaker 1: okay?".

135
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,249
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Most of the time I'd encourage you to go to the screening, but yeah, this one's a

136
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,410
Speaker 1: mess.".

137
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:54,598
Speaker 1: I was like,

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,125
Speaker 1: "Okay.".

139
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:01,409
Speaker 0: So since it's still in theaters, honestly, my short review is go see it in the theater in 3D.

140
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,423
Speaker 0: It is designed, much like Mad Max, it is designed for 3D.

141
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,508
Speaker 0: They put a lot of care into making the movie work very well in 3D.

142
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,070
Speaker 1: Just really saturated colors, the environments are just phenomenal.

143
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:22,270
Speaker 1: There were many scenes in the movie where it was very simple and beautiful.

144
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,750
Speaker 1: You know, like the scene with the stars.

145
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,029
Speaker 1: Most of the movie takes place on a boat.

146
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:29,867
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

147
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,638
Speaker 1: Well, it's a movie about wayfinding.

148
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,030
Speaker 1: It's about exploring and learning to sail.

149
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,450
Speaker 1: And it's also about finding yourself and stuff like that.

150
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,090
Speaker 0: I'd say meeting your heroes, but it wasn't really her hero.

151
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,488
Speaker 0: And that was kind of a plot point.

152
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,510
Speaker 1: So the whole plot is, she lives on this island and her dad is chief of the village.

153
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,050
Speaker 1: And he's like, she really wants to go in the water.

154
00:09:56,351 --> 00:10:00,670
Speaker 1: Ever since she was a little kid, she's been obsessed with the ocean and always going to the ocean.

155
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,010
Speaker 1: And her dad's like, no, no, come back from the ocean.

156
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,030
Speaker 1: Don't go to the ocean.

157
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,209
Speaker 1: She's like, but the ocean.

158
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,450
Speaker 1: And so he's like, stay on land.

159
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,868
Speaker 1: You've got responsibilities here.

160
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,830
Speaker 1: You know, be responsible, dad, kind of person.

161
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:21,970
Speaker 1: And so it ends up she has to go save her village because the island's dying and they think it's a curse.

162
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:25,570
Speaker 1: And the only way to fix the curse is to return the heart.

163
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:34,010
Speaker 0: But interestingly, no one thinks that except the grandmother who's old enough to remember what's in that cave and all that biz.

164
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,730
Speaker 1: I love the grandmother.

165
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,510
Speaker 1: She was one of my favorite parts of that movie.

166
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:45,010
Speaker 1: She was also very ocean-y and kind of mystical, but she was funny about it.

167
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,570
Speaker 1: She's like, I'm just the village crazy lady.

168
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:53,810
Speaker 0: The characters that had speaking lines or that had any sort of prominent part of the movie were just really good characters?

169
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:54,566
Speaker 0: Yeah.

170
00:10:54,911 --> 00:11:00,490
Speaker 0: They had complex motivations insofar as they needed them for whatever they were doing in the movie.

171
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, the dad caused conflict.

172
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:13,370
Speaker 1: Their wills were often at odds, but he was portrayed as this loving, caring father, even though he was like, nope, don't go sailing kind of thing.

173
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,749
Speaker 1: And I loved her relationship with her.

174
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,990
Speaker 1: I mean, with her mom, there was a few good scenes with that, but mostly with her grandmother.

175
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,870
Speaker 1: That relationship was just really sweet and well done.

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:38,250
Speaker 1: So anyway, she has a legend that she's got to go save the island and she braves the ocean to go find Maui, who's like this legendary demigod.

177
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:44,250
Speaker 1: And yeah, he's not quite what she expected, I think.

178
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's not quite a dick, but he's- He's a trickster for sure.

179
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,101
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of Gaston in there, but then- No, not Gaston.

180
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,410
Speaker 0: He's more like- He's full of himself.

181
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,910
Speaker 1: He's kind of like the genie a little bit.

182
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:11,198
Speaker 1: He's like very egotistical, but he's a little bit like the genie where he has modeling moments, but he's not quite as pop culture- The genie's only modeling because that's a post-apocalyptic society and they've rebuilt- Oh, come on.

184
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,688
Speaker 1: That's silly.

185
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,690
Speaker 1: I don't buy that.

186
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,709
Speaker 1: Look at the evidence.

187
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:15,775
Speaker 1: Nonsense.

188
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:18,046
Speaker 1: You could make cases for just about anything.

189
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:22,190
Speaker 1: Be like- Pokemon ashes in a coma the whole time or whatever.

190
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:22,848
Speaker 0: Oh, that's canon.

191
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:23,972
Speaker 1: What?

192
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 1: Nonsense.

193
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:26,969
Speaker 1: Nonsense, I tell you.

194
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:36,130
Speaker 1: But Moana, one criticism I did see was that the character of Maui is based on a mythological figure from Polynesian culture.

195
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,799
Speaker 1: And they were like, "Why did they make him so

196
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,502
Speaker 1: doofy?".

197
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:41,450
Speaker 1: But they also made him kind of badass.

198
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,830
Speaker 1: So he's a combination of doofy and really badass.

199
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,276
Speaker 0: Well, the movie has no- It ties up all of its ends really well.

200
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:55,590
Speaker 0: Maui is the way he is, but even that ends up being a big part of his character arc and the plot toward the end.

201
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:07,410
Speaker 0: Not to spoil anything, everything like that in the movie, except possibly the chicken, wraps up in a very heartfelt and meaningful way.

202
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,617
Speaker 1: The chicken wraps up just the way the chicken should wrap up.

203
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:15,850
Speaker 1: The chicken survives through the whole thing and ends up pecking at rocks just back where he started.

204
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,390
Speaker 0: Okay, the Aladdin thing is checking out more and more.

205
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,395
Speaker 1: Oh, bologna.

206
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:22,370
Speaker 1: Anyway- This is looking pretty solid.

207
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,468
Speaker 1: Anyway.

208
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,156
Speaker 1: I'm going to have to look at this later.

209
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:30,450
Speaker 1: He's looking at this fan theory that Aladdin was set in this post-apocalypse.

210
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,185
Speaker 0: Look, it's like Adventure Time.

211
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:32,609
Speaker 0: Look at that.

212
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,607
Speaker 1: But that's the video game.

213
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:35,930
Speaker 1: What the heck?

214
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, video game is canon.

215
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,053
Speaker 1: Whatever.

216
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:39,900
Speaker 1: Anyway, concentrate.

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,129
Speaker 1: We're talking about Ocean Voyages here.

218
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:55,090
Speaker 0: But the movie's just really good and kind of drew me in in a way that I guess recent Disney movies have, but there was a long drought of Disney movies that were not bringing me into them to that level.

219
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,789
Speaker 0: They didn't have these sort of beautiful, expansive, immersive worlds to fill out.

220
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:00,212
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:02,670
Speaker 0: I feel like- Inside Out was pretty superficial.

222
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:03,930
Speaker 1: That was a Pixar.

223
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:04,986
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

224
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:14,570
Speaker 1: That's the thing that's interesting is I feel like for about a decade, it was like Disney's going down the tubes and Pixar's star is rising.

225
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:23,230
Speaker 1: But I tell you, I think in the past maybe five years or so, I've found Disney movies to be generally more compelling than the Pixar counterparts.

226
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,381
Speaker 1: Frozen had some issues.

227
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:26,510
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it anyway.

228
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, Frozen was okay.

229
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:28,937
Speaker 1: No pros and cons.

230
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,741
Speaker 1: Come on.

231
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:31,170
Speaker 1: It was like Norwegian.

232
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,716
Speaker 1: But, oh, that's one thing I must say for Moana.

233
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,299
Speaker 1: that disappointed me in Frozen.

234
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:41,550
Speaker 1: that Moana did really well is incorporated traditional music of the setting into the score.

235
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,803
Speaker 0: Frozen was like, "Hey, check out this traditional music.

236
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:44,669
Speaker 1: That's never coming

237
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:44,890
Speaker 1: back.".

238
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,982
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Oh, Norwegian Joiking.

239
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:47,425
Speaker 0: Oh, it's

240
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:48,270
Speaker 0: semi-people.".

241
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,401
Speaker 0: Nope, the Joiking's gone.

242
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,289
Speaker 0: It's only in the soundtrack.

243
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,059
Speaker 1: No, it's just musical music.

244
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,750
Speaker 1: And this one had a good combination.

245
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,730
Speaker 1: It was like Disney musical music by the guy who did Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, I guess.

246
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,304
Speaker 0: And if you stay for the credits, one of the songs, one of the good songs in the movie.

247
00:15:04,324 --> 00:15:06,110
Speaker 0: The movie has excellent, excellent music.

248
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:09,330
Speaker 0: He sings the song over the credits.

249
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was funny because I feel like the soundtrack, it wasn't like.

250
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:15,770
Speaker 1: I watched it.

251
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,749
Speaker 1: I was like, "Wow, that had the best score of any Disney movie

252
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:18,890
Speaker 1: ever.".

253
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,030
Speaker 0: But it got stuck in my head.

254
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,817
Speaker 1: It got stuck in my head hardcore.

255
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,950
Speaker 1: I listened to the soundtrack at work the day after on Spotify.

256
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,562
Speaker 1: And then I was going around humming Maui's song.

257
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,490
Speaker 1: I was humming the song that the crab sings.

258
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,000
Speaker 0: Oh, we'll get to the crab.

259
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,646
Speaker 0: The crab is...

260
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,510
Speaker 1: So this crab monster appears.

261
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,301
Speaker 1: He was your favorite because you love that, what's his name?

262
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,450
Speaker 1: Clements, Jermaine Clements or something.

263
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,690
Speaker 1: Goodbye Moon Man.

264
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,089
Speaker 1: And that's a song that always gets stuck in your head.

265
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,810
Speaker 0: The crab starts singing and immediately all I can think of is it's the Moon Man guy.

266
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,400
Speaker 1: It's the guy from Rick and Morty.

267
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,770
Speaker 1: He played fart in Rick and Morty.

268
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,290
Speaker 1: And he does this voice of this giant crab monster who impersonates.

269
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,850
Speaker 1: He does this kind of David Bowie inspired glam rock number.

270
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,086
Speaker 1: And I was just like, "That sounds really

271
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:05,529
Speaker 1: familiar.".

272
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,566
Speaker 1: And rim leans over and he's like, "It's the guy from Moon

273
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:08,827
Speaker 1: Man.".

274
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,265
Speaker 1: I was like, "Oh yeah, I totally see

275
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:11,487
Speaker 1: that.".

276
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:18,830
Speaker 0: As opposed to say Zootopia where there's one song that was memorable and that gets stuck in our heads.

277
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,038
Speaker 1: Zootopia wasn't really a musical.

278
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,466
Speaker 1: It had a very different format.

279
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:24,570
Speaker 1: This felt more like...

280
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,910
Speaker 0: Zootopia had the same problem that those Marvel movies did where it had a soundtrack that just sort of served its purpose and then one iconic song.

281
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:36,210
Speaker 1: No, I would say Zootopia is a little bit more unique than the standard action movie.

282
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,330
Speaker 0: I can't place a single melody of any sort from that movie.

283
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,419
Speaker 0: That's super generic.

284
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,130
Speaker 0: That could fit like a hundred movies.

285
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:51,110
Speaker 0: I got nothing.

286
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,890
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, I've been singing three different songs from Moana under my breath constantly since we saw it.

287
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,430
Speaker 1: Yes, Moana's songs really, really stick.

288
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,869
Speaker 1: And also they incorporated like about half the songs incorporated Polynesian vocals in them.

289
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,935
Speaker 1: And I really like that.

290
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:13,290
Speaker 1: I think it was mostly like Samoan culture.

291
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:18,130
Speaker 1: But I know they had a lot of New Zealand voice actors like Maori people and stuff like that.

292
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,428
Speaker 1: And I thought that was pretty neat.

293
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,718
Speaker 1: But anyway, music was good.

294
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:31,849
Speaker 1: But I think the thing, one of my favorite, favorite things about the movie, and this is going to sound really superficial and animatory of me.

295
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,565
Speaker 0: Now the water.

296
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,810
Speaker 1: Oh my God, the shaders in this movie, like the nature stuff was really, really well done.

297
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,090
Speaker 1: Just like it was so colorful and beautiful.

298
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,470
Speaker 1: And it wasn't that it was realistic because that wasn't what made it cool.

299
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:58,960
Speaker 1: It was that they took the good things of realism and the good things of like artistic expression and like exaggeration and brought them together.

300
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,390
Speaker 1: And it was really, really beautiful.

301
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,169
Speaker 0: I found all these articles where they said that they did a lot of study of their old 2D animation while simultaneously investing, kind of like how they invested in that.

302
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,049
Speaker 0: What was the thing that made the Zootopia characters sort of just...

303
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:27,329
Speaker 1: It was like motion noise where everything was like, it's kind of like moving holds, where if you have a freeze frame in an animation where the character is not really moving, if you just freeze it, it looks kind of stiff, especially if it's in 3D.

304
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,050
Speaker 1: Like if the character is moving and then they stop moving and then they move again, it really breaks the illusion.

305
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Speaker 1: So they have this kind of, to add visual motion noise to a character's movement.

306
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:44,830
Speaker 1: It's just like a character will be standing and their fur will be blowing and the trees will be blowing.

307
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:46,889
Speaker 1: It's like wind and stuff.

308
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:49,610
Speaker 0: Apparently that was a crazy system they developed.

309
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,690
Speaker 0: And now they extended that with a liquid water and particle system for Moana.

310
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,249
Speaker 1: It's nice to see all their tool development, right?

311
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,490
Speaker 1: Because Zootopia was all about the fur.

312
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:06,470
Speaker 1: It was about the fur and certain things, like I said, the movement stuff.

313
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,030
Speaker 1: Moana is all about sand and water and the hair.

314
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,470
Speaker 1: I love the hair in Moana.

315
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,436
Speaker 1: She has this big, long, curly hair.

316
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,550
Speaker 0: It swings around and gets stuck in her eyes.

317
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:25,670
Speaker 1: It swings around and she'll come out of the water and it will be all wet and it will hit her in the face.

318
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,270
Speaker 1: I loved watching the way her clothes and her hair were animated.

319
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:37,490
Speaker 1: But just as a character, I found her to be a really compelling character.

320
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,970
Speaker 1: Because they didn't make her overly like "tough girl, let's go, punch 'em" kind of thing.

321
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,210
Speaker 1: She was just very determined and pretty smart and adventurous.

322
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:53,070
Speaker 1: But I don't know, I just thought she was good as a protagonist.

323
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,647
Speaker 0: It's not like "fuck this town, I'm out of

324
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:55,889
Speaker 0: here.".

325
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:00,870
Speaker 1: No, she cared a lot about her family and about the people in her village.

326
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:04,790
Speaker 0: She was pretty close to agreeing and staying to do her job.

327
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,509
Speaker 0: And she was actually pretty okay with it.

328
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:15,590
Speaker 0: And it wasn't until the thing that grandma showed her, and not to spoil, but basically one of my favorite things ever in anything is precursor technology.

329
00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:17,770
Speaker 0: And that is a big part of this movie.

330
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,748
Speaker 1: The movie was all about "where did our people come

331
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:22,050
Speaker 1: from?".

332
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,908
Speaker 1: And then she has this revelation like "oh, we weren't always on this

333
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:27,429
Speaker 1: island.".

334
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,430
Speaker 1: And it's actually a really great scene.

335
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:39,050
Speaker 1: But also I like how some of the songs, they do the thing like... You never saw Princess and the Frog.

336
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,150
Speaker 0: I do need to see that.

337
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:53,170
Speaker 1: It's a good movie, but there was this one musical number where it's like the style will switch during a song, and it will be like aping a specific artistic style.

338
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:56,750
Speaker 1: And this one was like 1920s Jazz Age posters.

339
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:05,930
Speaker 1: And in Moana, they did a similar thing during Maui's song where it's all like stylized art and it looks like paper cutouts.

340
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,260
Speaker 0: It's beautiful.

341
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,309
Speaker 0: And they don't overuse it.

342
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,689
Speaker 0: They just use it there in that one scene.

343
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,950
Speaker 0: But it's just like... He basically has the powers that the witches have in Madoka and pulls her into this weird animated death world.

344
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:21,928
Speaker 0: Because he does try to kill her.

345
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:24,970
Speaker 0: I mean, you're welcome.

346
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,709
Speaker 1: He's such a jerk.

347
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,339
Speaker 1: He's straight up.

348
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,910
Speaker 1: Watch the movie and you'll see there's a point.

349
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,890
Speaker 1: He's like hanging out on this island in this cave.

350
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,726
Speaker 0: He tries to kill her like 20 times.

351
00:21:36,052 --> 00:21:37,349
Speaker 1: He tries to kill the chicken too.

352
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,009
Speaker 1: He's like "I'll fatten you up for

353
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:40,190
Speaker 1: later.".

354
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,950
Speaker 0: That villager tries to kill the chicken.

355
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:48,586
Speaker 1: At that point, everybody kind of looks at the chicken and be like "Should we just put it out of its

356
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:49,050
Speaker 1: misery?".

357
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,995
Speaker 1: And she's like "No!

358
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,423
Speaker 1: He's our special

359
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:52,147
Speaker 1: chicken!".

360
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,649
Speaker 1: He's like trying to eat a rock.

361
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,330
Speaker 1: But I like how the chicken wasn't too big a part of it.

362
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,610
Speaker 1: It was just kind of like a little bit of comic relief.

363
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,802
Speaker 1: Like look at the cute, dumb animal.

364
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:06,989
Speaker 1: do a cute, dumb thing.

365
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:21,948
Speaker 1: But yeah, they have that... It was definitely, again, kind of a buddy thing where at first they don't really get along and then they learn to work together.

366
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:22,049
Speaker 1: Yeah.

367
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,770
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend you go see this while it's still in the theater.

368
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,169
Speaker 1: But it wasn't a romance for the once.

369
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,169
Speaker 1: That's actually cool.

370
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,309
Speaker 1: The Disney princess did not... It wasn't about finding the prince.

371
00:22:32,013 --> 00:22:40,770
Speaker 1: She had an entirely different motivation and I really liked the resolution of this because to be honest, there wasn't really a villain.

372
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,300
Speaker 1: There were bad guys.

373
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:43,269
Speaker 1: There were antagonists.

374
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,449
Speaker 1: Like the crab was an antagonist.

375
00:22:45,992 --> 00:22:49,369
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't call anybody particularly villainous.

376
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:54,181
Speaker 1: There wasn't any overarching thing where somebody was like "Mwahahaha!

377
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,467
Speaker 1: I will thwart you at every

378
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:55,808
Speaker 1: turn!".

379
00:22:56,311 --> 00:23:11,629
Speaker 1: It was like the majority of the antagonism came from the adventure itself or from two characters kind of dealing with each other and dealing with their past and stuff like that.

380
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,730
Speaker 0: Surprisingly subtle little arcs for the very relatively small cast in this movie.

381
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,610
Speaker 0: And just haunting moments like when the ships are going by and she's sort of having her vision of what could be.

382
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,730
Speaker 1: I like that scene.

383
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:33,310
Speaker 1: I like the scene, like I said, the scene where it was like... You know in the hero's journey to get all film school on you.

384
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:42,590
Speaker 1: But in the monomyth, there's always the point where the protagonist is kind of down and out before the climax where they have lost space in their self.

385
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,250
Speaker 1: And it's like the belly of the whale, I think it's called in the monomyth.

386
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,250
Speaker 1: But it's like, so they're at their lowest point and they receive some sort of revelation that allows them to go for it.

387
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:01,589
Speaker 1: That scene in Moana was really, really beautiful and I really liked it.

388
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,790
Speaker 1: And yeah, go see it.

389
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:11,249
Speaker 1: It's a simple movie but it's definitely, I think, one of Disney's better records.

390
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,970
Speaker 0: Of the recent stuff, I think only Zootopia beats it out on my list.

391
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,870
Speaker 0: It's a solid number two and I think Zootopia only wins partly because of the subject matter and the two main characters.

392
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:33,549
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard when you don't like... But also, Zootopia dealt with some real shit really in a nuanced way that I did not expect that level of subtlety.

393
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:38,490
Speaker 1: I liked that their two most recent movies were so different.

394
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:45,010
Speaker 1: You compare Zootopia and this film and they're both really good but in completely different ways.

395
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,891
Speaker 0: Which don't worry because their next movie is Cars 3.

396
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,089
Speaker 1: That's Pixar, again.

397
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,693
Speaker 0: Disney's next movie, Wreck-It Ralph 2 2018.

398
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,430
Speaker 0: Then Incredibles 2, that's Pixar.

399
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,009
Speaker 1: I mean, I liked Wreck-It Ralph but I don't really think it needs sequel.

400
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,669
Speaker 0: Toy Story 4, that's Pixar.

401
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,127
Speaker 1: God, they're having total sequelitis.

402
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:03,829
Speaker 0: Frozen 2 is listed here.

403
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:04,409
Speaker 0: For real?

404
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,131
Speaker 0: For 2021.

405
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:12,390
Speaker 0: And an untitled Lin-Manuel Miranda, Byron Howard developed Disney animation film is supposedly in the works.

406
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:13,268
Speaker 0: Okay, then.

407
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,950
Speaker 1: I know that Moana was in the works for a long time.

408
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:25,090
Speaker 1: They really wanted to do... It's kind of funny because I think it started because they had all the Polynesian stuff at Disney World.

409
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,268
Speaker 1: You know how Disney likes to work with existing properties and themes like Pirates of the Caribbean and stuff?

410
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,889
Speaker 0: We have the Polynesian, you know, the resort, the Polynesian.

411
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,950
Speaker 0: We never did anything and luckily they didn't get that idea until 2016.

412
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,110
Speaker 0: Can you imagine this movie in like 1940?

413
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,812
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think... Well, Disney World hasn't been around since 1940.

414
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,970
Speaker 0: When did they build the Polynesian?

415
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,450
Speaker 1: Then we'll look at what Disney movies they were making.

416
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,830
Speaker 1: I'm assuming it was sometimes in the 60s from the decor of that place.

417
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,649
Speaker 1: It's like, I'd say mid-60s, I'm assuming.

418
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,569
Speaker 1: That's where we had the Tiki Bar.

419
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,943
Speaker 1: That was actually some of my favorite memories from our recent trip to Disney World.

420
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:05,990
Speaker 1: was hanging out at the Polynesian Resort.

421
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:14,830
Speaker 1: They have this balcony where it's an outside Tiki Bar and you can see the fireworks.

422
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,030
Speaker 0: You can actually see the Disney castle and the fireworks in the distance.

423
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,470
Speaker 0: They actually played the music and all the stuff for the fireworks right there.

424
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,148
Speaker 0: It was pretty fun.

425
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:33,410
Speaker 0: It was a bunch of couples and adults like us, surprisingly similar demographic sitting there, all just having cocktails and sort of enjoying Disney from afar.

426
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,350
Speaker 1: And the nice lady let me keep the glowing ice cube from the fancy drink.

427
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,551
Speaker 0: All right, so 1971...

428
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,439
Speaker 1: See, I was right.

429
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,266
Speaker 0: I said late 60s.

430
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:49,150
Speaker 0: So let's see, we got The Jungle Book, The Aristocrats, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, Fox and the Hounds.

431
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,529
Speaker 1: This is a different movie.

432
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,486
Speaker 1: Fucking and sucking.

433
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,727
Speaker 1: I don't think Disney is in that one.

434
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,908
Speaker 1: But anyway, I kind of think that the development...

435
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,077
Speaker 0: We're right all over in company.

436
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:04,270
Speaker 0: I always forget that movie exists.

437
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,719
Speaker 1: I like that movie okay.

438
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,290
Speaker 1: It's not great, but it's not terrible.

439
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,630
Speaker 0: It's just, I forget, it never comes to mind.

440
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:18,970
Speaker 1: But anyway, I feel like, because being in the industry I'm in, I keep a fairly close eye on what Disney's planning, like their development stuff.

441
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:29,270
Speaker 1: And I know both The Snow Queen, which became Frozen, and a Polynesian princess movie were in the pipeline for many years and it got substantially rewritten.

442
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,610
Speaker 1: And luckily the end result is a really good movie.

443
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,622
Speaker 0: Well, they already had The Tiki Room.

444
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:37,876
Speaker 0: They can make that movie.

445
00:27:37,896 --> 00:27:39,850
Speaker 0: It'll be Iago and everyone going on an adventure.

446
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,320
Speaker 1: Oh my god, The Parrots.

447
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,050
Speaker 1: That's a song that gets stuck in my head.

448
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,090
Speaker 1: I'm like, no, don't even start with me, buddy.

449
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,650
Speaker 0: I remember they had that one drink at The Polynesian, The Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

450
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,230
Speaker 1: Anyway, it could have been really stereotypical.

451
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:04,250
Speaker 1: And I'm not saying it was without any problems, but I was pretty impressed by the caliber of the movie.

452
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:06,529
Speaker 1: Good game, Disney.

453
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:16,508
Speaker 0: But seriously, go see it in 3D while you can, because it will lose... It'll still be a great movie to see, but it'll lose something significant if you don't see it in 3D.

454
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,990
Speaker 1: The depth of the environment.

455
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,775
Speaker 0: It was designed for 3D.

456
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:25,170
Speaker 0: If you look at the credits, they put a lot of effort and care into the 3D environments.

457
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:25,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

458
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,887
Speaker 1: Now we have to review, let's see, we have to review Dr.

459
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,128
Speaker 1: Strange.

460
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:29,594
Speaker 1: Dr.

461
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:29,869
Speaker 1: Strange.

462
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,981
Speaker 1: We've got to review...

463
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,750
Speaker 0: Lupin, Fujiko Mine, we'll do that one.

464
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got to do that one.

465
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,429
Speaker 1: But I really want to drag you to go see the new Harry Potter because I really liked it.

466
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,750
Speaker 0: A bunch of white kids running around.

467
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:41,068
Speaker 0: It was good, though.

468
00:28:41,873 --> 00:28:44,185
Speaker 1: It was 1920s New York, and it was fun.

469
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,967
Speaker 1: It was like, imagine New York, prohibition era, plus dragons.

470
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:50,850
Speaker 1: It's great.

471
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:58,170
Speaker 0: I guess the two, I saw I think three Harry Potter movies, and one of them was like half of the Deathly Hallows or whatever.

472
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,530
Speaker 0: One of them was the bad one with the Phoenix, I think?

473
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:07,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one Chamber of Secrets, which is the weakest of the Harry Potter books.

474
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've not batted too well with Harry Potter movies.

475
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:12,590
Speaker 1: You're like so anti-Harry Potter.

476
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:14,441
Speaker 1: It's a great story.

477
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,569
Speaker 0: I can't read those books.

478
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,513
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah.

479
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,537
Speaker 0: Ron said, blah, blah.

480
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,823
Speaker 0: Harry said, blah, blah, blah.

481
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,888
Speaker 0: Ron said, blah, blah.

482
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:27,649
Speaker 0: Harry said, and then a sword fell from the sky into Harry's hands and he accidentally killed the salamander or whatever.

483
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:29,262
Speaker 1: Salamander.

484
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:36,190
Speaker 1: I think, I think you should narrow... See, you would be better than that potted Potter.

485
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,609
Speaker 1: You would have been a better like...

486
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,967
Speaker 0: I can get my off-Broadway show.

487
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,130
Speaker 0: Rims summarizes Harry Potter.

488
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,049
Speaker 1: Harry Potter, having read approximately none of it.

489
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,714
Speaker 1: Oh boy.

490
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:49,469
Speaker 1: Anyway, Disney's, Disney's pretty cool.

491
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,590
Speaker 1: Pixar's needs to step up their game a little bit and that's our show.

492
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,527
Speaker 0: And look forward to, I guess, Cars 3 if you're a Pixar fan.

493
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,429
Speaker 1: Okay, one last thing before the end of the show.

494
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,322
Speaker 1: The trailer for Cars 3, right?

495
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:04,870
Speaker 1: Which we saw before Moana.

496
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,930
Speaker 0: I had heard so much about this trailer.

497
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:08,536
Speaker 0: What the heck?

498
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:09,850
Speaker 1: I had heard a little bit.

499
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:16,129
Speaker 0: It just shows the main car like dying in a car accident and then it's like everything changed and that's it.

500
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,410
Speaker 1: But it doesn't show the car as like the weird car face.

501
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,810
Speaker 1: You just see this computer animated car like flipping over and it's not like stylized all that much.

502
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:34,910
Speaker 1: It's just like this red NASCAR looking car flipping over and wiping out and it's all like sparks and on fire.

503
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:36,978
Speaker 1: And I was like, what?

504
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,749
Speaker 1: And then I was like, this is cars?

505
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,986
Speaker 0: Okay, I learned what the deal is.

506
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:47,090
Speaker 0: Blindsided by a new generation of blazing fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves.

507
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,490
Speaker 0: To get back in the game and lead the help of eager young female race technician Cruz Ramirez with her own plan to win.

508
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,889
Speaker 0: Plus inspiration from the late Doc Hudson.

509
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:57,461
Speaker 0: It's basically Rocky.

510
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,750
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a comeback story.

511
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:01,267
Speaker 0: Except he's actually going to win.

512
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,868
Speaker 0: Spoilers, I guess.

513
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,353
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

514
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,707
Speaker 1: Pixar could pull a thing and not have him win.

515
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,590
Speaker 1: They could have him die.

516
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,261
Speaker 0: Then it cuts back to he's just in the hospital hallucinating.

517
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:15,648
Speaker 0: all of that from the actual accident.

518
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:16,090
Speaker 0: The end.

519
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,852
Speaker 1: I don't know.

520
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:21,010
Speaker 1: Cars just weirds me out because it's like, I have difficulty.

521
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,970
Speaker 1: Like little, little kids love the shit out of that movie.

522
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,961
Speaker 0: Because they have cars.

523
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:26,690
Speaker 0: They can move them around.

524
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:31,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I get that little kids like it and it seems like, but like.

525
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,350
Speaker 0: Cars bothers me on a fundamental level the way that like Rugrats does.

526
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:42,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm like, I have trouble immersing myself in that world because like I don't really understand how the world works and why.

527
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:43,069
Speaker 1: and like.

528
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:50,910
Speaker 0: How come Angelica can talk to the babies and they understand each other, but like the babies can't talk to the adults, but Angelica can also talk to the adults.

529
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,279
Speaker 1: Well, cause she's a toddler.

530
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,549
Speaker 1: She's halfway between.

531
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,609
Speaker 1: But she fully understands them.

532
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:58,244
Speaker 1: So did you ever read the book of 101 Dalmatians?

533
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,885
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever actually read it.

534
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:01,330
Speaker 0: I think I just.

535
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,721
Speaker 1: It's way better than the Disney movie.

536
00:32:03,782 --> 00:32:04,385
Speaker 1: I really like it.

537
00:32:04,426 --> 00:32:05,130
Speaker 1: It's very British.

538
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:15,409
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's this one part where Pongo and misses encounter this old sheepdog and this little kid and the old sheepdog is like.

539
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:20,770
Speaker 1: Hangs out with the little kid and the little kid can kind of talk to the dogs and understand them.

540
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:27,284
Speaker 1: But he's like in that weird liminal stage between like starting to learn how to talk in people.

541
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,710
Speaker 1: So he's losing the ability to talk in dog.

542
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:38,210
Speaker 1: And so it's kind of like that scene where it's like when they're little, they can talk to each other, but then they grow up and they lose the ability to talk baby.

543
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,009
Speaker 0: And I think we'll leave it at that.

544
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,430
Speaker 0: Yes.

545
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,586
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

546
