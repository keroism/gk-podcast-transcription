1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,369
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 5th, and this is a Geek Nights special.

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:24,376
Speaker 0: Tonight we bring you the final final lost coverage from Otacon 2006 which includes, among other things, the famed assassination attempt by Anime World Order on myself and Scott.

3
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:28,374
Speaker 0: Now before I begin I would like to point out that this is a Geek Nights special.

4
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:31,540
Speaker 0: For any of our newer listeners this is not a canon episode.

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,788
Speaker 0: This is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

6
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:47,580
Speaker 0: If you want to hear what Geek Nights is really about and this is the first episode you've ever heard, I suggest you check out any other of the approximately 190 episodes we've got up on the website and in the feed that do not contain the word "special" in the title.

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:01:01,371
Speaker 0: Now to provide a little background, this is a recording that we did shortly after the Webcomics roundtable that we recorded at Otacon with the Anime World Order guys and Fast Karate for the Gentlemen Ninja Consultants, a few other people were around.

8
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,200
Speaker 0: It was about two in the morning.

9
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:05,372
Speaker 0: I was both drunk and exhausted.

10
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,642
Speaker 0: My throat was so scratchy I could barely talk.

11
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:13,280
Speaker 0: Scott was doing equally miserably and we were attempting to have some sort of panel discussion.

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:26,135
Speaker 0: This discussion, for anyone who is not fully aware, ended in myself being shot in the face with a clown pistol, shortly followed by Scott being shot in the face with a clown pistol.

13
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,965
Speaker 0: Now you might be wondering what is a clown pistol?

14
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:32,200
Speaker 0: Well, I think you're just going to have to listen to the following.

15
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:38,339
Speaker 0: I apologize for the audio quality and that I'm not going to even bother trying to clean this up.

16
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:58,640
Speaker 0: Now there are a lot of conspiracy theories as to why this content was not provided immediately after Otacon, ranging from the fact that we actually died as a result of injury sustained and we've been covering up ever since with clever robot voices, to some sort of conspiracy to cover up any sort of discontent among the masses or assassination attempts thereby.

17
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:20,240
Speaker 0: The sad, sad truth is simply that GarageBand made a weird file and I didn't want to bother trying to get it out and do the things necessary to make it able to be put into an episode of Geek Nights, let alone to clean it up and deal with all of the artifacts from the fact that there were a bunch of drunken people at two in the morning trying to record a podcast.

18
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,020
Speaker 0: But because we are going to Sitacon this weekend and we are not doing a normal show today, I had plenty of time to finally slap something together.

19
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:42,419
Speaker 0: So at last, at long last, what the moment you have all been waiting for, the first of I assume to be many assassination attempts on Rim and Scott of Geek Nights, as well as some commentary about Otacon, you know that con we were all at at the time.

20
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:56,880
Speaker 0: So we're here at Otacon 2006 with the Geek Nights crew and the Anime World Order crew and this is going to be a very free-form, somewhat alcohol-filled romp through, at least from my part, alcohol-filled, romp through Otacon.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 2: Well, the first two days is currently Saturday night, pre-Geek Nights panel.

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,979
Speaker 0: So of course first, let's have everyone introduce themselves so voices are actually understood as who they are.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,686
Speaker 3: Yeah, it's not actually just the Anime World Order crew, but I guess since you mentioned the Anime World Order crew, we may as well introduce ourselves.

24
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,980
Speaker 3: I'm Daryl Surratt from Anime World Order.

25
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:24,080
Speaker 3: I've got Tom, a podcast about World Order and anime.

26
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:29,519
Speaker 1: And I'm Gerald Rathgeld, the other one-third of that.

27
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:31,779
Speaker 2: The Muppets Eagle Rathgeld.

28
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Muppets Eagle Stephen Hawking's butthead.

29
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,339
Speaker 2: I was with the Muppets Eagle thing, but when he said like the butthead, I was like,

30
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:44,500
Speaker 2: "What?".

31
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,600
Speaker 0: And of course, the rest of our panelists here, I apologize for their audio quality, but they were using the cheapest microphone we have through no fault of their own.

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 2: Yeah, I apologize for my audio quality too, but that just comes with the territory being me.

33
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 2: I'm Noah Fulmore of the Ninja Consultant podcast.

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,140
Speaker 4: Joel and I apologize for no such audio quality.

35
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,339
Speaker 4: I'm Dave Riley of Fast Karate for the Gentlemen.

36
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:12,640
Speaker 1: And I am Joel White, the other half of Fast Karate for the Gentlemen at JoelandDave.com.

37
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,358
Speaker 1: That wasn't my decision.

38
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,540
Speaker 0: And of course, in case this footage ever appears anywhere, it's not really footage, I'm Rym.

39
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:22,378
Speaker 2: I'm Scott.

40
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,480
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,030
Speaker 2: Great.

42
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,260
Speaker 2: Let's do this.

43
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,899
Speaker 0: I guess I'll let... Do we want to try to coordinate this?

44
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,740
Speaker 2: Here's a secret.

45
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,756
Speaker 2: We don't really say, "Let's do

46
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:30,959
Speaker 2: this.".

47
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,460
Speaker 2: We've said it maybe twice.

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,540
Speaker 0: We recorded it raw every time.

49
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got it right once, and we were like, "Let's use that in every episode forever and see if anyone

50
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:39,558
Speaker 0: notices.".

51
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:41,779
Speaker 2: You want to say it?

52
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,377
Speaker 0: Let's try it.

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 0: One, two, three.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,448
Speaker 2: Let's do this.

55
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,100
Speaker 2: That was pretty good.

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,558
Speaker 2: Good enough.

57
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:51,340
Speaker 0: I guess we'll let Gerald and Scott lead the discussion, because you have the schedules in front of you.

58
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,840
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we should just go through Otakon chronologically speaking.

59
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:57,760
Speaker 2: So when did we get here?

60
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,330
Speaker 2: We got here Thursday morning.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,299
Speaker 2: What did you guys get?

62
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,279
Speaker 1: I got here Thursday, around Thursday noon.

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,980
Speaker 2: Thursday noon?

64
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:09,919
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was about when we got here.

65
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:10,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, give or take.

66
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:17,180
Speaker 3: I was supposed to get here Thursday, 8.15.

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:27,680
Speaker 3: The flight was delayed for roughly an hour and a half, because there were just total ineptitude on the ground people and the air traffic controllers.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:37,940
Speaker 3: Then I get here, and then I have to carry an extensive amount of obscenely heavy flyers, which we have printed up several thousand.

69
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,200
Speaker 3: The box of flyers weighs 50 pounds.

70
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,082
Speaker 3: I weigh roughly 110.

71
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:49,780
Speaker 0: Also, I would like to note that he is an Otakon virgin.

72
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,000
Speaker 2: Yeah, how many Otakons has everyone here been to?

73
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,159
Speaker 2: Me and Rem, this is our fifth Otakon.

74
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,200
Speaker 3: Yeah, so the story continues.

75
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,640
Speaker 1: For those of you who don't know, it's exceedingly hot this weekend.

76
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:12,080
Speaker 3: On Thursday, it was something that feels like 112 degrees Fahrenheit, and so I had to carry this box.

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:21,780
Speaker 3: I got on the train, the light rail, at a mere $1.60, and on the way to the con, the train stopped in the middle of the tracks.

78
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,159
Speaker 3: No lights, not at a stop or anything.

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,439
Speaker 3: Total blackness.

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,160
Speaker 3: I was expecting judgment night to happen, and then the train starts going backwards.

81
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,940
Speaker 3: It stops for about 20 minutes, and then eventually I got here.

82
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:40,360
Speaker 1: I got a phone call from him as well, and I'm about to wish him goodbye.

83
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,480
Speaker 3: Not even good luck.

84
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,560
Speaker 2: Tell him about the hobos.

85
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,479
Speaker 2: There's a lot of hobos in Baltimore.

86
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,460
Speaker 0: Baltimore is the home of the hobo.

87
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,620
Speaker 2: Well, they're not technically hobos, they're bums.

88
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,280
Speaker 2: A hobo is someone who actually works and just doesn't have a home and kind of does things that are homeless.

89
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,098
Speaker 4: You guys clearly do not inhabit populated areas.

90
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:21,840
Speaker 4: Joel and I, being from the wonderful metropolitan area of Philadelphia, are acclimated to spending no less than $2 for a public transit fare, not actually getting to the intended destination, and being harassed by hobos or bums, should you prefer.

91
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,599
Speaker 3: Fortunately, I've played Condemned Criminal Origins and know exactly how to deal with hobos with a wood stick.

92
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,239
Speaker 1: Door of a locker, man.

93
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:41,960
Speaker 2: All right, so after everyone did or did not get here peacefully or quickly, there was a pre-reg line.

94
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:43,999
Speaker 2: What did you think of the pre-reg line?

95
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,039
Speaker 0: Are you going to go through every single thing?

96
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,265
Speaker 2: No, no I'm not.

97
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,693
Speaker 2: I'm going to go through the major things.

98
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,980
Speaker 2: I think the pre-reg line is pretty major.

99
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,160
Speaker 2: Is that the only thing that happened on Thursday at all?

100
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,507
Speaker 0: We ran into three cosplayers.

101
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:58,200
Speaker 0: I asked them what the fuck they thought they were doing, and that was it.

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:58,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

103
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,820
Speaker 1: I stood next to a really fat man with an Evangelion tattoo, and I got a photograph of it too.

104
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,940
Speaker 0: A really fat man at an anime con.

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,207
Speaker 0: Yeah.

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,779
Speaker 4: I've seen that same fat man in years past.

107
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:10,599
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,539
Speaker 4: Unit one on what, the left?

109
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:13,860
Speaker 1: On the right shoulder.

110
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,617
Speaker 4: Oh, there you go.

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaker 3: You have to be the guy.

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,630
Speaker 2: Wow.

113
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:17,739
Speaker 2: Oh, scary.

114
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:28,260
Speaker 2: Yeah, the people at the front of the line said they were there since, like, stupid early in the morning, but then we just went out there at, like, six, and it only took ten, fifteen minutes to get through the line.

115
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, they let us in early just to sit inside there because they were sure that people were going to die from the heat stroke.

116
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,488
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, pretty stupid people.

117
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:39,179
Speaker 2: They had umbrellas though, which is smarter than we were.

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,419
Speaker 2: We were not smart enough to bring the umbrella to block out the sun.

119
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,278
Speaker 2: That was an idea we never would have had.

120
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,560
Speaker 2: All right, so fast forward to Friday morning.

121
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,520
Speaker 0: How about two things we did at the con?

122
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,520
Speaker 2: Yeah, what did you do Friday morning?

123
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:54,079
Speaker 2: Anyone remember?

124
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,939
Speaker 2: You went to work, really?

125
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:56,795
Speaker 3: We shut up.

126
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,710
Speaker 3: I didn't get here until 9.50 on Friday.

127
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:05,619
Speaker 2: And you still had to pay the, you know, the three day fare to get in.

128
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:06,599
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.

129
00:09:06,821 --> 00:09:06,906
Speaker 2: Yeah.

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,620
Speaker 1: That's right.

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 1: I spent, I got in and I spent the two hours at the artist's table.

132
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,080
Speaker 4: But we didn't have to wait in the pre-regs line.

133
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:13,602
Speaker 2: Oh.

134
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:14,719
Speaker 0: True.

135
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,308
Speaker 2: Pund.

136
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:15,685
Speaker 0: Hmm.

137
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,280
Speaker 1: Did you guys go to any panels?

138
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,056
Speaker 2: We went to...

139
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,559
Speaker 0: Well, fantastically, many of us went to a certain panel just a little while ago.

140
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:24,855
Speaker 2: Oh, that was...

141
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:25,759
Speaker 1: On Friday?

142
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:26,400
Speaker 1: On Friday morning?

143
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,420
Speaker 2: On Friday morning we went to the OC remix panel.

144
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:29,380
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.

145
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,920
Speaker 2: Where we finally got permission from DJ Fredzel.

146
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:36,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, our opening song, we never actually got permission, technically.

147
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,759
Speaker 0: We just asked him for it and he didn't answer and that was good enough.

148
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,268
Speaker 2: Yep.

149
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Speaker 2: So, and we figure he gives the MP3 away for free, he doesn't mind.

150
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:46,660
Speaker 2: And he didn't mind, he was totally cool, but yeah.

151
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,380
Speaker 0: I didn't actually stay at the panel, so I can't talk about it.

152
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:55,057
Speaker 2: It was actually, as panels go, it was pretty good because they had live performances and stuff.

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,479
Speaker 2: They played music and they sang stuff.

154
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,560
Speaker 2: It was much more than I expected.

155
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Speaker 2: And then some people actually asked some moderately intelligent questions.

156
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,380
Speaker 1: I went to the Sentai panel.

157
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:13,860
Speaker 1: I don't have anything funny to say about it, but they played a 16 minute clip of every single opening to every single Super Sentai show that's ever been created.

158
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,699
Speaker 3: I think lots and lots of running away from explosions and rock quarries.

159
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Speaker 2: Did they seriously do every- Are you sure it was every single one ever?

160
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:22,899
Speaker 1: Every single Super Sentai.

161
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:23,517
Speaker 1: Ah.

162
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,298
Speaker 3: Which is totally different from Battle Heroes and Kamen Rider.

163
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,380
Speaker 4: We've done the research and they're all pretty much the same.

164
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,260
Speaker 1: Oh my god, were they?

165
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,940
Speaker 0: Well, was the panel well done at least?

166
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,000
Speaker 1: It was very well done.

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,500
Speaker 1: These people seemed to know what they were doing.

168
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Speaker 1: Well, that makes one.

169
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:39,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

170
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,940
Speaker 1: Then again, I only stood there for the video, so whoever did that video was really good.

171
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,236
Speaker 1: I walked out after it.

172
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:57,880
Speaker 3: Yeah, I was thinking of going to History of Gainax, but it was just two dudes I'd never heard of with no visual aids whatsoever talking about how Gainax existed there.

173
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,300
Speaker 0: Seems a lot of panels were like that this year.

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
Speaker 0: There's someone talking about something.

175
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:05,539
Speaker 0: Like, I'm going to talk about something I know nothing about.

176
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

177
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:11,020
Speaker 2: When I go to a panel, I expect to be informed about something I do not know.

178
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,639
Speaker 2: If I went to the Super Sentai panel, I would want someone to teach me the difference between Super Sentai and non-Super Sentai.

179
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,438
Speaker 0: Ultra Sentai.

180
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:18,853
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Speaker 3: I believe they did go into that to their credit.

182
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 2: Because then that's a good panel, but the Science in Anime panel, as the contrary, which I spent about less than a minute in, was just nerds going nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, and they really didn't have anything intelligent or informative to say at all.

183
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,420
Speaker 2: Totally uninspiring and a waste of time.

184
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,120
Speaker 3: Yeah, on the subject of that, I went to Anime Name That Tune.

185
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:54,040
Speaker 3: It was run by a girl, and she had decided she'd cut out 300 of these little paper egg-shaped things, and whoever had the most of them at the end would win.

186
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:12,499
Speaker 3: And she got through about 40 songs because the thing was an hour long, and half the songs were from the same shows, and she's like, "Well, this is probably the second oldest thing I've got, and I've lost at life and have to commit ritual suicide because someone else beat me to Fist of the North Star.

187
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:16,037
Speaker 2: Part

188
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:16,119
Speaker 2: two.".

189
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,557
Speaker 2: Part two?

190
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,220
Speaker 3: No, no, tough boy.

191
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:19,617
Speaker 0: Tough boy.

192
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:33,559
Speaker 1: And yeah, I gave up on going to see Nobuteru Yuki, the character designer, because I wanted to check out older Otaku, and every year before they had these real old guys there, these guys that were watching Astro Boy and 8-Man when it came on TV.

193
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:37,459
Speaker 1: This year, they had guys that were my age.

194
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:39,780
Speaker 0: Isn't that a scary feeling?

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they were talking about, oh, back in the day of Streamline and trading tapes.

196
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,139
Speaker 1: I wanted people back in the day of Super 8, back in the day before Color TV.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,139
Speaker 2: Well, there are some of those guys that were at the Club Summit, actually.

198
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are those guys who ... I don't know their names or anything.

199
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,280
Speaker 2: I don't know what their club is.

200
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,279
Speaker 2: What's the name of their club again?

201
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,959
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

202
00:12:57,262 --> 00:13:03,880
Speaker 2: But there are these three guys who've been coming to the Club Summit every year, as long as we've been here, because they run this anime club of old guys.

203
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,379
Speaker 2: It's like this community club, and they watch the oldest stuff you've ever heard of.

204
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,000
Speaker 2: It's way cool when they talk about it.

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,319
Speaker 3: That's why it's called Oldurotaku, but not Oldist.

206
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,650
Speaker 2: Yeah.

207
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:15,099
Speaker 2: Oldotaku.

208
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,679
Speaker 2: I mean, it's like they're talking about 8th Man, and 8th Man is new stuff to them.

209
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,295
Speaker 3: Tobor the 8th Man, the brand new prehistoric monster.

210
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Speaker 3: I don't even remember the lyrics to that stupid song.

211
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,118
Speaker 3: Something about how the FBI is helpless back in the days when the FBI was capable of repelling alien invasion.

212
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:47,510
Speaker 1: I should mention it took about 45 minutes to get into the dealer's room after the line got moving, an hour after the line got moving.

213
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:53,870
Speaker 0: I don't know what was up with that, because usually people don't line up in that quantity for the dealer's room in Otakon.

214
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,870
Speaker 0: That was a surprise.

215
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:58,370
Speaker 1: What was interesting was that the line got longer as it started moving.

216
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, why was that?

217
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,109
Speaker 0: I mean, there was nothing else to do with Otakon?

218
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:05,490
Speaker 2: I think that had something to do with just not pushing people into the room fast enough.

219
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,064
Speaker 2: I mean, usually on Friday, the line builds up, and then as soon as the room opens, the line disappears in less than an hour, less than a half hour.

220
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 2: But this year, it just stuck around for a long, long time, and they couldn't get people into the room fast enough.

221
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,970
Speaker 2: And yet they close it at 8 on Friday, and at 6 on Saturday.

222
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:22,477
Speaker 2: Yeah.

223
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:23,769
Speaker 2: I don't know.

224
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:24,227
Speaker 2: Why?

225
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,708
Speaker 0: A lot of cons have been closing dealer's rooms earlier and earlier these years.

226
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:35,130
Speaker 2: I think it's possibly to encourage, because when the dealer's room is open, that pretty much takes away a giant pile of people from any event that's going on.

227
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,069
Speaker 2: So if they want to encourage people to go to certain events, they'll close the dealer's room earlier, open it later.

228
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,030
Speaker 3: And that's what Otakon needs, more people at the events, because there just aren't enough people at Otakon to go around.

229
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,470
Speaker 2: Once they close the dealer's room, they can't seat everybody anywhere.

230
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,069
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is true.

231
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,910
Speaker 0: Though at least Otakon has mitigated that now.

232
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,664
Speaker 0: I mean, the Masquerade can seat like 15,000 people now.

233
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,570
Speaker 0: If you want to see the Masquerade, you can see it.

234
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,689
Speaker 0: There's no longer a question of getting into that room.

235
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,064
Speaker 2: Yeah, that did used to be a problem where people would line up for the cosplay, and only some of them would get in, and the rest would go, "Ah,

236
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:10,406
Speaker 2: dammit.".

237
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:17,069
Speaker 2: Now, the number one biggest event at the entire con, anyone who wants to see it can see it, and they just have to walk down the street.

238
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:25,330
Speaker 2: The thing is, I didn't really notice when... When that was going on, the con would be empty, but I never really noticed the con being empty.

239
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:32,790
Speaker 0: Because a lot of people are like us, and we'd never go to masquerades ever, for various reasons ranging from dislike of cosplay to dislike of cosplay.

240
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,647
Speaker 2: To the fact that, you know...

241
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,670
Speaker 0: Well, cosplay skits at least.

242
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:44,170
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, the cosplay is traditionally, there are three awesome skits that are entertaining as hell, and then the rest of them are painful, painful, painful.

243
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,079
Speaker 3: Three?

244
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,790
Speaker 3: That's generous.

245
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,610
Speaker 2: That is generous.

246
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,050
Speaker 2: It is Otakon, so there would be three at Otakon, and there would be one or fewer at any other?

247
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:53,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that Muppet-Utena one a few years ago.

248
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:53,930
Speaker 2: That was just amazing.

249
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,468
Speaker 2: That was amazing, but it's really just not worth it to sit through 30 terrible ones to see the three.

250
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,430
Speaker 3: I, for one, am quite glad that I don't even know where that cosplay was held.

251
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:03,830
Speaker 3: It was in some magic building.

252
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,550
Speaker 0: There's the Baltimore, what's it called?

253
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:08,490
Speaker 0: The First Mariner Arena, which is a hockey arena.

254
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,209
Speaker 2: It was where the Larkins Yale concert was.

255
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:11,470
Speaker 3: Oh, okay, that.

256
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,550
Speaker 3: Yeah, full-on arena.

257
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,710
Speaker 3: At the convention I've never been to before.

258
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,770
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.

259
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:16,263
Speaker 2: Yeah.

260
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:27,010
Speaker 2: But, yeah, at night, you think all the stuff at night's 18+, you know, all the kids would go home, and they did, but, you know, everything still filled up like crazy.

261
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,249
Speaker 2: I mean, even frickin', what was that movie we just went to?

262
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,509
Speaker 2: I forget what it's called.

263
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,450
Speaker 2: Sex and Fury?

264
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:33,328
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.

265
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,470
Speaker 2: It just filled up with people, and then halfway through the movie, all the people left.

266
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,190
Speaker 2: It's like, why did you get in line in the first place?

267
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, did you guys hit any of that?

268
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,150
Speaker 4: Because the name of the movie is Sex and Fury.

269
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:42,548
Speaker 2: I know.

270
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:43,697
Speaker 0: 18+ content?

271
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:48,330
Speaker 3: And they must have all realized there's far too much sex and not nearly enough fury.

272
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,309
Speaker 2: That was, I was going personally for the Fury, and I was dealt with too much sex, and...

273
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,670
Speaker 3: There was no man in a space suit with a flamethrower blasting off into the cosmonaut.

274
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,108
Speaker 3: The Fury, yeah.

275
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,490
Speaker 3: And Lethal Weapon 4, that's right.

276
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,530
Speaker 3: Opening scene where Danny Glover has to dance like a chicken.

277
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,490
Speaker 1: Okay, so, back to what we were doing.

278
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:24,488
Speaker 2: Yeah, did anyone go to any of those other 18+ nighttime things that we didn't go to?

279
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,906
Speaker 1: Confidentially, yes.

280
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:28,989
Speaker 2: Well, I meant...

281
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,390
Speaker 0: Well, in the interest of journalism.

282
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:30,838
Speaker 2: Yeah.

283
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,549
Speaker 1: Well, what did I see?

284
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,530
Speaker 2: Let's see, what was there?

285
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,170
Speaker 2: Did anyone actually go to the...

286
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,550
Speaker 0: I mean, actually, at Gerald's recommendation, I went and watched a good movie.

287
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,604
Speaker 0: 15 minutes of...

288
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:42,450
Speaker 2: We've been trying to figure it out.

289
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,230
Speaker 3: It was drawing hentai, is my understanding.

290
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,510
Speaker 2: That's what our understanding was too, but we're not sure.

291
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 4: That's totally weak that you would name your panel that.

292
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,370
Speaker 2: I think they named it that to attract people, and it worked because they're...

293
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,610
Speaker 3: And then the con guide, when you look at it, it just says hentai drawing.

294
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,869
Speaker 3: Like, they wussed out on it.

295
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,788
Speaker 3: It says do-it-yourself bukake on this.

296
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,649
Speaker 2: Read the, uh, read it from the book.

297
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,730
Speaker 2: Read it from the book.

298
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:05,630
Speaker 3: It's written there, but it's changed on, like, the revised schedule.

299
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:06,706
Speaker 3: Yeah.

300
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:10,430
Speaker 3: Like, if it's do-it-yourself... Well, don't make the girl wait.

301
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,130
Speaker 3: No, listen.

302
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,370
Speaker 3: That is not the terrifying panel.

303
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,469
Speaker 3: That's the panel with the most terrifying name.

304
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,290
Speaker 3: The terrifying panel was the hookups panel.

305
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,570
Speaker 3: Oh my god, yes.

306
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,590
Speaker 3: Let's get social.

307
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,750
Speaker 2: Oh, Scott Johnson went to that, didn't he?

308
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, there wasn't the ratio of men to women, like, three to one, and that only increased as the night went on.

309
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,870
Speaker 4: Did you say only three to one?

310
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:33,390
Speaker 3: I don't know.

311
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,296
Speaker 3: There were a lot of things.

312
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:36,070
Speaker 3: I just walked in and was terrified by.

313
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,130
Speaker 3: The anime parliament.

314
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:38,207
Speaker 3: I walked in.

315
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,614
Speaker 2: Oh, god.

316
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,089
Speaker 3: Have you ever been to one of those before?

317
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,170
Speaker 3: No, no, I never heard of it.

318
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:42,130
Speaker 2: It's like, what is this?

319
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,970
Speaker 0: Did you know what it was walking into it?

320
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,750
Speaker 3: No, I was like, anime parliament.

321
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:46,508
Speaker 3: What are they gonna do?

322
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:47,330
Speaker 3: And then it's like, huh?

323
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,450
Speaker 2: They have those at a lot of Northeast cons, and it's quite frightening.

324
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,089
Speaker 3: Note to self, never attend Northeast cons.

325
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,090
Speaker 2: No, just never attend anime parliament.

326
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,930
Speaker 1: Wait, what is anime parliament?

327
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,309
Speaker 3: Yeah, what is anime parliament?

328
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:10,308
Speaker 3: Anime parliament is... Free bonus gear!

329
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,230
Speaker 0: I mean, you just saw, you experienced it for the first time.

330
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:20,687
Speaker 3: I walked in and walked out instantly just because it was like, oh, well, the archangel has been sentenced to being a ripoff of...

331
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:34,550
Speaker 0: The way it was explained to me, because I have never stayed in one of these for more than about 15.5 seconds, is that people who have a grievance with an anime will come in and say, like, my favorite character shouldn't have died in this show.

332
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,770
Speaker 0: And then the panel will pass judgment, like, yeah, they shouldn't have.

333
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,569
Speaker 0: They're hereby alive.

334
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,030
Speaker 1: So that's not even really parliament.

335
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:40,709
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

336
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,483
Speaker 0: All right, allow me to read...

337
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,329
Speaker 2: Sit down, sit down, sit down.

338
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,150
Speaker 2: Allow me to read the description from the con book here.

339
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,389
Speaker 0: Ava didn't end like that.

340
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:59,650
Speaker 2: At anime parliament, you, as your chosen character, can strive, so there's role-playing involved, can strive to clear your name, get justice, or argue for admission into another anime universe.

341
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:04,010
Speaker 2: Bring witnesses to provide counter defenses and increase your chances of swaying the pose.

342
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,590
Speaker 0: All right, the looks on everyone's faces were priceless, as that was read.

343
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,023
Speaker 1: Just the black hole of...

344
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,841
Speaker 0: This is just, I expect a guy to walk in in a football jersey and scream,

345
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,848
Speaker 0: "Nerds!"

346
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:19,620
Speaker 0: That would be so great.

347
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,035
Speaker 4: You could be like Gendo Akari and be like, "No, rape and incest is totally

348
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:24,697
Speaker 4: cool.".

349
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:33,817
Speaker 1: That's pretty lame that they couldn't even get the name right, because they're not actually legislating.

350
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:36,480
Speaker 1: They're adjudicated.

351
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,239
Speaker 3: No, it's anime supreme court.

352
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:44,920
Speaker 3: Where's James Caan when you need him?

353
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,820
Speaker 3: He's an expert in the aforementioned art of adjudication.

354
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,300
Speaker 1: Part of it isn't exactly a foreign concept in the Western world.

355
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,420
Speaker 1: You can look up the rules to parliament anywhere, in a local library, the internet.

356
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,797
Speaker 3: Nobody else likes the way of the gun.

357
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,080
Speaker 3: Robert's Rules of Order comes second nature to otaku.

358
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,760
Speaker 2: They do indeed.

359
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,819
Speaker 0: That is in fact the second time in this con that Robert's Rules of Order have come up, because I talked about it extensively in our panel.

360
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,420
Speaker 3: At the Anime Club Summit, whether or not Robert's Rules of Order need to be invoked.

361
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,076
Speaker 2: Occasionally they do.

362
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,880
Speaker 2: They are very important.

363
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:24,180
Speaker 3: In terms of other things that were very important, we went to I Can't Believe You Haven't Seen That, which is a panel that we had just ripped off ourselves.

364
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:25,038
Speaker 1: One week ago.

365
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,678
Speaker 3: About one week ago, and we wanted to see how the real pros would do it.

366
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:31,880
Speaker 3: It turns out you were the pros.

367
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,113
Speaker 3: Yeah, well...

368
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,580
Speaker 1: They didn't do a bad job.

369
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:35,679
Speaker 1: They were good guys.

370
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,830
Speaker 1: Yeah.

371
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,820
Speaker 1: There's no humor in there.

372
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,046
Speaker 2: What did they not believe?

373
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:39,570
Speaker 2: I haven't seen?

374
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,020
Speaker 3: They had things like Future Boy Conan and Bobby's Girl, which is this really obscure madhouse OAV.

375
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,679
Speaker 2: Yeah, I never heard of that.

376
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,060
Speaker 3: That Gerald and this guy are the only people on the planet to own.

377
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:52,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

378
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:56,960
Speaker 3: And then they also had perennial classics such as Riding Bean.

379
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:58,038
Speaker 2: Riding Bean!

380
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,900
Speaker 2: I saw Riding Bean at the Anime Club Library.

381
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,340
Speaker 1: And the special How to Teach Your Children Absolutely Useless English through Doraemon.

382
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:09,688
Speaker 1: Singing things like.

383
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,240
Speaker 1: I've Been Working on the Railroad.

384
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:12,080
Speaker 1: I saw that!

385
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,698
Speaker 3: I recently saw that!

386
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,140
Speaker 3: Did you see it with the ridiculous warning subtitles?

387
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,239
Speaker 3: Like, warning, hobos will take your money in.

388
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,679
Speaker 3: Well, you don't actually work on the railroads.

389
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:30,460
Speaker 3: Yeah, and then they closed things off by showing The Wizard of Speed and Time.

390
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,320
Speaker 2: I don't know what that is, but it sounds awesome.

391
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,237
Speaker 3: I can't believe you haven't seen that!

392
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,069
Speaker 3: And then the other panel.

393
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,379
Speaker 3: I was sort of let down by... Actually, let me back up.

394
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,879
Speaker 3: Digital Fan Subbing.

395
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,400
Speaker 3: That was like Live Evil.

396
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:49,619
Speaker 3: The panel.

397
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,440
Speaker 0: Great.

398
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:51,437
Speaker 3: What did they say?

399
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Speaker 3: They talked about how much better they are than professional subtitlers.

400
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,420
Speaker 3: Because they put a billion liner notes on the screen as someone talks.

401
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,739
Speaker 2: And they use fancy... It's all about karaoke opening theme songs.

402
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,489
Speaker 2: Yeah!

403
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,599
Speaker 2: It's all about fancy fonts that sometimes are hard to read.

404
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,659
Speaker 0: I mean, that makes it.

405
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,820
Speaker 0: Fullmetal Alchemist crap without that karaoke.

406
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,959
Speaker 1: Also, failing to interpret context.

407
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,320
Speaker 1: Very important in any fan sub operation.

408
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, being very liberal with use of obscenities.

409
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,153
Speaker 3: Then the next panel.

410
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:29,980
Speaker 3: I went to... I'd gone to this because of the recommendation of Aaron from the Weekly Anime Review podcast who's forgettably not here because it's like three in the morning.

411
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,780
Speaker 3: It's Your Favorite Anime Sucks, the panel.

412
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,380
Speaker 0: I had high hopes for that.

413
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,039
Speaker 3: I had really high hopes for it because on other internet message boards I have as my avatar Your Favorite Anime Sucks.

414
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 3: And I do panels at conventions entitled Anime That Sucks.

415
00:23:45,102 --> 00:24:02,197
Speaker 3: But my approach is that I show clips of anime that sucks and their approach is, "Well, we're three guys on stage and the audience, we're gonna call people from the audience and they're just gonna say an anime name and we're just gonna fire back why it

416
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:02,538
Speaker 3: sucks.".

417
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,960
Speaker 3: Which, I guess if you're really fast on your feet, and to these guys' credit, they were all really fast on their feet, it could work.

418
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:11,940
Speaker 3: But I just didn't think it was funny.

419
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:13,136
Speaker 3: I don't know.

420
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,199
Speaker 4: Could you give an example of what was said?

421
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:16,251
Speaker 3: Alright.

422
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:23,220
Speaker 3: Someone said something like... They had a few things worked out in advance, you could tell.

423
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,596
Speaker 3: Someone said, "Oh, Bleach is the obvious

424
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:25,797
Speaker 3: one.".

425
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,769
Speaker 3: And then they said,

426
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,135
Speaker 3: "Alright.".

427
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,992
Speaker 3: And then they all put their mics down and said, "Alright, let's do a trust

428
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:31,276
Speaker 3: check.".

429
00:24:31,741 --> 00:24:33,638
Speaker 3: And then one guy got behind him and he's like, "Alright, trust

430
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:33,800
Speaker 3: check.".

431
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,159
Speaker 3: And he fell back and caught the guy.

432
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,415
Speaker 3: And he's like, "Alright, now, Bleach, do that with

433
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:38,797
Speaker 3: swords.".

434
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:40,659
Speaker 3: That's the joke.

435
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,100
Speaker 2: I was gonna make the cricket noise.

436
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:51,529
Speaker 3: And then things like, "Space Runaway

437
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:51,730
Speaker 3: Idion.".

438
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,099
Speaker 3: The guy who was running the panel happened to have an Idion shirt on.

439
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:04,337
Speaker 3: And he said, "This is a show where a five-year-old girl, you get to see her head burned to a crisp, and then everyone in the universe

440
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:04,680
Speaker 3: dies.".

441
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,429
Speaker 3: And I said, "Wait a second, I thought you said explain why the anime sucks, not why it's totally freaking

442
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:11,670
Speaker 3: awesome.".

443
00:25:11,831 --> 00:25:13,148
Speaker 1: They put you on the stage.

444
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:15,429
Speaker 3: They didn't call on me.

445
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,570
Speaker 3: I had my hand up for a good hour straight.

446
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,645
Speaker 3: 'cause they must have sensed...

447
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,630
Speaker 2: What anime were you gonna say if they called on you?

448
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,072
Speaker 3: I was gonna say Madbolt 34.

449
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:28,429
Speaker 3: And any reason they could have possibly given me for why the anime was bad would in fact have been...

450
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,539
Speaker 2: I think that would be the trick, is to name an anime.

451
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,630
Speaker 2: they never heard of that way.

452
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,410
Speaker 2: What did they say about it?

453
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,910
Speaker 3: Well, they took great pride in the fact that it's impossible to stump us 'cause we know every single anime that you could possibly name.

454
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,348
Speaker 1: Don't ever say that around us.

455
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:41,168
Speaker 2: Yeah.

456
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:43,188
Speaker 3: They were smart to not call on me.

457
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,884
Speaker 2: Also, they got one wrong.

458
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:52,629
Speaker 2: Someone called out High School Rumble and they confused it, I think, with Combustible Campus Guardress.

459
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:58,650
Speaker 1: And while Daryl was at this panel, I was witnessing Art in Motion.

460
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,330
Speaker 1: I was at the movie Belladonna.

461
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,129
Speaker 1: And this is a... It's supposed to be a porno movie that Osamu Tezuka did.

462
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,490
Speaker 1: I don't know what was going on in that movie.

463
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,270
Speaker 1: What are you doing, Daryl?

464
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,054
Speaker 3: I'm seizing the microphone from you so I can mention how.

465
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:21,463
Speaker 3: if you thought the experimental shorts that Geek Notes reviewed by Tezuka a few weeks back were weird, Belladonna...

466
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, we ran into... Belladonna, holy shit.

467
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:34,748
Speaker 1: There was a scene in there of a woman whooping fish that flew into the air and then she ripped herself open and balls fell out of her.

468
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:37,910
Speaker 2: That reminds me of that thing we saw at the sex museum.

469
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:38,565
Speaker 2: Oh, God.

470
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:39,190
Speaker 2: Remember that?

471
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:46,678
Speaker 0: Because Adam and I ran into Daryl after he'd come out of that, obviously, and he mentioned it and I was like, "Tezuka porn.

472
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:47,425
Speaker 0: There's no

473
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:47,808
Speaker 0: way.".

474
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:56,249
Speaker 0: So I went and it's a woman talking to this demon who turns into a giant penis and then there's this yellow submarine kind of sex scene and I have no idea what was going on.

475
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:03,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I saw that scene where she was supposedly having sex and she got fatter and fatter and fatter and exploded.

476
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,249
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, the camera's zooming in more and more and more.

477
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:06,828
Speaker 2: Yeah.

478
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,508
Speaker 3: You can buy this movie on DVD.

479
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:23,630
Speaker 1: It's kind of a three-pack along with Cleopatra, the queen of sex, and A Thousand and One Nights, and Cleopatra has Mark Anthony fighting in a gladiatorial combat and he gets thrown a handgun.

480
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:27,569
Speaker 2: We gotta get that.

481
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:28,988
Speaker 0: Yes, we have to review that.

482
00:27:29,655 --> 00:27:30,710
Speaker 2: Is that not how it happened?

483
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,109
Speaker 1: And Julius Caesar as Syphilis.

484
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,196
Speaker 2: Yeah, when they...

485
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:39,410
Speaker 1: There's a ninja as well and there's Gamelons, I swear to God.

486
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,409
Speaker 2: What's the limit on that?

487
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:42,190
Speaker 0: We're good, we're good.

488
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,650
Speaker 2: I like my history better with Gamelons.

489
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,950
Speaker 1: So everyone out there, find Belladonna.

490
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:49,086
Speaker 1: You will never be the same again.

491
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,025
Speaker 2: God.

492
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,649
Speaker 1: Wait, you're recommending it on those grounds?

493
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,509
Speaker 1: Holy shit, yes.

494
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:59,250
Speaker 3: He was shaking, he was sweating, his eye, his pupils were fully dilated.

495
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:00,989
Speaker 2: The man was jittering.

496
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:02,470
Speaker 2: We have it on tape.

497
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,309
Speaker 4: Now that was something else.

498
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one thing.

499
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:12,810
Speaker 0: listeners of all of our shows here, if any of us say don't watch something, we're not saying don't watch it as in oh my god it's hilarious.

500
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:14,046
Speaker 0: watch it because it's bad.

501
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,117
Speaker 0: We're like don't watch it.

502
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,510
Speaker 2: Just don't fucking watch it.

503
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,710
Speaker 2: You're wasting precious moments in your life.

504
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,270
Speaker 0: Empty geist.

505
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:29,269
Speaker 2: You're only going to live for probably around 60 to 80 years, you know, why spend a whole hour of it watching something completely terrible and that will only bring you pain.

506
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,109
Speaker 2: Unless you're into that sort of thing.

507
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,349
Speaker 2: Because it makes really awesome podcasts.

508
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:36,388
Speaker 1: That's the entire purpose of our podcast really.

509
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:38,590
Speaker 2: Yeah.

510
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:40,245
Speaker 2: Meanwhile, speaking of terrible.

511
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:42,249
Speaker 3: To trick people into watching horrible things.

512
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:50,012
Speaker 2: Speaking of terrible things, while they were watching Belladonna and whatnot, I watched Lady Terminator followed by Art of the Devil 2.

513
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:51,149
Speaker 2: Lady Terminator was.

514
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,110
Speaker 2: it was so stupid.

515
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:54,708
Speaker 2: Oh my god.

516
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,589
Speaker 0: So why did you watch it?

517
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:57,476
Speaker 2: I don't know.

518
00:28:57,496 --> 00:29:00,549
Speaker 2: We walked into it and like in the middle of it.

519
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,263
Speaker 0: I was out experiencing art.

520
00:29:02,404 --> 00:29:03,829
Speaker 0: You know, giant penis demons.

521
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,109
Speaker 2: This was, well there were penises I guess.

522
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,764
Speaker 2: It was a woman acting much in the same way.

523
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:14,688
Speaker 0: Could you be a little more specific?

524
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,281
Speaker 2: Alright well, the Lady Terminator most of the people she killed blows them down with an Uzi that has infinite ammo somehow.

525
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:29,154
Speaker 2: But occasionally she would like take her shirt off you know, use her moderate breasts to attract some men.

526
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:31,176
Speaker 2: Then she, you know, they would Of course.

527
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:32,109
Speaker 2: Wait, was this a live action movie?

528
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,877
Speaker 2: Yes it was.

529
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,170
Speaker 1: I've seen this movie before.

530
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,196
Speaker 2: She would have sex with them and then they would die of like bloody face pukake somehow.

531
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,952
Speaker 0: Someone just explained to us that there was some sort of snake in her that was biting them.

532
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:45,379
Speaker 2: I think that's what someone did say but I wasn't sure.

533
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,189
Speaker 2: Looks like a ninja scroll.

534
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:46,930
Speaker 1: That's right.

535
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:54,750
Speaker 2: Later on in the movie she inexplicably acquired a third means of dealing out death which were eye lasers.

536
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,390
Speaker 2: that could, well, when fired at a helicopter caused it to explode.

537
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:04,265
Speaker 2: when fired at a man, they caused him to fall down and die, but when fired at the main character they just didn't do anything at all.

538
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:05,993
Speaker 2: Awesome.

539
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,840
Speaker 2: The eye lasers are completely unexplained.

540
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:08,973
Speaker 1: Eye lasers from who's eyes?

541
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:09,559
Speaker 1: Her eyes?

542
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,073
Speaker 2: From the Lady Terminator's eyes.

543
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:14,489
Speaker 1: So she shot them into a mirror and they bounced back?

544
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:17,155
Speaker 2: No, she shot them at a helicopter which exploded.

545
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:18,510
Speaker 2: Oh, the main character.

546
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,236
Speaker 2: The main character was some white blonde guy.

547
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:22,346
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

548
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,397
Speaker 1: I thought she was the main character.

549
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:29,539
Speaker 2: No, no, no, she was like, you know, it was more like the John Connor couldn't be killed with the eye lasers.

550
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,510
Speaker 2: She was the title character but not... Exactly.

551
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,258
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we should probably move this along a bit mostly to the fact that I'm going to pass out due to tiredness.

552
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:38,530
Speaker 2: And we have a panel tomorrow.

553
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:39,960
Speaker 0: Yes.

554
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:41,940
Speaker 0: General impressions of the con.

555
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:42,809
Speaker 0: The dealer's room.

556
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:44,690
Speaker 0: How was it?

557
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,215
Speaker 0: What do you think?

558
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:50,630
Speaker 1: I spent $120 there on Monday buying cool stuff so I was kind of happy.

559
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:55,376
Speaker 0: The front row crew combined bought, I think, five box sets of giant robo.

560
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:58,771
Speaker 2: And like four Zeta Gundam boxes because they were $40.

561
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:01,194
Speaker 1: I got all of Master Keaton that I didn't already have.

562
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:01,640
Speaker 0: Yes.

563
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,510
Speaker 2: Yes, we got that.

564
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:08,127
Speaker 4: Whoever bought all Master Keaton and all Big O box sets, man, F you.

565
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:11,883
Speaker 2: But there were none left.

566
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:12,710
Speaker 2: Isn't that what you're saying?

567
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,909
Speaker 4: There weren't any left like last night.

568
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:16,081
Speaker 2: Oh, man.

569
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:16,730
Speaker 2: That's rough.

570
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:17,447
Speaker 2: That's rough.

571
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:19,364
Speaker 2: Yeah.

572
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,530
Speaker 2: Screw that guy, though, for having Crying Freemen.

573
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,069
Speaker 2: volume one and three and not two.

574
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,228
Speaker 2: Making three unbuyable and two not being there also unbuyable.

575
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:31,873
Speaker 0: Honestly, though, the dealer's room was generally not... I'm just jaded, I think.

576
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:39,651
Speaker 0: It wasn't impressive anymore because it's mostly bleach and Naruto and like the same Gundam seed things every year now.

577
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,995
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of hard to be impressed by a dealer's room.

578
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:42,217
Speaker 1: True.

579
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:46,869
Speaker 1: Which is why I spent $120 buying really freaking obscure weird stuff.

580
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:48,805
Speaker 1: That wasn't porn related.

581
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:49,715
Speaker 1: I better make that clear.

582
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:54,583
Speaker 2: The thing is like a lot of the weird stuff we see is either just weird old crap.

583
00:31:54,604 --> 00:32:03,450
Speaker 2: You don't want it or it's like I saw this great Galaxy Express poster from back in the day and it was like 30 bucks and I'm like, oh, I like that but I'm not paying 30 bucks for a movie poster.

584
00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:11,555
Speaker 3: Yeah, there was another poster from the same dealer that I was considering getting a $25 theatrical poster for Odin.

585
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:12,325
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

586
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:15,154
Speaker 2: I would pay $25 for that.

587
00:32:17,073 --> 00:32:18,064
Speaker 2: That is totally worth it.

588
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,882
Speaker 2: But yet, I notice a lot of things are missing from the dealer's room this year.

589
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,420
Speaker 2: Like, uh, Viz wasn't there.

590
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:25,969
Speaker 2: Anyone see Viz?

591
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:28,126
Speaker 2: No.

592
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,370
Speaker 2: Viz, they usually give out those awesome bags.

593
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,990
Speaker 2: They weren't here last year, though, either, were they?

594
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,077
Speaker 2: I think they were.

595
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:34,750
Speaker 2: They gave out all the free bags again.

596
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,409
Speaker 2: Somebody missed it last year.

597
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,255
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Bandai totally dropped the ball this year.

598
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,559
Speaker 2: They usually sell all kinds of awesome robot shit.

599
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,794
Speaker 0: Bandai didn't even try to muscle their way into our panel like all the other companies.

600
00:32:44,814 --> 00:32:46,166
Speaker 2: Bandai was nowhere to be seen.

601
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,156
Speaker 2: I was like, where'd they go?

602
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,430
Speaker 3: They were somewhere to be seen.

603
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,614
Speaker 3: They were there in the $5 DVD section.

604
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:53,150
Speaker 3: It's all Bandai stuff.

605
00:32:57,613 --> 00:33:01,724
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you can't make it to a convention, I think, what's the website of the $5 DVD guy?

606
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:02,190
Speaker 2: They're awesome.

607
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,135
Speaker 2: Buy right?

608
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:03,969
Speaker 3: Buy right DVDs.

609
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:07,408
Speaker 3: We get to buy 15 of each thing before you can get the prices.

610
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:10,120
Speaker 1: Or sailors if you buy it off the website, really.

611
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:12,069
Speaker 2: Not cool.

612
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,710
Speaker 0: Do you guys hang out in the artist alley much?

613
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,949
Speaker 0: Check out all the art at the art show.

614
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,170
Speaker 1: Only fags are in the artist alley.

615
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,585
Speaker 1: Easy.

616
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:25,696
Speaker 2: Only fags and only cool booze.

617
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:30,629
Speaker 2: I guess it might be more evidence to our listeners that we're gay.

618
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,630
Speaker 1: By fag, you mean awesome.

619
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:36,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, the art room was all right.

620
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:37,420
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of it.

621
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:39,690
Speaker 0: Do you guys check out the art show?

622
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,723
Speaker 0: It's been my experience.

623
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:47,296
Speaker 0: I like big cons and I like small cons, but small con art shows have just been really bad this year.

624
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:53,557
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like you go to a con that's maybe a quarter the size of Otacon, but the art show is 1/100th the size.

625
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:58,210
Speaker 0: It's all the same tracings of the same scenes from Naruto.

626
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,890
Speaker 2: It'll be like four pictures on a bulletin board.

627
00:34:01,313 --> 00:34:06,826
Speaker 1: You don't have the art show personalities that we have in Florida, or at least we had in Florida.

628
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:10,221
Speaker 3: That are exceedingly hairy people.

629
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:14,308
Speaker 3: No offense to anyone who is present right now.

630
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:23,549
Speaker 3: Instead of setting up in the artist alley, they just set up a random table somewhere in a high traffic area and blare really loud obnoxious music.

631
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,348
Speaker 3: He's been banned from every Florida convention that I know of.

632
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:29,308
Speaker 1: Awesome.

633
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:34,489
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought the art show was pretty good this year compared to past years.

634
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:35,496
Speaker 0: I bid on things.

635
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:36,570
Speaker 0: It's rare for me to bid on things.

636
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,907
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think I've ever bid on anything before, but there was this cool Phoenix Wright and the minimum bid was like five bucks, so I was like hells.

637
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:42,029
Speaker 2: yeah.

638
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,599
Speaker 2: Comes in a frame.

639
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,969
Speaker 2: The frames are usually five bucks at the freaking store.

640
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,167
Speaker 2: Five bucks for a frame with a picture in it.

641
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,509
Speaker 0: Chris, we didn't delve into the porn room.

642
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,370
Speaker 2: No, no we did not.

643
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,509
Speaker 2: Did anyone else go in the porn part of the art show?

644
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:55,650
Speaker 1: There was a porn part?

645
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was hidden off and you had to be 18.

646
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,358
Speaker 2: Yeah, usually in past I noticed that this year they've done a lot more of the 18+ checking than in past years.

647
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:08,669
Speaker 2: I mean, it used to be you could have gone to see each of the killer three years ago without an ID check.

648
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:15,089
Speaker 2: In the artist's alley the porn was separated by a divider, but you could just walk back there.

649
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,679
Speaker 2: If you were a little kid and someone saw you, they might be like "Hey, what are you

650
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:17,842
Speaker 2: doing?".

651
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:24,050
Speaker 2: This year they were checking I18+ to go into the hidden area, which is more hidden than ever before.

652
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:35,448
Speaker 4: Man, not being able to just walk down the aisle and see a picture of say, Lena inverse getting a free limb It's like totally a different convention, man.

653
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:37,108
Speaker 1: Is that like roots getting root?

654
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,045
Speaker 1: I think I've got that.

655
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:47,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not going to complain about that at all because if anything it means I just don't get exposed to it either.

656
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,150
Speaker 2: I'm not complaining about it.

657
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,539
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not complaining.

658
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,670
Speaker 2: I'm actually also glad that I don't accidentally see nasty hentais.

659
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:03,837
Speaker 4: It's just, you know, I noticed You do still have to deal with the fairy eyes yourself for 275.

660
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:06,390
Speaker 2: I can't believe that guy has such a specific skill.

661
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,809
Speaker 2: I mean, talk about a one trick pony.

662
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:12,770
Speaker 2: I mean, he could have said "I paint you into something".

663
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:15,050
Speaker 2: No, only fairies.

664
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:22,710
Speaker 0: I would have gone with centaur but not fairy Of course, like three people independently Like, "Rim, you should do that.

665
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,095
Speaker 0: It'll be

666
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:23,624
Speaker 0: awesome.".

667
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,334
Speaker 2: We

668
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,202
Speaker 4: wanted to get one for

669
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:25,869
Speaker 3: one of our buddies

670
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:27,301
Speaker 1: Less than 270 dollars.

671
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,129
Speaker 1: That guy would have had like five commissions.

672
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:36,608
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like he's right over there, here's his picture as gay as possible.

673
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:44,589
Speaker 0: So I actually have a question for Daryl while you're here about.

674
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:47,690
Speaker 0: You've been to the two prime days of Otacon.

675
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:48,890
Speaker 0: What do you think of this con?

676
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:55,249
Speaker 3: I mean, it's freaking huge I don't know, I think something's Something's kind of missing from this whole thing.

677
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:11,750
Speaker 3: It's like All the elements are there Sort of, it's like Oh, you look at the list You see, like, oh, well We've got our art show We've got our cosplay We've got our AMVs We've got our panels We've got our dealer's room.

678
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,450
Speaker 3: What is missing?

679
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:14,649
Speaker 3: What is the?

680
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:28,987
Speaker 3: I don't know, there's something about it that is just not there to make it an anime con for me and it's like I went an excessive distance and I think I can sum it up in about three words.

681
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:32,488
Speaker 3: uh seek semper tyrannis.

682
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:43,260
Speaker 0: Now, the sound you just heard was that of a clown pistol, which is a small explosive device being detonated directly in my face followed by my death screen.

683
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:48,619
Speaker 0: If you ever run into me in the street and blow something up in my face, you will probably hear a similar scream.

684
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:56,960
Speaker 0: Now at that moment, the room went into silence for a second, and then everyone wondered well, does he have any more of these clown pistols?

685
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,819
Speaker 0: Scott specifically was wondering this and then, he shot Scott in the face with a clown pistol.

686
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:07,548
Speaker 0: I've got two.

687
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,067
Speaker 0: that should be enough for all of you.

688
00:38:12,113 --> 00:38:14,330
Speaker 1: I inadvertently left these in my bag.

689
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:19,308
Speaker 3: I'm very glad I wasn't arrested by airport security.

690
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:30,963
Speaker 0: I think you realize how often we've spoken of fucking clown pistols ever since you brought them up and we didn't know what they were and then we googled for them and you guys show up as the number one link.

691
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:50,789
Speaker 3: clown pistols are not an official term (laughter) and I just throw them down like I'm 47 and steal off into the night.

692
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:52,726
Speaker 3: now coming here was worth it.

693
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,767
Speaker 3: it was always worth it.

694
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:58,450
Speaker 2: stupid clown pistols are not acquireable in our northeastern states.

695
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:08,550
Speaker 0: yeah, you realize fireworks are totally bad, like we have to drive to Tennessee to get anything Pennsylvania has just bottle rockets sweet snake action.

696
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:23,360
Speaker 3: listen, I had to sign a legal document stating that I was going to use these in compliance with a very specific Florida law stating that the detonation of fireworks is permitted only if you're using them to frighten away birds (laughter).

697
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:25,103
Speaker 2: is that true?

698
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,869
Speaker 3: listen, it's shaped like a gun (laughter).

699
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,249
Speaker 3: you don't shape something like this like a gun if it's not meant to be pointed at another human being.

700
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:50,549
