1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,572
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 6th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:19,574
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about procrastination, laziness, and we're generally lazy during the show.

3
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,120
Speaker 0: But it's awesome.

4
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,519
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,980
Speaker 1: So this is the 88th episode of Geek Nights.

6
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:29,020
Speaker 0: And we're tired.

7
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,339
Speaker 1: Tired as fuck.

8
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,219
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:35,900
Speaker 0: If you could see us now, there'd be like these Z's floating out of our head.

10
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,280
Speaker 1: I was asleep until just recently when Scott forced me to wake up long enough to do the show.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if the show is not so great, or not so long...

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,540
Speaker 1: Well, uh, you can die in a fire.

13
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:48,780
Speaker 0: What's with you and the dying of fire?

14
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:50,051
Speaker 1: I don't know, I find it hilarious.

15
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:50,960
Speaker 1: It was on Penny Arcade.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,277
Speaker 1: Then it was all over Fark, and I think it's becoming fast a new internet meme/cliché.

17
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:58,198
Speaker 0: Great.

18
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:05,880
Speaker 0: Alright, so, in less happy news, there's this guy who's a listener and he's in our forums.

19
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:08,820
Speaker 0: We only know him as Rich, or Tech Support Rich.

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:14,540
Speaker 0: And he is one of the people who does a podcast called Movies You Should See.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,499
Speaker 0: And you can go check it out at www.simplysyndicated.com/moviesyoushouldsee.html.

22
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems pretty cool.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, I listened to a few of them.

24
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:28,713
Speaker 0: These people really know as much about movies as the Anime World Order.

25
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:29,720
Speaker 0: people know about anime.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: Which is good, because I don't know shit about movies.

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,999
Speaker 0: Like, I don't pay attention to actors or directors or any of that.

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,099
Speaker 0: So when these guys say, "Oh yeah, that was directed by the same guy who directed this and

29
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:39,320
Speaker 0: that."

30
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,332
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh, really?

31
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:40,656
Speaker 0: Oh.".

32
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:42,147
Speaker 1: And of course, Mr.

33
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,340
Speaker 1: Period has no problems with how this guy posts.

34
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,060
Speaker 0: Nope, no problems whatsoever.

35
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:47,538
Speaker 0: So he gets more points.

36
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,300
Speaker 0: But, what happened was...

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,060
Speaker 1: His appendix exploded!

38
00:01:52,702 --> 00:01:53,760
Speaker 0: I don't know if it exploded.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,340
Speaker 0: He had appendicitis, which means it's all swollen.

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,698
Speaker 0: And if you don't know, appendicitis is really painful and...

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,300
Speaker 1: Possibly deadly.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,273
Speaker 0: Basically, you have this organ attached to your intestine.

43
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,800
Speaker 0: that doesn't do much nowadays.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,359
Speaker 0: I mean, it does something.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,604
Speaker 1: You know what it does?

46
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:12,059
Speaker 1: It collects pus and tries to kill you.

47
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:12,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

48
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,059
Speaker 1: It's like the Bender of the Middle Ages.

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,982
Speaker 0: Exactly.

50
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,120
Speaker 0: It's like this little sack of poison that everyone has inside their bodies.

51
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:24,280
Speaker 0: And if something goes wrong, it gets swollen or it explodes.

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,719
Speaker 0: If it explodes, you're pretty much dead.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,559
Speaker 0: But if it's swollen and painful, you can go to the hospital and they take it out.

54
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,259
Speaker 0: Well, they just took his out and we hope he gets better soon.

55
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:34,579
Speaker 0: And all that good stuff.

56
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever they put up their next episode, we'll definitely be linking to it because we're in it.

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Speaker 0: Yep, we sure are.

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,640
Speaker 0: And I want to see a picture of this appendix in a jar.

59
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,859
Speaker 0: That's what I want to see.

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Speaker 1: They usually don't give you the appendix in a jar.

61
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,533
Speaker 0: You gotta get it in a jar.

62
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 0: What's the point?

63
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,458
Speaker 1: There's laws against that.

64
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,047
Speaker 0: What?

65
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:52,580
Speaker 1: Aww.

66
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,560
Speaker 1: Though I have.

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,530
Speaker 0: He's in the UK, though.

68
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,400
Speaker 0: The laws might be different.

69
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,123
Speaker 1: Ha ha!

70
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,579
Speaker 1: The UK, where people have slightly different rights.

71
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,140
Speaker 0: Less in some areas and more in others.

72
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,175
Speaker 1: Actually, I saw a story today on FARC about a guy who fought a parking fine with a law that was passed in England in 1600-something.

73
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:10,835
Speaker 1: Wow.

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,360
Speaker 1: He lost and the judge basically laughed at him, but the guy's taken it to a higher court and he thinks he has a valid point.

75
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,239
Speaker 1: Because the law was never overturned.

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,235
Speaker 1: Wow.

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,451
Speaker 1: It's a long, complicated story.

78
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,239
Speaker 1: I'm not going to get into it.

79
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,580
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll talk about it someday when we talk about jurisprudence.

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,415
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,200
Speaker 1: But I have a relevant appendix story.

82
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,257
Speaker 0: Well, Houdini?

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,308
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

84
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:31,880
Speaker 1: Not Houdini.

85
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:32,280
Speaker 1: Okay.

86
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,940
Speaker 1: Even though there's somewhat of an urban legend around how Houdini actually died.

87
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,560
Speaker 0: There is indeed, which is why I was going to start talking about it.

88
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no, no, no.

89
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,293
Speaker 1: This is very different.

90
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,120
Speaker 1: This was in high school.

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Speaker 1: We had a friend, Aaron Nardi.

92
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:45,020
Speaker 1: And Nardi is an amazing drummer.

93
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,720
Speaker 1: Like, this kid could frickin' drum.

94
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,839
Speaker 1: We played in a jazz band together and he was an awesome guy.

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,259
Speaker 1: Now, he got his appendix out.

96
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,100
Speaker 1: And so suddenly, like, he had a problem and he went to the hospital.

97
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,899
Speaker 1: He, like, missed some school and his appendix was out.

98
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,780
Speaker 1: And he came back and there's this giant scar on his abdomen.

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,220
Speaker 1: Now, only a few people knew that he had had his appendix out in a semi-emergency surgery.

100
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:17,559
Speaker 1: So the story that everyone who knew and that Nardi himself propagated was that he was involved in an altercation down on 8 Mile, since we live near Detroit, during which he was stabbed.

101
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:19,459
Speaker 0: Okay.

102
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:22,820
Speaker 1: And for years and years, everyone believed this.

103
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,457
Speaker 1: Everyone thought he was stabbed on 8 Mile.

104
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:25,880
Speaker 1: And it was just his appendix.

105
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,135
Speaker 1: And they'd be like, "No

106
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:27,380
Speaker 1: way!".

107
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,956
Speaker 1: And he'd lift his shirt and there'd be the scar there.

108
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,143
Speaker 1: and they'd be like, "Oh, wow.

109
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:30,948
Speaker 1: Sorry I doubted you.

110
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:31,511
Speaker 1: Damn.

111
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:32,335
Speaker 1: You've been

112
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:32,979
Speaker 1: stabbed.".

113
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:38,020
Speaker 0: All right, so Rich, if you're listening out there, remember, to anyone who doesn't know, you were stabbed.

114
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:39,632
Speaker 1: On 8 Mile.

115
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,020
Speaker 0: By Jack the Ripper.

116
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,179
Speaker 0: You're in London, right?

117
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:44,680
Speaker 1: Jack the Ripper's dead.

118
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,320
Speaker 0: I know, but it's supposed to be funny.

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

120
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,040
Speaker 1: I actually read the Wikipedia on Jack the Ripper today.

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, oh, yeah.

122
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,740
Speaker 0: Actually, there's this comic that Alan Moore wrote about Jack the Ripper.

123
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,240
Speaker 1: That's why I read the Wikipedia.

124
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,520
Speaker 0: Called From Hell, which I've been trying to get, but you can't get it.

125
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 0: It's like 60 bucks for a used crap one.

126
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,700
Speaker 1: I will say something that bothers me about Jack the Ripper.

127
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:10,619
Speaker 1: A lot of people have done a lot of relevant research trying to figure out who he was.

128
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,239
Speaker 1: But the fact remains that there's really no way to know.

129
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,590
Speaker 0: No one knows for sure.

130
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,540
Speaker 0: No one will know for sure.

131
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,360
Speaker 1: You should see the crazy crackpot conspiracy nutjob theories about Jack the Ripper that are out there.

132
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,560
Speaker 0: If this ever is something that we can't figure out, every nutjob in the world would make a crazy conspiracy.

133
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,959
Speaker 1: Even things we can figure out.

134
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,779
Speaker 1: I mean, oh, things are evolving?

135
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,519
Speaker 1: No, it was a guy in the sky.

136
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,240
Speaker 1: Or, oh, a building was hit by a plane?

137
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,439
Speaker 1: It must have been an explosion planted by the government.

138
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:36,920
Speaker 0: Yeah.

139
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:38,740
Speaker 1: I'm telling you this, though.

140
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,018
Speaker 1: Abraham Lincoln shot first.

141
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,080
Speaker 0: How do we beat a giant stone Abraham Lincoln?

142
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,400
Speaker 1: Uh, giant stone John Wilkes Booth.

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,219
Speaker 0: I love that joke.

144
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,000
Speaker 0: That's the one, there's very few things I miss from television.

145
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,099
Speaker 0: But all those cartoon cartoons like Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls were definitely where it's at.

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, though that was from South Park.

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,217
Speaker 0: Oh, was it?

148
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:01,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,062
Speaker 1: Oh.

150
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,657
Speaker 0: An episode that's coming soon.

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,099
Speaker 0: But it was Dexter's Lab where they brought Mount Rushmore to life and they...

152
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:08,879
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

153
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:09,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm 100% sure.

154
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:12,780
Speaker 1: And then they had a giant stone John Wilkes Booth come?

155
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,260
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was a giant stone John Wilkes Booth.

156
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,340
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was from South Park.

157
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:23,540
Speaker 0: But there was a giant Abraham Lincoln made of stone and Mandark had another pres... Did Mandark have Lincoln and then Dexter had the other guy?

158
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:24,060
Speaker 0: I don't know.

159
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,788
Speaker 1: I'd take Tefft.

160
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:25,820
Speaker 1: I could form a black hole.

161
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,119
Speaker 0: A black hole of teapot domes.

162
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,440
Speaker 1: Alright, yeah, we're tired and we're silly.

163
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, so everyone go check out Movies You Should See.

164
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:43,100
Speaker 0: And there should be an episode coming soon where we do a mini review of a movie that everyone should see and you probably don't know about.

165
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you haven't seen it, we'll make sure you get it somehow.

166
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,370
Speaker 0: Yup.

167
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 0: So, fair.

168
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:58,340
Speaker 1: Alright, in actual relevant news, scientists recently discovered something that... This is actually a fairly significant find.

169
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,299
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of people are calling it the missing link.

170
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:03,780
Speaker 1: And it's not... I hate that term.

171
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,040
Speaker 1: I hate when people say the missing link when it comes to evolution.

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Speaker 1: Because there's no such thing as the missing link.

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,278
Speaker 1: Someone will always say... Every time you find something, they'll say, "Oh, but there's nothing between that one and the one before

174
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:14,379
Speaker 1: it.".

175
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,692
Speaker 1: And then you find one in the middle and they'll say, "Oh, but there's a

176
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,315
Speaker 1: d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.".

177
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:18,785
Speaker 1: Whatever.

178
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:19,895
Speaker 1: So don't use the term "missing

179
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:20,077
Speaker 1: link.".

180
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,399
Speaker 1: However, what scientists just found is a missing link.

181
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,599
Speaker 0: That's... There aren't any other English words for it.

182
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically...

183
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,747
Speaker 0: It's a link.

184
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:29,539
Speaker 0: Let's just say it's a link.

185
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,033
Speaker 1: Yeah.

186
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,560
Speaker 0: It's a link that until previously was undiscovered.

187
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,120
Speaker 1: The link between seagoing animals and land-dwelling animals.

188
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,140
Speaker 0: Like, we always kinda knew that some fish got some legs and crawled up out and were amphibious and then were land-based.

189
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,800
Speaker 1: They found this crocodile-like, shallow-water fish kind of thing that can also walk on land.

190
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,582
Speaker 0: Yep.

191
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:51,640
Speaker 0: That's what it was.

192
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,680
Speaker 1: They've named it the Tiktaalik Rosae.

193
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:56,459
Speaker 0: That's a great name.

194
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, they took it from the Inuit language and I don't remember what it means and I'm not gonna go over and look it up.

195
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,918
Speaker 0: What happens to the fun names like trilobite?

196
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,360
Speaker 1: What's with you and trilobite?

197
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,288
Speaker 1: Wheee!

198
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:06,899
Speaker 1: Trilobites!

199
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,860
Speaker 1: You know, my mom's got like nine fairly well-preserved trilobite fossils.

200
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,080
Speaker 0: I'll buy one someday.

201
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,484
Speaker 1: You want one?

202
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,860
Speaker 1: I could probably get one for you.

203
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,859
Speaker 0: No, I'll get my own.

204
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,488
Speaker 1: My mom has a fairly extensive collection of fossils.

205
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:22,297
Speaker 1: She has a small fragment of a dinosaur egg.

206
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,280
Speaker 1: All sorts of cool things.

207
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,211
Speaker 0: I think I'll just go on eBay and search for trilobite.

208
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:26,460
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get a plushie trilobite.

209
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:27,699
Speaker 1: Ah, I've seen 'em.

210
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen 'em too.

211
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,120
Speaker 0: I got a plushie stingray guy.

212
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:30,693
Speaker 0: Ooh.

213
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:31,638
Speaker 0: From an aquarium.

214
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,908
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that thing.

215
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,360
Speaker 1: We used to throw it around the apartment.

216
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:35,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cool, isn't it?

217
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,085
Speaker 0: Yeah.

218
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:37,840
Speaker 1: You always keep it next to your Charmander.

219
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:38,422
Speaker 0: Yeah.

220
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,839
Speaker 0: It's worth seven bucks, which is what I paid for it.

221
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

222
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:48,560
Speaker 1: For whatever kind of, you know, adult, professional, geek guy whatevers, we have a surprising number of stuffed animals.

223
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:54,600
Speaker 0: It's weird because I had 'em as a kid and then I didn't want 'em anymore and I didn't really play with 'em when I was a kid.

224
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,516
Speaker 0: I just kind of hid amongst them, like E.T.

225
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:56,880
Speaker 0: style.

226
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:58,157
Speaker 1: So did I.

227
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:05,140
Speaker 0: And then they put 'em all, eventually they got handed down from kid to kid and then my sister put 'em all in the attic except for like a couple.

228
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,167
Speaker 1: We had a friggin' my brother's room.

229
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:10,280
Speaker 1: We put a net, like, hanging from the corner of the room.

230
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:11,199
Speaker 0: And you filled it?

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,910
Speaker 1: We filled it and every now and then we'd get 'em.

232
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,440
Speaker 1: But we had to keep 'em up there because we had dogs.

233
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,279
Speaker 0: And they would just eat 'em.

234
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,859
Speaker 1: The dogs, we'd give them their own stuffed animals to play with and they loved 'em.

235
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,700
Speaker 1: But they always had this sense that the ones we didn't give 'em were far superior somehow.

236
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,660
Speaker 1: And they would stop at nothing to get their hands on 'em.

237
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,262
Speaker 0: You know why?

238
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,271
Speaker 0: 'Cause they tasted like you and they couldn't eat you.

239
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,160
Speaker 0: so they could eat those and it'd be close enough.

240
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,212
Speaker 1: I think it was more like they'd see us playing with 'em and they knew that they were important to us.

241
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,980
Speaker 1: so they must be awesome toys because we protected 'em.

242
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:40,699
Speaker 1: 'Cause they protected their toys.

243
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,880
Speaker 1: Though my dad has this four or five foot tall quality Wile E. Coyote stuffed animal.

244
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,280
Speaker 1: Like, it's quality.

245
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,840
Speaker 1: And one day, one of our dogs, he finds it 'cause the door was left open.

246
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 1: So we're sitting in the living room and he walks in carrying this Wile E. Coyote that's bigger than him.

247
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,452
Speaker 1: And he has this look on his face like, "I'm the king of the world!

248
00:10:01,512 --> 00:10:01,833
Speaker 1: Woo!

249
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:01,914
Speaker 1: Woo!

250
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:02,275
Speaker 1: Woo!".

251
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,660
Speaker 1: And we look at him and he looks at us and he realizes we're gonna take it away.

252
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:10,537
Speaker 1: And he just drops it and just kinda slinks away with his tail between his legs like,

253
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:10,938
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

254
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:12,580
Speaker 1: He didn't even fight.

255
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,343
Speaker 0: That's pretty funny.

256
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, but nowadays it's like we have all new stuffed animals.

257
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,060
Speaker 0: All things that are geeky.

258
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,623
Speaker 0: What do we got?

259
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:21,640
Speaker 0: We got a Cthulhu and a Cactuar.

260
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have the Cactuar, the Cthulhu, the Corolla.

261
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,213
Speaker 1: 1985 Corolla.

262
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:30,099
Speaker 0: 1985 Toyota Corolla from Japan.

263
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,450
Speaker 1: Yes, I have a stuffed 1985 Toyota Corolla.

264
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:34,549
Speaker 1: It's pretty big.

265
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,600
Speaker 1: I paid a lot of money for it.

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,377
Speaker 0: It's actually more of a pillow and less of a... I have a Calcifer from... Ah, yeah, yeah.

267
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,786
Speaker 0: That's a really quality Calcifer.

268
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:45,040
Speaker 0: It's so cute when he opens his little mouth and he's got little hands and little logs.

269
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,329
Speaker 0: The logs are what's key.

270
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,660
Speaker 0: They had a non-log version.

271
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,194
Speaker 0: I don't know who would buy the non-log version.

272
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:51,079
Speaker 0: They got something wrong with them.

273
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:52,910
Speaker 0: Alright.

274
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

275
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:56,420
Speaker 1: Though, anyway, the evolution thing.

276
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:57,900
Speaker 0: Alright, we're doing news.

277
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, this thing is basically... I mean, evolution is pretty much proven.

278
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:08,880
Speaker 1: I mean, the fact... the idea that animals change and evolve into different species over time is fact.

279
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,408
Speaker 1: Fact, fact, fact.

280
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,095
Speaker 1: We've observed it.

281
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:11,519
Speaker 1: It happens.

282
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:23,692
Speaker 1: Despite this, on FARC, you should see how many people either said that this fossil is bullshit or it's fake or it doesn't matter 'cause there's still a missing link or you're gonna burn in hell.

283
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:27,758
Speaker 1: so it doesn't matter or just denying the fact that this happens and it boggles my mind.

284
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:33,739
Speaker 1: Mostly because there were two other related evolution things that happened like today and...

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was like some bird... another bird dinosaur.

286
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,920
Speaker 1: Yep, and they found that Gawi's skull, which is basically the link between Homo erectus and Homo sapiens.

287
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,138
Speaker 1: They're reasonably certain that it is.

288
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:45,916
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

289
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:58,520
Speaker 1: But also recently, a Canadian researcher was trying to get money for a grant to study the deleterious effects of the rise of intelligent design and creationism in the US on Canadian science education.

290
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,360
Speaker 1: The people in charge of giving him the money said that because he cannot prove that evolution is a fact, they cannot give him the money.

291
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,280
Speaker 0: Well, not only is evolution a fact, but there's one deleterious effect for his study right there.

292
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:11,698
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,920
Speaker 0: People not giving money to important science research.

294
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,100
Speaker 1: And just recently, Bill Nye was doing... 'cause Bill Nye, you know, Bill Nye the Science Guy, he's a fairly awesome dude.

295
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,183
Speaker 0: He's really awesome.

296
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,647
Speaker 0: Like, don't underestimate him.

297
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:28,060
Speaker 0: 'cause he did a show that may seem corny on the surface, but is actually awesome also.

298
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,461
Speaker 0: Yeah.

299
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,233
Speaker 1: I mean, he's very well-spoken and cool.

300
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,700
Speaker 1: And he knows his stuff.

301
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,572
Speaker 1: And he was doing some lectures at various places.

302
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,000
Speaker 1: He's at this college and he's doing a lecture.

303
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,180
Speaker 1: And at one point, he starts talking about the origin of the universe and the moon and the sun and all sorts of things.

304
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,870
Speaker 1: And this woman stands up and is like, "This is horrible.

305
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,714
Speaker 1: We believe in God.

306
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,017
Speaker 1: I won't subject my kids to

307
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:51,197
Speaker 1: this.".

308
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,139
Speaker 1: And she storms out.

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,583
Speaker 0: Uh, nutcase.

310
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:58,800
Speaker 0: Why did you go to see Bill Nye the Science Guy if you don't believe in science?

311
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

312
00:12:59,248 --> 00:12:59,559
Speaker 1: Science.

313
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:01,880
Speaker 0: Everyone else there was cool, though.

314
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, as far as I can tell.

315
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,800
Speaker 1: They just kinda laughed it off and Bill Nye cracked a joke and they kept going.

316
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:06,342
Speaker 0: Yep.

317
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:10,634
Speaker 0: Bill Nye's actually trained in not only science, like real science.

318
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,580
Speaker 0: He's not like some guy who pretends to know science.

319
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,506
Speaker 0: Or some guy who just knows some cool experiments like Mr.

320
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:15,867
Speaker 0: Wizard.

321
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:21,280
Speaker 0: Like, he's a real scientist and he's a real stand-up comedian and he's real famous and real cool.

322
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,580
Speaker 0: So, if you ever get a chance to go see Bill Nye somewhere, go see him.

323
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,400
Speaker 1: 'Cause he's currently, apparently, on tour.

324
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you don't know who Bill Nye is, go find an episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy somewhere and watch it.

325
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:42,860
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not- it's meant for, like, younger audience than- but, uh, even if you're, like, in high school, you'll still get something out of it no matter which one you watch.

326
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,034
Speaker 1: If anything, you watch an explosion and go, "Ha

327
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:45,517
Speaker 1: ha!".

328
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, or watch, you know, some crazy cool science experiment and go,

329
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,790
Speaker 0: "Ooh!"

330
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:50,733
Speaker 0: You'll learn something!

331
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:52,618
Speaker 0: I'll learn something if I watch one of those.

332
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:53,440
Speaker 0: It's been so long.

333
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,720
Speaker 1: But I guess my main thing here is just that I don't care what you believe.

334
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:07,580
Speaker 1: The contrary to the posts I made in the flame war art thing we had on creationism and, uh, God in the forum, but I don't care what you believe, whatever.

335
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:20,559
Speaker 1: But if you don't recognize that evolution happened and that there's evidence for it and that there's no real evidence against it, I don't know what to say to you other than that I really can't ever respect you as a person.

336
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:21,480
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

337
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, um, there's, you know, one of the key- God's real, but you know what?

338
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:30,599
Speaker 1: Evolution happened, and we can't deny that.

339
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,187
Speaker 0: One of the key things they look for when checking to see if someone is insane is whether they can tell reality from fantasy.

340
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:47,020
Speaker 0: Well, if reality is staring you in the face, reality such as evolution, and you deny it, I submit that you are insane, and therefore you should be put in the loony bin.

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,534
Speaker 1: I mean, by the same token, if, uh, Buddha came down and walked over to me and said, "Hey, uh, I'm Buddha.

342
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:54,356
Speaker 1: I'm real,".

343
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 1: and then he did some magic, I'd be a Buddhist.

344
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,280
Speaker 0: Yup, but first I had to make my wisdom check in case I disbelieved and he disappeared.

345
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might just be a, uh, major illusion.

346
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,165
Speaker 0: It might just be a major illusion, but you know what?

347
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:07,615
Speaker 0: When it comes down to it, there's always that philosophy.

348
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,440
Speaker 0: it could just be like the Matrix, whatever.

349
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:09,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

350
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,086
Speaker 0: But forget about that.

351
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:12,959
Speaker 0: There's not much you can do about it if it is.

352
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, but believe whatever you want.

353
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:16,934
Speaker 1: Just don't disbelieve things that are real and proven.

354
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 1: That's all I ask.

355
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,147
Speaker 0: Heh.

356
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:21,775
Speaker 1: That's not- that's like so simple.

357
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,500
Speaker 1: That's all I want.

358
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,075
Speaker 0: If I hold up one finger and say, "How many fingers am I holding

359
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:25,196
Speaker 0: up?"

360
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:25,739
Speaker 0: Don't say two.

361
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll cry.

362
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I'll hit you.

363
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,319
Speaker 0: And then I'll hit you for every number you're off by.

364
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:32,055
Speaker 1: Schlagensee.

365
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:32,893
Speaker 0: Schlagensee.

366
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,329
Speaker 1: So, uh, obviously we're just kinda running the recorder here.

367
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,800
Speaker 1: We're not editing or stopping or anything, so Scott can do his news now.

368
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,477
Speaker 0: There is, um, not really a way to segue to this news, but, uh, a long-lost Nintendo game.

369
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,640
Speaker 0: Well, not so long lost.

370
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,940
Speaker 0: It was a game that came out for the Super Nintendo and was never a sequel, but was very popular.

371
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's a lost franchise, basically.

372
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a Nintendo franchise that hasn't had more than one game.

373
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:05,060
Speaker 1: It's one that shouldn't have been forgotten because it kind of started a whole new genre of gaming.

374
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,385
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's very, very awesome.

375
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:12,860
Speaker 0: And they're finally, for sure, working on possibly another one, probably for the revolution.

376
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,730
Speaker 0: They're gonna make Pilotwings 2?

377
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,713
Speaker 0: Pilotwings Revolution?

378
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,195
Speaker 0: I don't know.

379
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,560
Speaker 0: Pilotwings, baby, yeah.

380
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pilotwings is one of the launch games for the SNES.

381
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,386
Speaker 0: I remember it was a launch game for the SNES.

382
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:32,000
Speaker 0: It's one of the few SNES games they don't have a ROM for, but I might now because they downloaded a package of, like, a zillion SNES ROMs.

383
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,718
Speaker 0: Ooh, don't tell anyone.

384
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,394
Speaker 1: Villainy!

385
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:36,818
Speaker 0: I don't know what, another word for villainy.

386
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:37,899
Speaker 0: Haha!

387
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:40,996
Speaker 0: Scoundrelisms!

388
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,157
Speaker 1: You Montabank!

389
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,319
Speaker 0: Piracy.

390
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,218
Speaker 1: Yeah.

391
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:45,807
Speaker 0: Arrr.

392
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,983
Speaker 1: But Pilotwings was a fun game.

393
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:57,380
Speaker 1: Basically, it was a game of learn how to pilot a plane, learn how to parachute, learn how to fly a rocket pack, learn how to hang glide.

394
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,004
Speaker 1: Do things to get points.

395
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,491
Speaker 1: Learn to do it perfectly and you'll get more points.

396
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,676
Speaker 1: Unlock things by doing things well.

397
00:17:05,278 --> 00:17:05,800
Speaker 1: Do stunts.

398
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,222
Speaker 0: n64 which i never knew about until just now.

399
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:39,362
Speaker 1: it wasn't very widely played.

400
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,484
Speaker 0: there wasn't a pilot wings gamecube which apparently some people wanted.

401
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,966
Speaker 0: but there's probably going to be a pilot wings revolution.

402
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:46,947
Speaker 0: all right so it's the revolution.

403
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,889
Speaker 1: makes sense because it's got the awesome controller.

404
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:49,769
Speaker 0: yeah it's the third.

405
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,771
Speaker 0: so it's the third pilot wings not the second one.

406
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,252
Speaker 0: all right whatever.

407
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:58,435
Speaker 0: also something that was fairly obvious to me and a bunch of other people.

408
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,717
Speaker 0: um and i thought it.

409
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:08,662
Speaker 0: you can ask people who were with me at the time when i you know i've said it a bunch of times in the past few months they're actually going to make mario paint ds for real.

410
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,423
Speaker 1: probably i just assumed they would.

411
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:18,949
Speaker 0: i just assumed they would also but hopefully now all the people who go what's mario paint we can show them what for man i had mario paint the day it came out.

412
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:26,094
Speaker 1: i remember i came home from school and i was i i forget i think i was in middle school or other still elementary school i don't remember.

413
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:32,758
Speaker 1: but i came home from school and my parents were like there's something in your brother's room you can't go in there until he gets home.

414
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,460
Speaker 1: and i remember thinking what could it be?

415
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,782
Speaker 1: super nintendo's in his room it's mario paints.

416
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,104
Speaker 1: and i snuck into the room and played.

417
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,525
Speaker 1: mario paint awesome.

418
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:54,192
Speaker 1: and then my brother came home and my parents my parents yelling for me like brennan because you know back then i didn't call myself i would have what kind of parents my parents would have gone up to look at that room every few minutes.

419
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,574
Speaker 1: i they i guess they assumed i was doing something else.

420
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:02,138
Speaker 1: geniuses they were because i was in there with the door shut and they called for me and i'm like oh shit.

421
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:08,265
Speaker 1: and i tried like open the door to sneak out my brother sitting there and it's like oh owned.

422
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:29,972
Speaker 1: though to this day there's a debate not really debate more of an angry argument between my brother and i because i made on the game before he touched it an awesome stamp icon and he claimed i don't even remember it was so long ago that he made it or something.

423
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:32,581
Speaker 1: that story doesn't go anywhere.

424
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,106
Speaker 1: well okay it's like the.

425
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,032
Speaker 1: it's like the clamp it's and the what's it's.

426
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,019
Speaker 1: we're still fighting but we don't remember why.

427
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:43,538
Speaker 0: you mean the hatfields and the mccoys yeah yeah those ones like.

428
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:51,141
Speaker 0: i said at the beginning of the episode i'm tired we are tired and the episode is about tired to crap lazy pucks what.

429
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,646
Speaker 0: that's exactly my point.

430
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,173
Speaker 1: i'm not editing that out in fact we're going straight to things of the day.

431
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,407
Speaker 1: so anyway my thing of the day.

432
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:08,694
Speaker 1: um actually i didn't really have anything for today.

433
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:13,250
Speaker 1: so i was trolling around on google video and i found this little gem.

434
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:25,190
Speaker 1: now i'm not sure of the scenario here other than that these young boys are playing quake 3 and watch the video and watch the guy in the back right corner of this land party.

435
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:30,224
Speaker 1: he gets quite perturbed at what is going on in the game.

436
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:33,853
Speaker 0: he might remind you of a recent thing of the day involving a german kid.

437
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,319
Speaker 1: german kid where is des escaping?

438
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,442
Speaker 1: only this kid's korean?

439
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:51,407
Speaker 1: yeah and this kid looks i don't i'm pretty sure it's real because the guy holding the camera is kind of like staying back and you hear him going like yeah that's the best.

440
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:57,853
Speaker 0: is that in the german one and just kind of weird this one you have a guy who takes the place of you who's laughing with you.

441
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:59,900
Speaker 1: so yeah the german one was like wow this is funny.

442
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:01,625
Speaker 1: okay is this is fake?

443
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,855
Speaker 1: wow this kid have mental problems.

444
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,083
Speaker 1: this isn't funny this is disturbing.

445
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,708
Speaker 1: yeah this one's just funny.

446
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,187
Speaker 1: and then the guy notices that someone's laughing at him and he whips a can of something at him.

447
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,617
Speaker 0: i think he throws a pen or a pencil or something.

448
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:19,774
Speaker 1: yeah it was funny it made me laugh and it was the best thing i've seen on the internet today.

449
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:20,597
Speaker 0: awesome.

450
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,444
Speaker 0: so i was looking for something.

451
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:27,080
Speaker 0: i didn't come up very big but i found another funny video game commercial.

452
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,026
Speaker 1: so you're not gonna do the f1 crashes.

453
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:32,981
Speaker 0: no the f1 crashes can wait for another time in another place.

454
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:34,768
Speaker 0: perhaps an episode where we talk about f1.

455
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:36,778
Speaker 1: didn't we already talk about f1?

456
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,307
Speaker 0: we didn't do a whole episode in f1.

457
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:39,492
Speaker 0: i think we did an episode about sports.

458
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:43,967
Speaker 0: oh yeah yeah yeah we could do like a when the season's over.

459
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:53,317
Speaker 1: we could at the end of the year we can do like an f1 review or we could do a thursday episode on all those bad things on the internet like car crashes and people exploding.

460
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,228
Speaker 0: you mean a fox special and style project.

461
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:58,933
Speaker 0: so a fox special of geek nights?

462
00:21:59,073 --> 00:21:59,795
Speaker 0: yeah okay.

463
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,740
Speaker 0: so anyway world's blankiest blank.

464
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:08,880
Speaker 0: this is a um a japanese early 90s commercial for the game boy version of dr mario.

465
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:17,345
Speaker 0: it's basically a bunch of people dressed up as germs synchronized swimming doing a crazy dance and it's pretty scary.

466
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:18,970
Speaker 1: the music is creepy.

467
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,543
Speaker 0: rim is making a funny with a toy a toy that i can.

468
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,550
Speaker 0: i have a similar toy but it's at work.

469
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:30,383
Speaker 0: yes the people who know me know that i'm really good at dr mario.

470
00:22:30,443 --> 00:22:37,291
Speaker 0: he is really good like it was weird because i never had dr mario but i knew how to play it and i played it a few times on an emulator.

471
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:42,467
Speaker 0: but when it came down to playing dr mario against people i kicked everyone.

472
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,329
Speaker 0: i knows ass.

473
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:52,274
Speaker 0: so if anyone wants to challenge me to some dr mario if they ever make it for the ds or anything let's get it on.

474
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:56,910
Speaker 1: i'm actually quite surprised that some dr mario wasn't included in tetris ds.

475
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,740
Speaker 0: yeah i mean they had a level that's tetrisy.

476
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,916
Speaker 0: that looks like yoshi's cookie but they don't have a level that's like dr mario.

477
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,489
Speaker 1: i guess my only guess is that they're going to release dr mario ds.

478
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:08,673
Speaker 0: well no they released.

479
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:14,127
Speaker 0: um that like puzzle combination game for the gba that had.

480
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:14,969
Speaker 0: i think it had you.

481
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,646
Speaker 0: i'm sure about yoshi's cookie or not but it had dr mario and panel de pon.

482
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:25,525
Speaker 0: and if you don't know panel de pon is the what was originally pokemon puzzle league.

483
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:34,859
Speaker 0: pokemon puzzle league is just panel de pon with pokemon added in and that's the game where you flip to to the right and to the left sort of like horizontal medios kind.

484
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,509
Speaker 1: yeah even though i don't i don't like medios.

485
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:39,595
Speaker 0: medios is okay.

486
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:41,604
Speaker 0: i wouldn't think i would pay more than 10 bucks for it.

487
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:46,650
Speaker 1: well i remembered something we played because i did really well when we played with those guys at uh gaming for hope.

488
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:52,232
Speaker 1: and the reason i did well is because i remembered something taiko had said on penny arcade about medios.

489
00:23:53,075 --> 00:24:08,641
Speaker 1: you can do very well for yourself by simply simply randomly dragging the stylus up and down on rows as fast as you can and all i did was scribble back and forth and i kept making things and making combos and shooting things up and i was doing real well.

490
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:18,259
Speaker 1: oh really yeah because i was trying and i did okay yeah but i just i just freaking scribbled around and without do not even thinking i kept knocking things up and hitting that planet.

491
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,172
Speaker 1: wow yeah it was kind of annoying.

492
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,622
Speaker 0: yeah the thing is i just wish they would have kept those.

493
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:32,374
Speaker 0: you know they were gonna make that puzzle combination game for the gba and they did and i was looking forward to it but they delayed it so long.

494
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:36,471
Speaker 0: i kind of wish they would have just moved it to the ds and added wi-fi and wireless to it.

495
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,158
Speaker 0: yeah i mean dr mario alone would be worth it.

496
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:56,380
Speaker 1: so anyway like we said our uh main bit today is about procrastination and laziness and how they uh work respective to geeks and how you can fight them if you want to or if you need to.

497
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,450
Speaker 1: i mean first i'll say that we're pretty lazy.

498
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:01,797
Speaker 0: god i am so lazy.

499
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:06,250
Speaker 0: but that is one of the three important uh attributes of a great programmer.

500
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:07,514
Speaker 0: yeah laziness.

501
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:19,276
Speaker 1: well the other thing is i mean we think of ourselves as lazy because a lot of times we'll sit around and we'll realize hey i could be doing something relevant and important and productive right now but i'm not.

502
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,370
Speaker 1: but then we realize how much we do compared to most people.

503
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:28,330
Speaker 1: i mean i guess if you compare us and most geeks to the average person we're the opposite of lazy.

504
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:31,378
Speaker 1: we're the most ambitious like driven people in the world.

505
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:36,812
Speaker 0: yet right now i'm so lazy i can't even podcast while sitting up.

506
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:37,973
Speaker 0: i'm laying down.

507
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:41,858
Speaker 0: yeah i'm sitting here i am reclined.

508
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,100
Speaker 0: that's how lazy we are.

509
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,175
Speaker 1: but i mean we're lazy.

510
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:46,218
Speaker 1: like we're really lazy.

511
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:53,730
Speaker 1: we really generally mostly enjoy to do nothing like when we go to the shore in wildwood with our friend scott johnson and stayed his beach house.

512
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,744
Speaker 1: i mean there's crazy things to do all over the place.

513
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:04,960
Speaker 1: but our favorite thing is to either lay in the beach house going ah or to lay on the beach going.

514
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:17,185
Speaker 0: it's so weird with our laziness is that we will put in lots and lots of effort in order to continue doing nothing.

515
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:29,127
Speaker 0: i mean if we're sitting in a restaurant someone has to do the tiny bit of paying the bill and we will viciously fight and put in more effort than it takes to pay the bill into not paying the bill.

516
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,453
Speaker 0: yeah it's the same thing.

517
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:39,426
Speaker 0: we're like if everyone's laying down and comfortable in a room talking and someone has to get up to say get a drink or get a the phone or get a video game from across.

518
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,176
Speaker 1: the worst is ordering pizza or order a pizza.

519
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:43,080
Speaker 0: that's a lot of effort.

520
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,143
Speaker 1: we all have a cell phone we're all adults but for some reason whenever we're going to order a pizza no one will do it.

521
00:26:48,404 --> 00:26:57,115
Speaker 0: yep so we we will fight viciously with more effort than it takes to order a pizza in order so that someone else will order the pizza and not us.

522
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:15,259
Speaker 1: i mean i guess really it's a fault of the english language that we need to split lazy into two separate concepts because lazy the way i would think of lazy now are people who just don't do anything like the guy who comes home from work and then sits there watching tv and doesn't do anything and then goes to bed.

523
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:18,860
Speaker 1: compared to that guy we're the opposite of lazy.

524
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,685
Speaker 1: we're lazy in like this different sense.

525
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:22,728
Speaker 1: there's no word for it.

526
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:26,617
Speaker 0: um yeah i don't know.

527
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:36,111
Speaker 0: it's sort of like when you talk about laziness for a programmer you're not talking about doesn't want to do anything you're talking about a guy who doesn't or a girl.

528
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,238
Speaker 0: no no a lazy programmer.

529
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:46,802
Speaker 0: what they will do is because they're so lazy and they want things to be so simple and efficient and requiring the least effort.

530
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:54,570
Speaker 0: they will put in a whole shit ton of effort to write a complicated script to make life easier later and that's what it's like for us.

531
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:03,239
Speaker 0: we'll do a whole bunch of work up front that doesn't even seem like work in order to prevent other work that is possibly unpleasant.

532
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,871
Speaker 1: well like the little example of paying the bill at the restaurant.

533
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:13,352
Speaker 1: for us paying the bill is a mundane task and we generally seem to dislike anything mundane or routine.

534
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:19,655
Speaker 1: now arguing and fighting to not have to pay the bill while it takes more effort is much more enjoyable.

535
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:23,089
Speaker 0: yeah usually just comes down to saying not it but or not it.

536
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:24,454
Speaker 0: race is a fun game not it.

537
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 1: i mean i would rather spend 10 times as much effort doing something i enjoy then spend any effort whatsoever doing something i don't enjoy.

538
00:28:34,665 --> 00:28:39,181
Speaker 0: yep and i mean come on this is simple stuff like paying a bill in a restaurant.

539
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:40,324
Speaker 0: what the hell's wrong with us?

540
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:41,968
Speaker 1: yeah yet we say we're lazy.

541
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:51,633
Speaker 1: we've done 87 45 to an hour and 20 minute long fairly professionally done audio radio shows.

542
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,197
Speaker 0: this isn't anything.

543
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:57,232
Speaker 0: i'm laying down in a recliner talking as they normally would.

544
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,280
Speaker 0: we're just holding a microphone in front of my face.

545
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,690
Speaker 0: it's not effort because we have to do this anyway.

546
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,694
Speaker 1: yeah we'd probably.

547
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:08,856
Speaker 1: honestly i mean today tonight's geek nights for those of you who haven't realized it by now is completely unedited.

548
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:12,689
Speaker 0: well we took out a few uh empty pauses of nothing.

549
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,396
Speaker 1: yeah but that's short some silences.

550
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:17,222
Speaker 1: but other than that this is exactly.

551
00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:20,452
Speaker 1: we didn't start we didn't cut anything out appear.

552
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,606
Speaker 1: and uh i guess all it'll show is that we really almost never cut anything out.

553
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:30,169
Speaker 1: we really are like this all the time on the air off the air we basically have the same kinds of conversations.

554
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:35,250
Speaker 1: the only difference is we're usually a little bit less informative when we're not talking into a microphone.

555
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:39,105
Speaker 0: yeah plus we usually are talking to people who already know stuff.

556
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:42,478
Speaker 0: so the only time we're informative is do you know this?

557
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:47,716
Speaker 0: just to make sure that someone knows something that might not be common knowledge you know.

558
00:29:47,736 --> 00:29:53,756
Speaker 0: so if we talk the way we do to each other on the podcast you'd be like what are they talking about?

559
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:58,698
Speaker 0: i don't know unless you were really really smart like us and then you would know.

560
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:01,910
Speaker 0: but then why would the hell are you listening if you're so smart?

561
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:05,906
Speaker 1: i guess i mean the when i noticed this is that well one.

562
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:11,510
Speaker 1: a lot of our friends especially in college would always say that we're hilarious or like like.

563
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:22,297
Speaker 1: they'd like we scott and i would start arguing we'd have a bunch of people over and they would just start like people would all sit around and just kind of watch us argue and one day we noticed and it's like wow why are you guys here?

564
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:29,245
Speaker 0: it's just us arguing with each other and they were like it's funny i'm like okay and then we'd bring a new person over who didn't know anything about us.

565
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:37,441
Speaker 1: yeah they just be like hysterical on the floor rolling around not just us but like our group and the way we interact seem to be very entertaining to people who didn't know us.

566
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:39,950
Speaker 0: yeah i don't know what it is.

567
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,355
Speaker 0: it's not so entertaining to me.

568
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:43,546
Speaker 0: it's like i say things and they're not really funny.

569
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:48,508
Speaker 0: they're just normal things that i say and other people are just like ah oh my god oh my god.

570
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:53,082
Speaker 1: yeah so i guess while we do a lot i mean we put out all this content on the internet.

571
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,033
Speaker 1: it doesn't take effort for us it only takes time.

572
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:59,949
Speaker 0: yeah it would take effort if i had to like get up and walk around or something

573
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,838
Speaker 1: or if we had to think of things to say

574
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:05,536
Speaker 0: well we do have to think about what to talk about but once we get going we're good

575
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:08,570
Speaker 1: yeah and thinking about what we talk about is usually just all right.

576
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,936
Speaker 1: there's three things in the news.

577
00:31:10,177 --> 00:31:11,402
Speaker 1: we can't talk forever.

578
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:13,027
Speaker 1: which one are we not going to talk about?

579
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:14,372
Speaker 0: the boring one?

580
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:17,483
Speaker 1: yeah someday we'll probably record the process.

581
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,126
Speaker 1: we you know what.

582
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:21,439
Speaker 1: let's do a show next week where we we don't actually do our news.

583
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:28,181
Speaker 1: we just record us deciding which news we're going to do and then we'll record the news for the next day one.

584
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,445
Speaker 1: it kills two episodes.

585
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:33,776
Speaker 0: news wise we'll wait for there to be not enough news.

586
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,528
Speaker 0: yeah no i got it on a day where there's like shit shit news.

587
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,242
Speaker 0: we'll just record us figuring out that this shit shit news.

588
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:46,706
Speaker 1: yeah coming to the conclusion that there's nothing and then picking two crap news isn't doing them all right.

589
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:48,311
Speaker 0: so what can you do?

590
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:55,315
Speaker 0: if you want to be productive and you have some ideas for things to do like projects and such but you're too lazy and you won't do them?

591
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:58,206
Speaker 1: well the easiest answer is do them.

592
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:01,881
Speaker 1: if you can't overcome your laziness to do it you didn't really want to do it anyway.

593
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:03,949
Speaker 0: that's pretty much what it comes down to.

594
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:15,336
Speaker 0: i mean if you set projects for yourself that you don't want to do enough that you you know you might want the result but if you don't actually want to do what it takes to get that result then you don't want to do it.

595
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,260
Speaker 0: you're not going to do it.

596
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:19,514
Speaker 0: if you have to do it you're eventually going to be forced to.

597
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:20,700
Speaker 0: so that's that's what we'll talk about.

598
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,723
Speaker 0: procrastination next.

599
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:28,042
Speaker 1: but yeah like case in point i was i decided i wanted to learn how to run jboss servers.

600
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,813
Speaker 1: so i got all this documentation.

601
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:31,596
Speaker 1: i'm reading through it.

602
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:35,592
Speaker 1: i decided i'm going to teach myself jboss because it's useful to put on my resume blah blah blah.

603
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:39,930
Speaker 1: but the thing is i don't like jboss and i didn't like learning about it.

604
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:50,212
Speaker 1: and every time like i'd have to force myself to read the documentation and like install the server and play with it and eventually i realized all right i'm never going to actually do this because i hate it and i stopped.

605
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,065
Speaker 1: meanwhile i decided i wanted to learn.

606
00:32:53,245 --> 00:33:01,759
Speaker 1: uh a while a long time ago i decided to learn hongdol which is the way you're right in korean and i really wanted to even though it's useless to me because i wasn't.

607
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,962
Speaker 1: i didn't think i was going to actually learn korean and i learned it in like a week just because i actually wanted to do it.

608
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:13,656
Speaker 1: if you don't want to do something don't force yourself to do it because it's never going to get done ever and if it is it won't be satisfying you're.

609
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:15,924
Speaker 0: you're mainly just going to unpleasantness for yourself.

610
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:19,981
Speaker 0: if you want a result and you don't want to do the work required to get the result.

611
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:20,624
Speaker 0: here's an example.

612
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:28,797
Speaker 0: let's say you want a new uh piece of furniture and you think i'll build it but you don't actually like building furniture and you just never get around to it.

613
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:32,655
Speaker 1: not only will it suck to build it and cost you more but it'll look like ass when you're done.

614
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:42,174
Speaker 0: just hire someone to do it to get the result for money and spend your time doing something you like to do and maybe get money for that you can use to pay for the other thing.

615
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 0: that's why we have an economy.

616
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:48,059
Speaker 1: yep i mean i see so many people that are so unmotivated and i can't imagine that.

617
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:51,599
Speaker 1: but then i realize that these people are all trying to do things that they don't really want to do.

618
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:52,803
Speaker 1: it's that simple?

619
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:59,688
Speaker 0: yeah i mean if there's like a book and you'd be like man i really got to read this book but you never read it.

620
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,196
Speaker 0: obviously you don't like the book.

621
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:02,543
Speaker 0: get rid of it and read different books.

622
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:02,925
Speaker 0: yeah

623
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:16,652
Speaker 1: i mean if you're reading i actually that happened to me recently there's a book i'm reading and i really wanted to read it but it wasn't the kind of book that you read straight through and i was having trouble just like picking it up and continuing it and i realized suddenly all right this is dumb.

624
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:19,406
Speaker 1: i'm just gonna read this book that i want to read and i'll put that one in the bathroom.

625
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:22,097
Speaker 0: yeah excellent well which book was that?

626
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:23,703
Speaker 1: it was the biography.

627
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:25,190
Speaker 1: it was a biography of peter the great.

628
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,581
Speaker 0: yeah no one can read that because i really want to.

629
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:29,550
Speaker 1: i'm really interested in peter the great.

630
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,085
Speaker 1: i know quite a bit about him but this is an extremely detailed biography.

631
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:35,858
Speaker 0: i looked at it in the bathroom once and i was just like what the hell.

632
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,739
Speaker 1: so now i read like a chapter every now and then but i don't force myself to read it when i don't want to.

633
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,771
Speaker 1: yeah now procrastination is an entirely different beast.

634
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,275
Speaker 0: it mainly affects students.

635
00:34:47,918 --> 00:35:01,064
Speaker 1: yeah i will say with in no uncertain terms that i for the entirety of my time at the rochester institute of technology put off every single project i ever had until the absolute last second and then put myself through hell trying to finish it.

636
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:06,602
Speaker 0: i procrastinated 90 of the time throughout my entire student career.

637
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:06,642
Speaker 0: i

638
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:20,923
Speaker 1: mean i would literally i remember the moment my sophomore year where because for my whole life before no matter how much i procrastinated i would always like just pull it all night or the night before finish the paper fall asleep wake up like two hours later and go to class and turn it in.

639
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:31,374
Speaker 1: there was one time when i was writing a paper overnight and it was due the next day and the sun came up and class was in an hour and i still wasn't done.

640
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:36,585
Speaker 1: wow i finished it barely and you know what.

641
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:39,759
Speaker 1: that didn't change me i i procrastinated just as much in the next paper.

642
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,809
Speaker 0: so you know what eventually got me on the papers was.

643
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:51,467
Speaker 0: i realized it doesn't really take that long for me to write papers and that like i would write a paper and then i would spend a long time editing and rewriting and rewriting your drink.

644
00:35:52,531 --> 00:36:02,210
Speaker 0: then one time i just wrote one and just submitted it because i was like oh whatever i got a good grade so i just stopped putting in a whole lot of work into them and i just did have been handed them in.

645
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,712
Speaker 0: i didn't care.

646
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:09,762
Speaker 1: yep well it depends partly at least if you're a procrastinator in college on the school you go to because rit had no pluses or minuses to grades.

647
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:21,878
Speaker 1: it was a b c fail and super fail and that was also d. well yeah d was basically a failure because it counted as a pass but it didn't count for the prerequisites of other classes.

648
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:25,813
Speaker 1: so you basically had to take the class again unless it wasn't a class in your major.

649
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:28,805
Speaker 1: so a d was effectively a failure.

650
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:29,768
Speaker 0: i did not know that.

651
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:35,006
Speaker 1: yeah d's did not count as prerequisites unless you got special permission which no one ever got.

652
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:51,054
Speaker 1: wow so at rit you either said i am going to put the effort forth to get an a or you shot for the low b because the low b was the minimum effort and you still got a b even though you almost got a c. but now you got a b.

653
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:56,072
Speaker 0: see throughout my entire schooling i always just never did put an extra effort.

654
00:36:56,393 --> 00:37:00,568
Speaker 0: i did every graded assignment and i attended class and that was it.

655
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,592
Speaker 0: that's all i did.

656
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:04,262
Speaker 0: i never did reading assignments unless it was literature.

657
00:37:04,342 --> 00:37:05,286
Speaker 1: i never bought my books.

658
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:07,756
Speaker 1: i never did my reading i never did reading.

659
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,743
Speaker 0: i only did literature reading like i just said.

660
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,088
Speaker 1: actually i didn't do that.

661
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,324
Speaker 1: oh i i never read the tree stars whatever that terrible book tree red stars.

662
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:18,149
Speaker 0: yeah i read that in like a day.

663
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:24,463
Speaker 1: i didn't even buy it or read it and but i did.

664
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:27,590
Speaker 0: um i'm losing it because i'm tired.

665
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:41,747
Speaker 0: yeah i mean basically oh i never studied at anything ever ever ever ever and somehow i always got like b's and a's and the very rare c except uh calculus.

666
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:45,180
Speaker 0: until one day i took calculus three and i did the same exact thing and i failed.

667
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,667
Speaker 0: and then i said oh shits i better take that again.

668
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,470
Speaker 0: and i failed.

669
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:59,927
Speaker 0: and then i said oh shits and it's a three in the summer and i gotta see yep three times in calculus three and then i said thank god i never have to take calculus again.

670
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:00,630
Speaker 0: god damn

671
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:21,893
Speaker 1: i guess all i want to say about procrastination is that a lot of people say it's a bad thing and all i have to say is that procrastination is probably responsible for much of the happiness in my life today because if i hadn't procrastinated if i had been diligent and done all my schoolwork like worked on my projects ahead of time throughout the quarter i wouldn't have had half the fun that i had in college.

672
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:27,011
Speaker 1: no i wouldn't be doing work i'd have a 4.0 but i wouldn't have enjoyed myself.

673
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:29,119
Speaker 1: i mean how many times did i like a lot?

674
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,469
Speaker 1: there were projects in it that were always like all right.

675
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:43,451
Speaker 1: you have all quarter 10 weeks to do this and basically if you go to the lab every weekend for like two or three hours all quarter you'll be done by like the ninth week and then you just turn in your work.

676
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,243
Speaker 0: but that pretty much rules out any all weekend activities.

677
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:58,731
Speaker 1: so instead i would just jack screw around all week all weekend all quarter and then around week eight i'd realize oh shit and then i'd kill one whole weekend like barely finishing the project and then i'd go back just like enough.

678
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:00,700
Speaker 0: it also depends a lot on your friends.

679
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:08,173
Speaker 0: i mean if all your friends are procrastinators then they won't want to hang out with you in the end of the semester anyway because they'll all be doing the same thing.

680
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,620
Speaker 0: you're doing yep bit by bit.

681
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:17,228
Speaker 1: all our friends that actually did their schoolwork drifted apart from us just because they they were around because we all skip classes to go do stuff.

682
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:25,840
Speaker 0: yeah and if you hang out with people who you know do their schoolwork then those then you have to do it too because otherwise you won't be available.

683
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:33,072
Speaker 0: at the same time you'll be you know freewheeling it alone most of the quarter and then at the end they'll have a little bit more free time and you'll be locked up.

684
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:37,828
Speaker 1: yeah i mean skipping a class alone for whatever reason is usually stupid.

685
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:49,373
Speaker 1: but the best time to skip a class is say you go for lunch at the cafeteria somewhere or like a campus thing and you're eating and then you run into three of your friends and you all have class at one and you eat lunch together.

686
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:57,328
Speaker 1: that's the point especially if they're not slackers when you have to convince them to skip class with you if they don't skip you might as well not skip either.

687
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:03,212
Speaker 1: but if you can get more the more people you get to skip something with you or procrastinate with you the more fun you'll have net.

688
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:06,546
Speaker 0: now you got to keep in mind when you procrastinate.

689
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:10,664
Speaker 0: you're saying all right i don't want to do this now because it doesn't have to be done now.

690
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:11,868
Speaker 0: it can be done later.

691
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:17,648
Speaker 0: and if you're going to neglect not doing it right now you better do something good.

692
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,517
Speaker 0: otherwise you should have done the thing instead.

693
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:26,155
Speaker 0: yep but it is the other thing a lot of people um make like little planners and things right.

694
00:40:26,617 --> 00:40:29,007
Speaker 0: yeah now all i gotta say about this is number one.

695
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:39,028
Speaker 0: if you have a really terrible memory like you can't remember what i was saying to you a minute ago you don't remember the name of this podcast then you probably need some sort of little planning book or something.

696
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:47,937
Speaker 0: but if your memory is good and you know like i generally remember what i have to do like oh i have to go to work today.

697
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,883
Speaker 0: oh this is what i have to do at work.

698
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:57,346
Speaker 0: you know i might have like a really sort of sketchy to-do list somewhere but i don't really look at it so much.

699
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,695
Speaker 0: but you got to be careful.

700
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:08,482
Speaker 0: if you're the person who needs a list of things to do or a schedule or whatnot don't spend more time fiddling with that than doing the actual stuff.

701
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:15,004
Speaker 1: yeah these freaking life hackers who spend more time like trying to organize their life than they do living their life.

702
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:23,943
Speaker 0: yeah it's like they got these moleskines and things and it's like i have a fancy notebook and i write my things down in a special way and it's like you spend a whole you spend.

703
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:27,620
Speaker 0: how many hours writing down what you're gonna do you could spend doing stuff.

704
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:28,943
Speaker 0: it's like what the hell?

705
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:32,914
Speaker 0: yep uh just i don't get those people.

706
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:33,937
Speaker 0: don't be that guy.

707
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:37,632
Speaker 1: yeah the moral here is just if you're gonna procrastinate do it for a reason.

708
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:42,651
Speaker 1: if you don't have a reason to put something off you might as well do it now.

709
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:43,995
Speaker 1: the reason could be trivial.

710
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:49,355
Speaker 1: the reason could be like i want donuts so instead of doing your paper you drive out to get donuts.

711
00:41:49,495 --> 00:41:52,848
Speaker 0: yeah but don't sit around going or i should be doing my paper.

712
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,514
Speaker 1: that's the worst thing.

713
00:41:54,594 --> 00:42:04,859
Speaker 1: the people who procrastinate but then worry about what they're procrastinating about and as a result they don't get their work done and at the same time they don't enjoy the extra free time they got by not doing their work.

714
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:12,129
Speaker 0: that's like the worst thing you can do yeah because you basically just wasted time you didn't get fun and you didn't get anything done either.

715
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,780
Speaker 1: yep you're still fucked and now it's later.

716
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:20,538
Speaker 0: good job you're the winner or actually no you're the loser if you do that.

717
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:22,144
Speaker 1: yeah we just always make fun of our friend pete.

718
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:26,863
Speaker 1: you know pete the one who's now a scientist of somewhat he's somewhat respected ill repute.

719
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:30,714
Speaker 0: oh no wait that's the wrong words.

720
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:35,416
Speaker 1: and you know we had him on the episode on the show a while ago as uh when we talked about pseudoscience.

721
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:41,635
Speaker 1: we're gonna have him on again sometime hopefully soon and he'd always around midnight or one he'd go home.

722
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:44,464
Speaker 0: yeah i we're like why are you going home?

723
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:45,390
Speaker 0: everyone else is staying.

724
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,758
Speaker 0: he'd be like i got an 8 a.m class.

725
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:48,748
Speaker 0: i'm like you don't have to go to the 8 a.m class.

726
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,079
Speaker 0: he'd be like yeah i gotta go to the 8 a.m class.

727
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,902
Speaker 0: there's like a test.

728
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:56,960
Speaker 0: yeah we're like all right we don't want you to go but we can't prevent you from leaving.

729
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,928
Speaker 0: he would never go to the 8 a.m class.

730
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:01,478
Speaker 1: yeah ever he just go home and sleep through it anyway.

731
00:43:01,498 --> 00:43:05,978
Speaker 0: yeah it's like he could have stayed and it would have been better off but no it didn't listen to us.

732
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:08,663
Speaker 0: good job.

733
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:12,698

734
00:43:12,738 --> 00:43:14,805
Speaker 0: i think i think that's all we got.

735

Speaker 0: yeah right betelgeuse.

740
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:35,958

741
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:40,714
Speaker 0: yeah if you say occupation of i i seem to think ill repute for some reason.

742
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:41,235
Speaker 1: really.

743
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:52,154

744
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:53,880
Speaker 1: yeah did we ever tell the?

745
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,370
Speaker 1: it's a me mario story on geek nights from ohio con?

746
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,075
Speaker 0: yeah yeah okay we did great.

747
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:08,500
Speaker 1: in other news i doodled a fairly poorly stylized picture of a deer with three legs while i did this episode.

748
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,260
Speaker 0: is it anything like a formula one car with three wheels?

749
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,445
Speaker 1: that was amazing.

750
00:44:15,465 --> 00:44:19,462
Speaker 1: i don't know what to say about that other than it should be your thing of the day on monday.

751
00:44:19,763 --> 00:44:21,648
Speaker 0: i think it's gonna be if nothing else comes up.

752
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:25,198
Speaker 1: all right i'm going to bed.

753
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,325
Speaker 0: next thursday we'll have a better episode.

754
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:35,132
Speaker 1: yes actually next thursday we decided we didn't want to do it today because one we want to warn people and two we want to be awake.

755
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:41,757
Speaker 1: for this one we're i mean geek nights hasn't really done anything particularly i don't know risque or controversial.

756
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:46,977
Speaker 0: yeah i mean if i had to rate geek nights i'd give it a pg-13 except sometimes you say fuck.

757
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:52,135
Speaker 0: so you have to give it a rated r like yeah you can have up to one fuck in a pg-13 movie.

758
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,004
Speaker 1: oh really in many cases it depends on how it's used.

759
00:44:55,185 --> 00:44:56,870
Speaker 0: so we're we're somewhere between low pg-13.

760
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,061
Speaker 0: well low r high pg-13.

761
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:01,285
Speaker 1: yeah something like that.

762
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:06,100
Speaker 1: next thursday we're going to delve into yet untested geek nights.

763
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:16,279
Speaker 0: so if you are of i don't know a different mind or maybe possibly under the age of 18 i don't know.

764
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,565
Speaker 0: yeah what are the?

765
00:45:17,826 --> 00:45:23,453
Speaker 1: we might have to put the explicit tag on that one if you would violate a law by listening to two guys talk about masturbation.

766
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:25,181
Speaker 1: don't listen to next thursday's geek nights.

767
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:31,884
Speaker 0: we are going to talk about masturbation specifically male masturbation because we do not have vaginas.

768
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,795
Speaker 0: if we had vaginas we would talk about female masturbation.

769
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:52,264
Speaker 0: now that we have actually lots mostly because we are grand masters grand masturbators and i guarantee this is gonna be the funniest episode of geek nights ever you wouldn't believe how many stars we have.

770
00:45:52,284 --> 00:45:57,703
Speaker 0: um for any of you because we know we have we might have to do a part one and a part two.

771
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:58,306
Speaker 1: we have.

772
00:45:58,326 --> 00:46:19,026
Speaker 1: we know we have a lot of listeners who haven't been to college yet who still in high school and i don't think you guys realize the complicated nature of college masturbatory habits because you have a roommate and neither one of you wants to talk about masturbation but somehow you both have to make it known when you both will be there and will not be there so everyone can satisfy themselves.

773
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:24,402
Speaker 0: we should do part one uh stroking it and part two finishing it.

774
00:46:24,422 --> 00:46:27,089
Speaker 0: i'm just i don't know.

775
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:28,593
Speaker 0: this is like a gold mine.

776
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:41,113
Speaker 0: so just be warned if you are the uh faint of heart yeah or if if you would in any way violate a law by listening to next thursday's geek nights or if you're easily offended.

777
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:44,185
Speaker 1: if you're easily offended why are you still listening to the show?

778
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:46,656
Speaker 0: i mean because they like being offended.

779
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:46,997
Speaker 0: and you know.

780
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:52,123
Speaker 0: if you're easily offended and you're listening to the show still and you're getting offended keep listening because i love offending you.

781
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:54,453
Speaker 0: it's great and tell me about it too.

782
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:54,895
Speaker 0: i want to get.

783
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:57,725
Speaker 0: i haven't got a single hate mail because of geek nights.

784
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:59,631
Speaker 1: yeah you're right we haven't gotten any.

785
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,538
Speaker 0: i want i've got.

786
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:01,839
Speaker 1: i got.

787
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:12,415
Speaker 1: hey i wrote a freaking article about being happy in the college newspaper at rit like this dinky little newspaper called gracie's dinnertime theater and i got fucking hate mail.

788
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:17,653
Speaker 1: why doesn't geek nights which has far more listeners than that had readers get hate mail?

789
00:47:17,974 --> 00:47:18,716
Speaker 1: i want hate mail.

790
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,522
Speaker 1: i don't want fake mail though.

791
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:28,084
Speaker 0: yeah as soon as i when we get a real hate mail i tell you what any real legitimate hate mail and i can tell.

792
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,048
Speaker 0: don't think i can't tell.

793
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:33,043
Speaker 0: yeah we know we know you know mr period will check it too so he knows.

794
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,710
Speaker 1: yeah and someone already asked.

795
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:46,124
Speaker 1: we're not gonna tell you who mr period is because it's a long story but this person has a lot more free time than they should and for whatever reason they want to do this for us.

796
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:46,806
Speaker 0: yeah.

797
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:54,173
Speaker 0: so yeah watch your grammar and spelling in the forms and mr beard will come after you although he is going to be a little bit lenient.

798
00:47:54,234 --> 00:47:56,263
Speaker 0: so if you write te he'll be.

799
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:57,530
Speaker 0: he'll be like all right that happens.

800
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,203
Speaker 1: i think that's mostly because the first person he went after was you.

801
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:01,607
Speaker 0: yeah what do you want?

802
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:05,379
Speaker 0: but see that was actually when he went after me.

803
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:08,329
Speaker 0: that was a typo and not uh i had the words there.

804
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,218
Speaker 0: i just accidentally deleted them i'm sure anyway.

805
00:48:11,278 --> 00:48:11,459
Speaker 1: yeah.
