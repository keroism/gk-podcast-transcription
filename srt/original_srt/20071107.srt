1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,997
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday November 7th.

2
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,020
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:15,090
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,529
Speaker 1: Why Naruto sucks?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:42,400
Speaker 1: So I came home the other day to box a really heavy big box, and it said to Scott Yeah, well there's a lot of boxes coming from the mail these days so sadly none of them contain brides.

7
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:43,912
Speaker 1: I wish there were some brides in there.

8
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:48,938
Speaker 1: That'd be nice, but no Not Yoko Kanno, I guess she would count as a bride.

9
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:54,006
Speaker 1: no Anyway, you know I had a.

10
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,109
Speaker 0: this is no joke.

11
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:01,873
Speaker 0: I had a teacher in high school whose father Did in fact get a Russian mail-order bride.

12
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:05,424
Speaker 1: I remember back in that when I was in Rochester There was on the local radio.

13
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:10,780
Speaker 1: a guy called in and talked about how he would go to Russia to be with brides.

14
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:16,637
Speaker 0: No this was that she came over and lived with him as his wife yeah, and she learned English.

15
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,700
Speaker 1: it is a real thing.

16
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:19,819
Speaker 1: It's kind of creepy, but it's real.

17
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:28,598
Speaker 0: It was an interesting situation And he would periodically give us updates about how his stepmother the Russian mail-order bride was doing.

18
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:40,620
Speaker 1: yeah Anyway, yeah, so in this box I don't know if everyone listening knows But I get a like the way I buy comics as I ordered them from this website DCB service calm direct comic book service.

19
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:47,333
Speaker 1: And the way it works is you order comic books two months in advance Which is kind of sucks because you don't get to look before you buy.

20
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:52,835
Speaker 1: and sometimes I buy crap But it's worth it because I get like 40% off.

21
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:56,872
Speaker 1: so even if I buy crap I still save a shit ton of money, and I get like.

22
00:01:56,932 --> 00:02:03,140
Speaker 1: I spend like a hundred bucks in comics every month But I get like two hundred and fifty dollars worth of comics, and it's just like this big mountain.

23
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:12,360
Speaker 0: It's great because whenever I want a comic I if I find out when it's coming out I just tell Scott hey put it in your thing, and then it comes for almost no money almost no money.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,025
Speaker 1: I mean manga.

25
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,101
Speaker 1: even an expensive manga will be like eight bucks Amy.

26
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:29,278
Speaker 1: and sometimes every month is like specials some like last volume of Death Note five dollars Five dollars brand new not used or anything anyway, so two of these comics of the I don't know 20 or so.

27
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:40,296
Speaker 1: Usually what happens is it sort of comes in waves so I could be light month with a little tiny box a little tiny Box little tiny box big box, and it was finally the big box this time, but I got the the trial of Colonel sweeto.

28
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:50,459
Speaker 0: Oh My god, which if you don't know what that is I suggest you search for the Perry Bible fellowship Which is nothing as nothing to do with Perry's Bibles or fellowships.

29
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,393
Speaker 1: I think it has something to do with Perry's does it now?

30
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:54,740
Speaker 1: it does indeed well.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,680
Speaker 0: Regardless it is in my opinion one of the funniest things ever put to ink or any other medium.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,500
Speaker 1: I would put it in the top 10 comic strips of all time in the history of the world.

33
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:06,982
Speaker 0: It's just.

34
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:10,980
Speaker 0: it's so wonderful and the book doesn't actually have a lot of specials in it.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,898
Speaker 0: It has like 10 lost strips even though I've seen some of those so I'm not sure how lost they really were.

36
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,283
Speaker 0: but yeah Not.

37
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:22,940
Speaker 0: I expected commentary on all of them, and I was really sad to only get commentary on the lost strips.

38
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter because it's still worth it to have those things a little book.

39
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah website is sort of annoying to navigate.

40
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:32,619
Speaker 0: I just I love it, but the other thing I got that was really important.

41
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,423
Speaker 0: here We've talked a bit about.

42
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:39,539
Speaker 0: Jason are one of our favorite comic artists, and he did such things as why are you doing this?

43
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:39,619
Speaker 0: and?

44
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,504
Speaker 1: The Left Bank game?

45
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:42,950
Speaker 0: yeah, that was the good one.

46
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:51,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was all Hemingway, but it was also Anyway, they all have a very distinctive style, and we've talked about that, but I want to do a quick geek bite here.

47
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,300
Speaker 1: I remember back in the day when I first found out about what are you doing this from like some blog?

48
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,003
Speaker 1: I think was boiling boiling and I was like and I read the description of it I'm like oh, man.

49
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,008
Speaker 1: That's a comic for him.

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,173
Speaker 1: It was like years ago.

51
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:02,655
Speaker 0: Think about it.

52
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:02,796
Speaker 0: You're

53
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,466
Speaker 1: an RIT still Maybe it's

54
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,763
Speaker 0: a short simple psychological thriller

55
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:16,420
Speaker 1: and it had like animal people and I was like I soon as I read the description I knew it was the Comic for rim, and it took me how many years to actually get a copy of it, and then what I did.

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,384
Speaker 1: I was so right.

57
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,834
Speaker 0: so uh we just got finally.

58
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,279
Speaker 0: I think it's one of his newest works.

59
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,043
Speaker 1: It's the newest one.

60
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:33,347
Speaker 0: yeah is the title is I killed Adolf Hitler I killed Adolf Hitler and It's about Exactly, what do you think it's about?

61
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,110
Speaker 1: It's like you think.

62
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,416
Speaker 1: oh, you know it's one of you know.

63
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:41,016
Speaker 1: usually when people make something About Hitler like he appears once or you know it doesn't actually have to do with Hitler literally.

64
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:49,461
Speaker 1: no literally I killed it off Hitler literally, and I'm not gonna ruin it cuz Crime.

65
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:56,915
Speaker 0: but one you should read everything this man ever writes, but two I Just remembered what happened to Hitler.

Speaker 0: I killed Adolf Hitler.

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,731

00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:07,920
Speaker 0: all I know is that they there.

72
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:12,554
Speaker 0: The trend in these works tends to be along the lines of concept.

73
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:13,337
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

74
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:21,040

75
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,520

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,666

99
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:37,160
Speaker 1: I'm ready all right, so there was a survey company called Oricon right which is a big Japanese survey company.

100
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:52,982
Speaker 1: I always see their name attached to all sorts of surveys about anime and stuff and they did a they survey for Japan's culture day on November 3rd and They had a questionnaire at and the questionnaire asked which cultural figure represents Japan?

101
00:06:53,323 --> 00:07:11,543
Speaker 1: right like they asked Japanese people which cultural figure you know represents your country and They had two thousand two thousand people online and they evenly divided them between all the different age groups five different age groups You know of both genders and the results were Number two.

102
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:18,120
Speaker 1: the number two person who represents Japan was Miyazaki all right, but that's expected and acceptable.

103
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,142
Speaker 1: You know the number one Person was.

104
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:28,711
Speaker 1: I could say something funny, but it's a Japanese person you know, but I doubt you'll guess it, but just try Satoshi Ka.

105
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,320
Speaker 1: I know It was a Takeshi Kitano.

106
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,840
Speaker 1: Really, yes, really, huh?

107
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,292

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,860

113
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:02,200
Speaker 1: I think he was Zato Ichi in a recent in the recent Zato Ichi movie.

114
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:10,308
Speaker 0: He's almost as cool as Koyasu almost as cool as Takehito Koyasu, but not quite Aka pumpkin head.

115
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:22,851
Speaker 1: no, but you should Seek out Takeshi Kitano also known as beat Takeshi and see him in all his Artistic endeavors usually TV shows and movies right.

116
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:35,693
Speaker 0: so this is slightly old news But it's kind of interesting, and I'm very happy about this, but according to anime news network There's a new anime distributor translator, or whatever.

117
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:43,313
Speaker 0: just so we need another anime called Reanimedia and they're going to be releasing the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

Speaker 1: Are Russians into anime?

126
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,933
Speaker 0: uh you know what I would imagine.

127
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:06,910
Speaker 0: so because it seems like Most of the world is into anime in some form.

128
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:13,894
Speaker 1: no Italy is super into anime like Italy loves going to gain To Italy and actually from what I hear Mexico Mexico.

Speaker 1: They know how to use computers pretty well.

136
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,999

142
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:47,039
Speaker 1: go to countries that don't have anime and bring it there.

143

Speaker 1: why they only buy the u.s.. Rights probably?

148
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,254
Speaker 1: Why don't you try to buy like some worldwide rights, and then you know go big.

149
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:01,640
Speaker 0: see it's hard to say.

150
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:06,820
Speaker 0: I wonder what the Japanese even say to someone offering to buy a worldwide right or not exclusive.

151
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,630
Speaker 1: That's really why the Japanese get the world right.

152
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,957
Speaker 1: they already own the world right rice.

153
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:10,480
Speaker 1: They made it.

154
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,009
Speaker 1: Why don't they go worldwide?

155
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:12,411
Speaker 1: I don't know I?

156
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Speaker 0: Take issue with a lot of the way Japan tries to my.

157
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,465
Speaker 1: Take the world.

158
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,939
Speaker 1: I also take issue, but you would think that would be the way to get the most profits.

159
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,535
Speaker 1: no You know I don't know.

160
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:28,525
Speaker 1: maybe a less Potential profit, but lower risk.

161
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:33,640
Speaker 0: or maybe they've realized that the American anime companies will just bend over and take it regardless.

162
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,911
Speaker 0: So why bother changing?

163
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,000
Speaker 1: yeah again?

164
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:40,555
Speaker 1: I wonder are they really making the most from the American ones and compared to any other country?

165
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:44,186
Speaker 0: see the problem is None of them ever say anything.

166
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,910
Speaker 1: we have no idea what anime.

167
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:51,151
Speaker 1: so we know like the UK anime companies could be you know Doing a lot better than the American ones.

168
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,661
Speaker 1: who knows I mean There's.

169
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:58,820
Speaker 0: so we've complained about this a lot and so is that in my world order the anime industry is so tight-lipped in the u.s.

170
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,079
Speaker 0: That it's it's ludicrous like it bothers me.

171
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:08,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't they see that like in every other industry the companies that are you know the more well?

172
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,659
Speaker 1: I don't know.

173
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,810
Speaker 1: I guess that's sort of incorrect to say that because you look at places like Apple and Google It's like the the tight lips and it seems to work out.

174
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:19,540
Speaker 1: But I guess well people tend to like companies that lose their lips.

175
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:44,757
Speaker 0: Well at the same time I feel like they could put a lot more pressure on the Japanese companies if even if they weren't more open if they I don't know colluded illegally Or in some way if any of them would just stand up and say no That much money is ludicrous for a show that you're not even gonna Let me release for a year and a half in the u.s.. And won't let me talk about until two weeks before whatever.

176
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:53,985
Speaker 1: yep Well people just you know they they don't make the day of the hardcore like business deal where businessmen duke it out and and drive A hard bargain.

177
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,820
Speaker 1: I think that day is sort of long gone.

178
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,586
Speaker 0: I don't think it is.

179
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,420
Speaker 0: I just think the anime companies in the u.s.

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,800
Speaker 0: Are run mostly by anime fans as opposed to by businessman with testicles.

181
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,358
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

182
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,088
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what I can say about this.

183
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,689
Speaker 1: Mickey fail.

184
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:24,946
Speaker 0: What it is a blog not in English Dedicated to pictures of Mickey Mouse that portray him in an unflattering way.

185
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,110
Speaker 1: Oh Mickey fail.

186
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,557
Speaker 0: Feo fe I.

187
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,847
Speaker 1: oh oh that's not Spanish, but that is a Latin language of some sort.

188
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:32,890
Speaker 1: because fail in Spanish.

189
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:39,584
Speaker 0: Oh, I never would have guessed yeah But I look ugly Mickey Mouse ugly Mickey Mouse bunch of ugly Mickey mice.

190
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,852
Speaker 1: you like ugly Mickey Mouse I don't know.

191
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:47,210
Speaker 0: I just I guess this speaks of the fact that one there's a blog for everything.

192
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:58,900
Speaker 0: That's true everything - I don't know that there's some amount of novelty to looking at a website that is so Specialized and to such a specific audience.

193
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:03,513
Speaker 1: I don't think it's more specialized than nadshots.com I don't know.

194
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,175
Speaker 0: it might be.

195
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:04,918
Speaker 1: no it's not.

196
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:05,439
Speaker 0: it might be.

197
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,164
Speaker 0: that is in all comics.

198
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,990
Speaker 0: This is just Mickey Mouse.

199
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:13,775
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe but anyway Looks like a penis.

200
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,059
Speaker 1: I want to take this opportunity.

201
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:15,461
Speaker 1: So does this?

202
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:19,894
Speaker 0: I think that Mickey Mouse is constructed entirely of Stylized palaces.

203
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:24,429
Speaker 1: I want to take this opportunity to say that I actually really like Mickey Mouse and that.

204
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:31,669
Speaker 1: One thing that constantly pisses me off is that Disney doesn't let anyone make any Mickey Mouse cartoons with their endless copyright.

205
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,310
Speaker 0: BS Huh, but it wasn't that wasn't that copyright just about to expire?

206
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:38,110
Speaker 0: Bono copyright saved the day.

207
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,627
Speaker 1: But at the same time what have they done with Mickey Mouse besides merchandise since the prince of the pauper?

208
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:44,389
Speaker 1: well nothing.

209
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,910
Speaker 0: Let him fade as fast as they can into obscurity.

210
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,362
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean more people around the world recognize Mario than recognize Mickey Mouse at this point.

211
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,775
Speaker 1: make Mickey Mouse cartoons make a whole Full.

212
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,718
Speaker 1: you know, you make a full-length Animation motion picture every summer.

213
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,470
Speaker 1: Why don't you put Mickey Mouse in one of those freaking movies?

214
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:11,103
Speaker 0: See is I'd be all for that except there's someone who needs a movie theater to see that shit much more desperately and that's Donald Duck, but you got a course.

215
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 1: put all of them in there.

216
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:18,030
Speaker 1: But you know Mickey Mouse would be the main guy and you call it, you know I mean the other day I was randomly watching some of those old like goofy cartoons.

217
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,917
Speaker 0: Like goofy teaches you how to ski.

218
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:26,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, or ah, I know you are the biggest fan of the goofy and the Donald Duck.

219
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,179
Speaker 0: More so but well more than anything.

220
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,690
Speaker 0: It's anytime Donald Duck and Chip and Dale get into it.

221
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,990
Speaker 1: Yeah for me it's all about like the Mickey and the Beanstalk sock action.

222
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:38,989
Speaker 1: but of course Mickey and the Beanstalk is so great, but that part with goofy on the jello.

223
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:46,369
Speaker 1: You bring this up every time we talk about Jello, if you haven't seen Mickey and the Beanstalk, you're not human being.

224
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,438
Speaker 1: And also, I mean, come on Fantasia best part Mickey Mouse.

225
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,102
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

226
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:56,274
Speaker 1: say I guess that's second to the the finale Not a bomb out.

227
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,881
Speaker 1: All right, do I need to do a thing today?

228
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:58,845
Speaker 0: I think you do.

229
00:14:58,945 --> 00:14:59,990
Speaker 1: Okay, Mickey Mouse is awesome.

239
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:20,849
Speaker 0: it was good.

240
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:25,512

00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,380
Speaker 0: I see something on the internet and he saw it.

250
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:47,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, the difference is when I you know Different I don't care.

251
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,654
Speaker 1: You say it's so old.

252
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:50,317
Speaker 1: I'm like whatever.

253
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,160
Speaker 1: I just found it.

254
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,496
Speaker 0: However, if you've never seen it, you know yesterday I did Half-life in 60 seconds.

255
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:56,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

256
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,001
Speaker 0: This is rocky.

257
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,330
Speaker 0: One, two, three, four, five and six in five seconds.

258
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

259
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:21,030
Speaker 1: so my actual thing today from anime news network is anime news network like many other blogs and cool websites that provide geek news had a pumpkin carving contest and these are all the pictures of the pumpkin carving contest and Many of them, you know, some are better than others But you know anime themed pumpkins some of them amazing in quality.

260
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:26,330
Speaker 0: Scott tried to show me a picture of his favorite pumpkin, but every time I tried to look at it He turned the laptop away.

261
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:27,295
Speaker 1: What?

262
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:27,719
Speaker 1: no, I didn't.

263
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,058
Speaker 0: ah You could have run with that.

264
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:35,399
Speaker 0: cuz if think about what your eyes Ruined the joke, maybe why do you do this to me?

265
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, yes, this is some really good pumpkins going on here.

266
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,359
Speaker 1: I mean, I see this really good gonkotsu.

267
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,585
Speaker 1: Oh one this housing one.

268
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:42,630
Speaker 1: That's just like amazing.

269
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,190
Speaker 1: Here is one where they actually made the pumpkin into a Haro.

270
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,723
Speaker 1: It's good stuff going on here, but Scott.

271
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:50,909
Speaker 0: What is the best one?

272
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:59,205
Speaker 1: Well, it's not actually the best one because the actual Quality of it is is pretty low, but the boo pumpkin is amazing.

273
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:00,690
Speaker 1: I like booze.

274
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:11,709
Speaker 1: I mean you could they could have just taken a picture of a boo printed out of their printer and taped it to the front of the pumpkin And then on the backside of the pumpkin taped a picture of the boo with his eyes closed And that would have been good enough for me.

275
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:15,707
Speaker 0: You hear that fangirls draw a boo and Scott will be all over that.

276
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:25,790
Speaker 0: maybe It's actually kind of sad because for the last two years we have said all right We're gonna carve pumpkins here in the game more like for flash ten years.

277
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,070
Speaker 0: Well here I mean known you pretend you count our IT where every year we wanted to carve pumpkins.

278
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,463
Speaker 0: But either I didn't have enough money to buy a pumpkin this year.

279
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:35,687
Speaker 1: We even failed at buying them.

280
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:38,941
Speaker 0: We didn't get one I don't know what's because last year we went and bought pumpkins.

281
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,030
Speaker 0: We're like, oh man, we got three pumpkins.

282
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:43,170
Speaker 0: We're all gonna carve pumpkins gonna be awesome.

283
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:47,244
Speaker 0: And then we even got Emily to come out and like let's carve our pumpkins the three of us.

284
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,295
Speaker 1: and then we didn't even Bought the tools to carve them.

285
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 0: So we've still got the tools.

286
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,264
Speaker 0: I've got like a hundred tea candles, but The pumpkin sat there until the others tea lights.

287
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:58,390
Speaker 0: It's a candle.

288
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,981
Speaker 1: It is a candle but it's a specific type of candle.

289
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,130
Speaker 0: Yes a tea one a tea light candle.

290
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,467
Speaker 1: No, it's a tea light is a subset of candle.

291
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,442
Speaker 0: So thus it is also a tea candle.

292
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:18,770
Speaker 0: no Anyway So this year we went apple picking earlier than we expected.

293
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,325
Speaker 0: So as a result, it was too early to buy pumpkins the pumpkins ahead.

294
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:23,490
Speaker 0: We're not so great dad.

295
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,824
Speaker 1: Well, I think it was mostly their lack of pumpkin selection.

296
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:26,789
Speaker 0: It was too soon.

297
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,278
Speaker 1: It was too soon also, but the selection was also.

298
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,402
Speaker 0: so we said don't worry.

299
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,810
Speaker 0: We'll come back and buy pumpkins when it's time.

300
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,215
Speaker 0: And Halloween came and went.

301
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:38,366
Speaker 0: yep, and we've still got the hundred tea candles.

302
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,258
Speaker 1: It's reminds me of an idea Open pumpkin carving tool.

303
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,843
Speaker 1: this reminds me of an idea I had today.

304
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:44,185
Speaker 1: You ready?

305
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:49,220
Speaker 1: I had this idea, you know Thanksgivings coming up right actually had this idea listening to Dave and Joel.

306
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,330
Speaker 1: Thank you, Dave and Joel, you know a cornucopia, right?

307
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,378
Speaker 1: You know what a cornucopia is?

308
00:18:53,479 --> 00:19:02,130
Speaker 1: Yes, it's something that I People more often today use the word to say like oh a cornucopia of something as in a bounty, right?

309
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,418
Speaker 1: But the actual object a cornucopia.

310
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,240
Speaker 1: you've seen them.

311
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,910
Speaker 1: You probably might not know but it's it's a Thanksgiving kind of thing.

312
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,229
Speaker 1: It's like a it's like a horn basket thing with a whole bunch of crap coming out of it.

313
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:20,065
Speaker 0: I don't know, but I pictured something horrible.

314
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:26,109
Speaker 0: No, I Want people to make geek cornucopias and send them to us?

315
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,015
Speaker 1: Well, no, you can just take a picture and put it online but we're like geek cornucopias.

316
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:37,819
Speaker 1: right and try to make a theme like you can make like a an anime cornucopia or maybe a Halo cornucopia or full of grenades.

317
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,634
Speaker 1: Yeah a half-life cornucopia grenades Mario Cornucopia little bombs.

318
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,519
Speaker 1: Who knows, you know something like that.

319
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,910
Speaker 1: go for it and you know, it could even just be photoshops.

320
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,054
Speaker 1: It could be the real deal.

321
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:52,084
Speaker 1: I want to see people get creative here with the cornucopias.

322
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,830
Speaker 1: That is that is my request.

323
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:55,217
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, one more thing.

324
00:19:55,257 --> 00:20:00,057
Speaker 0: I'll just bring this up on the show because I'm proud I finally did it and I actually updated it.

325
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:01,522
Speaker 0: I have a blog.

326
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:02,485
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

327
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,107
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

328
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,755
Speaker 1: I've had a blog for Since 2003 or 4 well years.

329
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,295
Speaker 1: Technically I've had one since 1998 Here's in years ago.

330
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:16,030
Speaker 0: There was even Scott saw proto geek nights where he did an audio blog.

331
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:23,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I was bored one day at RIT and I said hey Why don't people like record themselves talking and then put it on their websites.

332
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,487
Speaker 1: There's no reason that can't be done.

333
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:24,849
Speaker 1: So I did.

334
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,970
Speaker 0: But yeah, I had a slash journal that I posted in twice and then never even looked at again.

335
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:34,645
Speaker 1: It's like I before.

336
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:38,018
Speaker 1: back in the day I just had to Geo cities which wasn't really a blog technically.

337
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,314
Speaker 0: then later my og my Geo cities was a semi illegal Bootleg ROM site.

338
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:58,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, then like I moved that I kept updating that and moving it over and it was just static HTML And then I kept moving it around and doing stuff with it and then I did a slash journal and then I set up some old pearl blogging software and then I set up WordPress and I'm still using that WordPress.

339
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:04,161
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's not Dvorak org slash blog It's rim dot front row crew.

340
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,989
Speaker 0: calm because I know how to use domains.

341
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:11,704
Speaker 1: Actually, I should put me at that front row crew calm to forward with the C name.

342
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:13,410
Speaker 0: Yes, you should there's no reason not to.

343
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:17,416
Speaker 1: I know I'll probably do that tonight if I remember Yeah, I'll probably eventually.

344
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:23,096
Speaker 0: the problem is that rim net is taken by something stupid and rim calm is way for Way for it to expire.

345
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,340
Speaker 0: it expires in forever.

346
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,263
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

347
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:25,805
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

348
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:26,848
Speaker 1: All right.

349
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,321
Speaker 1: So tonight We learned from Dave and Joel again.

350
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:32,208
Speaker 1: They recently reviewed gal guy guy.

351
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,589
Speaker 1: now I'm not gonna comment on because I've never seen it.

352
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:35,873
Speaker 0: I've seen some.

353
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,942
Speaker 0: gal guy guy is an awesome show as long as you never watch it.

354
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,830
Speaker 1: Okay, so I like the song anyway.

355
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:50,970
Speaker 1: So what happened was is they they basically they didn't say they didn't They didn't hate on the show exactly.

356
00:21:51,073 --> 00:22:00,550
Speaker 1: But again They weren't the biggest fans of the show and it seemed that the popular opinion was that the show was bad for a while And then got good really good and was an awesome show.

357
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:06,270
Speaker 1: So this the fact that their opinion was contrary to the popular opinion drew some attention.

358
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:09,140
Speaker 1: So he said hey, I got an idea.

359
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:16,262
Speaker 1: Let's start doing some shows where we give opinions Contrary to the popular opinion and maybe we can get some attention though.

360
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:23,666
Speaker 0: Don't worry because I think next Tuesday We're gonna do a show that is not contrary to the public opinion, but the two of us disagree.

361
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:25,816
Speaker 0: Oh Because it's been it's.

362
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,949
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna say what it is, I'll see if you all can guess.

363
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,077
Speaker 1: It shouldn't be hard if you've been in the forums.

364
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's only two things that we've been arguing about lately.

365
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,682
Speaker 1: So today we're gonna do something that's gonna piss a bunch of people off.

366
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:45,730
Speaker 1: We're gonna tell you that Naruto sucks So does bleach and so does one piece and so does dragon ball.

367
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:49,305
Speaker 0: There's a special place in my heart for the absolute disdain.

368
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,450
Speaker 0: I feel towards cried.

369
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:52,935
Speaker 1: I've only watched like two episodes of that.

370
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,299
Speaker 0: That's not a good show.

371
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,810
Speaker 1: brave master also sucks final fantasy unlimited.

372
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:00,039
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of any others.

373
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,875
Speaker 1: I Can't that fist.

374
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:06,230
Speaker 1: the North Star is good, but only an ironic way and otherwise sucks.

375
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:20,130
Speaker 0: Well, yeah guy guy I think the real important thing I think it was Joel's comment that You can't get me to sit through 26 episodes of a good show and you expect me to wait through 20 episodes of a bad show.

376
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,158
Speaker 0: That might get good.

377
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:21,924
Speaker 1: Yeah.

378
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:27,610
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically, it is the opinion of both of us that there there is a genre of anime and manga.

379
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:42,248
Speaker 1: That is the show not just shonen but shonen fighting a subset of shonen even right which is specifically a show where you have Incredibly long fights and it's the show is all about the fighting or some sort of combat.

380
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:47,490
Speaker 1: in some way You could even argue successfully that something like a car no go could be considered shown in fighting.

381
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:49,340
Speaker 1: Instead of fighting.

382
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,717
Speaker 1: they're playing go he car no go Initial D.

383
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:55,350
Speaker 0: Those are all shown in fighting shows as far as I'm concerned.

384
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty much.

385
00:23:56,575 --> 00:24:04,007
Speaker 1: you know, it's sometimes tough to draw the line between shonen fighting and sports You know because a lot of the sports show is shown in fighting where instead of fights.

386
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:04,550
Speaker 1: They have a sport.

387
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,309
Speaker 0: I was gonna say something.

388
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:12,090
Speaker 1: Not all sports shows though, cuz they're like touch not shown in fighting even though it is a sports show.

389
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:16,615
Speaker 0: I was gonna make some comment about how the difference is that Sports shows are worse.

390
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:17,659
Speaker 1: No some of them.

391
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 0: I have not seen many sports shows.

392
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,989
Speaker 1: I like I really want to watch attack Number one as do I?

393
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:32,010
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think we're gonna be able to see that though I think the fact that I saw an episode of buzzer beater is what just tainted.

394
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,720
Speaker 1: Buzzer beater is not shown in fighting.

395
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:41,634
Speaker 0: It's just bad sports anime Also the fact that the only touch I've ever seen is the movie and if you've ever seen the movie You'll know why I said that right?

396
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:45,363
Speaker 1: Okay, so we don't like shonen fighting shows.

397
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:51,828
Speaker 1: We think that they're largely inept mindless a waste of time and not good.

398
00:24:51,848 --> 00:25:00,530
Speaker 0: and At the same time there are shows that follow the same format that I. that in my opinion don't suck.

399
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that is true.

400
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:12,781
Speaker 0: Like I think I'm gonna initial D. if you discount anything other than the original the first 26 episodes I think the rest of it is utter utter drivel.

401
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,809
Speaker 1: No, you said it is.

402
00:25:16,171 --> 00:25:17,077
Speaker 0: It's awful.

403
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,622
Speaker 1: I like it.

404
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,750
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

405
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,620
Speaker 0: You can't make fun of anyone who likes Naruto.

406
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:28,887
Speaker 1: if you like initial D my past episode 27 I think what the rule is right is it's sort of like with with MMOs you're allowed one.

407
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:39,050
Speaker 1: It's like you can have everyone, you know If you've never seen a shonen fighting show or read a shonen fighting manga You can do one and then you learn your lesson from that one.

408
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,858
Speaker 1: But that one has a special place in your heart.

409
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,209
Speaker 0: And then yeah, I mean, I'm gonna do it again.

410
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:44,599
Speaker 1: Let's see thing with MMOs.

411
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:50,210
Speaker 1: Like I played a mud back in the day I played many muds back in the day, so I don't need to play World of Warcraft now.

412
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,345
Speaker 1: Yep, I've played World of Warcraft now, and it's your first MMO.

413
00:25:53,546 --> 00:25:54,932
Speaker 0: You're excused You know what.

414
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:58,908
Speaker 0: once you learn your better off World of Warcraft is the best freaking memo ever made.

415
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:02,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still Or up like my.

416
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:05,527
Speaker 0: I've watched all of Sailor Moon my first magical girl show.

417
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,310
Speaker 0: I've got one.

418
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,333
Speaker 0: I like Sailor Moon.

419
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:08,477
Speaker 0: You can all fuck off.

420
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should watch fancy.

421
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:11,546
Speaker 1: Lala instead fancy.

422
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:12,770
Speaker 0: Lala didn't exist.

423
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,054
Speaker 1: Oh, that sucks.

424
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,660
Speaker 1: I was in high school.

425
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,470
Speaker 0: I bought fan subs from V kill.

426
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,272
Speaker 1: I really want to know what.

427
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,096
Speaker 1: so if anyone knows is up with the dinosaurs.

428
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,279
Speaker 1: I'm still waiting to find out.

429
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,320
Speaker 0: I Can tell you what happens in the end of Sailor Moon.

430
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,889
Speaker 1: it does involve dinosaurs.

431
00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:32,950
Speaker 1: No, it's not as good as fancy Lala.

432
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:38,405
Speaker 1: So You're allowed one Shonen fighting show and only one.

433
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:42,420
Speaker 0: But also like Gatekeepers follows a very similar format.

434
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,162
Speaker 0: It's a monster.

435
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:45,570
Speaker 1: Gatekeepers is different, and it's a monster of the week.

436
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:49,186
Speaker 1: I think the difference is there's a clear difference between monster of the week.

437
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:53,418
Speaker 1: Which is something like Voltron or Gatekeepers and such.

438
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:03,172
Speaker 1: but and then Shonen fighting which is where You know the actual fighting in say a monster of the week is there's the monster you know and then it's mostly Attack.

439
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:06,124
Speaker 0: we saved the day with the power of friendship, right?

440
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,213
Speaker 1: It's it's sort of an action You know scene.

441
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:14,464
Speaker 1: it's like it's like a show where they have a big plot and then at the end of the episode There's one action scene where they beat the bad guy.

442
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:15,490
Speaker 1: That's a monster of the week.

443
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,519
Speaker 0: That big o one was.

444
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,830
Speaker 1: that big o one was totally monster of the week.

445
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,710
Speaker 0: It was just had other stuff going on and then big o two was Ava done properly, but that's beside the point.

446
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you look at you know something like Naruto.

447
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:30,450
Speaker 1: Naruto is not monster of the week.

448
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,726
Speaker 1: Naruto is monster of the decade of the 13 episodes.

449
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:35,610
Speaker 0: see here.

450
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:39,804
Speaker 0: Let's just tell this forget everything else and just focus on Naruto.

451
00:27:39,864 --> 00:27:47,550
Speaker 0: because I think the reasons Why I was so excited about Naruto and because remember I liked Naruto.

452
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,176
Speaker 0: I wanted to see it.

453
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:50,119
Speaker 0: I heard about it.

454
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,822
Speaker 0: There was buzz.

455
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:51,705
Speaker 0: I saw the first four episodes.

456
00:27:51,725 --> 00:27:53,090
Speaker 1: I heard about this thing called Naruto.

457
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,599
Speaker 1: It was getting pretty popular.

458
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,665
Speaker 1: everyone was talking about it.

459
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:56,369
Speaker 1: I hadn't seen it.

460
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:59,990
Speaker 1: I didn't go out of my way to see it, but you know I saw it at anime club.

461
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,114
Speaker 1: I saw four episodes.

462
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,218
Speaker 1: I was intrigued.

463
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,686
Speaker 1: I liked the four episodes, then I went home.

464
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:05,910
Speaker 1: I downloaded a bunch of fan subs.

465
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,290
Speaker 1: I watched 13 episodes of Naruto, and I read I think two volumes of the manga, and then I was done.

466
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:11,952
Speaker 1: but

467
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:22,366
Speaker 0: what we'll do here is just we'll take the story of our rise and fall of Naruto fandom as an example of why we dislike almost all shounen fighting shows

468
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:32,498
Speaker 1: and the same thing you know because Anything we say about Naruto pretty much applies to all the other big shounen fighting shows equally because it's the same story with all of Them at least as far as I'm concerned.

469
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,050
Speaker 0: so we'd heard all the buzz For a while before we saw Naruto because you know running the anime club back at RIT.

470
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,335
Speaker 0: We were gonna show it once.

471
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:44,333
Speaker 1: we got four episodes hanging out with a hundred anime fans every week.

472
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:51,783
Speaker 0: when Naruto is new and popular kind of hard to avoid Naruto and Everyone was of the opinion that it was the best show ever.

473
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:52,124
Speaker 0: there were.

474
00:28:52,545 --> 00:28:58,284
Speaker 0: people were talking about Naruto the way they talked about Fullmetal Alchemist after it started coming out.

475
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:00,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, they actually did Naruto come first.

476
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,643
Speaker 1: It was around the same time, but people were there's the same level of.

477
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,189
Speaker 0: it's the best show ever.

478
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,033
Speaker 0: yeah People are just.

479
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,781
Speaker 1: oh they were talking it up.

480
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,630
Speaker 1: They were having conversations about characters.

481
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:17,750
Speaker 0: There were people at RIT who had made those Naruto headbands for themselves before two episodes had been fan-subbed.

482
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,788
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, they didn't design those into the show for merchandising.

483
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,170
Speaker 1: no.

484
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,844
Speaker 0: So we finally get four episodes And we show it to the club and of course we stick around and watch it.

485
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,267
Speaker 0: cuz that's kind of why I waited so I Could stick around and watch it with a big crowd of people.

486
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,498
Speaker 1: And it was great!

487
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,305
Speaker 0: It was funny.

488
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:46,029
Speaker 0: ninja school Awesome characters a good plot setup that obviously could come into play in a really interesting dramatic way.

489
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,130
Speaker 0: later Like everything was set up the character designs were great.

490
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,930
Speaker 1: But you know the only thing I could say bad about it after those four episodes was that the plot was a little bit Transparent like yeah, I know what's gonna go down in the long run.

491
00:29:57,111 --> 00:30:02,590
Speaker 1: You know it's like yeah, obviously you know if they would have mixed They could have mixed it up which is the reason to keep watching.

492
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,262
Speaker 1: But that was the only bad thing after four episodes I could say about.

493
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,210
Speaker 1: it is obviously what's gonna go down.

494
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,010
Speaker 0: I don't think they needed to mix it up in the first four episodes.

495
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:14,326
Speaker 0: No, which is but that was definitely a long-term plot which didn't really matter.

496
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:20,085
Speaker 0: I don't think no I'm not sure and I really don't care, but yeah, I got it.

497
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:20,587
Speaker 0: I dug it.

498
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:21,670
Speaker 0: I thought Naruto was great.

499
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was I was laughing.

500
00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:25,347
Speaker 1: I was you know when he turned into like you know.

501
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:25,990
Speaker 1: What's it called?

502
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:32,370
Speaker 1: Sexy nojutsu, that's what it's called and of course the guy with the eyepatch best character ever maybe.

503
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:39,789
Speaker 0: But I think when I got my first inkling that something was wrong Was when before I had seen this scene.

504
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:50,167
Speaker 0: So there was a big fight going on and someone who had already seen that episode Basically had a conversation with me along the lines of oh man when you see how he

505
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:50,608
Speaker 1: pulls

506
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:59,845
Speaker 0: off Like getting past this guy and winning like what he does like you'll see something happen And then they'll go back and reveal how he did it.

507
00:31:00,307 --> 00:31:16,204
Speaker 0: Oh, man This is the best show ever and I was all psyched because I expected some sort of like crazy Choreography or some sort of like amazing spike Spiegel kind of thing or just something awesome and great and Instead it was nothing.

508
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:25,890
Speaker 0: it was like oh I used the shadow windmill whatever technique which allowed me to Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah whatever the plot needed blah

509
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:33,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's one thing right like let's say you're watching two people play chess right and you have a commentator explaining Oh look at what he did there.

510
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,010
Speaker 1: Are you watching say a football game and someone says it's a draw play oh my god.

511
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:57,325
Speaker 0: Or even if you're watching a show that is obviously fake not a real sporting event or a real contest but yet is self-consistent or generally realistic like you're watching a show about a go tournament and Like someone says oh he did the blah move but in the show really did do like it really did it and they show it.

512
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:07,787
Speaker 0: or there's a Fencing fight and they actually choreographed his fight, and maybe there's commentary or it does something cool But it happens in the context of the show in a realistic self-consistent manner.

513
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:28,475
Speaker 0: mm-hmm Naruto has the sin that many anime and many other things fall for where instead of actually Showing something cool or coming up with something clever They make up something within like the fake Constraints of whatever's going on and then act as though the thing that they just made up was somehow Amazing.

514
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:29,606
Speaker 1: yeah, they just it's.

515
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:37,950
Speaker 1: basically I Watched 13 episodes and at the end of that 13th episode you know they were fighting this guy with a big sword and this person with like some mirrors.

516
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:41,949
Speaker 1: and it was like all the you know Naruto and his friends versus these two people.

517
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:45,379
Speaker 1: and That fight ended in like the 13th or 14th episode or whatever.

518
00:32:45,439 --> 00:33:00,384
Speaker 1: and then I realized that fight started in like the 6th or 7th Episode or something like that and I was like wow and all I could remember from all that stretch of episodes Most of the scenes were Naruto's standing there pan across Naruto's face while you hear his inner monologue of.

519
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,467
Speaker 1: should I use this technique?

520
00:33:01,488 --> 00:33:02,210
Speaker 1: should I use this technique?

521
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,376
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe we'll use this technique.

522
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:04,362
Speaker 1: Oh wonder what their weaknesses?

523
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:10,428
Speaker 1: dah dah dah dah dah and Then pan across the picture of the bad guy with all the mirrors and the bad guys going.

524
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,588
Speaker 1: haha You cannot get through my mirrors, haha.

525
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,679
Speaker 0: Now consider the difference between these two kinds of writing.

526
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,484
Speaker 0: consider say I don't know.

527
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:20,590
Speaker 0: CS foresters ratio hornblower books.

528
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:27,330
Speaker 0: Now there's a scene where the captain is Like something's going on and he has to make a decision.

529
00:33:27,611 --> 00:33:32,350
Speaker 0: Do I run against the Turkish gun batteries and try to escape through the channel or do I?

530
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,295
Speaker 0: Beat back and Lee again.

531
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:45,057
Speaker 0: So, you know, whatever his options are but the options are realistic either within the context of the fantasy or within the context of the fiction that is based in the real world.

532
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:50,838
Speaker 0: like the author obviously did a little bit of research and came up with Invitable options and an interesting conflict.

533
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,730
Speaker 0: in a show like Naruto you make up a conflict.

534
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,977
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what the conflict actually is.

535
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,867
Speaker 0: It's pretty much literally do I foo or do I bar?

536
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:17,770
Speaker 0: because whenever they need a conflict they just make something up like oh, well your blah blah blah technique didn't work because I Have the blah blah blah blah Yeah, and like the actual stuff that's happening doesn't matter because in the end it's entirely made up.

537
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,737
Speaker 1: They can do whatever they want.

538
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:20,469
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times do you see in these shows?

539
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,371
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

540
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,943
Speaker 1: You have used every technique, you know, and I'm still not defeated.

541
00:34:24,004 --> 00:34:24,565
Speaker 1: Huh?

542
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:25,208
Speaker 1: What are you going to do?

543
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,920
Speaker 1: And then it's like I will use the super Superpower and they charge up times a hundred something never done before.

544
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,382
Speaker 1: then they win.

545
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:33,928
Speaker 1: his power level is over nine thousand.

546
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:36,590
Speaker 1: nine thousand the only thing You know.

547
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,385
Speaker 1: if the only thing that that is that you're not sure of is who is gonna win.

548
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,101
Speaker 1: everything else between Who is fighting and who is going to win?

549
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,601
Speaker 1: The fight is just meaningless and a waste of time.

550
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,940
Speaker 1: and it's not even like Interesting like how I bebop right.

551
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,897
Speaker 1: watch the first episode of cowboy bebop Even if you've seen it already.

552
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:55,501
Speaker 1: watch the end.

553
00:34:55,742 --> 00:34:56,949
Speaker 1: There's a fight scene, right?

554
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,375
Speaker 0: It's got a sombrero.

555
00:34:58,395 --> 00:34:59,781
Speaker 0: He kicks the table over that one.

556
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one it's a fight scene.

557
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,901
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with a fight scene.

558
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:03,789
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of action.

559
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:04,573
Speaker 1: Rim is a fan.

560
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,365
Speaker 1: it watch something like Iron Monkey also a real kung fu move.

561
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,177
Speaker 1: Oh, man, Iron Monkey You see many fight scenes.

562
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:12,850
Speaker 1: many in fact over half the movie is fight scenes.

563
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:25,810
Speaker 1: Movie is just a vehicle for fight scenes but the fight scenes in and of themselves are a sort of work of art of Choreography or animation and is actually something interesting and stimulating to be seen there.

564
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,447
Speaker 1: It's not just a guy standing there another guy standing there and someone.

565
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,514
Speaker 1: now I mean Street playing.

566
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,584
Speaker 1: Street Fighter is more dynamic than watching Naruto.

567
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:38,858
Speaker 0: these shows Naruto fighting games though It's almost like I'm not watching a show.

568
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,830
Speaker 0: I'm watching a series of well animated storyboards.

569
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:42,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

570
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,504
Speaker 1: it's like someone is narrating.

571
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:45,570
Speaker 1: there are not even there.

572
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:52,030
Speaker 1: It's like these characters are self narrating some really slow boring made-up sporting event with no rules.

573
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,632
Speaker 1: It's completely.

574
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:56,264
Speaker 0: you know what it reminds me of I don't know maybe underwear perverts.

575
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,070
Speaker 0: I'll punch you you a little guy.

576
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:01,930
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I have been punched and in the panel it says he is punching.

577
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:13,518
Speaker 0: No, I did back in the day nowadays a little different But yeah, or even just the idea of how many superhero comics would just whenever they needed a plot device They just made something up that kryptonite.

578
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:16,189
Speaker 0: It's just like oh, well that didn't work because of.

579
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:19,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like oh you punched me.

580
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,742
Speaker 1: I am dead uh-huh no I'm not actually dead because I was wearing the double armor.

581
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,666
Speaker 1: uh-huh now.

582
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:25,590
Speaker 1: I hit you with this weapon.

583
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:28,992
Speaker 1: Oh, I am trapped ah but I get out with my eye lasers It's just.

584
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:43,849
Speaker 1: it's basically like they just invent inventories of things And then they sort of use every item from each inventory And then make up new items in the inventories and just pull them out one at a time until they're done Just to drag things out.

585
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,800
Speaker 1: And it's really not Interesting or entertaining once you've seen it before like

586
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:57,801
Speaker 0: that scene that I talked about where I expected something awesome And then it was just oh I use the blah technique in the shadow of the ninja star or whatever he did I don't even remember now.

587
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:12,381
Speaker 0: It was just the fact that in a in a well-written show or a good show There would be some amount of foreshadowing or something you there'd be a Possibility drama that you could foresee ours going to happen.

588
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:13,805
Speaker 0: or at least take a guess.

589
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:17,421
Speaker 0: and when I saw it And then I found out I'm gonna find out how we did it.

590
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:20,840
Speaker 0: I thought huh well Maybe he did this or maybe he did this.

591
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:22,410
Speaker 0: I'm trying to figure out what he did.

592
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,090
Speaker 0: And then I find out that the writer basically said yeah, I don't fucking know what he did either.

593
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,954
Speaker 0: I just made up a word.

594
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:27,557
Speaker 1: yep.

595
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,869
Speaker 1: I do use the something technique that I just made up.

596
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:33,363
Speaker 0: Okay, and then this is what really bothered me.

597
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:56,430
Speaker 0: Naruto of the show would often I don't know if it does this in later episodes, but I can guess Will not only make up some sort of technique or something, but then they'll go into excruciating and completely unnecessary Detail about exactly how the technique worked and why it worked and how it worked on this guy cuz he was weak against this But it wouldn't worked against this guy because his father was the fifth.

598
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,155
Speaker 1: I Really, just don't care.

599
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:04,090
Speaker 1: That's it the thing that's really disappointing about these shown in fighting shows.

600
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,086
Speaker 1: I mean it wouldn't be so bad if it was just a bad show right across.

601
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:11,057
Speaker 0: like you cried It's great at nothing because there I just started dumb kept being dumb.

602
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:14,890
Speaker 1: there are plenty of shows that are just dumb across the board and we ignore them.

603
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,664
Speaker 1: We don't complain about them so much, but you look at something Naruto or one piece right.

604
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:25,510
Speaker 1: and what's so upsetting here Is that they had these amazing characters this amazing plot this amazing humor?

605
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,441
Speaker 1: Actually pretty decent production quality mostly cuz it's so popular.

606
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:35,119
Speaker 0: how up my alley is a show about Smiling pirates seriously good.

607
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,163
Speaker 0: God right.

608
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:37,969
Speaker 1: I mean red shanks awesome.

609
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:41,227
Speaker 1: the Kakashi, I think the guy patch guy is awesome.

610
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,860
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it's like bleach.

611
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,450
Speaker 1: even you have these shows.

612
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:52,583
Speaker 1: They could be the best shows And then they ruin them with all this pointless fighting crap in them.

613
00:38:52,663 --> 00:39:01,999
Speaker 1: if you took the fighting out of Naruto And you said hey any Avius made every fight in Naruto Naruto a Choreographed fight like the first one in cowboy bebop.

614
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:05,590
Speaker 1: We're actually animate people fighting and it's over really quickly.

615
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:07,808
Speaker 1: It'll be maybe the best show ever.

616
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:13,310
Speaker 1: It just might or it was funny ninja school just the whole way through 26 episodes of funny ninja school best show ever.

617
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,829
Speaker 1: But maybe it could be and that's why it's so upsetting is that it's actually one of the worst shows there is.

618
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:19,610
Speaker 1: But and it's stupidly popular.

619
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,038
Speaker 1: But it's 99% crap just pointless crap.

620
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,323
Speaker 1: Dragon Ball is the same way.

621
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,610
Speaker 1: at least the original Dragon Ball had more humor than DB.

622
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:36,306
Speaker 0: original Dragon Ball is actually pretty funny, and I've always looked at Dragon Ball Z as a kind of Self-reflective parody of those kinds of shows.

623
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,090
Speaker 1: that's what it is.

624
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:42,199
Speaker 1: But that's not the way most people view it and it's sort of set up You know with its ludicrous popularity.

625
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:51,050
Speaker 1: if you don't understand the level of popularity of Dragon Ball Look at Japanese weekly Shonen jump sales figures, and then look what happens to those sales figures when Dragon Ball ended.

626
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:59,230
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think that the fact that people took deep Dragon Ball Z more seriously than I think it was intended.

627
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:03,465
Speaker 1: But then again that is what sort of spawned that the current wave of.

628
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,810
Speaker 1: you know Shonen jump fight.

629
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,350
Speaker 0: That seems to be a common trend.

630
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:19,591
Speaker 0: I mean we talked about this I think last week or the week before where a lot of anime fans Especially when they're young they see shows that are intended to be humorous and for whatever reason just don't pick up on that like project Aiko.

631
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:28,083
Speaker 0: project Aiko is probably the biggest example because almost everyone I talked to when they were a kid Saw project Aiko and took it at face value, and they're like man.

632
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,587
Speaker 0: Why does she have superpowers?

633
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:30,570
Speaker 0: That's so cool.

634
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,039
Speaker 0: Oh, she saved the day.

635
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,034
Speaker 0: and now I look at it is like oh It's a joke Get it.

636
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:40,083
Speaker 0: I mean I was so into the drama of the.

637
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,490
Speaker 0: you know the movie battle gray battle blue and all that.

638
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:46,050
Speaker 0: I thought it was and then I saw it again, and it was just wow.

639
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:54,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I ever tell you when I first saw tank police I took it as seriously as someone that you're supposed to take something like Galaxy Express.

640
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:56,990
Speaker 1: and now well I still take Galaxy Express seriously.

641
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,243
Speaker 1: I don't take tank police nearly half as seriously as I used to.

642
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:07,641
Speaker 0: that is not to say that I do not enjoy Tank police or project About half serious and project Aiko is about 5% serious.

643
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:08,222
Speaker 0: Well.

644
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:11,190
Speaker 0: Don't read the tank police manga because the seriousness drops away.

645
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:13,056
Speaker 1: I'm getting it eventually.

646
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,682
Speaker 0: yeah, it's okay.

647
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:20,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is is that Naruto and all these other shonen fighting shows you really don't like them.

648
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,310
Speaker 1: really think there's a waste of time.

649
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,528
Speaker 1: But anyone is excused from watching or reading one of this.

650
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:28,239
Speaker 0: well You know people are allowed to like whatever they want.

651
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:35,609
Speaker 1: they are allowed to like whatever they want, but if they want my respect No, you see they would need to enjoy one or fewer of these things.

652
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:39,424
Speaker 0: I just I. I think the real issue is much simpler.

653
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,050
Speaker 0: I don't like Naruto.

654
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,069
Speaker 0: I think it's a bad show.

655
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:44,715
Speaker 1: I think Naruto is bad.

656
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:51,657
Speaker 0: the worst is when people on pieces bad people try to argue with me on that point because remember I Didn't say you shouldn't watch it.

657
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:57,641
Speaker 0: I said I think it's a bad show and people will argue no It's not it's a great show you.

658
00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:06,190
Speaker 0: and then there's always that pause And I always look hopeful and then they always say you just have to get past the filler episodes.

659
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,502
Speaker 1: That is the worst argument.

660
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:10,110
Speaker 0: You can make just if you're gonna make.

661
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,216
Speaker 1: You know what my argument to that is.

662
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:11,979
Speaker 1: okay, okay?

663
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,728
Speaker 1: All right, so it's a good show.

664
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:14,030
Speaker 0: I got it.

665
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,799
Speaker 0: I got it much simpler.

666
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,609
Speaker 0: We'll skip all that.

667
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:21,009
Speaker 0: I'll give you a dollar, but you have to get through me punching the crap out of you for five minutes first.

668
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,556
Speaker 1: That sounds like a loss.

669
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:27,170
Speaker 1: You know cuz I would pay a dollar to keep you from punching me for five minutes, huh?

670
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:34,918
Speaker 0: So I mean I think the line for me in terms of because people always argue But yeah shows can have bad parts gotta wait till they get good.

671
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,597
Speaker 0: I think gassaraki was the line that was the slowest show I actually finished.

672
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,264
Speaker 1: yeah, you look at this though right.

673
00:42:42,284 --> 00:42:45,455
Speaker 1: someone says oh the show's really great If you just wait through the bad part.

674
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:48,084
Speaker 1: well cowboy bebop doesn't have a bad part.

675
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:49,890
Speaker 1: try gun doesn't have a bad part.

676
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,367
Speaker 1: So maybe the show that is part bad and part good is better than the show.

677
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:55,030
Speaker 1: That's all bad.

678
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:55,909
Speaker 1: I will give you that.

679
00:42:56,492 --> 00:43:00,749
Speaker 1: But the show that is part bad and part good is not as good as the show that is all good.

680
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:06,330
Speaker 1: now There are plenty of shows that are all good, and I don't have time to watch all of them.

681
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:08,379
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna have any time to watch.

682
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:09,926
Speaker 1: your half bad have good show.

683
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,171
Speaker 1: your half bad Have good.

684
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:15,424
Speaker 1: show is might as it to me is as good as the all bad show.

685
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:18,913
Speaker 1: breathe breathe fuck it Fuck it.

686
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:20,962
Speaker 0: It's all fuck the fuck up.

687
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:22,369
Speaker 1: It's all fuck the fuck up.

688
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,776
Speaker 1: But I'm economies off fuck fuck.

689
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:31,470
Speaker 0: I'll say this bodega bodega baby Moses, okay, let's not get on those tangents.

690
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:41,569
Speaker 0: I'll say when they're actually Woman tangents something I got nothing Naruto sucks.

691
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:45,369
Speaker 0: You know now I actually forgot what I was gonna say.

692
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,275
Speaker 0: I had something needed.

693
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:49,519
Speaker 0: oh all right all right.

694
00:43:49,940 --> 00:44:00,710
Speaker 0: the next time you ever try to convince and me or Yourself that a show that has a bad like a long bad part is worth watching to get to the good part Just go watch.

695
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,097
Speaker 0: I don't know 12 kingdoms or Kazu.

696
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:06,628
Speaker 0: no yo Jimbo cuz I guarantee you haven't seen those shows hardly anyone especially Kazu.

697
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:09,197
Speaker 0: no yo Jimbo That show is awesome.

698
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:09,959
Speaker 1: Have you watched it?

699
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,505
Speaker 1: more than a few episodes that we've seen?

700
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:14,215
Speaker 0: I saw the first six episodes And they were all awesome.

701
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:17,530
Speaker 0: I also saw the first except even if the show gets crappy after that.

702
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:17,952
Speaker 0: You know what.

703
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:24,659
Speaker 0: if a show starts good and turns crappy I get to watch the good part And then I stop watching and I don't lose anything.

704
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

705
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,968
Speaker 1: It's actually not bad.

706
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:27,570
Speaker 1: It's like Naruto.

707
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:29,298
Speaker 1: Just watch four episodes.

708
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,770
Speaker 1: You'll get all this goodness, and you won't lose anything.

709
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,352
Speaker 1: It's actually.

710
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,577
Speaker 1: then it's an amazing show.

711
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:46,090
Speaker 0: if a show feels like I have to fight my it's kind of like Pokemon And why I gave up on it and stop playing it The moment anything that's supposed to be entertaining feels like work or like I just got to get through this part people.

712
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, people say oh World of Warcraft is a good game once you get the level 70.

713
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:50,994
Speaker 1: What I need to?

714
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:55,208
Speaker 1: why would I work to get the fun part when I can just buy the fun part?

715
00:44:55,228 --> 00:44:55,910
Speaker 0: there was a tiny.

716
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:58,158
Speaker 0: There was a time I would back in the day.

717
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,012
Speaker 0: what I would play through like Final Fantasy 4j I think that is.

718
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:13,310
Speaker 1: that's a topic for a separate show is the ongoing problem of the fact that when we were in college And I think most people who are in college or high school and younger than that have the same issue Is that they have plenty of free time and not a lot of money?

719
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:21,170
Speaker 1: So they've got all this time to enjoy works of entertainment, but not enough works of entertainment to enjoy whereas us We don't have a lot of free time.

720
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,328
Speaker 1: We need to go to work all day and commute and do all this other geek night stuff.

721
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:27,083
Speaker 1: Yeah We have plenty of money.

722
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:36,074
Speaker 1: so we have all these Entertainment things to enjoy but not enough time to enjoy them all and it when you have you know when you're you're when you're the sort of a high school kid.

723
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:45,650
Speaker 1: I can very easily excuse something like Naruto because it fills up a Lot of time need the pleasure of Scott to be just excused from watching they do because it fills up.

724
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:51,849
Speaker 1: They have a lot of time on their hands and not a lot to be entertained by and whereas us We don't have time for Naruto.

725
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,042
Speaker 1: Seriously, it's what I get to spend.

726
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:57,437
Speaker 1: if I spend the time watching Naruto I'm not gonna be able to do anything else at all.

732
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:16,290
Speaker 0: I don't think many of the people who listen to geek nights are particularly fans of Naruto.

733
00:46:16,521 --> 00:46:22,943
Speaker 1: No But that's fine because even if they aren't I'm hoping that fans of Naruto will pay attention to the show and link to it And be all like these guys are.
