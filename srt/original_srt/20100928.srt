00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,039
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday September 28th.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,970
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,630
Speaker 1: Andy Schatz the creator of Monaco.

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,998
Speaker 2: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:27,225
Speaker 1: So I'll keep this brief.

6
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:34,559
Speaker 1: Scott is off playing Civ 5 and I'm gonna go play Civ 5 in a second because Civ 5 is Pretty much taking up all of our time right now.

7
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:40,360
Speaker 1: But we did right before we did this show get Andy Schatz the creator of Monaco a fantastic game.

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,020
Speaker 1: We tried out of packs to come onto the show come into the studio and talk to us a bit.

9
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:56,499
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna skip on talking about news or things of the day or any of that and we'll just get right into the interview Because I think it's pretty fantastic and I look forward to playing the game for real when it's actually out which should be fairly soon.

10
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,060
Speaker 1: So like we said, we've got a guest in the studio tonight Andy Schatz.

11
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:05,900
Speaker 1: Uh, so we were at PAX and we played this game called Monaco in the expo.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,867
Speaker 2: Well, I had seen the game before on the internets and then I saw it at PAX and I was like, oh man's it's it's There I can actually play this thing.

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,200
Speaker 1: I got to do that and we were blown away by it.

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,399
Speaker 1: So we called up Andy and we're like, alright, we got to talk to you about this game.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,607
Speaker 1: So Andy Schatz, hello everyone.

16
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:22,331
Speaker 2: Hey, thanks for coming on the show.

17
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:23,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely.

18
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:24,296
Speaker 0: Thanks for having me.

19
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:25,700
Speaker 0: Thanks for enjoying the game.

20
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,790
Speaker 1: Well, you gave me that little bag of diamonds.

21
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:34,544
Speaker 1: I had to come get you on the show after that $10,000 in real life.

22
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,896
Speaker 1: Scott swears that they're not Kubrick zirconia, but I checked and they definitely are.

23
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,020
Speaker 1: they have the right refractive index.

24
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,113
Speaker 2: How did you make the refractive index?

25
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,379
Speaker 2: he doesn't just full of crap.

26
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:52,865
Speaker 0: you know, you actually can blow hot air onto cubic zirconia and and the the What's it called.

27
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,738
Speaker 0: I see I'm not enough of a geek for your show.

28
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:56,383
Speaker 0: It actually doesn't.

29
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,550
Speaker 0: it holds the moisture on on cubic zirconia.

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,456
Speaker 0: Whereas it won't it'll clear up on diamonds.

31
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,524
Speaker 1: I Did not know that.

32
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one layman's way of telling the difference.

33
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,553
Speaker 2: Well, he you know, he did a lot of research and making his heist game.

34
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:08,799
Speaker 2: He had to know all about these things.

35
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:10,806
Speaker 1: So tell us about Monaco.

36
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,338
Speaker 1: Like what is this game as you would describe it?

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:22,904
Speaker 0: so Monaco is a Four-player or one to four player co-op stealth game in the in the style of like oceans 11.

38
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:29,266
Speaker 0: So you're all on a heist Trying to get in and steal something and get out or steal a whole bunch of stuff and get out And each player.

39
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:30,331
Speaker 0: it's a class based game.

40
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,276
Speaker 0: So it's like Team Fortress.

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:36,300
Speaker 0: So each player Has unique abilities that they can help use to help the team get through the mission.

42
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:46,839
Speaker 0: So you might have the hacker who can hack computers and plant viruses in them or you have a locksmith who can get through locked Doors much faster than everyone else or the cleaner who's got chloroform to knock out guards with.

43
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:59,319
Speaker 0: and there's a. there's eight different classes of character in the game and The game's sort of a. it's a. it's a tile based game So you can edit all the levels yourself and make new levels and share them with your friends.

44
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:02,759
Speaker 0: And yeah, I mean that's the basics of it.

45
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:06,575
Speaker 0: I think the most unique thing about it is probably the the line-of-sight system.

46
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:11,638
Speaker 0: It's a top-down game So it plays a little bit like a I'd say like pac-man crossed with hitman.

47
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:22,700
Speaker 1: Well, it reminded me of the old Ultima games where it would like show and not show things depending on what you could see But actually dynamic in real time as opposed to incredibly cripplingly slow and frustrating.

48
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:25,327
Speaker 0: Right exactly and it's all sort of vector based.

49
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:37,620
Speaker 0: So as you come around the corner the areas that you can see are rendered in Their their actual lighting And the areas that you can't see are rendered as if they're a blueprint.

50
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:47,040
Speaker 0: So as you walk around corners You see areas change from this sort of the dark dim monochrome blue blueprint into the bright full color of the visible areas.

51
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:52,526
Speaker 1: well, that was actually really cool with the stock because we were playing the game and Watching it not actually playing it.

52
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,156
Speaker 1: It looked like I thought I was gonna embarrass myself.

53
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,180
Speaker 1: Like that's really confusing.

54
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,452
Speaker 1: There's stuff moving all over the place.

55
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,240
Speaker 1: It's just crazy.

56
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:02,940
Speaker 1: But then when we sat down it like just it made perfect sense and I knew exactly what I was doing.

57
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:07,840
Speaker 2: It's weird because you're playing it and the gameplay is actually really fast for a stealth game.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,126
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of stealth games are so quiet and you're creeping along like at two miles an hour So no one sees you.

59
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,320
Speaker 2: but like I was like running really fast.

60
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,220
Speaker 2: Even when I was going from bush to bush to bush, which is actually is also really that was one of my favorite parts.

61
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,923
Speaker 1: I was in the bush.

62
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,379
Speaker 1: then we realized we could go from bush to bush to bush.

63
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:28,807
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how else you gonna make it over to the window with that Individually along the way like now.

64
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:29,330
Speaker 1: I'm here now.

65
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,812
Speaker 1: I'm here now.

66
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:30,194
Speaker 1: I'm here.

67
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:31,299
Speaker 2: It's very cute.

68
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's funny.

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:43,911
Speaker 0: Actually if you play the game single-player the game plays a lot more stealthy stealthily, I should say and because you're you know, you're really you can it.

70
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:49,519
Speaker 0: when you play four players all of the Visible areas are visible to everyone.

71
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:59,474
Speaker 0: so the game is less about like making sure that you're hiding behind something so that the guard can't see you and more about Working together and using your abilities to accomplish your mission.

72
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:09,960
Speaker 0: Whereas when you're playing by yourself You don't have teammates around that can revive you if you get shot And you don't have all of their extra abilities to be able to use in order to get out of sticky situations.

73
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,660
Speaker 0: So the game plays much more like sort of I would say a traditional stealth game when you're playing single-player Than when you're playing when you're playing with up to four people.

74
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,551
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think also we played.

75
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,920
Speaker 2: we didn't have anyone using the cleaners So we really couldn't do anything about the guards except run.

76
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,480
Speaker 2: So there was a lot of guards see you but there's not much you can do about it.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,608
Speaker 2: Just go go go as opposed to.

78
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:38,446
Speaker 2: if we had someone who was the cleaner then we probably could have you know All stayed waited for him to knock out the guard and then you know gone with much less hurrying Exactly.

79
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:40,380
Speaker 1: We should have just not woken up the guard in the first place.

80
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:49,845
Speaker 2: I mean the only way we could have the only thing with our class is the only thing we could have done to the guard Was I could have hit him with the dynamite, but I really like blowing a hole in the wall instead Which is way more fun.

81
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:50,145
Speaker 2: Yes.

82
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:51,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've.

83
00:05:51,349 --> 00:06:01,380
Speaker 0: actually I was just refining that the redhead which wasn't a playable character at PAX but I Almost put her in and I took her out last minute cuz I didn't think her as her abilities were really balanced enough.

84
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:04,618
Speaker 0: But her special ability is that she can charm a guard.

85
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:17,165
Speaker 0: She's like she's like the sexy seductress and she can charm a guard and he'll follow her around for for 30 seconds opening doors for Basically Also, we're just the doors.

86
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:18,890
Speaker 0: yeah, he'll open anything.

87
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:26,180
Speaker 0: he'll open anything if she points towards it he'll open it for her Yeah, and obviously she won't shoot at her during that time either.

88
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,534
Speaker 2: So then as soon as the 30 seconds is up, but she's got to start running.

89
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:32,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's the 30 seconds are up?

90
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,661
Speaker 0: She's got.

91
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:48,250
Speaker 0: she's got like a two-second window in which she his heart is broken and she can get out of there But if she doesn't get out before he before his heart Completely breaks before he's crippled on the ground crying Over her then then she's fucked.

92
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:52,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the game really like the gameplay is really strong But at the same time it's definitely rockin.

93
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:57,031
Speaker 1: the style I mean it is super retro and simple looking.

94
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:59,319
Speaker 1: and was that very much the aesthetic you were going for?

95
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean so.

96
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:04,921
Speaker 0: so the game won the the IGF independent games festival in 2010.

97
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:07,955
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you about that a few questions from now, but I guess you got to it now.

98
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:08,658
Speaker 1: So sorry.

99
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:15,658
Speaker 0: Well So so well, it's sort of the part of integral to the story of how the looks evolved.

100
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:26,820
Speaker 0: I I entered the game in the IGF after I'd only been working on it for about six weeks And at the time it was totally tile based.

101
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:32,787
Speaker 0: So everything in the game was completely tile based rather than having you know The sort of pretty vector lighting.

102
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:35,298
Speaker 0: as you walk around a corner things gradually appear.

103
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:47,258
Speaker 0: Things would light up and darken down Kind of like a roguelike except all in real time And and entirely based upon the light or I was based upon the tiles.

104
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,567
Speaker 1: Wow So you really pushed out the kind of.

105
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,635
Speaker 1: this is my proof of concept like.

106
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:52,960
Speaker 1: this is what I'm trying to do.

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,824
Speaker 1: It's not there yet.

108
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:59,207
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know when I cuz when I saw the videos originally online before packs, you know It looked totally different than what we played.

109
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,771
Speaker 2: You know, I mean like I could tell it was the same game But the the graphics it was told.

110
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,159
Speaker 2: obviously a lot had changed.

111
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:06,857
Speaker 0: Yeah it and it.

112
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:23,804
Speaker 0: You know when I decided I wanted to to make this into a more ambitious game rather than just it originally I actually made the game because I was working on another game at the time a game called venture dinosaur ea Which was a sim game about about Dinosaurs.

113
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,371
Speaker 2: I was like, you know and sounds good.

114
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,100
Speaker 0: No, no and it never came out.

115
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:48,079
Speaker 0: it's actually the third game in the in a series that I've been working on for years and I'd worked on it for like a year and spent a lot of money trying to get the damn game done and it just wasn't fun and eventually I started taking breaks from working on that game and on the very last time I had to let go my staff and and so I basically cut back to nothing.

116
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:52,520
Speaker 0: and The last break that I was on I was gonna quit and go get a job.

117
00:08:52,802 --> 00:09:03,139
Speaker 0: You know, I've been I've been indie for about six years And I pulled out this old design that I actually designed like eight years ago for Monaco And started making it and after like a week it was already really fun.

118
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,429
Speaker 0: so I decided well, I better keep going with this.

119
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:23,219
Speaker 0: so I kept making it and after six weeks, I'd entered it in the IGF and You know, I'm thinking maybe I had a long shot chance of sneaking in with a nomination or something like that And it ended up winning the excellence in design award and the grand prize.

120
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:36,340
Speaker 0: So at that point there was that that was a 12 to 15 week build that it won with and At that point I figured well I can get I can be a little more ambitious now and actually make it into the game.

121
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,880
Speaker 0: It was meant to be rather than just this sort of little throwaway thing that I was using as a break for my other project.

122
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,468
Speaker 0: and So here I am almost a year later.

123
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,680
Speaker 2: So you wait, it's really surprising.

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,972
Speaker 2: You said that Monaco is like an eight-year-old design.

125
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,078
Speaker 2: Is that is that right?

126
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,803
Speaker 2: Yeah Well, yeah but I played it.

127
00:09:51,843 --> 00:10:00,140
Speaker 2: the first thing I thought was this is totally inspired by like four swords or you know All those those GameCube and GBA games at the four player co-op going on.

128
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:12,226
Speaker 1: I was also reminded of the recent aesthetic of games like passage that had this very particular like kind of large pixel Old-school look or like pac-man versus right, but if it was designed eight years ago You were way ahead of the game.

129
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,440
Speaker 2: then you should have come out with it for the for the GameCube.

130
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:26,308
Speaker 0: Yeah the original idea actually Was something that I was working at like a triple-a gaming company and luckily I got it in my contract that I owned the design And we actually built a basic prototype of it.

131
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:38,382
Speaker 0: and the original design actually didn't only had a few preset missions But everyone built their own mansions and all of the missions were basically about breaking into other people's mansions and stealing They're.

132
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:39,427
Speaker 2: oh my god.

133
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,576
Speaker 1: That's got to be some DLC for monica.

134
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:49,341
Speaker 0: You got to put that in and so we actually pitched it to Microsoft and Jay Allard In.

135
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:55,979
Speaker 0: during in some interview someone asked him what the next generation of Xbox Live games would look like and he described our pitch in detail.

136
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,649
Speaker 1: That's got a good feeling.

137
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,978
Speaker 0: but then they turned us down.

138
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,433
Speaker 2: Yeah, so well they didn't rip you off obviously, so I guess it's.

139
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:06,397
Speaker 2: you know, it's not all that.

140
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,586
Speaker 0: yeah I know they did.

141
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:12,660
Speaker 0: they didn't make the game and you know That sort of thing probably happens all the time and who knows if he actually was talking about my concept?

142
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:23,240
Speaker 0: But at the time it certainly felt like he was and So at any rate Yeah, I pulled that old design out the games that I've been making as an indie.

143
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:31,000
Speaker 0: I'd built up a fan base of people that really liked games about like sim games about nature stuff And so my fan base just this wasn't gonna be something they were interested in.

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,680
Speaker 0: So it was something I'd really held off on on approaching as an indie.

145
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:41,397
Speaker 0: but when I was kind of at wits end, I I said fuck it and Decided to make a game about stealing shit.

146
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:46,414
Speaker 1: So you definitely said ocean like Ocean's 11 style the kind of like heist.

147
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:49,465
Speaker 1: I love the you know, what's yours is mine Like what?

148
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:50,409
Speaker 1: were there any games?

149
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,698
Speaker 1: or like Lupin the third or anything else out there that kind of?

150
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,899
Speaker 2: Influence your get your design and your style like spy for a spy for the NES or anything like that.

151
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:02,067
Speaker 0: I've actually had a lot of people Suggest a number of different ones.

152
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,980
Speaker 0: mainly it really was hitman crossed with pac-man.

153
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:14,085
Speaker 0: I've always felt that I love hitman and I like trying to go in and get get Silent assassin on it on the various different the hitman's But it's it.

154
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,557
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a totally flawed game design.

155
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:34,260
Speaker 0: but the the the thing that I thought about hitman was that the top-down view the mini-map view that you can't you can't move around or see the world when you're looking at the Mini-map, but it was so much more informative than looking at the actual game world That I always thought that the game it's that that game would be better played just from the mini-map.

156
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:37,406
Speaker 0: And And so I figured you so.

157
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,199
Speaker 0: so that's where the original inspiration for the game came from.

158
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:47,305
Speaker 0: And then you know and then there's all this these other social elements that I was I was thinking about doing and when I went To prototype it as an indie.

159
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:52,200
Speaker 0: I just prototyped, you know, the basic version of it without all of this sort of sharing related stuff.

160
00:12:53,341 --> 00:13:05,178
Speaker 0: But the game will actually have an editor and you can share levels And at least for the PC version I'm pretty sure I'll probably I'll probably host a Central level repository where people can upload their levels and rate them.

161
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,467
Speaker 0: So You know, you can go check out the best levels.

162
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,015
Speaker 1: There will be cock towers galore.

163
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

164
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:20,540
Speaker 1: So going way back, I mean not about influence in this game in particular, but obviously you're very passionate about gaming.

165
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,899
Speaker 1: So what were the games that kind of started that passion that really got you into this?

166
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,129
Speaker 0: I'm a nerdy old-school PC gamer.

167
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,193
Speaker 0: I actually never owned.

168
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:33,780
Speaker 0: I didn't own a console until the first Xbox Zork or more like star control.

169
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,579
Speaker 0: Well, both of those games are fantastic.

170
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:50,830
Speaker 0: I would I'd say my favorite my favorite my two favorite games of all time or at least I should say that probably the two that influenced me the most were Sim City and Ultima for Ultima for that was a quest of the Avatar right, right?

171
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,113
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was in.

172
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,400
Speaker 0: I was a pretty young kid at the time.

173
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:04,302
Speaker 0: I played it with my dad and I remember I I go to school and at the end of the day I'd actually like rate myself and how well I did in each of the eight virtues Myself.

174
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:07,839
Speaker 2: the next day we should make an app an iPhone app that does that.

175
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:13,099
Speaker 1: Just don't let the smell of mundane.

176
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:23,095
Speaker 0: So, yeah for them for me that was a really influential game just because it was something that affected my life outside of the actual playing of the game.

177
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:27,602
Speaker 0: And then Sim City to me is still The most.

178
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:32,395
Speaker 0: I'm totally amazed at at how he actually created that design.

179
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:44,096
Speaker 0: having made some sim games myself the challenge involved in making a game that simultaneously plays itself and is fun for the player to play is incredibly difficult.

180
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:52,997
Speaker 0: And I you know, I don't know exactly I don't know how he managed to come up with with the perfect balance in that game But I still think that's the best sim game of all time.

181
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:58,664
Speaker 0: Or simulation game of all time, I should say One not 2000.

182
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,249
Speaker 2: you like the original better.

183
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

184
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,397
Speaker 0: It's the simplicity of it.

185
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:10,600
Speaker 0: I think is There's something to be said for the simplicity of it And I think that if I were going back and making a game like that today I'd want to make it about that simple as well.

186
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:15,098
Speaker 0: It's because it's something you can just you can get right away.

187
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,142
Speaker 0: There's this.

188
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:18,768
Speaker 0: I mean the depth of some.

189
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,960
Speaker 0: city 2000 is fantastic and it feels more like a city.

190
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:30,460
Speaker 0: It's sort of less of a puzzle game But just the original inspiration for for the first Sim City is something that I just find totally brilliant.

191
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:53,340
Speaker 1: so it sounds like it forgive me if I'm putting words in your mouth that you definitely seem to have this idea and I think I agree with it that Hardware and speed are not the limitations of games anymore and that we can kind of go back to Simple things and just perfect them and make very simple games that are amazing without Necessarily needing a lot of processing power or depth that like Sim City 2000 or civilization 5 would need.

192
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely.

193
00:15:55,065 --> 00:16:00,259
Speaker 0: I definitely believe that the the art of designing a game is the limitation these days.

194
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,768
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with the hardware I mean, there's.

195
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:17,599
Speaker 0: there's plenty of other limitations like, you know If you're trying to make a big blockbuster game with that competes with other Big blockbuster games sure you have to compete graphically and you have to have a huge team But at the same time to make really sort of the truly great games.

196
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:19,624
Speaker 0: That that's not.

197
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:21,028
Speaker 0: that's not the main limitation.

198
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:42,699
Speaker 0: It's I like to describe it as I Look at game design and I like to think of game design as that as like a two-dimensional plane with a like height map with peaks and valleys, right and Any time someone decides to design something totally new it's like they're just like randomly dropping a ball somewhere on that 2d plane.

199
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:49,948
Speaker 0: and When someone then sees that, you know sees that game design and says hey, that's really cool I want to improve upon that.

200
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,560
Speaker 0: and they take it and they tweak it in some way.

201
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,380
Speaker 0: It's like the balls rolling downhill, right?

202
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,994
Speaker 0: and you're always trying to move that ball downhill from whatever that original inspiration was.

203
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:08,732
Speaker 0: and at some point maybe you want to sort of Reinvent an old classic and you go somewhere near that that where that original ball was dropped and you drop it somewhere nearby and you hope That that's actually downhill from where the original one was.

204
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:10,599
Speaker 0: and it's entirely possible.

205
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:19,450
Speaker 0: You're gonna discover a new local minima right that that you're gonna find a valley that was inaccessible from the original spot That's much deeper than the original one.

206
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:31,976
Speaker 0: So you might you know, you look at like You know doom or Wolfenstein and then doom 2 was just you know Sort of a ball rolling downhill from Wolfenstein and eventually you end up way down with like, you know Call of Duty and stuff like that.

207
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:44,260
Speaker 0: But then you take something like Bioshock and Bioshock took a big risk and they're like, okay I'm gonna take this and just sort of randomly drop the ball sort of near the FPS Valley But not quite in the FPS Valley and see if it's fun, right?

208
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,171
Speaker 0: and they you know and here they are, you know where the game.

209
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:51,368
Speaker 0: that feels a little different from an FPS and They're sort of exploring a new valley.

210
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:53,417
Speaker 2: I don't know if Bioshock was the one.

211
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,959
Speaker 2: I mean Bioshock It's pretty much the same as System Shock - right?

212
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,523
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much.

213
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's the point stands that yeah that that the game is.

214
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:08,334
Speaker 0: you know, it's a it's a tweak It's not just an improvement on the on the genre.

215
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:18,020
Speaker 0: It's actually it's Somewhat of a reinvention of the game design and that's a big risk, you know You might end up somewhere where it's just not as fun or where there's where there's not even as much potential.

216
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:24,645
Speaker 0: And clearly the FPS Valley is a deep one because people love playing FPS Right.

217
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:25,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows?

218
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,962
Speaker 2: Platformer Valley.

219
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,533
Speaker 0: Well, but there's there's lots of valleys out there.

220
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:31,260
Speaker 0: There's lots of lots more to discover.

221
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:38,920
Speaker 2: So some I'm a programmer by by trade and I noticed that at least at PAX that Monaco you did it with XNA, right?

222
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:44,232
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, so Which version of XNA did you use because I like.

223
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:46,100
Speaker 2: there's sort of like a flux going on.

224
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,100
Speaker 2: It's like there's a really new version like 4. that like yeah, it's sort of or is actually working on the Xbox yet.

225
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:53,587
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like it's weird.

226
00:18:53,607 --> 00:19:02,440
Speaker 0: It's like a beta but it's not you know, yeah I think it's only for Windows mobile devices, but they're launching the Xbox version of it in like two weeks or something like that.

227
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,989
Speaker 2: And I did it with 3.2 or whatever.

228
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:06,531
Speaker 2: The number is.

229
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:14,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I I think I started with Whatever the two-point something was and then I went up to three somewhere along the line.

230
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:18,512
Speaker 2: So have you programmed games and you know other platforms before?

231
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,140
Speaker 2: like, you know, if you have had his XNA compared to those.

232
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:22,947
Speaker 0: Well, I'm a c++ programmer.

233
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:26,625
Speaker 0: I My backgrounds in programming.

234
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,749
Speaker 0: I went to school.

235
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:35,869
Speaker 0: I was an art and computer science double major actually But my my Game development backgrounds in c++.

236
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:42,760
Speaker 0: I've done a fair amount of like flash work You know and some just rudimentary online stuff PHP and and the like.

237
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,517
Speaker 0: But I love C sharp.

238
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,780
Speaker 0: It's a blast working in C sharp.

239
00:19:49,041 --> 00:20:07,318
Speaker 0: It really is much faster and and I I don't I've never spent more than a couple of hours on a bug, you know an hour Maybe maybe two hours on a bug Whereas you know you're working a c++ and it's like you can spend a week on Stupid, you know memory leak or something like that.

240
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:29,657
Speaker 0: So so yeah, I absolutely love it That they make it real easy or at least with with X and a X and a makes it real easy to drop assets in make them usable with what you know with all the XML integration and and You know if you use the click once deployment, which I've been using it It's super easy to package up your stuff and and deploy it.

241
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:34,413
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's basically taken the stuff that I mean, I'm not a very.

242
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:36,580
Speaker 0: I'm honestly not a really very good techie.

243
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,740
Speaker 0: I'm a quite good programmer, but I'm not a good techie.

244
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,112
Speaker 0: So when I get down to like either systems level stuff or stuff about like, you know Setting up build environments and stuff like that.

245
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,120
Speaker 0: I'm really pretty crappy.

246
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,140
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of programmers are that way and I even have trouble with that.

247
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:57,700
Speaker 1: I mean I started using dotnet at work and C sharp Which I can't disparage you for using C sharp because I freaking love it now that I've had to actually use it for a few minutes.

248
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:03,280
Speaker 1: But even I have trouble like actually deploying my applications to like the different IIS servers and all that.

249
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:07,020
Speaker 2: You know, not everyone's like a vim terminal guy like me, you know some people.

250
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:10,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm pretty crappy at that stuff.

251
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:20,720
Speaker 0: So so I'd say I mean honestly I think that I spend if you if you add up all the time I spend like fixing C++ related bugs or dealing with deployment or dealing with system level stuff.

252
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:30,441
Speaker 0: In the previous games I've worked on I swear it's like at least 50% of my time And now that's now it's like 3%.

253
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:34,399
Speaker 2: So so when did like did you start programming in college or were you programming earlier than that?

254
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,682
Speaker 0: I've been.

255
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,233
Speaker 0: I actually made my first game.

256
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,482
Speaker 0: I think when I was seven It's a.

257
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:38,964
Speaker 2: what kind of?

258
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:40,150
Speaker 2: what kind of computer did you have then?

259
00:21:40,873 --> 00:21:43,310
Speaker 0: That was a Commodore 64 All right.

260
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,219
Speaker 1: So what kind of game was it?

261
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,780
Speaker 1: Are we gonna see this on like the Masters collection years from now?

262
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:56,860
Speaker 0: But my mom I think it was a one of these like ones where you had to actually where My mom got me a book where you just type in the code that was already in the book and you could play like a slalom Aski slalom skiing game.

263
00:21:57,161 --> 00:22:03,066
Speaker 1: I choose your own adventure game books that were like that and then you had to type in a game and then the game would Give you like a result.

264
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,113
Speaker 1: you have to go to the page number.

265
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:04,676
Speaker 1: Yeah.

266
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:06,303
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, I remember those ones too.

267
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:16,047
Speaker 0: And and I think I did my first original design when I was in about like Fifth grade or so something like that.

268
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,940
Speaker 0: I think I had my first made my first good game in seventh grade.

269
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:26,338
Speaker 0: It was a. it was a warlords clone And It was a hot seat warlords clone and my family used to play it all the time.

270
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,293
Speaker 2: So it's like warlords like the the pong with the four corners warlords.

271
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:37,188
Speaker 0: No, it was a turn-based large mapped army management game.

272
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:45,720
Speaker 0: so imagine like She's like, I don't know What's a panzer pan.

273
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,643
Speaker 0: Again yeah.

274
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:47,924
Speaker 0: Yeah.

275
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:49,108
Speaker 0: I'm sorry panzer blitz.

276
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:50,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

277
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,878
Speaker 0: No, what's the famous panzer game?

278
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:54,720
Speaker 0: That was the turn-based.

279
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:01,180
Speaker 0: That's the rail shoes sounds of blitzes the board game.

280
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,872
Speaker 0: I don't know at any rate that I can't remember what it is.

281
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:04,979
Speaker 0: It was like game of the year in like.

282
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,088
Speaker 0: It was it this?

283
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:28,620
Speaker 0: so my game was a turn-based Game with a randomly generated world with cities that you had to conquer and and you know neutral basically a bunch of neutral stuff on the map and you go out and you you conquer a bunch of cities and You use those to to earn gold which you used to hire armies and you go out and conquer the other people cities.

284
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,607
Speaker 1: So you got your family to play this with you?

285
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,137
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, my family's a bunch of geeks.

286
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:41,229
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, like my dad and I were actually making in my in when I was in high school We started making a real-time strategy game.

287
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,420
Speaker 0: That was like a side view underground style.

288
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:52,100
Speaker 0: So it's actually kind of like pixel-junk shooter as an RTS And I actually still think that's a fantastic idea and one day would love to go back and make that game.

289
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:54,629
Speaker 1: Well, did you see that video someone made of 8-bit Starcraft?

290
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,340
Speaker 1: It was like a scene based like side view.

291
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:57,822
Speaker 1: It was.

292
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:01,159
Speaker 1: it sounds like that video would look like the game that you were talking about.

293
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:05,523
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm imagining more like a sim ant kind of thing word But there's two.

294
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,496
Speaker 2: there's two different sim ants going on in the same screen in the.

295
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:10,343
Speaker 2: they're going at each other Exactly.

296
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:20,435
Speaker 0: It was like it was like cement only with you know, you would try and flood the other guys cave with lava But you're also trying to mine for gold in order to hire your units, you know, that sort of thing.

297
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:27,433
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not fun And it's all like command and conquer style You know, it's like every idea you're talking about.

298
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:28,758
Speaker 1: all I can think is I'd play that.

299
00:24:31,982 --> 00:24:33,860
Speaker 0: That's because I'm a great fucking designer.

300
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:36,286
Speaker 1: So I'm curious.

301
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:39,040
Speaker 1: Do you have any background at all in mathematics or game theory?

302
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,033
Speaker 0: No, I just been playing games and making games all my life.

303
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:46,350
Speaker 0: and well computer I you know, I went to school for computer science.

304
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:49,041
Speaker 0: And so there's a fair amount of math in there it's.

305
00:24:49,222 --> 00:25:12,699
Speaker 0: it's funny too because one of the things that I I've only learned recently is that I Really think about game design as it's the game designers are tend to be split into two camps Designers that really focus on like the mechanics of making a game and they think those people tend to think about like fun is a Commodity and how you can pace the fun and like, you know how all the pieces work together really well.

306
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,880
Speaker 0: And then and that's like the will right camp, right?

307
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,480
Speaker 0: And then there's the the game designers that are all about the experience of playing the game.

308
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:28,360
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with like, you know how things work together But just like the sort of emotional experience you have whether it's laughing or you know intense thought or whatever it is.

309
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:44,620
Speaker 0: Or you know enjoying the music or something and that's like, you know You're Tim Schafer or you're that game company type type designers and and I'm not saying that those designers don't think about it in the other way also, but But I think a really truly great game needs to have both.

310
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:51,642
Speaker 0: You know that sort of that perfect intricacy of of like a you know a Sim City and also you.

311
00:25:51,843 --> 00:26:00,400
Speaker 0: you really need to focus on the experience of playing the game and sometimes most of the time the things that a player actually Remembers about their favorite games are the experiences not the mechanics.

312
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:06,860
Speaker 0: There's very few games that actually do really well just based on the mechanics with some exceptions like a Starcraft or Sim City.

313
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:25,040
Speaker 0: But but people remember the individual experiences of playing a game and those experiences are the ones that I've only sort of recently learned That you really have to focus on making those sort of one-off moments in the games The really memorable moments for for for players so that so that they can you know, so they'll remember them ten years from now.

314
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:27,876
Speaker 1: So what are some moments that you remember from the last 10 or 20 years?

315
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,359
Speaker 0: Huh, that's a good question.

316
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:33,898
Speaker 0: That's a really good question.

317
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:50,167
Speaker 0: well Just individual like I I guess I think about like Tim Schafer and I think about Like various different psychonauts levels, but in particular the the the velvet painting one with the bowl Going around it out to me.

318
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,600
Speaker 0: This is that you this is just top of my head That's certainly not one of my favorite games but That was memorable.

319
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:58,523
Speaker 0: I think the first.

320
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:14,134
Speaker 0: there's a couple of in like really tiny indie games that are memorable to me the marriage and passage even though I think you know, they're just tiny tiny little games and I I don't think of them personally as Great great games, but they but they sort of encapsulate that one little experience.

321
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:15,659
Speaker 0: That is very memorable to me.

322
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:24,200
Speaker 1: That kind of proves your point that you remember this experience from this one Not that great game because the experience itself was kind of burned into your memory, right?

323
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, and those games really are simply about one.

324
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:34,039
Speaker 0: They're not about mechanics They are about a single tiny little experience and then and giving that experience to the gamer or the player.

325
00:27:35,983 --> 00:27:42,780
Speaker 0: Let's see, I don't know after that What's what's been a really memorable recent one.

326
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,828
Speaker 0: Josh I you know, I have my memories are my.

327
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,879
Speaker 0: my really great memories are often of the games I played when I was a kid.

328
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:54,319
Speaker 0: So like like at the end of xcom.

329
00:27:56,826 --> 00:28:01,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, and here's You gotta hear my story about the end of xcom.

330
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,180
Speaker 0: So so this honestly this is the best.

331
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,197
Speaker 0: This is the best ending of xcom anyone ever had.

332
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:11,780
Speaker 0: So my my main guy that I always relied on his name was Chuck Bryant, right?

333
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:15,080
Speaker 0: And and you get to the end of xcom you're in the alien base, right?

334
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:33,127
Speaker 0: and all my all the other guys are getting picked off and Chuck is just barely making it to the end and he he gets into the last room nearly dead where the alien brain is and He he's on like his last hit point and he goes to shoot the alien brain and click click click He's out of he's out of ammo, right?

335
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:34,512
Speaker 0: So he's like you have a grenade.

336
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,319
Speaker 0: So no I had nothing.

337
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,255
Speaker 0: so I'm like Well, maybe I can throw the gun at the brain and you never know.

338
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:42,388
Speaker 0: Maybe that'll work All right, so I throw the gun still doesn't?

339
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,231
Speaker 0: it does nothing.

340
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:44,315
Speaker 0: and then he's out of action points.

341
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:48,460
Speaker 0: I'm like, ah shit I'm gonna have to do this whole thing over again at that point.

342
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:57,460
Speaker 0: so the two aliens that are chasing me come into the room and If you remember an xcom you could choose either between a single aimed shot or a triple auto shot.

343
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,314
Speaker 1: Who did anything but first guy?

344
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:05,449
Speaker 0: Yeah the first guy did an auto shot at me and The first two shots are the second.

345
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,500
Speaker 0: the first shot hit me and then the second shot hit me and Chuck died.

346
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:13,653
Speaker 0: and then the third shot went over his dead body hit the brain behind him and Destroyed it.

347
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:15,859
Speaker 0: and then I got the cutscene of like.

348
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,550
Speaker 0: my main character is supposedly leaving the base as the base is exploding.

349
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:26,509
Speaker 0: So Chuck, of course, you know over his dead body it ends up.

350
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,170
Speaker 0: He ends up crawling back out of the the alien station and and winning in the end.

351
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:43,069
Speaker 0: So yeah that that is an experience that's totally burned into my head and and and I yeah I definitely think that those are necessary for for memorable couldn't have asked Couldn't have asked for better than an xcom story.

352
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:55,416
Speaker 1: I feel like xcom did that really well because it named every single character and you'd feel bad when they died and I would I'd identify with them and I'd worry about them and I'd always kind of protect the ones that I liked and kind of hold them Back from the chrysalids and

353
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:58,190
Speaker 2: you would manage like the inventory of each and every one.

354
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,786
Speaker 2: It's like okay, you're gonna do this and they actually look different like they had different faces and different hair.

355
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:10,050
Speaker 0: and yeah Yeah, I don't I have no idea whether or not from a mechanical perspective It would be fun these days because you know, all of our tastes have certainly changed.

356
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:12,809
Speaker 0: But uh, but I certainly remember it.

357
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:19,550
Speaker 1: So I think if anything the sheer number of people trying to remake xcom, I think but none of them is exceeding.

358
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's actually a decent.

359
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:23,790
Speaker 0: there's a decent indie one that just came out recently.

360
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,029
Speaker 0: It's actually I think in beta called frozen synapse.

361
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:30,241
Speaker 0: And if you guys like xcom, it's really worth checking out.

362
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:31,746
Speaker 0: It's a um, it's.

363
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,820
Speaker 0: it's just like xcom Except you're playing against other people and it's all.

364
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,181
Speaker 0: it's.

365
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:39,939
Speaker 0: it's basically tactical SWAT teams And it's it's short sessions and it's hot seat.

366
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:44,095
Speaker 0: and so the server set up so you can actually have a whole ton of games Going at once.

367
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:53,449
Speaker 0: so, you know you go in and you put in your moves for one game And then you go and put it in the moves for another game and after you do a couple You know one of them someone else will have already put in the moves and you can go back and see what happened.

368
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:55,188
Speaker 0: that turn And you you put in your moves again.

369
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just it's a hasn't gotten a lot of press but it's really well done.

370
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:01,485
Speaker 0: It's too bad.

371
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,729
Speaker 2: Sit five came out this morning.

372
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:12,162
Speaker 1: We're trying we're talking to you here and every two seconds someone is it pops up like so-and-so is playing said five so and so Is playing said five and I just want to go play some fun.

373
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:13,889
Speaker 2: I just I've stopped playing to do this interview.

374
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:20,113
Speaker 1: So these kind of Experiences aside.

375
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,056
Speaker 1: What are you playing right now?

376
00:31:21,116 --> 00:31:24,306
Speaker 1: Like when you're not busily coding Monica, like what is your go-to game?

377
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:31,670
Speaker 0: I Hadn't actually was was not playing games for a few months because I was crunching to get ready for packs.

378
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,201
Speaker 2: Yeah, that happened to have us does too.

379
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:46,830
Speaker 0: Yeah and And before that I was playing the Starcraft beta and I just picked up Stark the regular Starcraft To on Saturday, I think and I did my placement matches.

380
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,349
Speaker 0: I think I got totally lucky on my placement matches because I placed platinum and there's no way I belong.

381
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:52,375
Speaker 0: plan Are you actually?

382
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:53,261
Speaker 2: are you actually good?

383
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,791
Speaker 2: because I need cuz you know I'm.

384
00:31:55,032 --> 00:32:00,109
Speaker 2: I'm like pretty much the worst in the universe at Starcraft like if I'm playing against the computer on easy mode.

385
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:02,756
Speaker 2: just You know the regular old map.

386
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,358
Speaker 2: just you know.

387
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:05,043
Speaker 2: go, you know, here's right.

388
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:11,907
Speaker 2: basically what happens is is, you know They send over a wave of you know, little bad guys and I can't even fend off the first wave.

389
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:12,429
Speaker 2: I'm just done.

390
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:17,149
Speaker 1: So if you have any spacecraft advice be fair Scott, I should the same problem in advance wars.

391
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,658
Speaker 2: No, I don't have the same exact problem in advance wars.

392
00:32:19,698 --> 00:32:22,127
Speaker 2: I don't get killed by the first wave in advance second wave.

393
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,256
Speaker 2: No Anyway, you might.

394
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,729
Speaker 0: you might want to think about the possibility that you're just stupid.

395
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:30,295
Speaker 1: It's possible To be fair.

396
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:33,270
Speaker 1: I'm equally bad at RTS is I just don't advertise this fact?

397
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,471
Speaker 1: It's.

398
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,899
Speaker 1: it's so even command and conquer back that I never beat it.

399
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,347
Speaker 1: I never buy any single-player RTS.

400
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,179
Speaker 0: in my entire life I loved the original command and conquer.

401
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:49,430
Speaker 0: that's still my favorite RTS and my next game I think is I think I'm gonna try and make the first great console RTS and that's I got him.

402
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,181
Speaker 0: I'm sounding like a cocky ambitious guy.

403
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,506
Speaker 1: So now I'm cuz we have.

404
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:54,390
Speaker 1: we've talked a lot.

405
00:32:54,471 --> 00:33:03,197
Speaker 1: You obviously don't listen to geek nights But we've talked a lot about what we think is wrong with a lot of current popular RTS's and RTS is a genre and where they've gone.

406
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:07,809
Speaker 1: So what what mechanic like what would make the great American RTS?

407
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,421
Speaker 1: Like what is it that you obviously have some like very strong idea here?

408
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:12,244
Speaker 0: Sure.

409
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:12,404
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:26,810
Speaker 0: Well, I actually think that that To go back to my my sort of 2d plane local minima analogy This is a perfect example of it that like that command and conquer and Warcraft were were well and before that What was the predecessor to Warcraft?

411
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:28,654
Speaker 0: What was?

412
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,217
Speaker 0: sorry dude?

413
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:29,981
Speaker 0: No doing that's right.

414
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:50,810
Speaker 0: Yeah doing it was doing - I think Was the first RTS really the first modern RTS and they've just been iterating on that same formula and adding features all along And they did a pretty good job not getting to not expanding upon it too much with Starcraft 2 and and keeping it Still somewhat accessible, but it's still far from well.

415
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:57,638
Speaker 2: I think the reason that they the reason I realize the reason that they do a lot of the things they do in Starcraft 2 Is because of the Koreans right?

416
00:33:57,699 --> 00:34:07,955
Speaker 2: It's basically right football in Korea So when coming out we start coming out with Starcraft 2 is like coming out with football - you can't You know, I've heard that from a blizzard person.

417
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:12,010
Speaker 2: So you really know how much can you how much can you really change?

418
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,483
Speaker 2: You know, it might you know, it's very risky.

419
00:34:14,504 --> 00:34:14,946
Speaker 1: Well, I think so.

420
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:35,949
Speaker 0: I think that to answer your question I think that to make the the really sort of the next great RTS and that the first notable RTS not including Starcraft 2 and in you know, 15 years will be to go back and and Design a game based upon what the original idea of an RTS was supposed to be.

421
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:38,504
Speaker 0: So RTS is really a few.

422
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:45,389
Speaker 0: if you break it down What is core to a real-time strategy game and what's core to the things we like about real-time strategy games?

423
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:46,976
Speaker 0: You break you.

424
00:34:47,178 --> 00:35:07,388
Speaker 0: you can basically say well, it's chess So it's a there's a 2d there's basically a 2d space or at least there's a there's a manageable Space of air of area in which where you're dealing with like land control issues You have a variety of mixed units that might have strengths and weaknesses against one another And have different different things that they can do.

425
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:21,349
Speaker 0: and then you have an opponent that has You know somewhat somewhat equal Abilities and and I think if you sort of break it back to that and design a game based on that.

426
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:35,189
Speaker 0: and then if you if you add in some extra limitations like you know trying to design it around a classic gaming controller like a You know an Xbox controller except, you know, not with quite as much stuff.

427
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:39,569
Speaker 0: I mean the problem with every console RTS is that they try and use every button.

428
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:52,827
Speaker 0: And if you want to make a great console RTS stick to like, you know the four face buttons and and maybe a couple other buttons and You know, you have to do that because if you try and use every button you're gonna fuck over 95% of your your audience.

429
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:00,595
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm just getting old but I no longer have the patience even read the instructions to a game and if I Can't figure it out on my own.

430
00:36:00,756 --> 00:36:01,479
Speaker 2: It doesn't help.

431
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,267
Speaker 2: the instruction manuals are not what they used to be.

432
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:08,130
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean you have to you have to build your instruction manual into the game these days.

433
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,982
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but like I lay next to me we talked about the show recently.

434
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,170
Speaker 1: we have the original Zelda 1 instruction book.

435
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,093
Speaker 1: It's full color.

436
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,160
Speaker 1: There's comics in there jokes.

437
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,890
Speaker 1: It there's like maps hidden all over in this book.

438
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:21,456
Speaker 1: It's it's an amazing little book.

439
00:36:22,118 --> 00:36:22,540
Speaker 0: No, man.

440
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,166
Speaker 0: Ultima used to come with a cloth map.

441
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:24,968
Speaker 0: I still have them all.

442
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,739
Speaker 1: Wow I don't have any of those anymore.

443
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,950
Speaker 1: I Don't even have my quest for glory to map.

444
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:39,006
Speaker 0: So So, yeah, I think that what you need to do is you need to break it back to not not.

445
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:40,450
Speaker 0: what is it as not?

446
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:43,049
Speaker 0: What are the basics of a RTS video game?

447
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:45,354
Speaker 0: And build off of that.

448
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:52,949
Speaker 0: but what are the basics of what we like about the concept of an RTS not just as a video Game, but as a game and try and build a game based upon that?

449
00:36:55,031 --> 00:37:05,142
Speaker 0: and I when I design game stuff I do just Despite the fact that that Monaco is absolutely inspired by like pac-man and hitman.

450
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:11,679
Speaker 0: I do generally try and and Draw most of my inspiration from things outside of games.

451
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:24,687
Speaker 0: because if you're drawing your your design inspiration from games themselves You're just gonna end up sort of frankensteining something together, you know drawing bits and pieces of stuff that already exist And and I'm not saying that Monaco is you know, something totally revolutionary that it's never existed before.

452
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:25,249
Speaker 0: it certainly has.

453
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:40,049
Speaker 0: But at the same time I think that if you're drawing drawing your inspiration from things outside of existing games You're much more likely to not only Break the game down to sort of the basic pits and bits and pieces of what makes the experience fun.

454
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:46,249
Speaker 0: But also you're not likely to end up just you know, becoming a me to game something that looks exactly like something else.

455
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:50,850
Speaker 1: Alright, so I guess now let's step back from the gaming a little bit because we've got you on the show.

456
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,720
Speaker 1: We can talk about you as a person.

457
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,986
Speaker 1: I mean gamers are people too.

458
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:58,683
Speaker 1: So Obviously you're into video games pretty hardcore.

459
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,410
Speaker 1: But are you like do you a roleplay at all?

460
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,384
Speaker 1: Do you play board games any of that other kind of gaming stuff?

461
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:08,409
Speaker 0: I I have some friends that play a fair amount of board games and I love playing them.

462
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:13,404
Speaker 0: The main my main hobby actually is is ultimate frisbee.

463
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:14,689
Speaker 0: I play a lot of all day.

464
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,938
Speaker 2: It's not like for in a league or professionally.

465
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:18,579
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,963
Speaker 0: No, I I play.

467
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:22,510
Speaker 0: I usually captain my summer league in my winter league team.

468
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:25,150
Speaker 0: In fact, I met my wife playing winter league.

469
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,540
Speaker 2: I used to play used to play really seriously.

470
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,826
Speaker 0: Like I was a good college player.

471
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:30,830
Speaker 0: I'm not good anymore.

472
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:36,898
Speaker 0: I had a couple of knee surgeries and now I'm Lazy because I sit in front of the computer all day.

473
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,190
Speaker 1: where the knee surgeries from ultimate frisbee injuries?

474
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, they they were.

475
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:42,401
Speaker 0: well, they were both.

476
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:44,550
Speaker 0: I tore my meniscus in my right knee.

477
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,694
Speaker 0: I thought it was just.

478
00:38:45,754 --> 00:38:50,466
Speaker 0: this is so that's like a piece of cartilage that sits in your in your knee that keeps the bones from.

479
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:55,104
Speaker 0: Okay, I actually watched the surgery the first time.

480
00:38:55,124 --> 00:39:06,777
Speaker 0: okay, it's enough My meniscus broke in half and they gave me a spinal anesthetic Knocked out knocked me out from the bottom half down and I watched the surgery on the screen above me While they were going in.

481
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:09,330
Speaker 2: and I can't I can't even watch someone else's surgery.

482
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:13,188
Speaker 1: So the important thing is did you guys win that game?

483
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,979
Speaker 0: Though well, the thing is I broke.

484
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,650
Speaker 0: I broke my meniscus and I thought I was just dislocating it.

485
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,410
Speaker 0: So I kept just popping it back into place.

486
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:29,681
Speaker 0: So I broke it like maybe five or six times until the last the last time and it swelled up so bad I had to go to hospital because I couldn't.

487
00:39:30,103 --> 00:39:31,470
Speaker 0: I couldn't bend my knee anymore.

488
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:42,107
Speaker 0: You found out that yeah, I had a serious problem and not just a dislocated knee And then and then I busted it again the second time is the same problem.

489
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:42,850
Speaker 0: It just never healed.

490
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:47,616
Speaker 0: I busted it surfing the second time so That was.

491
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:48,505
Speaker 0: that's that.

492
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:52,670
Speaker 0: that's a bummer But you know, I was probably gonna get fat and happy after that in any case.

493
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,169
Speaker 0: So that just that just sped up the the process.

494
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:58,655
Speaker 0: But yeah, I do love.

495
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:06,690
Speaker 0: I love my disc sports and I definitely love board games Some actually some of those breaks that I was taking from venture dinosauria before I started working on Monaco.

496
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:16,490
Speaker 0: I actually was designing board games based on my like the other games that the video games that I've made So I'd made like that because it's rare that people go in that reverse direction.

497
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:21,150
Speaker 2: Usually if they take a board game and they turn it into a video game That's just the same exact thing.

498
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,435
Speaker 2: But now you don't need a. you know, this reduces setup time and count, you know It makes it easier to play.

499
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:29,970
Speaker 2: play it online, but I never seen a lot of video games turned into board games.

500
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:32,069
Speaker 2: I mean what half-life 2 the board game looked like.

501
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,456
Speaker 1: It probably exists Like penny arcade Metroid.

502
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:38,480
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean there are.

503
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:48,305
Speaker 2: there are games that are that have video game licenses Right, like there's a World of Warcraft board game and a doom board game, but they're nothing like the real, you know They just have some of the same characters and artwork.

504
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:50,736
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, it was actually my venture.

505
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:55,050
Speaker 0: Africa board game was actually really fun and I pitched it to a couple of board game companies.

506
00:40:56,115 --> 00:41:04,650
Speaker 0: it was a very sort of chess like game in which you have a number of African animals and there's a a son that moves around the board.

507
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,730
Speaker 0: You can actually rearrange the board configuration so that every game is different and then there's a son that moves around the board.

508
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:16,050
Speaker 0: You're trying to any time and that represents the great migration and any time you have animals that are passing beneath them.

509
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,065
Speaker 0: They're passing within the great migration.

510
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:20,869
Speaker 0: They get to breed So you actually get to put pieces back on the board?

511
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,065
Speaker 0: And you have your predators and you're trying to use your predators to take out.

512
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:27,805
Speaker 0: the other guys are before us But also keep your herbivores from getting eaten by the other guys predators.

513
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:28,610
Speaker 0: It sounds a lot of fun.

514
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:37,429
Speaker 2: It sounds like a combination of like the dune board game, which has the storm that blows around the planet But also roller derby where you're on offense and defense at the same time.

515
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:39,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds very similar to those.

516
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:53,697
Speaker 0: and then I did a a card game based on venture Arctic which is Was a game in which you're sort of it's a little bit sort of Puerto Rico inspired in that you are.

517
00:41:54,733 --> 00:42:05,244
Speaker 0: Their seasons pass and during each season you get to choose Or during each turn you get to choose which season you want to be And that determines the order of play and what things you can do during those seasons.

518
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:10,090
Speaker 0: so you can be and in the Arctic Of course, the the seasons are you know, everything is seasonally dependent.

519
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,829
Speaker 0: So you're trying to either kill animals or or help the animals based upon what season you are.

520
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:21,989
Speaker 0: Say there's a see sort of Autonomous animals in the world and then and then your role shifts each turn based upon what season you want to be.

521
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:27,869
Speaker 0: I actually did a dinosauria card game that played a little like magic.

522
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:39,572
Speaker 0: not it's not really like magic, but it It's a game in which the the world actually is growing and so there's more and more of the world to access as you as You go.

523
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:42,670
Speaker 0: but then occasionally there's disasters that sort of destroy a whole bunch of the world.

524
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:51,084
Speaker 0: But then the cards that are in your hand represent dinosaurs and you can only you start by placing the sort of low-level dinosaurs and then you spend.

525
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:57,030
Speaker 0: you can discard cards to Evolve your your existing dinosaurs up to more powerful dinosaurs.

526
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:05,048
Speaker 0: So you're kind of trying to get to the point get to the end of the game with the most evolved dinosaurs And yeah, it's an interesting little card game.

527
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:13,042
Speaker 1: So, you know, the show is called geek nights and it's something we like to ask a lot of different people Do you consider yourself a geek or a nerd or anything like that?

528
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:14,770
Speaker 1: Do you even think there's a difference in the terms?

529
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,005
Speaker 1: Do you even care about it?

530
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,414
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, probably all of you.

531
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:21,478
Speaker 0: I actually I won.

532
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,389
Speaker 0: I won the California State Science Fair when I was in high school.

533
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:26,368
Speaker 2: What was your project?

534
00:43:28,271 --> 00:43:42,994
Speaker 0: Fractal analysis of Southern California lagoons I took I took Satellite photography at the internet wasn't really around at the time and and I took satellite photography from the USGS and Wrote a program.

535
00:43:43,014 --> 00:44:04,927
Speaker 0: so I scanned in the photography and I wrote a program that actually analyzed the flood the flow patterns Within the flood plains of the lagoons to see whether or not Human intrusion like buildings and things like that actually interrupted the the fractal characteristics of the the flow plane or the flow pattern And did find that they did actually do that.

536
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:06,235
Speaker 0: That they're.

537
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:06,979
Speaker 0: they're fractal.

538
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:25,910
Speaker 0: They're fractal characteristics that Flood lagoons and lagoons that had seen some human development in them loss were no longer fractal in terms of the way that their their curves self related To to themselves and I can't talk about this anymore because I don't I don't have the.

539
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:35,321
Speaker 0: so there are a lot of kind of yeah, so I think I'm a nerd and a geek and all of those things and and I Embrace it back in my dating days.

540
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:47,105
Speaker 0: I used to I used to every time I'd go on a first date with someone I'd tell him look if you don't like nerds or geeks don't date me because I'm I'll say oh you said you're married so it worked out, right?

541
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:52,887
Speaker 0: Yes a beautiful wonderful geek.

542
00:44:54,755 --> 00:44:56,389
Speaker 1: So she's specifically a geek now.

543
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:58,878
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of conflated things.

544
00:44:58,918 --> 00:45:02,710
Speaker 1: like nerds and geeks are supposed to be into sci-fi and into role-playing games and into anime.

545
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:09,370
Speaker 1: So are you into like science fiction at all or science fiction like literature or movies or anime or any of these other?

546
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,886
Speaker 1: traditional comic books?

547
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:23,889
Speaker 0: My I did host a Star Trek themed murder mystery party once I were I I was commander Riker.

548
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:31,985
Speaker 0: My wife despite being a geek is not a is not a geek by by history.

549
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:40,981
Speaker 0: She's just a geek because of her brain and so I actually watched Star Trek first contact with her the other night and I was.

550
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,868
Speaker 0: she was surprised actually how much she loved it.

551
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was good.

552
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:51,470
Speaker 0: it's it's it's pretty cheesy I mean, I'm definitely a definitely a bit of a you know, sort of culture file.

553
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:55,081
Speaker 0: So I I'm you know, I'm picky about my movies.

554
00:45:55,141 --> 00:46:00,712
Speaker 0: But but I did definitely brought me back and I enjoyed it like I turned on the.

555
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:08,270
Speaker 0: I turned on next generation the other night actually and The the episode where Q loses his powers was on and that's one of my favorite episodes.

556
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:10,676
Speaker 0: It's got so many good lines in it.

557
00:46:11,078 --> 00:46:14,293
Speaker 1: just when he freaks out he fought he falls asleep and he can't figure out what happened To it.

558
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:14,696
Speaker 1: Yeah.

559
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:16,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to work in groups when you're omnipotent.

560
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:19,579
Speaker 0: Eat any good books.

561
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,049
Speaker 0: lately wharf is in there, too.

562
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:29,309
Speaker 1: Actually kind of randomly I was watching cuz I as a kid I never watched Babylon 5 and randomly we started watching it.

563
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,456
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if I like yeah, Scott doesn't.

564
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:35,890
Speaker 1: Scott doesn't like any like Star Trek or any of that stuff even like Firefly.

565
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:37,850
Speaker 1: So yeah, yeah, it's a fun.

566
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,530
Speaker 0: I didn't get into any of the newer ones.

567
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:47,583
Speaker 0: Like I I always I scoffed about X-Files ever because everyone loved X-Files after next generation was dead Like X-Files like early on.

568
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:53,469
Speaker 2: but I had this plot line But then they didn't really you know, they would always just they wouldn't advance that main plot line at all.

569
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:55,236
Speaker 2: You know, they were just.

570
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:56,902
Speaker 0: I hate to say it, but I hate it lost.

571
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,107
Speaker 1: Oh, don't worry.

572
00:46:58,328 --> 00:46:58,910
Speaker 1: We're in that camp.

573
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:05,170
Speaker 1: Okay, I watched one episode and I thought alright clearly they're just making this shit up and they don't have an actual ending in mind.

574
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,344
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna waste my time.

575
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone.

576
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,870
Speaker 0: and then you get to the ending and I like I watched the freakin recap.

577
00:47:11,091 --> 00:47:14,410
Speaker 0: It was like a three-hour recap episode just before the last episode.

578
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:23,849
Speaker 0: Just to see if like maybe I'll enjoy this last episode because of course they're gonna like throw everything But the kitchen sink and the kitchen sink at that last episode, so maybe it'll be good, right?

579
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:29,189
Speaker 0: But that boat after watching that recap episode is like I want nothing to do with this piece of shit.

580
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,073
Speaker 1: All right.

581
00:47:31,094 --> 00:47:32,342
Speaker 1: So let's get way out.

582
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:33,370
Speaker 1: We'll wrap it up pretty soon.

583
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:39,044
Speaker 1: But a bad question to ask we found is you know What are the like what's your favorite movie or anything like that?

584
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,210
Speaker 1: Cuz it's hard to actually qualify.

585
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:43,360
Speaker 1: So what are like five movies that you think are awesome?

586
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:46,170
Speaker 1: because I think this is a good insight into the the mind behind Monaco.

587
00:47:47,953 --> 00:48:12,037
Speaker 0: actually, I have a great I One of the the most underrated crime movies I think is a movie called confidence With Edward Burns and Rachel Ice and it's got like Dustin Hoffman as a strip club owner and I actually drew a lot of the the visual inspiration for Monaco from that movie and It's really good.

588
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,064
Speaker 0: It's like it's a con movie.

589
00:48:13,105 --> 00:48:19,308
Speaker 0: It's a con man movie so it's a team of con men that are trying to you know con people and it's got Who's the sideways actor?

590
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:22,728
Speaker 0: Anyways before he was famous.

591
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:27,548
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I think that's a really underrated like con heist movie.

592
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,097
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of the con heist movies.

593
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:30,981
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:38,268
Speaker 0: Oh, I've watched them all at this point And speaking of which there's another another crime-based movie.

595
00:48:38,288 --> 00:48:43,005
Speaker 0: I Really can't stand the Soderbergh Ocean's 11 12 and 13 movies.

596
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:51,189
Speaker 0: I think they're awful, but before he did those he did out of sight with George Clooney and J. Lo Which actually is fantastic really?

597
00:48:52,071 --> 00:48:54,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually really pretty steamy.

598
00:48:54,290 --> 00:49:03,407
Speaker 0: It's like it's got a pretty steamy, you know a couple of love scenes with the two of them and it's got like really funny stupid criminals and and a great plot.

599
00:49:05,264 --> 00:49:11,135
Speaker 0: So Yeah, and that's Soderbergh before before traffic and before Yeah, I liked traffic alive.

600
00:49:11,275 --> 00:49:12,519
Speaker 0: I think that was probably his high point.

601
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:19,959
Speaker 0: But but then, you know, he's had a bunch of bad movies, too and So those two I love Children of Men.

602
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:21,163
Speaker 0: That's a recent one.

603
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:22,850
Speaker 0: I guess that I thought was really good.

604
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:29,150
Speaker 1: Well have that one long cut in the middle that one scene that was crazy

605
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:40,227
Speaker 0: Unbelievable, yeah, and it's hard for me to know whether or not that movie is really as fantastic as I remember it to be Except that that scene is just so fucking mind-blowing that like I love that movie.

606
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:41,957
Speaker 0: It might maybe it's no good Maybe the movie is no good.

607
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:43,629
Speaker 0: But but that scene really is incredible.

608
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:53,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's I love those I Comedy wise like I'm a fan of I'm a fan of like the Royal Tenenbaums.

609
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:58,666
Speaker 0: I like really quirky stuff and that was quirky before he was.

610
00:49:58,927 --> 00:50:05,288
Speaker 0: Well, he I guess he was always Self-consciously quirky, but that was quirky before we were conscious of his self-consciousness.

611
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:12,790
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I enjoy that and you know, I like the stupid stuff, too.

612
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,842
Speaker 0: But but those are the certainly the ones that I I find memorable.

613
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:24,410
Speaker 2: All right, so we so we met you at PAX 2010. have you been to any other Conventions before then or do you go to any others?

614
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:25,953
Speaker 0: I've never.

615
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,502
Speaker 0: I've never actually done a booth at a convention.

616
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,670
Speaker 0: That was my first time doing a booth and it was a blast.

617
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:44,609
Speaker 0: I've been working in the video game industry since So I've been to my fair share of conferences, you know E3 and GDC and all that stuff, but I've never been to like, you know other like San Diego comic cons or maybe.

618
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:48,389
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, I've been to comic-con a bunch of times.

619
00:50:49,331 --> 00:51:00,560
Speaker 0: It's a lot of it's a little over my head and and I'm not into waiting in lines for We tend to not wait in line for things anyway, those are things that are worth writing, you know.

620
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:02,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually said we don't.

621
00:51:03,455 --> 00:51:04,398
Speaker 1: so prat packs.

622
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:07,106
Speaker 1: at least press and speakers get the same privileges.

623
00:51:07,908 --> 00:51:08,470
Speaker 0: Oh, that's awesome.

624
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, which is almost nothing.

625
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:12,815
Speaker 1: Oh They don't give press that much.

626
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:20,710
Speaker 1: exhibitor is the badge that gets you a way more access than press gets Because it mostly gets you into the exhibit hall because your booth is there.

627
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,130
Speaker 1: We're thinking about getting our own booth in the exhibit hall to share with some game designer friends.

628
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:24,953
Speaker 1: We have partly so.

629
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:29,146
Speaker 1: we can get that exhibitor badge along with the speaker badge between the two.

630
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:30,230
Speaker 1: We'll get around.

631
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:34,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, actually Chris Hecker the guy who did spy party.

632
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:37,177
Speaker 0: He's the guy that I Shared the booth with at PAX.

633
00:51:37,437 --> 00:51:40,227
Speaker 1: I was slowly working toward bothering him next.

634
00:51:40,247 --> 00:51:41,833
Speaker 0: Yes I was sharing.

635
00:51:42,034 --> 00:51:56,320
Speaker 0: I shared the booth with John Blow who did braid and he's working on the witness And and Chris Hecker who's got a long storied history with with technology and game development And he's been working on spy party at any rate he.

636
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:07,735
Speaker 0: so he actually came and stayed at my place For comic-con this year and that was sort of how we hatched the idea of doing a Doing a booth together at PAX.

637
00:52:08,979 --> 00:52:12,270
Speaker 2: So how do you think packs compared to the other conventions that you've been through?

638
00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:13,980
Speaker 0: I was my favorite.

639
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:16,535
Speaker 0: This is there was my favorite one I've been to.

640
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:25,724
Speaker 0: I didn't actually get a ton of time to to Really look around a lot because I was constantly babysitting the booth But I loved the gamers.

641
00:52:25,764 --> 00:52:46,710
Speaker 0: there were great really just totally awesome people that were really interested in games and You know a lot of just smart interesting fun people that were really there to have fun and just play games like I. and I mean granted it's a self-selecting audience the people that are gonna come over and play and play Monaco.

642
00:52:47,273 --> 00:52:56,210
Speaker 0: But pretty much everyone that came over to play Didn't seem like unduly impressed by the big triple-a stuff, you know.

643
00:52:56,494 --> 00:53:04,456
Speaker 0: I actually think that you know the smaller budget games can have just as good graphics or at least art if you want to call it that with it with a Capital a as the big budget games.

644
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:12,990
Speaker 0: and so it sort of bugs me when someone comes over and like sort of treats us as Second rate because I don't think there's any reason that we are.

645
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:22,208
Speaker 0: But yeah, I didn't encounter any of those people at PAX everyone who came over to play and a grant Like I said, it's a self-selecting audience, but everyone who came to play just was there to have fun.

646
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:29,308
Speaker 2: Well, I mean you're pretty close to like the PAX 10 area too, you know And that was it's pretty much all indie games in there, right?

647
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:30,829
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

648
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,750
Speaker 1: So is there an ETA and when Monaco is gonna be available for purchase or is that still in the works?

649
00:53:36,531 --> 00:53:41,169
Speaker 0: Now still in the works until I know which consoles it's gonna be it'll be PC and at least one console.

650
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:47,070
Speaker 2: If you did it with XNA, right then I mean it has to be Xbox the really what else can you get it on?

651
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,234
Speaker 0: Well, you can port it.

652
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,041
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess you could yeah.

653
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:52,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you can voice the things get farted.

654
00:53:55,231 --> 00:54:01,169
Speaker 2: Actually, could you you could put it on like the the the Windows Phone 7 and the zoom if you wanted to.

655
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:02,695
Speaker 2: I don't know How well that would work.

656
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:03,618
Speaker 0: I can.

657
00:54:03,759 --> 00:54:06,730
Speaker 0: I can say that it will be PC and at least one console.

658
00:54:06,892 --> 00:54:13,408
Speaker 0: It's it's not gonna be a mobile app Although I I do think that it'll be really fun to make a version of it for the 3ds.

659
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:17,716
Speaker 2: It can be a blast would be But that won't be.

660
00:54:17,977 --> 00:54:19,264
Speaker 0: that won't be of course right away.

661
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:34,609
Speaker 0: Of course not but but yeah PC and at least one console and that kind of I'm I. After it won the IGF back when everything was all blocky and tile based I got a lot of enthusiasm for wanting to talk to me.

662
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:45,390
Speaker 0: But most of the the big console companies You know, I was having to rely entirely on that enthusiasm rather than them actually getting it.

663
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:49,728
Speaker 0: They most of them most of them didn't really get it.

664
00:54:50,150 --> 00:55:00,179
Speaker 0: But and some of them were like, yeah, but we'll take it anyways because we might not get it, but clearly there's something here And I wasn't satisfied with that response originally.

665
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:04,293
Speaker 0: so I went dark for a while and decided well I'm gonna.

666
00:55:04,313 --> 00:55:09,855
Speaker 0: you know, the thing that the game that I was showing to them was 15 weeks of work By literally just me.

667
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:11,561
Speaker 0: I did all the art and programming and everything.

668
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:14,170
Speaker 2: Is it still just you or it is still just me?

669
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:15,243
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty good.

670
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,455
Speaker 0: But so I figured you know I went dark for a while.

671
00:55:19,496 --> 00:55:27,710
Speaker 0: it went sort of deep into development and really focused on Making sure that everyone who played it not just the business people but everyone who played it got it, you know.

672
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,066
Speaker 0: and Because because the game I think is is a lot of fun.

673
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:33,649
Speaker 0: It's fantastic.

674
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:39,450
Speaker 0: But you know there was a. there's a fairly big barrier to entry at that point.

675
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:46,407
Speaker 0: So so that was really my focus and and next month I'm gonna be moving back into talking to some people again and seeing who wants to play ball.

00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:48,510
Speaker 1: All right Well, I mean we wish you the best of luck.

677
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,230

699
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:53,724
Speaker 2: It's you know,

700
00:56:53,925 --> 00:57:13,988
Speaker 0: well, you know, I All my old games used to be through my mate the main pocket watch games calm web website and I spent a lot of time just like, you know, maintaining WordPress and maintaining forums and maintaining whatever image serving program I was using and This time around I just wanted to make a game.

701
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:21,250
Speaker 0: So I figured I'd do everything through social media where all of that infrastructure is pre-built and I don't need to maintain anything.

702
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:30,236
Speaker 0: At some point I'm gonna have to go in and revamp the website at least make it a little prettier But but I'll probably never.

703
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:33,370
Speaker 2: I mean, you don't really need like a forum if you're using Twitter and Facebook.

704
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:37,170
Speaker 2: But I mean, I feel like you do need at least a page with text like Monaco.

705
00:57:38,392 --> 00:57:39,363
Speaker 2: Here's a picture of it.
