1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,660
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 2nd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,994
Speaker 1: We nominally talk about bad movies, but we also cover quite a bit of other stuff.

3
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:18,620
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:20,685
Speaker 1: So it snowed today.

5
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,992
Speaker 0: I didn't go to work cuz it snowed.

6
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,740
Speaker 1: I went to work and no one else went to work.

7
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,820
Speaker 1: So all my meetings were canceled, and I left early.

8
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:33,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, things are going to work tomorrow, but I probably leave early as early as I can.

9
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:35,507
Speaker 1: yeah The sad thing was driving home.

10
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,734
Speaker 1: I expected you know although probably an accident on the freeway I'll be stuck forever, but no the freeway was fine.

11
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:40,480
Speaker 1: There was no traffic.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:50,275
Speaker 1: I made it most of the way home, and I got in a little road that goes to our actual house and I saw this huge traffic backup, and I'm thinking great.

13
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:51,500
Speaker 1: There's an accident now.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,324
Speaker 1: There was no accident.

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:01:02,040
Speaker 1: there was literally a little old lady in a little old car Driving as slow as her car would go And it's a lot of this line of traffic is rolling.

16
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:06,100
Speaker 1: I figure it like you know how you sit in a car an automatic transmission car.

17
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:11,234
Speaker 1: That's not that good especially older ones And they'll just kind of go if you don't touch the gas pedal or the bro.

18
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:12,480
Speaker 0: that that's supposed to happen.

19
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,040
Speaker 1: Uh not so much.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,890
Speaker 1: It shouldn't like my laser a problem, and it would go.

21
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,757
Speaker 1: if you just let it it would get to about 25 30 miles an hour.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,303
Speaker 0: Oh, that's too fast.

23
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:21,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean cars.

24
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:29,883
Speaker 0: I'd let us you know very like thousand something rpm Maybe less than a thousand rpms, and you know if they're in gear They'll roll.

25
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:30,285
Speaker 0: follow.

26
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:34,600
Speaker 1: you realize that in gear is a vague term when it comes to automatic transmissions, right?

27
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:36,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's the.

28
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:42,956
Speaker 0: if you have this if you're driving an automatic transmission And the stick is at the D or the OD that's in gear technically.

29
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,040
Speaker 1: no here's the thing.

30
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:52,228
Speaker 1: It's not engaged because you know when it's in D Even if you hit the brake the engine is not just pushing against the brakes so much it Moderates itself.

31
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,198
Speaker 0: yes, I know.

32
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:57,355
Speaker 0: now The point is is if the stick is in D, and you're not stepping on the gas.

33
00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:01,050
Speaker 0: It'll still roll Unless you're going up a hill then it won't.

34
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,460
Speaker 1: a good car won't move so much.

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,139
Speaker 0: No, it won't move so much, but it will move.

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,985
Speaker 0: Actually not at all it.

37
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,093
Speaker 1: It'll move a tiny tiny bit.

38
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if it's cold it won't move at all.

39
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:19,033
Speaker 1: And you know it's not really fully in gear because you can resist the cars forward movement And it'll just make the transmission heat up.

40
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:19,577
Speaker 0: yep.

41
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:26,260
Speaker 1: But anyway this lady was probably just driving without touching the gas of the brake and letting her car pull her along.

42
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,839
Speaker 1: She was going less than five miles an hour.

43
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:44,269
Speaker 0: Okay, well like I don't matter what the conditions are if I'm driving on the rockiest No pavement mountain pass in the middle of the desert, but it's snowing and as a hurricane I will still go five miles an hour.

44
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,097
Speaker 0: I mean yeah, it was terrible.

45
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,463
Speaker 1: I spent more time I spent.

46
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:58,639
Speaker 1: I was I could see my house But I couldn't get to it because I was behind this little old lady and all these people who runs a little lady And I saw it was a little old lady because she finally turned out of her way.

47
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,254
Speaker 1: We all go on and I Drive and she's gotten.

48
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:05,373
Speaker 1: she doesn't gotten far at all And I could see the white hair coming up as I drove past.

49
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,000
Speaker 0: her shouldn't be allowed to drive.

50
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:08,404
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say.

51
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,333
Speaker 0: listen to our driving episode from a week ago.

52
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, shouldn't be allowed to drive.

53
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:26,919
Speaker 1: so a while back all the ISPs and media companies have started talking about how they wanted to in some way either provide better Speed to their customers or to people who pay them more money.

54
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:38,080
Speaker 1: You know that sort of thing like Comcast wanted to say slow down voice over IP traffic But then speed up its own voice over IP or another voice out for IP that wanted to pay Comcast money.

55
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:48,564
Speaker 1: Yep, and all the companies saw hey, we can make a lot of money with this and they were really going forward with it like it was a good thing and It's actually very bad thing for reasons We don't need to get into.

56
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,267
Speaker 1: we've talked about it.

57
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:52,040
Speaker 0: basically everyone other than the phone companies said it was a bad thing.

58
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:56,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we not even the phone come it's just the providers like Comcast.

59
00:03:56,421 --> 00:04:00,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, the major ISPs of evil who own lots and lots of fiber and such.

60
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,819
Speaker 1: and it looked like AOL.

61
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,351
Speaker 1: Time Warner Thought it was a good thing too.

62
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,219
Speaker 0: Yeah geniuses.

63
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:10,323
Speaker 1: But anyway, we won't talk about the details because we've talked about it more than once on the show already now.

64
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:14,679
Speaker 1: senator Ron Witten Democrat from Oregon don't even know who he is.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:23,318
Speaker 1: Yeah I'd never heard of him before but he's fairly smart and he basically said that this is crap and Congress should pass a law saying that you can't do that.

66
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:31,959
Speaker 1: and He's they've got a law and We'll see if it goes through Congress or not, but it'll basically prevent the ISPs from doing exactly this.

67
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:44,400
Speaker 0: Actually, I was watching You know a few videos of like committees, you know of senators doing stuff and a lot of people watch C-SPAN And they say oh Congress doesn't do shit You know, what are they doing?

68
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,285
Speaker 0: If you watch committee meetings like when they meet to talk about stuff all the senators are like actually Smart and doing shit.

69
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:56,014
Speaker 0: You might not like what they're doing, but they're doing well.

70
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,700
Speaker 1: the Senate and the house are two very different beasts.

71
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:01,405
Speaker 1: Well, they were intended to be two very different beasts But over time they've merged the.

72
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:07,303
Speaker 1: the house was intended to be kind of a high turnover, you know local issues advocating for your constituents Whatever.

73
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,579
Speaker 1: now most people don't seem to know this.

74
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,443
Speaker 1: in fact No one at my work knew it Because I talks.

75
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:18,206
Speaker 1: I said something about it and no one believed me and I just show I know what you're gonna say and I've known It since middle school.

76
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's scary how many Americans don't know this?

77
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,800
Speaker 1: I mean I had to show them in the Constitution in the amendments where it was changed.

78
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:31,888
Speaker 1: But until recently well not recently but until recently historically at least Senators were not elected.

79
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,320
Speaker 1: senators were appointed by the state legislature.

80
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,263
Speaker 0: Yep, so you would vote for your.

81
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:45,059
Speaker 0: each state has its own government, you know your state government your governor and your state Congress and whatnot and You would vote for that, you know based on what state you lived in.

82
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,389
Speaker 0: So if you're in New York you vote for whoever.

83
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,188
Speaker 0: and then those people you voted for in, New York Would just pick their own senator whoever they wanted.

84
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,633
Speaker 0: They didn't have to pick who you wanted.

85
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:55,720
Speaker 0: They could pick, you know, someone you hated.

86
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:57,764
Speaker 0: That's how it worked.

87
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a way to.

88
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:00,275
Speaker 0: it was a good way to.

89
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:04,957
Speaker 1: well in some ways I mean part of the reason it was overturned is that there was a lot of corruption in this process.

90
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,072
Speaker 1: there was The millionaires Club because only millionaires became senators.

91
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:16,560
Speaker 0: Yes, but the solution to Corruption is not to change the system but to just you know justice increase justice.

92
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:21,767
Speaker 1: You can change the system to to make corruption less feasible or yeah But then you don't want to.

93
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:24,220
Speaker 0: you know, the point of having this was to have.

94
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:32,950
Speaker 1: Well, this is a tangent anyway, yeah, but the point is that the Senate 10 they tend to be more long-term people.

95
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:36,604
Speaker 1: someone would be on the Senate for many terms and Senators specialize.

96
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:48,495
Speaker 1: so the Senate is broken up in all these committees and each committee You'll have a bunch of senators on it and they won't know much about all the other things the Senate does But they'll be experts on their thing or at least they're supposed to be experts on their thing.

97
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:49,960
Speaker 1: Some people are some people aren't.

98
00:06:51,783 --> 00:07:04,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty funny because I was watching the commerce technology whatever committee and they were talking about the broadcast flag on radio and The head of the committee didn't know what the hell was going on.

99
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:17,300
Speaker 0: He just kept asking questions and trying to understand and The smart congressman on the side who was all active on this issue Was you know talking it up and the three experts they had testifying towards before the committee.

100
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:25,789
Speaker 0: We're all talking it up and the head guy was like, I don't know and he just kept asking dumb questions And so he could try to understand what the hell they were talking about.

101
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,478
Speaker 1: now senator senator Whitten definitely seems to.

102
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:29,723
Speaker 1: you might not know The technology.

103
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,016
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know much about this guy, but there's a quote here from him.

104
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:33,919
Speaker 1: That seems to tell all.

105
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:46,199
Speaker 1: the net has always been about Access and equal treatment and giving everyone a fair shake and people who own these fat pipes these cable and telecommunications People who say that they can't keep doing this want to undermine that.

106
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, what it really comes down to is we're paying them for bandwidth.

107
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,480
Speaker 0: Everyone else is paying them for bandwidth.

108
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:55,206
Speaker 0: Everyone pays once.

109
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,455
Speaker 0: you're not gonna you can't make anyone pay twice.

110
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:58,800
Speaker 0: just you know, shut up.

111
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what comes of it.

112
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,089
Speaker 1: I hope the bill passes.

113
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:07,540
Speaker 1: apparently it's got support from 16 Republican senators So it's definitely not a partisan issue.

114
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,919
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone in Congress unless they've been bribed will want to go against this.

115
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a feeling it's just gonna go right through.

116
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,780
Speaker 0: I mean, hey, how could you vote against something like this?

117
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:19,353
Speaker 0: It's just you'd have to be evil.

118
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:24,636
Speaker 0: That's really If anyone explains it to you and you understand what they explained.

119
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:25,560
Speaker 0: How could you?

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,764
Speaker 0: What are you thinking if you vote?

121
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:28,065
Speaker 0: Yes.

122
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:33,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you don't know that what we're actually talking about in detail read the link It'll tell you everything.

123
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:37,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason we're not gonna talk about is we've talked about it multiple times already.

124
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So ABC, which is the major network owned by Disney that shows, you know, I don't know what they show because I don't watch TV.

125
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:51,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you're like that guy on FARC who tells everyone he doesn't watch TV.

126
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, let it go.

127
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,347
Speaker 1: We know you don't watch TV.

128
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:54,790
Speaker 1: We don't care.

129
00:08:54,931 --> 00:09:01,760
Speaker 0: Yep, so Apparently, you know everyone puts their shows on iTunes these days and sells them for like three bucks.

130
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:03,847
Speaker 0: ABC is gonna try to.

131
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,480
Speaker 0: they're not doing it yet, but they're going to in the future.

132
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:15,191
Speaker 0: They've said so they're gonna put some shows on iTunes and give them away for free But they're gonna throw some commercials in there and I say woohoo.

133
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:17,558
Speaker 0: Well, just fast forward through those commercials, baby.

134
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,386
Speaker 0: Yeah Awesome.

135
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:20,709
Speaker 1: All right.

136
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:23,106
Speaker 1: I Can't run iTunes.

137
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:25,319
Speaker 1: Well, I can't easily access iTunes and Linux.

138
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,095
Speaker 0: No, but it does run in wine and a lot of people have it working.

139
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 0: I couldn't get it to work.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't get it to work.

141
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,211
Speaker 0: other people got it to work.

142
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,810
Speaker 0: But the point is is now you can You'll be able to get the TV shows download them.

143
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,210
Speaker 0: Someone else can you just give you the files or whatever, you know You won't actually have to Have iTunes to you just use a QuickTime player.

144
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,140
Speaker 1: Probably I guess the key is that there any shows I want to watch.

145
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:55,560
Speaker 0: You know, they didn't actually say which shows you know, at least they didn't say finally which shows that they're gonna show.

146
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,020
Speaker 1: I mean to tie into today's episode a bit.

147
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,800
Speaker 1: I mean, I there are TV shows that are good.

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,626
Speaker 1: I mean, I like Arrested Development freaks and geeks was cool all that but I like The Simpsons Yeah, but here's the thing.

149
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:15,140
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna watch them on TV and I really don't want to download them because honestly Netflix I can just get the whole DVD season whatever and just watch it at my leisure.

150
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,700
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing is that you can already torrent all these things, right?

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,840
Speaker 0: So what's the reason to get them on iTunes with commercials instead of torrenting them?

152
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:38,299
Speaker 0: They're gonna have to like put the episodes out faster than the torrents come out or higher quality than the torrents or The torrents are already DVD quality easy to find very fast.

153
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:39,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're gonna free.

154
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:44,040
Speaker 0: they're gonna have to like put them out before the episodes are on TV or something or else.

155
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,839
Speaker 0: What's what's gonna be the point of this?

156
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,660
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean their entire like all of like all the Family Guy torrents just out there everywhere.

157
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,310
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, you know, we.

158
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,419
Speaker 0: we say this, you know, what's the point this?

159
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:56,780
Speaker 0: torrents.

160
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,640
Speaker 0: But they're selling the episodes with no commercials for a few dollars and people are buying those.

161
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,605
Speaker 0: You know, not everyone.

162
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,573
Speaker 0: people are still torrenting but people are buying them.

163
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:08,980
Speaker 0: So and those have no commercials.

164
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,430
Speaker 0: So these have fewer commercials than on TV.

165
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,519
Speaker 0: Someone's gonna be downloading for free.

166
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,939
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people are gonna be downloading for free.

167
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:17,925
Speaker 0: It's just I don't know.

168
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,994
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we'll see what comes of it.

169
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:21,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see but see.

170
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,595
Speaker 0: now Here's the thing is for someone like me who doesn't watch television.

171
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,967
Speaker 1: if there's a show Let me guess you don't watch television.

172
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,015
Speaker 1: Yep, so you don't watch television.

173
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:37,357
Speaker 0: if they come out, you know I don't go around looking for torrents of shows because you know, that's for anime.

174
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:45,350
Speaker 0: I do but brother stuff No, not really, but if a show is free on iTunes and I'm bored I'll download the first episode and like skim through it.

175
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good point, you know, so I might I mean honestly That's the only way we found out about shows now like Arrested Development, which even you admit it was enjoyable.

176
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:53,603
Speaker 0: It's all right.

177
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:54,024
Speaker 1: Now.

178
00:11:54,064 --> 00:12:00,422
Speaker 1: The thing is I never would have even thought to see this evil evil like.

179
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:06,363
Speaker 1: the show would have just been completely off my radar, but a friend of ours really liked it and Brought it over.

180
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,951
Speaker 1: me watched on DVD and I discovered that.

181
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,808
Speaker 1: oh, it's actually really funny and cool But I never would have found that out on my own.

182
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:12,551
Speaker 0: Yep.

183
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:19,859
Speaker 1: Now if I could just download random shows for free I think I would watch now that Scott mentions it at least one episode of anything before I knocked it.

184
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:24,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, so plus now when the other thing is because I don't watch TV.

185
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:25,736
Speaker 0: Yeah.

186
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't watch TV, right?

187
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,109
Speaker 0: I don't know what people talk about.

188
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,079
Speaker 0: like people say stuff and I go what the hell you mean.

189
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,908
Speaker 1: Actually, what's scary is Pete my people at my work.

190
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:41,449
Speaker 1: They don't even talk about the TV shows but often they'll ask Hey, did you see that ad for blah blah blah?

191
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:44,320
Speaker 1: Whoa, and then they talk about the funny ad they saw.

192
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:57,337
Speaker 0: Wow Yep, but yeah Now maybe I can like in my spare time between listening to podcasts I can watch an episode of this or episode of that and at least I won't watch more.

193
00:12:57,398 --> 00:13:04,127
Speaker 0: if I don't like it I won't watch any more episodes, but when someone's talking about something I'll be like, oh I know what you're talking about.

194
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:14,126
Speaker 0: And then I'll be able to insult them more if it was crap and Nod my head if it was something good you know As Opposed to going huh?

195
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:14,908
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

196
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,976
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

197
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,060
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

198
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,266
Speaker 1: Are you talking to talking about?

199
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, so fucking steaks on a plane.

200
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:29,679
Speaker 0: So I think it's it's generally good for them to break their TV shows into the non TV watching people like me.

201
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:35,815
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see how quickly the advertisers get pissed when they realize that people will just fast-forward through the ads.

202
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:42,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think ABC might have a good racket going because it'll be great for us and be great for ABC.

203
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:43,560
Speaker 0: This would be bad for advertisers.

204
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:50,948
Speaker 0: They won't know it because they have no way of knowing even now with television How many people buy their stuff because of ads.

205
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:57,832
Speaker 1: in fact, not only that but see before the internet and the whole I mean there was a time when there weren't pop-up ads on the internet.

206
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:03,939
Speaker 1: for all you young ins who don't realize this There was a time when if you saw an ad on the internet was like whoa an ad.

207
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:06,613
Speaker 1: This site must be like professional.

208
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,820
Speaker 1: they've got ads.

209
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,612
Speaker 0: Or this site is some drekkie people trying to make money.

210
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:22,000
Speaker 1: I'm not going to them, but when the internet came I mean before the internet Advertisers didn't really question that their ads were effective and there was really no real evidence as to how effective ads really were.

211
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:22,924
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:31,160
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of the companies would pull out statistics, but Future recent studies have shown that a lot of those statistics were just made up or not entirely true?

213
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:32,613
Speaker 0: There is no.

214
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:40,655
Speaker 0: I mean We're pretty sure that when coke runs a giant ad campaign that it somehow gets people to buy more coke But there is no 100% sure evidence.

215
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:49,308
Speaker 0: I mean for all we know coke could just stop advertising altogether and close their advertising division entirely and The same amount of coke would still get sold.

216
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,446
Speaker 1: that we don't you know, so when the internet came They had ads.

217
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:57,320
Speaker 1: the thing is you could click on an ad and they could count how many people clicked on it.

218
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:05,099
Speaker 1: So the advertisers suddenly said hey Now we can see exactly who how many people are clicking on an ad we'll know exactly how effective that ad is.

219
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:08,649
Speaker 1: and Then they discovered that almost no one clicked on ads.

220
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:13,626
Speaker 1: Yep, and then they discovered that Oh People just fast-forward through ads.

221
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,810
Speaker 1: Oh people don't watch it.

222
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,632
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

223
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,097
Speaker 0: Well, except for your co-workers.

224
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:23,370
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so I don't know about that, but at least Younger people not to discriminate.

225
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,540
Speaker 1: but younger people seem to be more ad resistant.

226
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:31,220
Speaker 1: Here's the other thing though is except little kids who will buy anything that's shown to them on TV, of course.

227
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:41,503
Speaker 0: But like I remember some funny ads from when I did watch TV Like I remember the the classic one was the the Budweiser wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube, man Yeah, that kind of thing.

228
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,772
Speaker 0: But I remember those Budweiser frogs were a big deal.

229
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, or remember was?

230
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,070
Speaker 0: I think so.

231
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,440
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of guys going.

232
00:15:51,864 --> 00:16:00,129
Speaker 0: I also think I also remember that the bud ice when but ice was still around and they had that penguin and the penguin would Say do be do be do.

233
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,780
Speaker 1: Oh god that brought back memories of middle school.

234
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I remember that but I never drink.

235
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:07,675
Speaker 0: I don't drink alcohol.

236
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,100
Speaker 0: So I guess there I didn't work.

237
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:14,240
Speaker 0: I mean they just they gave me something to remember and talk about but they didn't sell me anything.

238
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,658
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the funny part there is that I remember the doobie-doo-doo penguin, but I had no idea.

239
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:23,220
Speaker 1: I had no idea what product they were selling until you said it was some kind of beer.

240
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,103
Speaker 0: It was but ice.

241
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:25,648
Speaker 0: it no longer exists.

242
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:26,311
Speaker 0: Oh good.

243
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,980
Speaker 0: They had you know, they were trying to add a new type of Budweiser.

244
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,422
Speaker 0: That was and I don't know All right.

245
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:33,305
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna.

246
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,810
Speaker 0: you can't ask me cuz I never drank it.

247
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,960
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my feelings on American beer.

248
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,028
Speaker 1: There's no beer in America, but he likes an all beer.

249
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,656
Speaker 0: the same tastes bad makes you drunk.

250
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:51,719
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh Ladies That's what it's about.

251
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,593
Speaker 1: So we normally don't report on actual real news in the world.

252
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,380
Speaker 0: Well, we have actual real news.

253
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,606
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean it came up because it's.

254
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:12,022
Speaker 1: I saw it online out of the blue because I actually read your real news and if we Wanted we could probably do a real like political news show instead of geek nights and have just as much to talk about because we're Opinionated.

255
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:14,311
Speaker 0: yeah, I read Google News, but that's about it.

256
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,618
Speaker 0: You know, I try to get the big things But I don't really care about all the other crap.

257
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:26,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I read Google News But I read it fairly thoroughly and my custom Google News page has like 20 categories in it Just like catching various types of stories.

258
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:34,180
Speaker 0: I know I just like Eliminated the health category and I added and the and the famous people category and I added like four categories at the bottom.

259
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,103
Speaker 1: Well, I have story.

260
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:39,436
Speaker 1: I have categories likes and nerdiness like this and this and this or this.

261
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:42,808
Speaker 1: not this not this not this And usually there's not even a story in there.

262
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:45,096
Speaker 1: I'm just it's I'm waiting in case there's a story about it.

263
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:59,036
Speaker 1: So I'll know Wow Okay, but anyway this story I guess it fits into geekery bit partly because of what it's about but to which is something that really Kind of bothered me and I really think this sort of thing needs to get more press.

264
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:07,172
Speaker 1: but in Kenya And this is very recent and I think it hit Boeing Boeing or something Now Kenya is not like one of those backwater African countries.

265
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:11,890
Speaker 0: It's sort of you know, it's a pretty good place, you know It's not scary this there's no genocide.

266
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,874
Speaker 0: I know of though

267
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:25,158
Speaker 1: when I lived in Michigan way back when I was in elementary school and I was a Cub Scout I had a friend who had come from Kenya And I remember him telling me that Kenya was a horrible place and that he never wanted to return.

268
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,322
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Well, it's not.

269
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,631
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's fantastic.

270
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:38,411
Speaker 0: Yeah far from it, but it's not like Rhodesia Darfur and What's the other place Rwanda, you know, it's.

271
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,577
Speaker 0: it's like one of those step.

272
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:42,081
Speaker 0: it's it's a it's It's.

273
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:45,999
Speaker 0: it's a little bit less than Nigeria where all the scammers come from.

274
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:50,060
Speaker 1: Now I'm curious as to where you're getting this knowledge as to how nice Kenya is.

275
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,485
Speaker 1: I mean, do you know anything about Kenya?

276
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,493
Speaker 0: No, this is entirely based on the internet.

277
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:54,437
Speaker 0: So don't believe anything.

278
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:56,165
Speaker 1: I say Scott Where is Kenya?

279
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:02,659
Speaker 1: It's in the middle of Africa in the middle a Little bit north a little bit south dead center.

280
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,978
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway, hold on I'm getting so.

281
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:13,904
Speaker 0: so in Kenya it's on the it's on the right under next to Somalia I think under Ethiopia.

282
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:14,790
Speaker 0: All right.

283
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:25,109
Speaker 1: So anyway, what happened was in Kenya the newspapers and the media had been reporting on a lot of government corruption Because the government is fairly corrupt and they've been reporting on it.

284
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:31,480
Speaker 0: Well, our government that our newspapers don't report when our governments corrupt Well, maybe that's because it would fill the newspaper every day.

285
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,263
Speaker 0: Hahaha.

286
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:32,584
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:38,063
Speaker 1: So anyway, and It looks like some government officials lost an election as a result of this.

288
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:41,678
Speaker 1: at least they blame the loss of the election on This bad press.

289
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,255
Speaker 1: Ooh So what did the government do?

290
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:48,230
Speaker 1: they ordered the police to raid all these newspapers?

291
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,089
Speaker 1: Burn all their newspapers destroy their printing presses arrest all the reporters and destroy everything.

292
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,527
Speaker 0: Wow now how?

293
00:19:58,492 --> 00:19:58,612
Speaker 1: Now?

294
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,322
Speaker 1: now here's the scary thing trying to hide it.

295
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:00,925
Speaker 0: What the hell?

296
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:11,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing I mean, I'm not gonna say I agree with it But this sort of thing happens from time to time in nations and usually it's kind of secret like the government will hire You know a mob to do it or something

297
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,582
Speaker 0: or the company will just go bankrupt.

298
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:16,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no no, here's a quote.

299
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,390
Speaker 1: This is from the Interior Security Minister John Michuki.

300
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:26,902
Speaker 1: He said quote in English if you rattle a snake You must be prepared to be bitten by it.

301
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:33,526
Speaker 1: and then in Swahili He said that this police raid was necessary to demonstrate state authority.

302
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:34,830
Speaker 1: It was a show of force.

303
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:37,069
Speaker 0: Well, they sure showed force.

304
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:42,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, police officers armed with ak-47 busted in said it was a raid without a warrant and then destroyed everything.

305
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,789
Speaker 0: How can you I mean?

306
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:51,514
Speaker 0: You you busted up a newspaper Because it was turning the people against you.

307
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:52,756
Speaker 0: So what do you do?

308
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:58,812
Speaker 0: you bust up the newspaper and To make more people turn against you and it's it's just like.

309
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,920
Speaker 0: how can you make more bad press?

310
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,407
Speaker 0: What you want to do is you want to?

311
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,860
Speaker 0: you want to lie and say no there is no corruption.

312
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:08,287
Speaker 0: Don't listen to that crazy lying newspaper.

313
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,411
Speaker 0: That's what you want to do.

314
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently seven ministers lost Elections were fired or something.

315
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,952
Speaker 1: I don't know all the details.

316
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:19,904
Speaker 1: I don't know much about Kenyan politics, but this Not only have.

317
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,620
Speaker 1: the reporters that were arrested are probably going to be tried and jailed.

318
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,057
Speaker 1: Wow Now I'd say why aren't the people up in arms about this, but who's gonna report on it?

319
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:29,779
Speaker 1: How are they gonna know?

320
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,320
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's other newspapers, but those are the newspapers aren't opposed to the government.

321
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:38,122
Speaker 1: They're you know, I guess they're tool newspapers or in the very least They're not gonna report on it.

322
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:38,322
Speaker 1: now.

323
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,690
Speaker 1: cuz let's see that newspaper reported on it and got burned down.

324
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:43,945
Speaker 1: I'll let it slide.

325
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,418
Speaker 0: Well, if they were badass real newspapers, they would.

326
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,965
Speaker 1: Newspapers left.

327
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,039
Speaker 0: they get their pirate newspapers out on the street.

328
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:57,780
Speaker 1: I mean, I it's funny I got to say it but Al Jazeera is one of the few news agencies left in this world that has balls.

329
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:00,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least according to that movie we watched.

330
00:22:00,934 --> 00:22:01,135
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,120
Speaker 1: Well, I've read more about him.

332
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,083
Speaker 1: I mean for what?

333
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:07,155
Speaker 1: they're not any more biased than the Western media are in my opinion.

334
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:12,976
Speaker 1: They're just biased in a different direction Yep, but at least I mean they'll stand there in the war zone and just take pictures of it.

335
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:21,757
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so things of the day.

336
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:28,310
Speaker 1: my thing was kind of obscure when I found it But it exploded all over the internet before we did the episode tonight.

337
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,830
Speaker 0: I don't even know how that happened.

338
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:36,184
Speaker 0: usually this is the kind of thing you see on like one website in the back corner like Here's a crazy old video game.

339
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:36,850
Speaker 0: No one ever got.

340
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:45,160
Speaker 1: I mean I saw it because someone linked to it from a thread about something else in FARC and Then now it's on Boeing Boeing.

341
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:46,390
Speaker 1: It's on slash dot is everywhere.

342
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:54,095
Speaker 1: But I swear to you all it was a unique not easy to find thing of the day when I said something about it When I found it, but anyway,

343
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:59,296
Speaker 0: I found it this morning and then by the afternoon it was everywhere and I was like, oh wow Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

344
00:22:59,497 --> 00:23:07,568
Speaker 1: But anyway Penn and Teller of the famous, you know Penn and Teller show and bullshit and all that they're awesome magic show and they're also awesome skeptics.

345
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:11,248
Speaker 1: Yep Well, they have this video game that they made a long time ago.

346
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:13,054
Speaker 0: For what system?

347
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:15,742
Speaker 0: the Sega CD and what other system?

348
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,146
Speaker 1: it was for another system.

349
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,349
Speaker 0: I think they said something about the 3do.

350
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,095
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that helps.

351
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, awesome.

352
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:28,841
Speaker 1: So systems that no one had anyway and Apparently the game is one of those meta games where it's.

353
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,410
Speaker 1: it's a stupid funny game, but it's not really a game.

354
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:33,882
Speaker 1: I mean, here's an example of this game.

355
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:43,390
Speaker 1: I Someone said that apparently if you pause the game it forces you to watch like this two-minute movie That that's just dumb every time you try to unpause it to punish you or something.

356
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:48,028
Speaker 0: well, that's kind of crazy, but actually the Sega CD was all about that.

357
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:57,230
Speaker 0: because The Sega CD was you still had a 16-bit Sega Genesis, but you had six hundred and forty megabytes of software.

358
00:23:57,671 --> 00:24:01,744
Speaker 0: So what they did is they filled it up with videos and CD audio.

359
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:02,506
Speaker 1: I remember playing.

360
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:03,830
Speaker 1: I think it was called sewer rats.

361
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:04,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

362
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:08,110
Speaker 0: that was one of these launch games I think because I remember that it came out.

363
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:15,181
Speaker 1: I went to funko land because I wanted to try this game and It was probably the worst game I've ever actually played.

364
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:17,007
Speaker 0: I was our worst game.

365
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:19,337
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way This is one of those mountain bike.

366
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:19,759
Speaker 0: Whatever.

367
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:22,090
Speaker 1: I was gonna say it's a lot like that mountain biking.

368
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:30,585
Speaker 1: Oh my god in that I could not control where I was going and I wasn't sure if any buttons I was hitting at anything to do with my success in the game.

369
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,649
Speaker 1: Wow It's a lot like that, but the Sega CD.

370
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:42,700
Speaker 0: It's like if they had the space to store videos and had the space to put CD quality audio like actual Full audio like a CD.

371
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it was a CD So one of the one of the game.

372
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:59,170
Speaker 0: well you can continue yeah, but the games themselves Since they concentrated mostly on the video and the audio Were a lot worse than Sega Genesis games and they really didn't have the ability to be much better.

373
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:04,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was the Sherlock Holmes game where it was basically just you watch movies Mm-hmm.

374
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:16,402
Speaker 1: But anyway this Penn and Teller game It's I guess it's claim to fame is that one part of it is called desert ride or desert bus And it was like part of this very simulator and they talked about how realistic it is.

375
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:25,086
Speaker 1: and basically it simulates you driving a bus Through the deserts of Nevada for eight hours and then eight hours back.

376
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:28,256
Speaker 1: All right You do it in real time.

377
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:29,843
Speaker 1: It literally takes eight hours.

378
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,718
Speaker 0: and then eight hours How does can you save?

379
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,147
Speaker 1: no, I don't think so.

380
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:34,469
Speaker 1: I don't know.

381
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:41,669
Speaker 1: all I know is it's a straight road in the Nevada desert and Apparently every now and then you'll see a cactus go by and that's it.

382
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:47,066
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'll just you know, put something on the a button and walk away.

383
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:57,789
Speaker 1: Oh So, uh, apparently the bus drifts to the rights and If you don't keep staring it back to the left, it'll crash and you'll lose.

384
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:04,030
Speaker 0: So if you crash you have to start over again at the beginning of the eight hours, I believe that's the case.

385
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:07,369
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, so who does anyone actually completed this?

386
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:08,515
Speaker 1: I don't know.

387
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:11,550
Speaker 0: Is there anything after this eight-hour bus drive in the game?

388
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:18,409
Speaker 1: The rumor out there is that if you completed it, you got one point toward completing the game whatever that meant.

389
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:22,864
Speaker 0: Well, so you could kind of choose things to do and get points.

390
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:24,309
Speaker 1: I guess I think the game.

391
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,116
Speaker 1: I mean I haven't played it.

392
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,710
Speaker 1: I'm just going off of what I've read in the car.

393
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,325
Speaker 0: I downloaded it, but I have to.

394
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:28,749
Speaker 0: I need it.

395
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,483
Speaker 0: I either need a Sega CD or I need a Sega CD emulator.

396
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:38,724
Speaker 1: It seems that it's a lot like The old Monty Python games where you can't just do a whole bunch of random stuff.

397
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,861
Speaker 1: Oh Those that's my best guess.

398
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,209
Speaker 0: I have one of those is pretty good.

399
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:48,061
Speaker 1: Once we get this game going and we figure out how to play it We're gonna play it and we'll report back.

400
00:26:48,504 --> 00:26:48,926
Speaker 0: Wow.

401
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:49,590
Speaker 0: Okay, it's crazy.

402
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,776
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day.

403
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:56,050
Speaker 0: a lot of people have a little trouble waking up in the morning.

404
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,166
Speaker 0: I mean, I know I'm guilty of wake up turn off the alarm sleep wake up too late.

405
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:06,752
Speaker 1: I did that today In fact, I woke up thinking well, first of all, I stayed up to like three and then stay up till three Don't ask.

406
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:12,090
Speaker 1: so then I I I decide all right, it's supposed to snow tomorrow supposed to snow a hell of a lot.

407
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,315
Speaker 1: I'll wake up at seven.

408
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,425
Speaker 1: I'll see the snow and I'll just go back to bed.

409
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:17,058
Speaker 1: I wake up at seven I look out the window.

410
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:17,829
Speaker 1: There's no snow.

411
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,102
Speaker 0: Yeah I always I thought the same thing and I was like there's no snow.

412
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:23,190
Speaker 0: but I could see the snow was gonna be there soon.

413
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,676
Speaker 0: And I said, you know what?

414
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:25,841
Speaker 0: I have to drive home.

415
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,730
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna delay myself an hour.

416
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:41,202
Speaker 0: I'll wait an extra hour before I leave the house and Good enough by the Time the hour was over there was some snow and I said yup if I were to go to work I would get there just fine, but getting home would suck ass.

417
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:42,085
Speaker 0: so I didn't go.

418
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:46,285
Speaker 1: now me I looked out the window and laid back in bed thinking god damn it.

419
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,169
Speaker 0: God damn it.

420
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:59,810
Speaker 1: Now I got to go to work and then I fell asleep and I woke up two hours later Awesome, and then I drove to work in the snow because while you know snow whatever I live like ten minutes away from my job.

421
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I live ten minutes, I would have gone to work as soon as I woke up.

422
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:02,925
Speaker 0: Just whoop.

423
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:04,123
Speaker 0: No question Yeah.

424
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,050
Speaker 1: So I got there to find that no one else came to work and I did a little work and all my meetings were canceled.

425
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,572
Speaker 1: Then I came home.

426
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:10,983
Speaker 1: Like I said earlier by the time I tried to drive home.

427
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:16,249
Speaker 0: It had snowed a hell of a lot Yep, so I was correct in my assessment of not going to work.

428
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:29,946
Speaker 0: But the point is is that if you have this problem where you wake up and your alarm wakes you up but then you turn it off and you fall back to sleep and you're screwed and You can't seem to get into the habit of using the snooze button to you know,

429
00:28:30,026 --> 00:28:30,970
Speaker 1: the snooze button is evil.

430
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't use it.

431
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:33,445
Speaker 1: It'll just make your life miserable.

432
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:43,689
Speaker 0: actually lately I've been using the snooze button because I've never used it before in my life and now I can use it and it works Because I've never used it before but as soon as it stops working, I'm gonna stop using it.

433
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,490
Speaker 0: That way I can keep its effectiveness.

434
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:47,134
Speaker 1: What effectiveness?

435
00:28:47,174 --> 00:28:48,299
Speaker 1: all I find is I lay bed.

436
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,046
Speaker 1: I wake up and I'm at there.

437
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:51,090
Speaker 1: either two states either.

438
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:52,557
Speaker 1: Well, I guess three states.

439
00:28:52,838 --> 00:28:54,245
Speaker 1: I want to get up and I can get up.

440
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,787
Speaker 1: I Don't want to get up, but I can get up.

441
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:00,049
Speaker 1: I neither want to get up and I don't want to get up and I can't get up.

442
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:05,562
Speaker 0: Well, you see when I wake up I usually get up enough and then I turn.

443
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:13,859
Speaker 0: I used to turn the alarm off and Then I would lay back down sometimes if I didn't get up right away and then cuz the alarm wouldn't go off again I was done.

444
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:14,449
Speaker 0: forget it.

445
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:15,212
Speaker 0: Yeah I lose.

446
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:28,409
Speaker 1: see most people use the snooze button as they're laying there and the alarm goes off and they hit it and then they Think all right I can sleep for nine more minutes and then I'll get up and then they hit it and then they sleep for nine more minutes And then they hit it and then they sleep for nine more minutes and then an hour goes by.

447
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:46,279
Speaker 0: Oh, no See what I do is when I hear when I be alarm goes off my brain says I'm up I'm going but sometimes I'm gonna lay back and if I start to lay back I hit the snooze button and that way You know in ten minutes I get another shot at it and I've never done it more than twice Like by the second try on this news, I'm always up.

448
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:49,750
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is people have this problem.

449
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:51,930
Speaker 0: There are a lot of solutions to this problem.

450
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:55,322
Speaker 0: There is one person who made something called clockey.

451
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,229
Speaker 1: Oh, is that the clock that jumps off your?

452
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:05,538
Speaker 0: It's like runs around the clock with carpet and wheels and it and when the alarm goes off it zips around the room and finds A hiding space and it makes a loud noise.

453
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:07,807
Speaker 0: You have to go and find it and there's another one.

454
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:08,530
Speaker 0: It's a helicopter.

455
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:13,869
Speaker 0: So as soon as the alarm goes off this little helicopter takes off and flies around your room when you have to go get it.

456
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:17,210
Speaker 0: But there is one today that I thought was really good.

457
00:30:18,552 --> 00:30:27,549
Speaker 0: at the top of the clock are for puzzle pieces and One of them is part of the clock, but the other three when the alarm goes off, you know, how perfection goes.

458
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:38,649
Speaker 0: pop it just pops these puzzle pieces out and they fly around the room and you have to go collect them and Put them back into the slots in the correct, you know fashion in order to get the alarm to shut up.

459
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,448
Speaker 0: So you're guaranteed to get up if the alarm is loud enough because I haven't heard it.

460
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:56,250
Speaker 0: obviously This thing is guaranteed to get you up because there's no way that you can find those puzzle pieces wherever they went and Put them back correctly in the top of the clock without being awake.

461
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:04,870
Speaker 1: See I've had friends who would put the alarm clock across the room and they would quite literally get up walk over turn the alarm Off walk back to the bed and fall asleep without even remembering.

462
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:17,630
Speaker 0: I found the distance doesn't really help so much unless it's a really long distance and I like to have it close because that way I can look at it more easily, you know Yeah, because you can't see very far with your eyes like one half a millimeter open.

463
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:28,286
Speaker 1: I love that time if you if you wake up in the middle of the night You don't expect to and you're not fully awake, but your eyes are working and you know You kind of stare at the clock, but you can't figure out what those symbols mean.

464
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've had that.

465
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:36,317
Speaker 0: Or like you see the time and you know the numbers of the time, but you don't know the time You don't know what that means.

466
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:40,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not really quite fully Digesting the numbers.

467
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:41,155
Speaker 1: Yep.

468
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,909
Speaker 1: The worst is when you wake up at a time that you didn't expect to wake up.

469
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:50,884
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah figure out what time it really, you know Like you wake up and it says like three something and you're like you're staring at like.

470
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,250
Speaker 1: did I sleep till three?

471
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,238
Speaker 1: Or did I wake up at three?

472
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,285
Speaker 0: Yeah stuff like that.

473
00:31:55,305 --> 00:32:04,290
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah One time I actually woke up at like seven o'clock at night And I thought it was seven in the morning and that I had accidentally slept through the previous day.

474
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:20,123
Speaker 0: I can always tell the story about how I went to Washington DC for a week on a trip in eighth grade And I came back and I went to sleep and I woke up in the morning and I you know ate breakfast and whatnot and then I went back to sleep because I was so tired.

475
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:32,668
Speaker 0: then I woke up again and my family was Gone and I thought I thought that I had slept that through the second night into the next day and I ate breakfast again When it was actually just the afternoon of that day.

476
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:40,630
Speaker 1: So wasn't our friend Greg who stayed up for like 18 hours playing Final Fantasy and thought it was like night?

477
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,835
Speaker 1: Then you thought it was morning.

478
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:44,446
Speaker 1: It was actually the next night or I forget that story.

479
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:45,189
Speaker 0: I don't know.

480
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:46,537
Speaker 0: It happens all the time.

481
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:48,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully the puzzle clock will save you

482
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:54,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least for a month and then your brain your muscle memory You'll figure out how to find the pieces put them together and put you back to sleep,

483
00:32:55,089 --> 00:33:03,534
Speaker 0: dude If you can do that we got to upgrade to like the eight piece puzzle and then eventually we'll have like a 5,000 piece jigsaw puzzle and you'll be just like Put it right back to you.

484
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:06,285
Speaker 1: If only I could train myself to wake up and do my job.

485
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:09,196
Speaker 0: for me, dude that would be the best like an alarm clock.

486
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:14,509
Speaker 0: that like has your job done for you and it undoes your job and then you Have to do it and then you can go back to bed.

487
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:16,650
Speaker 1: I could do I could technically do that.

488
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:22,230
Speaker 1: I could just set up a bash script that would break a random thing on my computer and make a noise until I fix it.

489
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:25,793
Speaker 1: hmm, I Mean my job's IT.

490
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,058
Speaker 1: So that's the closest thing I could do.

491
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might damage your computer though, like delete a file.

492
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:36,087
Speaker 1: Oops Yeah, I can imagine an alarm blaring at 6 in the morning and I'm trying to recreate like my NTP cough.

493
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:47,596
Speaker 0: Oh great Yeah, that's not a that's a little going too far All right, so anyway we're likely said wait, I just had thought okay What if a doctor did that?

494
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:49,869
Speaker 0: it like it like hurts someone and you have to heal them?

495
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,219
Speaker 1: That's uh silly.

496
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,295
Speaker 1: yeah, you're like Gabe With his allergies.

497
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,319
Speaker 0: I thought of a great one.

498
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,424
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make this you ready?

499
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:00,610
Speaker 1: All right, we'll see if you make it.

500
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,072
Speaker 0: Check it out.

501
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,279
Speaker 1: We'll see if you're a shit talker.

502
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:04,210
Speaker 0: We'll see if I'm probably gonna be a shit.

503
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:05,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that all right, let's hear it.

504
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,609
Speaker 0: So you get a Gameboy or something and the alarm goes off.

505
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:11,404
Speaker 0: Won't shut up until you beat a level or something.

506
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,935
Speaker 0: Ah Yes has an alarm.

507
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:17,790
Speaker 1: Maybe we can hook that up, you know, if we get a flash card or a dev kit or something.

508
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:22,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you wake up, you know, the DS is making a shit ton of noise cuz that's thinking it loud.

509
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:24,580
Speaker 0: You know whose cell phone could do this to?

510
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:34,170
Speaker 0: actually because they have alarms in video games And then there's like a hard video game thing and until you do it, it won't shut up beat cut man in Mega Man 1.

511
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that kind of thing are you really good?

512
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:44,065
Speaker 0: or like beat 1-1 in Mario and then every day you get a different Mario Level or even just a short one like a WarioWare game, dude That would be great cuz freakin.

513
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:54,909
Speaker 0: you know you could beat a video game like that where if you had to do a level every morning or Like you had to do one level of Tetris every morning and it got harder every single day until you huh?

514
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:57,880
Speaker 1: Though if the game were Final Fantasy Tactics, I'd kill myself.

515
00:34:58,302 --> 00:34:58,523
Speaker 0: Yeah.

516
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,608
Speaker 0: Well, we'll talk about that next.

517
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:06,730
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah Or actually you could train that in with you know, the there's those train your brain games there come over here.

518
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:08,569
Speaker 0: I think they're coming over real soon.

519
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I see I mean there's a huge market for that especially for like older people who want you know It's train their brain.

520
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:14,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually one.

521
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,430
Speaker 0: when you actually see what these puzzles are I don't think we're gonna be too interested in them.

522
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,207
Speaker 1: No, we're not but other people will.

523
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:24,030
Speaker 1: yeah But I could see games like that for people like us in in the future.

524
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,680
Speaker 1: Like I'd love to see a DS game.

525
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,029
Speaker 1: That was you know learn Japanese Hmm or yeah something like that.

526
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:34,885
Speaker 1: but imagine if you had to wake up in the morning and like say you're doing the learn Japanese one.

527
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:38,324
Speaker 1: you wake up and your DS is making noise and you have to like.

528
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:39,290
Speaker 1: it shows you a word.

529
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,587
Speaker 1: You have to write it in hiragana in order to make it shut up.

530
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,373
Speaker 0: You know we should do.

531
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:48,609
Speaker 0: we should make a computer program for the PC or whatever called like morning exercises and you can like.

532
00:35:49,070 --> 00:36:01,954
Speaker 0: they will sell different expansions for different kinds of exercises and That way you can force yourself every morning to do certain things and you can program in how many minutes you want to spend doing it Your morning routine.

533
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:10,386
Speaker 0: so you can be like I want to spend five minutes every morning improving my you know puzzle solving skills in this kind of puzzle.

534
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:21,149
Speaker 0: and then maybe you're you don't get one of those chess puzzles or a word search or a crossword and It'll you know make you spend five minutes doing crossword every morning and you'll get better and better at it.

535
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,458
Speaker 1: You know it's not a bad idea, and it won't shut.

536
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:27,916
Speaker 0: and the thing is it won't shut up until you do it because you know That's what gets you up in the morning.

537
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,650
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing we could actually do in our spare time.

538
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:33,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should do it now.

539
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:35,012
Speaker 1: now all you listeners out there Just heard this.

540
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:39,345
Speaker 1: now this illustrates a good point about Scott and I about shit talking.

541
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:42,215
Speaker 1: yeah that we have Conversations like that.

542
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:45,290
Speaker 1: we probably had four or five of them today, and we forget about them immediately.

543
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:50,176
Speaker 1: But now because we're in front of these microphones all of you out there Just heard our shit talking.

544
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:52,406
Speaker 1: so you can call us on it when we don't do this.

545
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:54,785
Speaker 1: yep But I think we should try to do it.

546
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:55,571
Speaker 0: Let's.

547
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,301
Speaker 0: I think the DS is or a cell phone is really the bell.

548
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:58,903
Speaker 1: consider this.

549
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,870
Speaker 1: we can't get a dev kit from Nintendo Just because we're not a company.

550
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,856
Speaker 1: We don't have any established.

551
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:05,250
Speaker 0: when you get one of those little flash cart DS thing is a lot of people.

552
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:06,967
Speaker 0: There's already Linux running on the damn things.

553
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,961
Speaker 1: yeah But say we made a demo of this game on the PC.

554
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:14,289
Speaker 1: then we went to Nintendo and said hey Look at this we could do that for the DS.

555
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,160
Speaker 1: They give us a dev kit and and and will.

556
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,685
Speaker 1: well you can have all the profit whatever.

557
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:21,110
Speaker 1: we just want to make these games.

558
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:23,157
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm let's go for it.

559
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:23,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

560
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,444
Speaker 1: We'll see if we're shit talkers.

561
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:28,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh wait I think I see something coming out of your mouth.

562
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:32,167
Speaker 0: Oh It smells like poo.

563
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,689
Speaker 1: Hopefully Sony will send us some Krispy Kremes.

564
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:43,670
Speaker 1: Alright, so we've gone long on just about everything else, but that's fine because we did that on purpose.

565
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, partly because our topic today yesterday.

566
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:46,999
Speaker 1: We thought oh, it's great.

567
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:50,628
Speaker 1: We'll talk about terrible movies, then we realized don't have much to say about him.

568
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:57,436
Speaker 0: well Let's say what we got to say about terrible movies now alright, so uh Speed 2 is a bad movie.

569
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:07,790
Speaker 0: yet, so the movie industry in America Lately has been making like the percentage of movies that are just no good has been increasing steadily.

570
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:13,821
Speaker 1: Garfield Catwoman kangaroo jack Snakes on a plane.

571
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:18,418
Speaker 1: yeah Garfield Deuce Bigelow European gigolo.

572
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:19,582
Speaker 0: Yeah a sequel.

573
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:20,445
Speaker 0: I think Bigelow.

574
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,930
Speaker 0: I come on what the hell.

575
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:23,588
Speaker 1: I think there was a speed three.

576
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:24,913
Speaker 0: What the hell.

577
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:25,395
Speaker 1: I know.

578
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:28,426
Speaker 0: Disney's making Bambi - what the hell isn't that.

579
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:29,370
Speaker 0: give me a VHS though?

580
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,092
Speaker 0: They make everything up.

581
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:34,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I saw like Aladdin 7 or whatever what I thought they're only three Aladdin's.

582
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,454
Speaker 1: I know there's at least three.

583
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,378
Speaker 1: I think there's a fourth one.

584
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:36,941
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

585
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,030
Speaker 1: I know they're at least 12 land before times.

586
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,392
Speaker 0: Oh my god See.

587
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,339
Speaker 0: I think what it is is they don't want it.

588
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:52,930
Speaker 0: movies are more and more expensive to make these days and They want to put less and less risk when they make them so they won't do anything outlandish.

589
00:38:53,573 --> 00:39:01,401
Speaker 0: So they end up doing the same crap over and over again because there are enough stupid people To pretty much pay for the crap like just barely now.

590
00:39:01,462 --> 00:39:08,329
Speaker 1: the reason we decided to talk about this is that now this The thing we're about to talk about has been around on the internet for a long time over a year.

591
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,135
Speaker 1: It's called snakes on a plane.

592
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:14,125
Speaker 1: and the basic story damn god damn motherfucking.

593
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:15,148
Speaker 1: snakes on a plane.

594
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:17,821
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's not a goddamn thing.

595
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:28,736
Speaker 1: You can do about it Alright, so to sum it up because you this is all over the internet if you haven't seen it by now I hate to say it, but if you don't know about snakes on a plane already I don't care how hip you are.

596
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:33,709
Speaker 1: You're not with the internet at least not as a Technorati kind of person.

597
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:37,945
Speaker 1: Now I'm not saying the snakes on a plane is a funny thing or a cool thing.

598
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:38,950
Speaker 1: it's actually a stupid thing.

599
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:39,854
Speaker 0: It's real stupid.

600
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:42,647
Speaker 0: I don't even think it's funny at all, but rim keeps saying it and it's kind of damn.

601
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:44,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's annoying.

602
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,658
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically this movie called snakes on a plane.

603
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:54,344
Speaker 1: apparently that was the working title and they were gonna name it something else later and The plot is basically to sum it up.

604
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:55,490
Speaker 1: There are snakes on a plane.

605
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,990
Speaker 1: Like really that's all there is to this movie.

606
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,270
Speaker 0: You know when he told me that I was like, oh that sounds like a scene in a movie.

607
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:09,394
Speaker 0: Maybe someone you know thought up a scene for a movie couldn't find a movie to put it in and just made a whole movie But just the scene.

608
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:14,169
Speaker 1: so apparently Samuel L. Jackson heard about this movie and was all about it.

609
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,135
Speaker 0: Wow, okay.

610
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,902
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what that guy's thinking.

611
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:20,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe he's having fun Maybe it's just.

612
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:25,607
Speaker 1: this is all just a scam and it's actually a big internet based promotional viral marketing kind of thing.

613
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:28,123
Speaker 0: I Hope it's all just a giant joke.

614
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:28,790
Speaker 0: That'd be hilarious.

615
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:34,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the movie doesn't actually come out knowing Hollywood, this is totally plausible.

616
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:34,890
Speaker 0: It's not even yeah.

617
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,847
Speaker 1: Well, it's in the IMDb and such and there are pictures from it and someone claimed to have seen it and reviewed it.

618
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,528
Speaker 1: Whoa Or saw like a pre advanced copy or something.

619
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:50,238
Speaker 0: Wow Just just well, you know Who is who are the people behind this stuff?

620
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,230
Speaker 0: thinking this up thinking it's a good idea and doing it?

621
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:54,337
Speaker 0: Who are these people?

622
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:56,089
Speaker 1: These are the same people who are making money?

623
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:59,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I point out that Garfield made money.

624
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:04,921
Speaker 1: Wow Garfield God That movie looked painful from the moment.

625
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,065
Speaker 1: I heard it was going to happen.

626
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,834
Speaker 0: I mean Garfield.

627
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:15,430
Speaker 0: the comic hasn't been funny in like over ten years ever and The the funniest Garfield thing ever was the Halloween cartoon special.

628
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:24,205
Speaker 0: Yes with the pirates the ghost pirates that tried to frickin kill Garfield and Odie Yep, and the best part was when they went up to houses and they weren't even like trick-or-treat.

629
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:24,908
Speaker 0: He was just like gimme.

630
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:29,182
Speaker 1: Yeah I should put that in Netflix and we'll watch it again.

631
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:29,845
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

632
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:30,066
Speaker 0: Yeah.

633
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,458
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean basically there.

634
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:34,745
Speaker 1: I mean there are good movies out there.

635
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:35,890
Speaker 1: I really want to see jarhead.

636
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,757
Speaker 1: I want to see a scanner darkly.

637
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,505
Speaker 1: I heard the corpse ride was amusing.

638
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:40,709
Speaker 0: I never heard any of these three.

639
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:50,277
Speaker 1: Yeah we were talking before the show and Scott was like no good movies come out in like ever and I was thinking back and I could think of a whole bunch of Good movies that I want to see or that I did see.

640
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:56,798
Speaker 0: I can't think of anything since like Narnia Lord of the Rings I don't want to see that the last Harry Potter movie.

641
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:57,881
Speaker 0: Don't want to see that either.

642
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:58,423
Speaker 1: You suck.

643
00:41:58,604 --> 00:41:59,868
Speaker 1: You suck serenity.

644
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:03,444
Speaker 1: Nope Yeah, anyway, well, I guess you don't watch movies either.

645
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:04,469
Speaker 1: mister doesn't watch TV.

646
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,860
Speaker 0: I watch movies when they're good or there's something to be excited about.

647
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,060
Speaker 0: like.

648
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,247
Speaker 0: I have cautious optimism.

649
00:42:10,307 --> 00:42:11,009
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

650
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,053
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

651
00:42:12,193 --> 00:42:14,843
Speaker 1: you poo-pooed every movie I mentioned and yeah, I was talking.

652
00:42:14,884 --> 00:42:16,530
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the V for Vendetta movie.

653
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,434
Speaker 0: That's coming real soon.

654
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:18,618
Speaker 0: I have cautious optimism.

655
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,686
Speaker 0: Okay that one but about all of them.

656
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:24,649
Speaker 0: all the other movies I even know I'm just like whatever Alright, but anyway.

657
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:29,590
Speaker 1: So we decided not to talk about that because it's basically Scott doesn't know about any movies coming out and doesn't like any of them.

658
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,413
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, I do.

659
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:34,067
Speaker 0: The point is is that we're just pissed off that Hollywood makes so many bad movies.

660
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:34,910
Speaker 0: What are they thinking?

661
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:35,552
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

662
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:36,296
Speaker 0: more importantly.

663
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:41,219
Speaker 1: It's more that we don't go to movie theaters anymore And we used to fairly often.

664
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:43,009
Speaker 1: the thing is the only.

665
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:55,195
Speaker 1: well Actually, I've been going to movie theaters more often lately, but not to see Hollywood movies but to see either serenity, which was the last movie I really wanted to see in a theater and All these anime movies.

666
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:59,479
Speaker 1: just cuz we live near New York City and I can go down and actually see Anime movies in the theater.

667
00:43:00,002 --> 00:43:05,383
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like it's so weird The last time I was in a movie theater at all.

668
00:43:05,644 --> 00:43:07,571
Speaker 0: I think was when he went to see episode 3.

669
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:07,853
Speaker 0: Maybe.

670
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:09,119
Speaker 1: no, we want to see steam boy.

671
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,827
Speaker 0: Was that after we saw episode 3?

672
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:14,903
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Yeah, and then so I guess he's a house house moving castle after that, right?

673
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,630
Speaker 1: I guess I lost track.

674
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,670
Speaker 1: But yeah, we saw all those in the theater, but we watch mostly anime movies in theaters.

675
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:27,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like some time around when I got to college, you know early on in college You have to see movies at like Tinseltown Semi-frequently.

676
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:32,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I note that other than one movie which we went to just because it was dumb most movies We went to were like we were.

677
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:39,230
Speaker 1: we were we were looking forward to see the movie Yeah, and we were looking forward to seeing it in the theater, which is a separate component.

678
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:45,870
Speaker 0: It was always like the matrix something or Lord of the Rings something or the Star Wars something.

679
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,069
Speaker 0: That's what we were going to see there.

680
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:56,686
Speaker 1: Now while there are a lot of movies that come out that I like or that I want to see here that I'm really interested In there hasn't been a movie since Serenity that I wanted to see in a theater or that way.

681
00:43:56,706 --> 00:43:59,308
Speaker 1: I even considered worth the money To go to a theater to see there.

682
00:43:59,631 --> 00:44:09,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there are plenty of movies and even though I don't find out about them some of them You know They go up high enough on the scale when I do find out about them to be like willing to watch on DVD.

683
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

684
00:44:10,638 --> 00:44:12,549
Speaker 0: But there aren't many.

685
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:18,470
Speaker 0: It's actually they're horrendously few that make me get up out of my chair and go to the movie theater.

686
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:19,343
Speaker 0: We must go now.

687
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:29,140
Speaker 1: The problem with that is that the movie industry seems to be blaming the fact that theaters are doing really poorly on Piracy and they blame it also in home theater.

688
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,210
Speaker 0: So like if you wouldn't get the home theater experience at home Why would they go to the theater the real theater?

689
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:42,766
Speaker 1: Yeah Not only that but the fact that theaters show ads before movies Angers me in a way that that it really shouldn't anger me as much as it does but it does.

690
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,682
Speaker 0: that's like the worst thing Ever like.

691
00:44:44,926 --> 00:44:46,255
Speaker 1: oh, no The worst thing ever was.

692
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:51,529
Speaker 1: I was at a movie and usually when the ads come on we crack jokes Loudly because you know their ads whatever.

693
00:44:52,252 --> 00:44:57,048
Speaker 1: Someone actually yelled at me to be quiet while I was making a joke about the ads before the movie.

694
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:58,975
Speaker 1: Wow I laughed so hard.

695
00:44:59,015 --> 00:44:59,859
Speaker 1: I about peed myself.

696
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:02,329
Speaker 1: I just didn't know it should have peed on them.

697
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:06,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was really the proper Social thing.

698
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,282
Speaker 0: didn't do anything else to say right there.

699
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:09,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I had to say something.

700
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever someone angers me in public I'll pee on them.

701
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:14,010
Speaker 1: That's quite a plan there.

702
00:45:14,653 --> 00:45:18,509
Speaker 0: You know what if I was just so badass that like no one could mess with me?

703
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:22,984
Speaker 0: That's like to someone who was so terrible like the worst person ever.

704
00:45:23,004 --> 00:45:24,689
Speaker 0: I totally just be on them.

705
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:25,939
Speaker 1: No No, there's a better thing.

706
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:27,090
Speaker 0: They'd be like, what are you gonna do about it?

707
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:37,976
Speaker 1: You go Horatio horn-blower on him you challenge him to a duel They cheat and yet you still beat them and then you've decide not to kill them because it's not worth it And only ruling wasn't illegal.

708
00:45:38,317 --> 00:45:42,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, then he'll try to kill you again, but captain Pele will shoot him from afar.

709
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,195
Speaker 0: Yep, that's fine.

710
00:45:43,356 --> 00:45:46,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just ruined the first episode Horatio horn-blower, but whatever no one cares.

711
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,754
Speaker 1: Here's your horn blowers fantastic.

712
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:51,385
Speaker 1: And if if you care that that was spoiled for you, you've already seen it.

713
00:45:51,947 --> 00:46:01,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, so The thing is is that it's not has nothing to do with me Like it's still very possible to get me excited about going to a movie theater.

714
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:10,721
Speaker 0: I mean, like I just said I'm like I'm slightly Optimistic about this V for Vendetta movie and if like some people decide to go and I've got nothing better to do I just might.

715
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:19,020
Speaker 1: yeah I just might go but definitely the movie theater experience has degraded in the last ten years to a point where It's almost impossible to make me want to go to a theater.

716
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Lord of the Rings was like woo.

717
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:25,546
Speaker 0: I'm going no matter what and if it came out now, I'd still feel the same way.

718
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:26,692
Speaker 0: I'd be like get up let's go.

719
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,304
Speaker 0: Lord of the Rings in the details goes goes go.

720
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:31,575
Speaker 0: but Now the movie quality.

721
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:33,200
Speaker 0: just know the ads.

722
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:35,668
Speaker 0: so, you know, just know the price.

723
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:42,527
Speaker 1: Yeah now at least in general I mean in New York City I can see a lot of cool movies in the theater and I'm all about that and I go to the.

724
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:43,857
Speaker 1: I used to go To the air fairly often.

725
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:45,006
Speaker 1: I haven't been to the city in a while.

726
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:46,276
Speaker 1: I've been busy But yeah, it's like.

727
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:58,789
Speaker 0: I remember we went down there once to see Anime movie in the in the little theater there and they had a little sign that was like at midnight We're showing Ghostbusters and I was like dude, if this was a theater the closer to my house I would be there in a second.

728
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:02,930
Speaker 1: Yep The problem is only the only cool theaters that are left are in the big cities.

729
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:06,309
Speaker 1: So most people they don't have the option to go to a cool theater like that.

730
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:13,570
Speaker 1: They either have the crap dollar theater that smells like pee or something like the dollar theater near us smells like pee really.

731
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like the nice dollar theater in Rochester.

732
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:16,842
Speaker 1: No, not like that one.

733
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:18,268
Speaker 0: We saw Powerpuff Girls for 25 cents.

734
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:25,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to say that was probably the best value per unit entertainment I have ever received in my life.

735
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:26,340
Speaker 0: We should get the DVD for that.

736
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,167
Speaker 0: I want to see it again.

737
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:28,934
Speaker 1: Yeah Everyone hasn't seen it.

738
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:31,100
Speaker 1: The Powerpuff's movie is good.

739
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all dark and yeah, like it sounds stupid that oh It's dark, but it actually is.

740
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,343
Speaker 1: it's serious, but it's also funny.

741
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:39,990
Speaker 0: I also like the TV show a lot, too.

742
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:41,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the TV show.

743
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,226
Speaker 1: I like Dexter's lab a lot.

744
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:43,051
Speaker 0: Oh, thanks We should.

745
00:47:43,332 --> 00:47:47,486
Speaker 0: I think all that stuff's on DVD like samurai jacks on DVD - you know what.

746
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:48,510
Speaker 1: I'll put it all in the queue.

747
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, go get Netflix the Cartoon Network.

748
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:55,909
Speaker 1: Yo, yeah, even though our queue is at the point where we're not gonna see anything We put in there for like two years.

749
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,622
Speaker 1: awesome See that's the other thing that's killing theaters.

750
00:48:00,642 --> 00:48:04,419
Speaker 1: in my opinion is that of course It's also I think gonna start hurting the anime industry a lot.

751
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,395
Speaker 1: and then I keep talking about Netflix and I swear they're not paying me.

752
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:13,529
Speaker 1: but Before if I wanted to see something I either had to go to the theater or I had to buy it.

753
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:14,869
Speaker 1: I had to go to Blockbuster.

754
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,895
Speaker 1: Blockbuster generally sucks.

755
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:19,143
Speaker 1: Yeah now Netflix.

756
00:48:19,524 --> 00:48:21,030
Speaker 1: I don't buy anything anymore.

757
00:48:21,473 --> 00:48:27,690
Speaker 1: I've bought maybe two DVDs in the last year Not counting the dollar DVDs when media play went out of business.

758
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:27,770
Speaker 1: I

759
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:36,382
Speaker 0: only buy DVDs if it's something that I got to own like I bought all of initial D or and I'm proud You know or if it's something so crazy like if

760
00:48:36,442 --> 00:48:38,369
Speaker 1: it's something that I'll watch again and again

761
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:39,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, or if it's

762
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:39,901
Speaker 1: something

763
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:40,627
Speaker 0: if to someone

764
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:44,759
Speaker 1: yes Give to someone else's key a lot of shows I want to own just cuz I want to lend them to other people

765
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,730
Speaker 0: or something that there won't be a chance to get like.

766
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,281
Speaker 0: I bought that macross box set.

767
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good buy.

768
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:52,144
Speaker 0: now You can't get that shit, even though I paid over $200 for it.

769
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:53,270
Speaker 0: You can't get that shit now.

770
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you got to buy the re-released one.

771
00:48:55,018 --> 00:49:01,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ADV re-release that's coming out now Probably for more money with a crummy dub on it.

772
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:02,790
Speaker 1: What do you care about the dub?

773
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:07,010
Speaker 0: I don't but that you know, the point is is that I got the real deal and I'm proud of it.

774
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:08,381
Speaker 0: I'm glad I got it.

775
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:09,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

776
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:17,174
Speaker 0: But the thing is is I don't think the deep that Netflix really is killing the theater because we stopped going to the theater long Before we got the net.

777
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:20,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, Netflix is definitely just like one more nail in an already sealed coffin.

778
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:21,572
Speaker 1: Yeah,

779
00:49:22,315 --> 00:49:28,409
Speaker 0: I mean, you know if it wasn't for that I would like if we suddenly got Netflix and stop going to theater I'd be like, oh obviously

780
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:39,410
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I I think back outside of anime movies and Just crazy like weird movies like when I saw that nothing lasts forever movie in like a cool indie theater.

781
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,465
Speaker 1: There's maybe two movies a year that I actually want to see in the theater at this point.

782
00:49:44,846 --> 00:49:46,392
Speaker 1: out of how many movies are released Every year.

783
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:48,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, how many movies released every year?

784
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:49,423
Speaker 1: a lot?

785
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:49,905
Speaker 0: Yeah.

786
00:49:49,925 --> 00:49:51,630
Speaker 0: Oh You know what?

787
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:57,435
Speaker 0: I think back in the day like I remember even when I was a little kid in the 80s Movies like were different.

788
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:01,870
Speaker 0: like you would go there and there would be an intermission and it was sort of fancy.

789
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:10,125
Speaker 1: I only had one intermission at a theater ever and that's when I went to see Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet there And they did the intermission because it's a frickin four-hour movie.

790
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:17,850
Speaker 0: when I was a little kid We would always go to the movie theater and there was always an intermission like until at some point in time Like intermissions just stopped happening.

791
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,569
Speaker 0: But every movie had one even the 90-minute movies it Wow.

792
00:50:21,092 --> 00:50:24,389
Speaker 0: And there would always be a cartoon at the beginning like a Bugs Bunny or something.

793
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,206
Speaker 1: Wow I never had cartoons at my theaters either.

794
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:37,534
Speaker 0: really I think if they bring the old style movie stuff back like take all the seats out of the movie theater and put like little tables with chairs around them like in little nightclub places and You know have little.

795
00:50:37,815 --> 00:50:41,006
Speaker 0: you know, you get coffee or whatever little cafe action in there, huh?

796
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:48,330
Speaker 0: And then You know bring the cartoon back before the movie get rid of the ads throw an intermission in there.

797
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:53,930
Speaker 0: You know, if you bring it back to the old school, you can still charge the same price that you do now.

798
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,574
Speaker 0: Well, actually a little bit more.

799
00:50:55,735 --> 00:51:09,290
Speaker 1: you may not know this but there's a growing market in adult movie theaters Not adult movie theaters, like you know, what used to be on time square 80s But apparently there's a lot of them in Texas now.

800
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:20,855
Speaker 1: I think it's a chain because people talk about on FARC all the time But basically they're theaters that one don't allow minors in period so no kids and They actually have ushers.

801
00:51:21,257 --> 00:51:24,370
Speaker 1: So like if someone's a jerk or talking or on their cell phone, they'll just kick them out.

802
00:51:25,192 --> 00:51:26,177
Speaker 1: awesome, like immediately.

803
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:40,910
Speaker 1: like sir you have to leave and The other thing is they're also a restaurant so you'll sit down you can order like food and beer and some drinks Reasonable prices because there's actual a restaurant there instead of a concession stand like before and during the movie.

804
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:50,604
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool Yeah And I'd like to see this trend grow because if there was a place like that within driving distance of me I might go to a weekly or like if they had some sort of extra cool.

805
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,035
Speaker 0: you get a place like that Right now.

806
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:56,794
Speaker 0: the there's still the problem that there aren't really movies They want to see.

807
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,130
Speaker 0: that solves every problem with the theater.

808
00:51:59,412 --> 00:52:04,140
Speaker 0: But there's still the problem of I'm not gonna go If there's some crap movie that kind of ruins it.

809
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,670
Speaker 0: like you're eating a fancy dinner and then this crap comes on.

810
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the thing.

811
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:13,024
Speaker 1: say there's a movie that's worth watching like not crap But just a movie that's worth watching and we were gonna go out to dinner.

812
00:52:13,144 --> 00:52:15,436
Speaker 1: Anyway, cuz you know, whatever Saturday Oh, we totally go there.

813
00:52:15,657 --> 00:52:18,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it doesn't cost that much more is here's the vision I just had you ready?

814
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,074
Speaker 1: Alright instead

815
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:35,430
Speaker 0: of waiting for good movies to come from Hollywood cuz I don't bet a lot on that What you do is you instead of selling, you know tickets you sell memberships You become a member and like members come there once a week or so or something like that and they show.

816
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:37,577
Speaker 0: They don't show new movies.

817
00:52:37,898 --> 00:52:41,290
Speaker 0: They show whatever movie they find or want to show and they only show something good.

818
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:48,323
Speaker 0: So like we're gonna show this this week and it's a movie you might already know or maybe you know The kind of things that are in our Netflix queue.

819
00:52:48,343 --> 00:52:52,201
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, maybe so, you know just always something good.

820
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:53,446
Speaker 0: They'll never show a crap.

821
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:55,816
Speaker 0: movie SARS Wars Yeah, you know.

822
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:57,323
Speaker 0: maybe something that no one knows about.

823
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,890
Speaker 0: maybe something everyone knows about.

824
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:09,350
Speaker 0: You know loves me, you know just mix it all up and it'll be you know, always fun to go and hang out and Watch all kinds of movies instead of just watching.

825
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:14,050
Speaker 0: You know wait the movies and for the Hollywood movies only cycle out like every few months, you know.

826
00:53:15,113 --> 00:53:18,857
Speaker 0: So this will be a much faster Cycling if there's a different movie every week.

827
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd like to see this trend at least of these types of places grow.

828
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,201
Speaker 0: yeah, for sure.

829
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:25,412
Speaker 0: cuz I mean I Don't know.

830
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:35,425
Speaker 0: it is like a recent thing where when I was a little kid or even before I went to college going to Movie theaters people didn't yell in the movie theater.

831
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:40,929
Speaker 0: Everyone shut up, you know They'd laugh at something was funny and they scream if it was scary, but people were quiet.

832
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:49,659
Speaker 0: yeah sometime around college like this gradual change where people started to yell shit out and You know cell phones.

833
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,830
Speaker 0: All right, whatever someone forgot to turn it off.

834
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,310
Speaker 0: Maybe you have a real asshole and they answer it actually a lot a lot of times.

835
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,317
Speaker 1: There's the asshole who answers it and then just talks.

836
00:53:57,618 --> 00:54:01,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's something else, you know cell phones technology.

837
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:16,530
Speaker 0: That would have happened anyway, but more people just yelling like when we went to see episode 2 Long after it was already, you know We saw it well after and some guys in the bag were just yelling shit, you know, and they were yelling funny shit.

838
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:21,621
Speaker 0: but the point is is like People are more free to be kind of assholes in the theater.

839
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,524
Speaker 0: now, I don't know what it is.

840
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:25,541
Speaker 1: I Could make a lot of social commentary.

841
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:26,770
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll save that for another day.

842
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,932
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know when it's.

843
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:33,754
Speaker 0: I'd like to try to figure out exactly when it started happening and what the cause was and You know what?

844
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:37,310
Speaker 0: Maybe when a certain generation became old enough to get to the movie theater on their own.

845
00:54:37,552 --> 00:54:52,355
Speaker 1: I think there's just a a Picture on FARC that I saw a while ago that basically epitomizes exactly what I think is the root cause and it shows a gravestone And the name of the gravestone is personal responsibility And there's a whole bunch of other stuff.

846
00:54:52,396 --> 00:55:03,524
Speaker 1: it was a there was a lot of stuff to this picture, yeah, but yeah I mean a long time ago if someone was a jerk in a movie theater There's a decent chance that someone would just pop him and that would be the end of that.

847
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:05,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't happen anymore.

848
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:14,130
Speaker 1: No, if you do that you go to jail now, not that I agree with the popping No, but there it was just not agree with the deserving of the popping.

849
00:55:14,232 --> 00:55:15,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not the pop.

850
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:25,055
Speaker 1: It's like when that that friend of ours got into a fight at Otacon over some stupid crap and the Otacon staff after the fact in the back room were like man You don't start a fight.

851
00:55:25,175 --> 00:55:26,520
Speaker 1: I mean, especially not in the con.

852
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,162
Speaker 1: That's not cool.

853
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:29,109
Speaker 1: But god damn that kid deserved it.

854
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:30,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

855
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:36,050
Speaker 0: it's one thing to say someone deserves violence like that guy deserves to be shot.

856
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:47,798
Speaker 0: But it's another thing, you know to actually shoot him because it's like, okay, you might deserve it But you don't shoot people because it's wrong no matter if they deserve it or not, you know, yeah Basically, it's hard to explain that.

857
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it seems like you know what?

858
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:49,905
Speaker 1: It's easy to explain.

859
00:55:49,925 --> 00:55:50,708
Speaker 1: you watch try gun.

860
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:59,850
Speaker 1: Yeah But basically it seems more that in recent years it's become less and less of a social stigma to be an asshole.

861
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:07,570
Speaker 0: Well is the thing though is like I'm an asshole you're a different kind of asshole and I you know I don't care there's a bracelet is a rudeness.

862
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,289
Speaker 0: But you know, I don't care about what you say only care about what you do.

863
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:16,064
Speaker 0: But but just making noise when someone's trying to pay attention to a movie.

864
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,150
Speaker 0: Well consider matter of politeness and rudeness.

865
00:56:18,472 --> 00:56:18,936
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

866
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,409
Speaker 1: It's a night to not be loud.

867
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:21,172
Speaker 0: Well, it's.

868
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:28,050
Speaker 0: it's a matter of actually, you know creating a physical disturbance not just upsetting someone's feelings.

869
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:28,657
Speaker 0: You see the point?

870
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:29,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

871
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:35,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see your point But the point is that people have gotten this idea that I mean, I believe in a free society.

872
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:39,349
Speaker 1: I believe that everyone has the right to be an asshole an idiot a jerk whatever the hell they want to be.

873
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:46,673
Speaker 1: If you want to be an ignorant horrible racist asshole, that's your prerogative and I'm fine with that because I don't have to like you Or talk to you.

874
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:48,021
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact knowledge.

875
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:53,583
Speaker 1: I have the right to ridicule you if I want Yeah, if you want to believe in some horrible things, you know would run around jihad, whatever.

876
00:56:53,984 --> 00:56:58,361
Speaker 1: or if you're like oral Robertson Pat, you know just recently said that Jews can't get in heaven.

877
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:00,169
Speaker 1: Whatever you can say whatever you want.

878
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,261
Speaker 1: But the thing is just because you can't do something doesn't mean you always should.

879
00:57:04,281 --> 00:57:07,284
Speaker 1: I mean I can just start yelling in a movie theater.

880
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:13,738
Speaker 1: It's the movie theaters right to kick me out and it's everyone else's right to not like me and hate me Mm-hmm, and there you.

881
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:22,970
Speaker 1: it used to be that people would at least avoid That sort of behavior when they knew it would cause a problem or at least there was a stigma about that sort of behavior.

882
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:26,268
Speaker 1: I mean if you talked in a movie theater, everyone would look at you like what the hell?

883
00:57:27,372 --> 00:57:28,478
Speaker 1: But now people just do it.

884
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:30,168
Speaker 1: people just start doing these things all the time.

885
00:57:31,093 --> 00:57:39,990
Speaker 0: I think part of it might be our like detachment from Strangers like you go to the movie theater with your friends and the only people there that you really acknowledge are your friends.

886
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:43,090
Speaker 0: So if your friends are all about being quiet, you're gonna be all about being quiet.

887
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:43,873
Speaker 0: But that makes sense.

888
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,647
Speaker 0: if your friends are all about yelling, you'll be all about yelling and strangers.

889
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:53,006
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit Yeah, and I remember like when I was a kid we would talk to neighbors on the street.

890
00:57:53,147 --> 00:57:54,090
Speaker 0: You would be like, hey, what's up?

891
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,873
Speaker 0: I knew who they were.

892
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:55,917
Speaker 1: Well, we never did that.

893
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:56,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, we knew.

894
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:02,729
Speaker 0: you know, it was and people around town We're friendly like you could just walk down the street and say hi to people, you know, you'd even know him.

895
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:05,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I'll point out that I grew up in like the other America.

896
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,266
Speaker 1: I grew up in like suburbia suburbia like black hole Sun suburbia.

897
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:14,622
Speaker 1: Yeah, and All our neighbors like we didn't talk to anyone because we really I hadn't.

898
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:16,958
Speaker 1: we had nothing in common with any of our neighbors at all.

899
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,044
Speaker 0: We don't really have as much in common with them other than that.

900
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:20,990
Speaker 0: They were our neighbors.

901
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:30,229
Speaker 1: Well, our neighbors were all like the homeowners Association types and they'd sit around and the only time they'd ever talked to anyone is like I see you're putting up a fence.

902
00:58:30,992 --> 00:58:31,496
Speaker 1: Yes, I am.

903
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:36,690
Speaker 1: I Don't think that offense is really a good thing to put up in this neighborhood.

904
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:40,615
Speaker 1: You know that sort of talk Yeah, or you know, they'd.

905
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:42,803
Speaker 1: actually we've gone long.

906
00:58:42,843 --> 00:58:44,970
Speaker 1: So I guess I'll end here with a funny anecdote.

907
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:49,323
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid, I had a cordless headset.

908
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,450
Speaker 0: phone was called Thursday's nostalgia day.

909
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:55,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, that seems to be what we're doing today, but I had this heads.

910
00:58:55,251 --> 00:58:59,090
Speaker 1: I don't think I told this story had this headset phone and it was cordless and it wasn't a cell phone.

911
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:09,748
Speaker 1: it was just a cordless headset phone that I used all the time because I talked on the phone a lot and I would climb out onto my roof from my window at night and just kind of like hang out up there and talk to my friends on the phone.

912
00:59:10,892 --> 00:59:18,329
Speaker 1: the neighbors Talk to my parents one day and they asked what was wrong with their son with with me.

913
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:20,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently he.

914
00:59:20,434 --> 00:59:25,110
Speaker 1: they saw me walking around on the roof yelling at people like yelling voice yelling at voices or something.

915
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:26,997
Speaker 1: They didn't know that I was on the phone.

916
00:59:27,017 --> 00:59:29,929
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and they couldn't conceive of the fact that I was on the roof.

917
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:49,943
Speaker 1: The point I was gonna make before I got way off topic and told an anecdote was that all my life Most of my friends until I got to college were all over the world because my friends were based on like interests and similar culture and I didn't make friends based on geography because most of the people around me weren't interested in anything I was interested in.

918
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:54,450
Speaker 1: Then I got to college and there were a bunch of people around me who were interested in the same things.

919
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:55,427
Speaker 1: We formed this tight group.

920
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:57,679
Speaker 1: Now we've all spread to the wind again.

921
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:00,090
Speaker 1: And now all my friends are far away.

922
01:00:00,732 --> 01:00:14,434
Speaker 1: I don't know anyone other than I know two people in the entire city that we live in But I know hundreds of people all over the country and almost every city just everywhere and I'm better friends with them than I am with people who Live 20 feet away from me.

923
01:00:15,096 --> 01:00:16,861
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm better friends with.

924
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:19,851
Speaker 1: you know, people like I have nothing to say to these strangers I've.

925
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:23,870
Speaker 1: I mean every now and then I get I talked to someone but I never really engaged them.

926
01:00:24,331 --> 01:00:25,074
Speaker 1: I don't remember them.

927
01:00:25,676 --> 01:00:30,050
Speaker 0: You don't engage them, but you kind of like acknowledge them and you know, you have a sort of.

928
01:00:31,055 --> 01:00:40,520
Speaker 0: There seems to be like this More detachment from people around you like it used to be people your friends are your friends and your family is your family But at least people who are near you.

929
01:00:40,943 --> 01:00:42,572
Speaker 0: you had you know Something.

930
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:46,990
Speaker 0: some like loose connection with anyone happened to be near you and it was positive.

931
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:51,430
Speaker 0: See, I've never had though there seems to be like this like this like if someone's near you and you don't know they are.

932
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,052
Speaker 0: They don't exist.

933
01:00:52,494 --> 01:00:53,758
Speaker 1: See I guess I've never had that.

934
01:00:53,858 --> 01:01:01,079
Speaker 1: I've never had any sort of connection to the people who were close to me Geographically, yeah, I mean I never knew my neighbors.

935
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:07,586
Speaker 1: as I said when I was a really really little kid living in downtown Detroit I knew all my neighbors, but I never knew neighbors.

936
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:08,430
Speaker 1: I was growing up as a kid.

937
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:09,136
Speaker 1: I had all my neighbors.

938
01:01:09,177 --> 01:01:14,290
Speaker 1: now when we lived at RIT Not only did not know my neighbors other than the horrible deaf people upstairs.

939
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:16,539
Speaker 1: Now none not.

940
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,049
Speaker 1: they're not horrible because they were deaf They're horrible because they were horrible and they happen to be deaf.

941
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:21,790
Speaker 0: See I would know our neighbors around here.

942
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,710
Speaker 0: We had more of them like I know the old lady next door and the old lady downstairs.

943
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:25,918
Speaker 0: We don't really have any other name.

944
01:01:25,938 --> 01:01:33,010
Speaker 1: the most I knew about any of our neighbors back We lived in college was that the neighbors next door knocked a hole in their wall once and I saw it through their door.

945
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:39,690
Speaker 1: Yep Just I didn't even know anyone in my major at RIT.

946
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:45,138
Speaker 1: I didn't know anyone in my major other than one of my friends who happened to be in the major But I knew him outside of the major.

947
01:01:45,179 --> 01:01:46,850
Speaker 0: I know I knew plenty of people in my major.

948
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:48,075
Speaker 1: I didn't know anyone.

949
01:01:48,377 --> 01:01:49,201
Speaker 0: quite a few they were.

950
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,466
Speaker 0: they were on the acquaintance level.

951
01:01:50,486 --> 01:01:50,607
Speaker 0: like.

952
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:51,230
Speaker 0: you know who they are.

953
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,489
Speaker 0: You know their name you give them a nod when you see him.

954
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:57,945
Speaker 0: You know you say hello meet-and-greet small talk, but not like hang out go hang.

01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,520
Speaker 1: I mean I guess to me equate.

958
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:02,574
Speaker 1: I had very few Acquaintances like that.

959
01:02:02,816 --> 01:02:04,785
Speaker 1: most of the acquaintance I had were from other things.

960
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:05,870
Speaker 1: they weren't from proximity.

961
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:07,579
Speaker 0: They were yeah, I got a lot of acquaintances.

962
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:09,790
Speaker 0: like you know I see people all the time.

963
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:11,164
Speaker 0: It's like oh, I know you from somewhere.

964
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:13,653
Speaker 0: Hey All right, see you I don't.

965
01:02:13,713 --> 01:02:20,509
Speaker 1: I don't really engage acquaintances unless I'm you know it's like a fan of a show or Like back when I ran the club when it was people who knew me because I ran the club.

966
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,885
Speaker 1: But other than that I just don't engage people.

967
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,694
Speaker 0: yeah I mean, I don't.

968
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:28,347
Speaker 0: it's it's not about really so much engagement when it comes to the movie theater.

969
01:02:28,408 --> 01:02:31,696
Speaker 0: It's about Like just it's the time.

970
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:34,910
Speaker 0: They don't the existence of the other people and the fact that they're there.

971
01:02:35,595 --> 01:02:36,400
Speaker 1: I guess I really don't.

972
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,085
Speaker 1: I'm guilty of that.

973
01:02:37,105 --> 01:02:43,280
Speaker 1: well But at the same time I'm generally Quiet in movies, so I don't cause a problem.

974
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,290
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm also the quiet in movies.

975
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:49,886
Speaker 0: But also what I do in movies is you know I try to like the wish.

976
01:02:49,926 --> 01:03:00,185
Speaker 0: you know because when we watch a movie at Home we always say funny stuff, or you know depending on the movie of course yeah, so when we're in a movie theater I'll always try to like you know whispered to the friends next to me like oh my god.

977
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:00,627
Speaker 0: You see that.

978
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:01,792

Speaker 1: Yeah, scotch that guy.

980
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:08,548
Speaker 0: yeah, but I don't you know I don't think The people next to me and usually my friends can hear me.

981
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:10,500
Speaker 0: It's like if I whisper to the friend on the right.

982
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:15,790
Speaker 0: sometimes the friend on the left gets pissed But usually the people in the front of me and back of me don't seem to get pissed.

983
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:19,329
Speaker 0: So you know I try to you know keep it quiet.

984

Speaker 1: Alright.

985
01:03:20,412 --> 01:03:23,684
Speaker 1: anyway, it was a rambly episode, and I think we're about done here.

986
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you get when it snows.

01:03:25,612 --> 01:03:30,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only did it snow, but we've got a crazy weekend planned with all our friends are coming out.

01:03:33,575 --> 01:03:34,660
Speaker 0: I think our themed weeks.

990
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:39,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not sure what theme we're gonna do next week But we're doing something something awesome.

991
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:44,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the theme week will really help us Keep up put up the quality back up.

992
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:46,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, the quality's been up pretty good except.

993
01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:48,444
Speaker 1: I think the penny already the content.

994
01:03:48,484 --> 01:03:50,432
Speaker 1: I mean I think the contents been alright That's alright.

995
01:03:50,954 --> 01:03:52,522
Speaker 1: I don't know what you guys they've been in the past.

996
01:03:52,904 --> 01:03:54,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've had some good episodes.

997
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,250
Speaker 1: We have some crap episodes.

998
01:03:55,290 --> 01:04:00,149
Speaker 1: That's the problem with doing you know for podcasts a week is that the quality will vary depending on you know?

999
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,415
Speaker 1: Everything in the world.

1000
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:04,170
Speaker 0: yeah, I think that you know that's something we got to accept.

1001
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:07,528
Speaker 0: But I really think the theme weeks will also help us try to figure out what to do.

1002
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:07,970
Speaker 0: and we're like.

1003
01:04:08,031 --> 01:04:09,010

1004
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,421
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Because Tuesday and Wednesday are cake and Monday is cake.

1005
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:14,369

1008
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:24,748
Speaker 1: You know getting the interviews prepared getting the research and material together.

1009
01:04:24,768 --> 01:04:26,423
Speaker 0: Yeah There's all kinds of stuff where it's like.

1010
01:04:26,483 --> 01:04:27,110
Speaker 0: Oh, we should do that.

1011
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:32,150
Speaker 0: Oh, we have to research something, and then we never do because our lives are so rushed and whatnot.

1012
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:39,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it said, but if we did a one day a week podcast It would be the longest most well researched awesome podcast in the world.

1013
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,529
Speaker 0: Probably it would did three days a week.

1014
01:04:42,032 --> 01:04:43,138
Speaker 0: It would be so it would like.

1015
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:44,888
Speaker 0: the quality would go up like a zillion.

1016
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:49,210
Speaker 1: yeah We're not gonna cut down anytime soon though because everyone who listens seems to really like the four day a week deal.

1017
01:04:49,772 --> 01:04:52,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus this will keep it so like anyone new comes along.

01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:55,150
Speaker 0: They'll be stuck away in the back archives.

1019
01:04:55,911 --> 01:04:58,630
