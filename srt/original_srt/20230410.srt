1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,399
Speaker 1: it's Monday April 10th 2023.

2
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,969
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,502
Speaker 1: tonight we're talking about fonts from a technology standpoint.

4
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,129
Speaker 0: let's do this.

5
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,916
Speaker 0: it's finally not cold.

6
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:28,083
Speaker 1: oh my god.

7
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,447
Speaker 1: I biked to work this morning.

8
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:31,013
Speaker 1: I biked home just now.

9
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:31,577
Speaker 0: I thought it was.

10
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:32,704
Speaker 0: I looked at the weather reports.

11
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:36,565
Speaker 0: I thought Wednesday was going to be the day but it moved up and out Tuesday.

12
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:42,408
Speaker 0: I mean it was cold this morning but it's now not cold and it looks like even it even tonight.

13
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:46,224
Speaker 0: the low is that it says 59 so that's only a little cold.

14
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:53,606
Speaker 1: well it's fascinating to me is you'll notice if you go back to I bet if you go back to old geek nights episodes you hear us talk about the weather because you warm.

15
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,189
Speaker 1: today was.

16
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,156
Speaker 1: it was a geek nights meme for a reason.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:08,951
Speaker 1: so about five years ago the climate in New York kind of had a radical sudden shift and I think this this this spring has been exactly what the last three springs have been and not how they used to be.

18
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:19,212
Speaker 1: where we have winter and then when spring starts spring is basically now in New York it's just like three weeks of radically shifting weather and then it's suddenly summer.

19
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:27,356
Speaker 1: it's like it'll be 70 degrees 40 75 40 80 20 and then it'll like settle into upper 70s.

20
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:36,810
Speaker 0: it says the high on Thursday and Friday will be 82 and 85. it's like all right you know anyway but actual non-weather open a bit.

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:46,170
Speaker 0: so we're sitting around this past weekend no plans whatsoever and I'm like I don't really want to sit inside all day even though it's a little bit cold.

22
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,681
Speaker 0: right let's you know I'm in New York City.

23
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:51,132
Speaker 0: there should be something to do right?

24
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:55,289
Speaker 0: I did should not be challenging to find something to do and I was like.

25
00:01:55,309 --> 00:02:07,683
Speaker 0: you know I'm looking around and I'm like oh I saw on the subway there were some ads for something at the Brooklyn Museum some fashion guy right you know and it was like you probably seen them like this picture of a bug lady.

26
00:02:07,704 --> 00:02:09,191
Speaker 0: oh yeah yeah yeah.

27
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:12,525
Speaker 0: and I was like hey let's do you want?

28
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:13,107
Speaker 0: you want to just go?

29
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:22,199
Speaker 0: maybe we went over there and basically there was a person I guess I don't know how to pronounce their name properly Darry Moogler.

30
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:29,120
Speaker 0: I guess it's t-h-i-e-r-r-y space m-u-g-l-e-r and there might be something on that.

31
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:40,654
Speaker 0: you but basically was a famous fashion person also even made perfumes and stuff and they passed away somewhat recently.

32
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:54,902
Speaker 0: but shortly before they passed away there was a exhibit put together by I think the Montreal Museum I guess and now it's moving around and it's at the Brooklyn Museum and for like another month or so.

33
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,833
Speaker 0: right and you know it's mostly like.

34
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:12,166
Speaker 0: you know runway fashions and you know theater fashions right the kind of ridiculous stuff that you see someone wear to like you know a red carpet or which I love that shit oh yeah.

35
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:24,230
Speaker 0: so you if you love that shit you should go head down there because they've got like hundreds of these like you know costumes and outfits and you know mostly dresses and stuff that have.

36
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:31,900
Speaker 0: basically you know we're worn once and then we're put into some storage some so fun fact bow at my two companies ago.

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,284
Speaker 1: so this is already a long time ago.

38
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:43,038
Speaker 1: that company sponsored Fashion Week and we got a lot of access and perks and things way back then that they gave to all of us.

39
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,464
Speaker 1: lowly regular employees.

40
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,157
Speaker 0: yeah but it's a lot different to see.

41
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:48,062
Speaker 0: you know it's.

42
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,509
Speaker 0: it's obviously one thing to see it.

43
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,368
Speaker 0: you know someone wearing it and you know moving around and whatnot.

44
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:57,976
Speaker 0: and there's videos and stuff in the exhibit you know showing you who was wearing it and when and photos and a lot of that.

45
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:09,307
Speaker 0: but you know the thing being on a mannequin and you can actually get close and look at it right and see what's up with it you know much more closely than you I guess ever could ever right?

46
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,982
Speaker 0: it's like you're not gonna get close to the famous person wearing it.

47
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,813
Speaker 0: you're gonna see it from from far away.

48
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,232
Speaker 1: you're not gonna close enough to be like wow I literally can't see the stitching.

49
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,660
Speaker 1: how the fuck did they do that?

50
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:24,993
Speaker 0: well no that's what I was actually gonna say right it's like the cosplayers should actually feel pretty good because I got.

51
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,987
Speaker 0: you know you get close to a lot of this stuff and it's like.

52
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,699
Speaker 0: you know the design of it and you know the way it looks is.

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,611
Speaker 0: you know is incredible but you get.

54
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:33,935
Speaker 0: it's like a lot of it.

55
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,548
Speaker 0: you get close to it and it's clearly very fragile.

56
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,155
Speaker 0: they they clearly made something that would only work one time right and it's held together by like you know.

57
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,385
Speaker 1: it's like it's the f1 car of a dress.

58
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,919
Speaker 0: exactly that's what this stuff like I saw.

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,102
Speaker 0: it's like when you get close to it it's like yeah you can clearly see that like this was not?

60
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,791
Speaker 0: you know some of the stuff isn't you know?

61
00:04:56,554 --> 00:05:02,857
Speaker 0: perfect right and but you can't tell from from far away right that it's not perfect it's still just.

62
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:05,992
Speaker 0: you know some incredibly unique and amazing clothing.

63
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,581
Speaker 0: but the coolest section.

64
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:13,121
Speaker 0: I thought they had a section of you know very fembot styled clothing

65
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:15,687
Speaker 1: also a fan of fembot style

66
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:26,574
Speaker 0: of course if a lot of that was clearly you know uncomfortable boob armoring but you know that and you could see also by looking at the clothing how unrealistically small the person who wore it had to be.

67
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:33,157
Speaker 0: like it's like no like you know only a child or a model can fit into any of this stuff right.

68
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:37,774
Speaker 0: and then there was the be like animal section.

69
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,980
Speaker 0: we're like you know the bug clothing clothing etc.

70
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,136
Speaker 0: right the put this on and you look like a motorcycle.

71
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:48,708
Speaker 0: literally there was one cool.

72
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:53,752
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that was in there that I think I would have worn there was like these.

73
00:05:53,893 --> 00:06:03,713
Speaker 0: there was a. there was a set of clothing you know one for a man body and a woman body shaped body yeah and it looked like the kind of clothing that someone would wear.

74
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:21,265
Speaker 0: and like you know some sort of a space station somewhere in between like a Logan's run and you know Cloud City right style with like you know people walk around in the space station with capes and whatnot.

75
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:22,391
Speaker 1: I was like.

76
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:29,339
Speaker 1: so I have seen occasional people kind of dressed adjacent to that as those handful of brands that make.

77
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,069
Speaker 0: you saw Lando Calrissian walking down the.

78
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:36,015
Speaker 1: it wasn't an anime convention or wasn't quite to the Lando level but it was like 40% of the Lando.

79
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,782
Speaker 0: this is the land level.

80
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,412
Speaker 1: yeah I want that style to come back for real.

81
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:45,636
Speaker 1: there is a few brands that actually make actual wearable clothes that are closer they like.

82
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,746
Speaker 1: they look like Assassin's Creed kind of stuff.

83
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,041
Speaker 1: I feel like we just need that trend to continue and we can dress like Lando.

84
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,851
Speaker 0: or we have money.

85
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:58,007
Speaker 1: you want to just get Lando stuff and just dress like that from now on.

86
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,958
Speaker 0: the other problem I don't think it would look good.

87
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,629
Speaker 1: I think we could pull it off.

88
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:02,755
Speaker 1: I think we could both pull it off.

89
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:06,012
Speaker 0: I think it only looks good if you're in the right setting.

90
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:06,534
Speaker 1: I don't know.

91
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:12,678
Speaker 0: exhibit is that all the clothing is in you know an appropriate setting that matches.

92
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,716
Speaker 0: if you think if you take it out of that setting it just looks ridiculous.

93
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:22,655
Speaker 1: ah but if enough people start dressing like Lando Lando becomes the fashion.

94
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,515
Speaker 1: sure I'm just saying I'll Lando if you Lando but I'm not gonna Lando alone.

95
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,908
Speaker 0: it's also not really practical right.

96
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:32,270
Speaker 0: it's like this.

97
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,900
Speaker 0: shit doesn't have pockets that you can't.

98
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,294
Speaker 0: it's got like giant shoulders and other ridiculous stuff.

99
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,399
Speaker 0: you yeah it's like you can't.

100
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,645
Speaker 0: it's hard to go about.

101
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,172
Speaker 1: as much as I like capes.

102
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:49,727
Speaker 1: you know I saw why was my father where with a guy in a cape having worn an actual for real cape a lot in marching as a high school kid.

103
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,480
Speaker 1: capes are actually super fucking annoying to wear.

104
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,184
Speaker 1: they're right.

105
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,270
Speaker 1: they are such a pain.

106
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:03,065
Speaker 0: especially all of these clothings right are only practical to wear if you're on a runway at a red carpet at a gala or someone.

107
00:08:03,106 --> 00:08:06,867
Speaker 0: you don't have to hold anything and you have like a someone to take care of your shit for you.

108
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,173
Speaker 0: the only thing get to hold us a drink.

109
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,642
Speaker 0: yes right all right you're not.

110
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:20,478
Speaker 1: no sitting no laying Scott I'll get packed with you now if there is ever a situation just saying where you and I are both attending something that qualifies as red carpet.

111
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,300
Speaker 1: if you want to

112
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:27,220
Speaker 0: go in fine well you can spend your money on getting some famous fashion design

113
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:36,135
Speaker 1: Orlando the both of us because I'm not doing by myself and I would love but I would like to Lando but it'll have to be an actual red carpet above the line.

114
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:42,990
Speaker 0: I think I mean the price that you have to pay to you know to to donate to the Met to get gala tickets in the first place.

115
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,483
Speaker 0: the cost of the clothing would not really compare.

116
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:49,197
Speaker 1: yeah I mean I don't think I would not be going to that.

117
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:49,800
Speaker 1: I can't.

118
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:50,523
Speaker 1: what kind of?

119
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:50,925
Speaker 1: what's the?

120
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:56,207
Speaker 1: what's the least red carpet that would qualify as red that you and I could get access to.

121
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,380
Speaker 0: that's it you would have to make.

122
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,872
Speaker 0: you would have to have premiere a movie or a show.

123
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:04,779
Speaker 1: there's minor red carpets.

124
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:09,313
Speaker 1: there's that red carpet to get into the lounge at London Heathrow

125
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:21,463
Speaker 0: but it mean it's like yeah there are red carpets about but it has to be one specifically where there's paparazzi waiting for this event those people crammed on the you know the size I feel like the

126
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,669
Speaker 1: best we could and you

127
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:25,725
Speaker 0: get to pull up and go down the red carpet and take

128
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:26,589
Speaker 1: a photo

129
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,333
Speaker 0: and go in because

130
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:38,182
Speaker 1: there is another kind of venue that does that and that is the club or the music venue where rich people are going in very specific circumstances like the fancy club that has the special concert.

131
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,953
Speaker 0: what if what if?

132
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,326
Speaker 1: oh maybe that's what our gaming con is the red carpet.

133
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:45,430
Speaker 1: gaming con is.

134
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,956
Speaker 0: no I mean it could.

135
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:53,382
Speaker 0: it could be a thing that happens at a con right like a special you know event at a specific time.

136
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,995
Speaker 1: we invite Friedman freeze and we make sure he's fancy.

137
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,703
Speaker 1: it's like comes in on the red carpet.

138
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:03,387
Speaker 0: we know we make a red carpet and you know cosplayers come up and get out and come down our.

139
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:07,105
Speaker 0: we basically set up a pretend red carpet but you know more achievable.

140
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:10,358
Speaker 0: it doesn't have to even be at a con.

141
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:16,124
Speaker 0: we could just be like spent you know event in New York right the red carpet for no reason at all right.

142
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,013
Speaker 0: it's like come you know buy a ticket.

143
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,228
Speaker 0: right and that funds the event and anyone who buys a ticket even better.

144
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:25,729
Speaker 0: anyone who buys a ticket can roll up and protect walk down the red carpet.

145
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 0: well everyone will be people taking photos.

146
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:34,397
Speaker 0: they'll get interviewed and then they'll get a photo in front of the thing with our logo on it and then they can go in and then that's the end right.

147
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:37,031
Speaker 0: you buy a ticket just to do that and there's no other event.

148
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:47,048
Speaker 0: that's it just even better to come down a red carpet buy a ticket and you get to live that like we rented the front of Cipriani for a day just to do it.

149
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:52,551
Speaker 1: a crowd of people who don't know that it's just like a bit would.

150
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,657
Speaker 0: that's what makes it work.

151
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,586
Speaker 0: you don't have to hire extras to come in.

152
00:10:55,626 --> 00:11:00,326
Speaker 0: we just need like a couple photographers right yeah the extras will make themselves.

153
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:01,432
Speaker 0: this is we could even make.

154
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:04,486
Speaker 0: we could even you know since it's not really harmful.

155
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,013
Speaker 0: we could also lie right.

156
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:19,406
Speaker 0: oh yeah we could send a press release to the news and we could as we could even you know let rim the expert on lying without lying write something like you know red carpet event you know etc.

157
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:19,647
Speaker 0: etc.

158
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:25,331
Speaker 1: yeah for the premiere of it'll be written in such a way that that halfling is definitely not going to be arrested by the wizard police.

159
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:31,197
Speaker 1: yeah so that that's actually a joke that the inside thing that predates you.

160
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:45,045
Speaker 1: but the the moment where my previous friend grew before I went to RIT realized that I can confabulate that well in the right circumstances without actually lying was specifically playing D&D at an event and I got out of being arrested by the wizard police entirely in character.

161
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:50,843
Speaker 1: so the listener suggests the fresh fashion by Friedman freeze.

162
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,336
Speaker 1: so in the news this is breaking news.

163
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:58,839
Speaker 1: it just happened.

164
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,882
Speaker 1: it was just announced.

165
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:09,594
Speaker 1: it said Al Jaffee an absolute legend basically like the art the illustrator that made mad magazine what it was.

166
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:16,496
Speaker 0: there were other people there was but Al Jaffee yeah is well I think Al Al was the guy who you know.

167
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:21,736
Speaker 0: he was the living embodiment of mad magazine and he live.

168
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:22,740
Speaker 0: he outlived them all.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:32,256
Speaker 0: basically yeah right so in outliving them all he sort of you know in his name he carries the torch for for all the others yeah

170
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,191
Speaker 1: and if you don't know if you think you don't know who Al Jaffee

171
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,765
Speaker 0: talked about him literally every time it's his birthday

172
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,012
Speaker 1: yep click on this link.

173
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:47,090
Speaker 1: and if you since he was like 90 something if you see any piece of art that this man made himself you'll realize oh it's that guy like.

174
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,775
Speaker 1: you'll know who it is.

175
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:48,902
Speaker 1: you've seen this everywhere.

176
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:53,582
Speaker 0: yeah mad man does it does it fold together and then another image appears.

177
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:57,230
Speaker 1: so he died at a hundred and two.

178
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:01,841
Speaker 0: so he had a good run but that I can make it all.

179
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:05,691
Speaker 0: that means he was born in 1921. yeah mad magazine was in the 50s.

180
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:11,886
Speaker 0: in the 50s he was 30.

181
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:15,696
Speaker 1: yep mad magazine started in the 50s.

182
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:22,978
Speaker 0: I want to say he was looking 30 something in the 50s when he was our age it was still the 60s.

183
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:26,009
Speaker 0: there was still 20 more years before we were even gonna be born.

184
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:31,066
Speaker 1: yet yeah mad magazine first October November 1952.

185
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:39,280
Speaker 0: yeah but it's like not only did he live long and see all that shit that you could you know that you could see in a hundred years plus.

186
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:44,898
Speaker 0: right but he remained the person that he was after seeing all that shit.

187
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,484
Speaker 0: yeah and that's not even that right.

188
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:54,496
Speaker 0: just that alone is a is a noteworthy and significant life not even counting all of the artworks he created.

189
00:13:54,516 --> 00:14:06,945
Speaker 1: yeah so it's like never mind the fact that mad magazine was surprisingly like important to pop culture in a way that modern people who are young might not recognize because it's long gone.

190
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:11,199
Speaker 1: but that magazine was an institution mm-hmm.

191
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,650
Speaker 0: it's not long gone it's somewhat recently gone.

192
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:21,074
Speaker 1: well it I would say it was effectively gone in the 90s like it really started to fall apart.

193
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:25,898
Speaker 1: you know there was mad TV which was actually better than people remember.

194
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,766
Speaker 1: it's kind of shame it failed but I digress.

195
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:42,404
Speaker 1: but anyway pouring out for a legend Al Jaffe God speed buddy hundred and two in much sadder news relatively recently what could be sadder than that?

196
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:47,043
Speaker 1: this is this is sadder than that in a in a very focused way.

197
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:56,553
Speaker 1: so in most of America for a long time pretty much in most states pretty the other majority of all cars on the road are trucks.

198
00:14:57,136 --> 00:15:00,889
Speaker 1: that's just for reasons but technically classified as trucks.

199
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:12,712
Speaker 1: yes now for a long time that was mostly very rural places because most people in America the vast majority of humans in America did not ever own or drive a truck.

200
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:21,090
Speaker 1: they drove a regular small car on a car chassis and if you needed to carry a bunch of people with you you had a station wagon like that was.

201
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:22,095
Speaker 0: I think it was.

202
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,401
Speaker 0: there was a leveling up right.

203
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,064
Speaker 0: so it started.

204
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:33,887
Speaker 0: as you know if you were just one person you had like a two-door car cuz you'd occasionally have a passenger to be more expensive than two cars right.

205
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,991
Speaker 0: and then well cuz two.

206
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,200
Speaker 0: our cars are usually fast sporty cars right.

207
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:41,878
Speaker 0: and then you know when you were a family right your family got a Ford.

208
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,188
Speaker 0: you know Taurus a sedan a four-door car.

209
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,635
Speaker 0: right a lot a long one.

210
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:46,640
Speaker 0: you're a big family.

211
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,252
Speaker 1: you got a station wagon or maybe you right.

212
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:52,906
Speaker 0: eventually right the station wagon became a thing right.

213
00:15:53,287 --> 00:16:05,760
Speaker 0: and then after that the minivan became a thing and like the 90s I remember all everyone had Ford Tauruses and when they all got rid of them and got Ford Windstar yeah it was either the Windstar or there was another.

214
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:10,886
Speaker 1: we couldn't afford the Windstar as a family so we got the fucking Astro like the bad one.

215
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:12,271
Speaker 0: yeah but it's like.

216
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:15,948
Speaker 0: basically everyone had Tauruses and then they changed to the minivan.

217
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:25,394
Speaker 0: right but the minivan was never even though it was so practical you know for a large family right if you had at least three chill if you only had two children you could go with the sedan.

218
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:32,386
Speaker 0: yeah it's not necessary right but if you had three or more right it was just you know and you were you know buying into cars.

219
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,832
Speaker 0: you weren't anti-car or anything.

220
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:47,440
Speaker 1: the practicality and convenience of it you know made sense and a lot of people to to their credit because something changed in America that really broke this situation.

221
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,238
Speaker 1: a lot of families that they could afford it would have a minivan that they only used when they had to take the whole family somewhere or move something.

222
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:57,808
Speaker 1: yeah like drive we had.

223
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,017
Speaker 0: yeah we had a big car and a small car.

224
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:03,730
Speaker 0: my dad would take the small car to work and the other car was right you know.

225
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,484
Speaker 1: so this article the Washington Post has a.

226
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:19,651
Speaker 0: and then SUV came along and was like hey all you minivan people you you've been riding those minivans because they're so practical and you can carry your whole family in them right even though most of the time even the minivan only had one person in it.

227
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:20,757
Speaker 0: right yeah it was only some.

228
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:24,984
Speaker 0: but then they were like but you know the whole time you've been driving that minivan you know it's not cool.

229
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,332
Speaker 0: no one feels cool driving it.

230
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,903
Speaker 0: and it's like we have made the SUV.

231
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,411
Speaker 0: it is it's just a minivan.

232
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:32,896
Speaker 0: it's just it's.

233
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:33,719
Speaker 0: it's a minivan.

234
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:34,824
Speaker 0: it's a worse minivan.

235
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:41,533
Speaker 0: all right it's a minivan or a pickup truck that we made a different shape so that you don't feel uncool riding it.

236
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:42,837
Speaker 0: but it's the.

237
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:47,580
Speaker 1: you know there's the same except you actually had less space in those SUVs than in minivans.

238
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:54,186
Speaker 0: so they were actually worse and they're higher up and harder to get into yep so and less fuel-efficient.

239
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:57,399
Speaker 0: it is more dangerous to everyone outside of them.

240
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,039
Speaker 0: it is true inside and we've talked about this on geek knives many times.

241
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:14,935
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna lay with the point that the primary reason Americans pretty much buy exclusively SUVs to this day is because those are the most advertised cars and the car companies really push SUVs over all other forms of cars.

242
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:21,221
Speaker 0: yeah car ads work whether you believe it or not and basically they can tell people what to buy.

243
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:24,473
Speaker 0: people in a lot of places have to buy a car.

244
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:29,310
Speaker 0: they end up buying the one the advertisement told them to buy the one that's available.

245
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:34,574
Speaker 0: right and you know they might not you know admit that like I bought this.

246
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:35,237
Speaker 0: you know it's like.

247
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,887
Speaker 0: they say oh I got it cuz I like it.

248
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,591
Speaker 0: why do you like it?

249
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,160
Speaker 0: because an ad made you like that.

250
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,761
Speaker 0: yeah right.

251
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,949
Speaker 1: so so this article?

252
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:52,776
Speaker 1: because in America relatively recently now in every state SUVs and light trucks are the majority of all cars.

253
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:57,736
Speaker 1: the last holdouts were Rhode Island New Jersey New York and Connecticut mm-hmm.

254
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:02,621
Speaker 1: those were the only places in all of America where there were more cars than trucks on the road.

255
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,731
Speaker 1: at any given time they have fallen.

256
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:09,890
Speaker 1: trucks are the majority and in red states they're like 80 plus percent of all cars.

257
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,335
Speaker 1: now it is nuts.

258
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:20,909
Speaker 1: so this article is a very long form sort of explanation mostly because it has a lot of citations and links to other resources.

259
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:22,937
Speaker 1: if you want to like dig more into this about.

260
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,850
Speaker 1: it's not asking why did Americans buy SUVs?

261
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,155
Speaker 1: because we know why ads.

262
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:36,027
Speaker 1: it's asking the question why specifically did every car company in America so aggressively push SUVs to the exclusion of everything else?

263
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,021
Speaker 1: and the short version of this is it's a reason.

264
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,594
Speaker 0: it's a reason I already knew yeah but it's an old.

265
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,937
Speaker 1: yeah it's a reason that well a lot of people knew and there's a lot of data around it.

266
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,770
Speaker 1: but this brings it all together pretty succinctly.

267
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,175
Speaker 1: and also there's new evidence and specific data from recent years showing exactly how this went down.

268
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:59,629
Speaker 1: America regulates cars in a way where if something is classified as this truck it can be less safe and less fuel-efficient.

269
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,353
Speaker 1: so every car manufacturer said fuck the world fuck America fuck people fuck the environment.

270
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:11,739
Speaker 1: we are going to skirt the regulations to the maximum extent and act in bad faith and sell nothing.

271
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,016
Speaker 1: but like trucks we're gonna make sure every car we make is a light truck.

272
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,422
Speaker 0: well the quest right.

273
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:22,244
Speaker 0: the real question is like you know not that you know it's like those as loophole.

274
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:25,940
Speaker 0: basically right to say you know if you make a car that's class.

275
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,985
Speaker 0: you know there's rules that were in law that say this is what classifies a car in this category.

276
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:35,486
Speaker 0: this is what classifies a car in that you're not gonna like the answer but keep going yeah.

277
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:47,762
Speaker 0: and then they said all right you know well if a car is in this category it has to be X efficient right it's like if a car is in this category well obviously that's a big truck category that has to be less efficient.

278
00:20:48,124 --> 00:20:48,647
Speaker 0: you know we can't.

279
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:56,381
Speaker 0: it's not reasonable to expect someone who makes a giant truck which does need to exist for the person who legitimately needs giant truck.

280
00:20:56,783 --> 00:21:01,779
Speaker 0: you know we can't ask them to make giant truck 60 miles a gallon.

281
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,450
Speaker 0: it's just not going to be possible right?

282
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,945
Speaker 0: that would basically be legislating those vehicles out of existence.

283
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:08,978
Speaker 0: and so they wrote those laws in that way.

284
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,204
Speaker 0: now the question is right.

285
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,672
Speaker 0: when they wrote those laws in that way right?

286
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:26,267
Speaker 0: did they or did anyone who was involved in the making of those laws lobbyists you know representatives staff anyone right?

287
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,472
Speaker 0: was this just an oopsie?

288
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:33,690
Speaker 0: or was this somehow foreseen and intentional?

289
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,574
Speaker 1: you're not gonna lie.

290
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:37,025
Speaker 1: this answer cuz there's evil parties right.

291
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:39,174
Speaker 0: there were the car companies like you know.

292
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:42,772
Speaker 0: oh yeah you can pass that legislation yeah that one.

293
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,300
Speaker 0: actually we see the loophole already.

294
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,265
Speaker 0: that's not gonna stop us.

295
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,169
Speaker 0: you can pass that one.

296
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:46,651
Speaker 0: go ahead.

297
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:52,471
Speaker 1: so there are effectively three reasons why this happened.

298
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,821
Speaker 1: one of them you're not gonna like.

299
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,448
Speaker 0: it's easy.

300
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:57,151
Speaker 0: we know it's evil.

301
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:01,416
Speaker 1: no I mean you personally you Scott Reuben are not gonna like the third one when I say it and you're gonna go.

302
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:02,863
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's just an evil reason.

303
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:16,117
Speaker 1: but one reason is a lot of our regulations and laws and just things are old and some of the stuff dates back to the 40s and like chicken shit like chicken trucks and stuff and like tariff wars with urine.

304
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:19,973
Speaker 1: so and there's just a lot of inertia to change things like that.

305
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:32,460
Speaker 1: the second reason was basically all the politicians who are paid off by the car industry had to make sure there was a loophole or they would have lost all their donors from the car.

306
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:33,265
Speaker 0: why didn't they just?

307
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:34,532
Speaker 0: why did they just do nothing?

308
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:34,874
Speaker 0: why did?

309
00:22:35,035 --> 00:22:40,599
Speaker 1: why did they you know just leave the victory of saying look we're gonna make cars fuel-efficient.

310
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,462
Speaker 1: and everyone celebrated because those rules also the safety rules were really important.

311
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:46,868
Speaker 1: cars used to kill.

312
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,695
Speaker 1: yeah as much as cars kill people.

313
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:52,187
Speaker 0: today they're the second most it's guns and cars are the killers.

314
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:57,101
Speaker 0: yep but anyway you want to know the real.

315
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:02,385
Speaker 1: the third reason the Senate is now paralyzed in a way that it wasn't when the but that's.

316
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,976
Speaker 0: that's a reason why you can't change it.

317
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:13,586
Speaker 0: now I'm talking about what happened when the most recent car safety car laws needed to be able to get past the Senate filibuster.

318
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,213
Speaker 0: when when were they made?

319
00:23:15,213 --> 00:23:17,403
Speaker 1: 2004 seems to be the last time right.

320
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:22,408
Speaker 0: so what were the discussions that were had in 2004 where the lobbyists saying oh no that's public there's.

321
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:25,422
Speaker 0: I don't know that right but that's that's what I'm saying.

322
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:33,434
Speaker 0: is that you know was this you know a a good-faith loophole like they didn't realize that the car companies would do that?

323
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,258
Speaker 0: or was it?

324
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,493
Speaker 0: hey hey the car company lobbyists already knew the strategy.

325
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:42,074
Speaker 0: I would argue they already were thick imagining the SUV world in 2004. as

326
00:23:42,516 --> 00:24:11,624
Speaker 1: someone who is not an expert on car regulation but actually is an expert on capital markets regulation professionally uh in my personal professional opinion but not the opinion of my employer regulators usually do anticipate loopholes and in functioning regulatory frameworks they document them and they wait and see and as soon as the first person actually takes advantage of obscure loophole they immediately correct it.

327
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:15,200
Speaker 1: uh the reason none of these loopholes been corrected?

328
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:24,451
Speaker 1: because a lot of these laws are from 1978 and the Senate has been paralyzed since about 1994-95. so none of these regulations can ever be changed again.

329
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:39,482
Speaker 1: so the regulators who probably have a whole list of here's all the ways they're gonna try to get around it so we can play whack-a-mole when they actually do which is before anyone says why don't you just put those all in the law to begin with?

330
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:40,869
Speaker 1: that's too hard.

331
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,175
Speaker 1: that is actually too hard.

332
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,783
Speaker 1: you cannot deal with every loophole.

333
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:44,647
Speaker 1: it is better.

334
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:46,978
Speaker 1: like hockey hockey rules change all the time.

335
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,617
Speaker 1: someone figures out some bullshit and then they're like all right.

336
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,565
Speaker 1: there's a rule against that specific bullshit.

337
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:56,464
Speaker 0: I mean on the one hand you know there is some truth to.

338
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,475
Speaker 0: you can't possibly anticipate everything.

339
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:03,765
Speaker 0: you need to be have the ability to change the rules once you realize someone else smarter than you figured out something.

340
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:04,066
Speaker 0: yeah.

341
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:12,259
Speaker 0: but on the other hand I see this a lot in game design right is like the the game testers or like the pro players.

342
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,064
Speaker 0: oh yeah I agree you.

343
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:24,647
Speaker 0: they figure shit out on like not even day zero like minute zero as soon as like some new card in a card game or some new patch to an FPS comes out or a new map.

344
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,938
Speaker 0: like they figure out the exploit within five minutes.

345
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:30,210
Speaker 0: and it's like when they figure out the loophole that quickly.

346
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:43,151
Speaker 1: that is either incompetence or lack of effort with the regulatory whack-a-mole applies to the actual edge cases the things that are difficult to codify in law.

347
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,600
Speaker 1: not not like babies first.

348
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:48,780
Speaker 1: what if they just make a new class of car that's exempt from all regulations?

349
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,127
Speaker 1: like that's baby's first bullshit.

350
00:25:50,650 --> 00:26:03,538
Speaker 1: but exactly the reason none of this has changed is because the Senate has been paralyzed and a lot of this stuff goes back to 1978. so this article should just radicalize you further against cars.

351
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:12,090
Speaker 1: in our final news tonight we were really excited about the Apple m1 and m2 chips and the whole world was excited about it.

352
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:13,154
Speaker 1: we're also up there.

353
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:13,757
Speaker 0: they're there.

354
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,725
Speaker 0: they're there m2.

355
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:18,316
Speaker 0: this at this MacBook Air m2 that I've been.

356
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:22,250
Speaker 0: I got for my new job new at least almost one year old job I guess.

357
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,318
Speaker 0: Oh ten times technology.

358
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:24,840
Speaker 1: right.

359
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:31,663
Speaker 0: it's like if I wasn't gonna play a video game in my life or run any Windows only software in my life.

360
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,332
Speaker 0: right it's like this.

361
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:35,295
Speaker 0: thing is unbelievable.

362
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,920
Speaker 0: it's better at the.

363
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:43,524
Speaker 0: you know the things that it can do right now that my my personal computer can also do.

364
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,713
Speaker 0: it is better at them right.

365
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,484
Speaker 0: the only thing is my personal computer can do additional things.

366
00:26:48,624 --> 00:27:01,537
Speaker 1: yep but as it runs windows also in parallel we noted and some multiple recent episodes of geek nights that well basically the entire technology sector on earth has been laying people off like crazy.

367
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:03,084
Speaker 1: Apple somehow wasn't.

368
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:05,132
Speaker 0: well that's that's not true anymore.

369
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:07,462
Speaker 0: Apple laid off a little bit.

370
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:07,843
Speaker 0: they're like.

371
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:17,522
Speaker 0: you can see that Apple is like cutting costs in other ways and they're they laid off a few I think like some retail executive type people and some other thing.

372
00:27:17,542 --> 00:27:18,526
Speaker 0: but it's like they are.

373
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:25,414
Speaker 0: Apple is at least holding back on the layoffs as much as they can which I think is wise.

374
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,323
Speaker 1: yep I mean my company my current company.

375
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:32,324
Speaker 1: we're hiring we're not firing we're hiring not a ton of people but we're still hiring.

376
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:36,279
Speaker 1: but McDonald's is also laying off a bunch of people.

377
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,281
Speaker 1: so watch out that's not a great sign either I don't think but that's a bad one.

378
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:43,754
Speaker 1: yep max sales are down 40% that's right.

379
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,085
Speaker 1: so wait so that right.

380
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,356
Speaker 0: well that's a trailing indicator right.

381
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,673
Speaker 0: so I think it's telling a story of something that's already happened right.

382
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:55,613
Speaker 0: so basically you know there was the pan doodle and people went to work from home.

383
00:27:56,015 --> 00:28:00,197
Speaker 0: right and when people are working from home they all went out and bought computers.

384
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,331
Speaker 1: yeah a lot of my co-workers had to buy computers.

385
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,877
Speaker 1: a terrifying number of professionals do not own an actual computer at home right.

386
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:14,952
Speaker 0: well it's not just and I think it's not I think that individuals these days clearly are not buying computers in great number.

387
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:21,765
Speaker 0: the only people who are buying computers for themselves I think in large significant numbers right are gamers who aren't buying Apple computer.

388
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:40,700
Speaker 0: yep all right and you know creators artists developers people making games and making entertainment and the I think the largest number of computers now desktops whether Apple or otherwise besides the gaming ones yep that are being bought are actually being bought by companies.

389
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:44,862
Speaker 0: right companies are the ones you buy computers guess you just write everyone off.

390
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:49,108
Speaker 1: all the tech companies that were buying all these computers all these tech companies laid people off.

391
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,370
Speaker 0: they either just let people keep the computers or they get them returned to the company.

392
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:54,631
Speaker 0: there

393
00:28:54,751 --> 00:29:00,876
Speaker 1: are so many cheap new computers for sale in the secondary market right so that

394
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:21,132
Speaker 0: so all these tech layoffs have resulted in a big glut of either people just got a free work computer that's now theirs and or right companies have their either remaining IT staff you know flashing and backing up all these computers from laid-off people and if any new employees come in they get one of those.

395
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:24,845
Speaker 0: so or they resell those used on the market.

396
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:25,407
Speaker 0: and now they're.

397
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:31,108
Speaker 0: so the demand for and people you know are going back to offices or whatever.

398
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:32,717
Speaker 0: I guess sometimes I don't know.

399
00:29:32,757 --> 00:29:41,488
Speaker 0: but the point is overall the demand for desktop and laptop computers right now is a way down and it's been down for a while.

400
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:49,941
Speaker 0: and that down miss has caught up to the point where now right you're actually getting the reports of how down it's been.

401
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:57,319
Speaker 0: it's been so down that Apple says 40% less sales on Mac computers.

402
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,334
Speaker 0: right and also Apple has basically stopped making m2 chips.

403
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,237
Speaker 1: now they have.

404
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,267
Speaker 1: that is huge I really have.

405
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,957
Speaker 0: it's like they've made enough to satisfy the demand at.

406
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:16,852
Speaker 0: so they're rather than cut costs by laying people Apple employees off they're cutting costs by not making chips that no one's gonna buy.

407
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:22,663
Speaker 1: so my first real job you know when I worked at IBM this happened a while ago it's just now that you know.

408
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:28,228
Speaker 1: so my first real job was in a fab like an a chip fab making chips for like PlayStations and shit.

409
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:29,296
Speaker 1: that was actually my job.

410
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:31,024
Speaker 1: you listen to old geek nights I talk about it a lot.

411
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:45,749
Speaker 1: and but the technology that I was directly personally responsible for was stuff that would collect data to calculate yields like what percentage of these wafers actually like turn into a chip versus fail that kind of stuff there is.

412
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:56,204
Speaker 1: the difference between slowing down a production line and halting a production line is more enormous than you can possibly imagine.

413
00:30:56,505 --> 00:31:03,811
Speaker 1: actually stopping a production line is a big fucking deal because they are not easy to start up again.

414
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:04,754
Speaker 1: right.

415
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:06,561
Speaker 0: well TS MC these are all you know.

416
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,200
Speaker 0: all these chips are made by TS M's yeah the most important company on earth.

417
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,846
Speaker 0: they're just they're gonna go there.

418
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:12,368
Speaker 0: they're actually.

419
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:12,749
Speaker 0: they're losing.

420
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,927
Speaker 0: you know they're not doing.

421
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,504
Speaker 0: they're down right now right because there's less demand for the chips.

422
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,994
Speaker 0: but they'll just have that line make something else.

423
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:27,348
Speaker 0: so it is in good time really.

424
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,263
Speaker 1: now again not one caveat is my knowledge of fab stuff is about a decade.

425
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:41,557
Speaker 0: the way TS MC works is basically every other company in the world your apples your Intel's your AMD's or whoever right?

426
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:44,269
Speaker 0: I guess Intel's their own fabs but everyone else right.

427
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,756
Speaker 0: who doesn't have their own fab?

428
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:52,420
Speaker 0: designs chips right and you send your designs to TMC and then they make the chip.

429
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,271
Speaker 0: they actually make the silicon wafer part for you right?

430
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:58,846
Speaker 0: so you know Apple designs the m2 chip sends it over.

431
00:31:59,187 --> 00:31:59,870
Speaker 0: they produce it.

432
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:03,145
Speaker 0: obviously apples like biggest customer one of the biggest customers.

433
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:18,471
Speaker 0: right but it's like that fab isn't just like a dead fab that can't do anything at all now right it's like either a eventually Apple will put in a new order or and it'll take some time to get it going or B it can do some other customers work.

434
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:26,074
Speaker 0: you know it might not gonna be overnight right but but Rachel is within a large ship manufacturer like that.

435
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:40,779
Speaker 1: from my understanding retooling a line is a very lengthy I've very expensive process and yields tend to go absolutely into the gutter with a newly tooled line.

436
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,771
Speaker 0: well it depends what you mean by retooling.

437
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:42,992
Speaker 0: right?

438
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:43,274
Speaker 0: it's like.

439
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:49,545
Speaker 0: you know if you're talking about like changing it from one like X nanometers to a different nanometer it's like that's basically they.

440
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,052
Speaker 0: it seems like TS MC.

441
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:53,104
Speaker 0: when they do that they just make a whole new fab.

442
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:53,788
Speaker 0: they don't seem like.

443
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:59,637
Speaker 0: I've never seen a news that was like ah they've changed this fab from this many to this many usually.

444
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:11,694
Speaker 1: well usually you have a fab and within a fab you have multiple channels or pipelines and I think some of those stories of technology like they'll share the same centering furnace but not all of them will.

445
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:17,139
Speaker 1: some of them will have a specialized function that other ones if you reason the TMC SMC news right.

446
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,570
Speaker 0: it's always like they're starting up a new fab.

447
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,203
Speaker 0: in this place it makes these kinds of chips.

448
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:26,207
Speaker 0: it seems like they've split it up to where each building makes a certain category of chip.

449
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:33,198
Speaker 0: and so as long as someone designs a chip in that category then the fab seems capable of you know producing it.

450
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:38,142
Speaker 0: but when it's a customer like Apple they'll often dedicate the entire fab to like that one customer.

451
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:39,990
Speaker 0: so you know it's.

452
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:43,525
Speaker 0: it's possible for I guess that fab to do something else but someone else would.

453
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:47,422
Speaker 0: some other customer would have to order an m2 like chip.

454
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:48,609
Speaker 1: but that's sort of.

455
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:54,981
Speaker 1: what's actually worrying me is not the chip thing but like the chip fab side of it like the black start of a manufacturing line or whatever.

456
00:33:55,482 --> 00:34:07,563
Speaker 1: but more that if the entire sector is collapsing then who is even gonna want that existing now idle fab capacity in the first place except militaries.

457
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:14,326
Speaker 1: and the only way out of this I see is if the whole Taiwan China thing actually blows up for real.

458
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:16,375
Speaker 1: then we'll see what happens.

459
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,081
Speaker 1: but this is that's not well.

460
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:25,110
Speaker 0: basically if China tries to go in right cuz TSMC is in Taiwan right most of it and most of their fabs are there right.

461
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:28,649
Speaker 0: basically if China goes in and tries to take the fabs it would.

462
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:31,422
Speaker 0: basically they would just ruin them right?

463
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:34,880
Speaker 0: not Taiwan would ruin them and be like oh you can't have now there I mean the u.s.

464
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:35,665
Speaker 1: is it war games?

465
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,274
Speaker 1: and they showed that pretty definitively.

466
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:39,303
Speaker 1: while the war would be horrific.

467
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,139
Speaker 1: there is no possible way to occupy permanently Taiwan right?

468
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,467
Speaker 0: nobody can take oh.

469
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:50,474
Speaker 0: the only way for those fabs to continue operating and continue to provide value is to leave Taiwan be right.

470
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:56,926
Speaker 0: if anyone tries to mess with Taiwan they'll just basically you know ruin their own shit and be like oh you can't make chips now.

471
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:58,134
Speaker 0: what'd you conquer?

472
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:58,757
Speaker 0: nothing you can't.

473
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:00,104
Speaker 0: a bunch of worthless crap right.

474
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:06,349
Speaker 1: good luck like in say oh here's my extremely unhappy city where I sold every building over the last ten turns.

475
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:08,436
Speaker 1: exactly so joy.

476
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:10,385
Speaker 0: that's not a concern right?

477
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:11,270
Speaker 0: the like you know.

478
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:16,933
Speaker 0: I guess it's a concern where if it happens that the then the chip supply will be in in in dire straits.

479
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:19,682
Speaker 1: well let's buy for everybody.

480
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:24,480
Speaker 1: yeah it's odd that that situation is actually pretty but I'm not.

481
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,149
Speaker 0: you know I'm not worried about that.

482
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:37,390
Speaker 0: I'm more worried about you know will companies continue to advance right for nerds who want and you know workers who want faster better desktop computers right?

483
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:44,498
Speaker 0: will Apple Intel Nvidia other companies continue to invest in improving that technology?

484
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:44,880
Speaker 0: is you know?

485
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:52,754
Speaker 0: are we gonna get to a point where Intel's like you know what 16th gen Intel CPU we're just gonna leave it at that the end?

486
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:55,524
Speaker 1: so uh the problem with that is this anger.

487
00:35:55,644 --> 00:36:03,581
Speaker 1: Apple gets like m5 and they're like you know what capital will be extremely unhappy if that happens even if that might be the right thing to do.

488
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:05,915
Speaker 1: I mean look at the geopolitical situation of the world right now.

489
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:10,639
Speaker 1: look at the crisis of a number of rare earth metals and other specific things.

490
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:17,427
Speaker 1: we need for chip manufacturing and we need a lot of chips for things that don't have as good of a margin as this kind of stuff.

491
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:24,240
Speaker 1: so a in a general tacit agreement of we don't need faster workstations for a decade might be better for the world.

492
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:26,108
Speaker 0: because I'm using this right.

493
00:36:26,128 --> 00:36:28,399
Speaker 0: they could just be like the m5 is so stupid.

494
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,652
Speaker 0: fast we'll make a bunch and then you know what.

495
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:33,107
Speaker 0: every once in a while it'll be like a book that goes out of print.

496
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:33,750
Speaker 0: it's like okay.

497
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:37,105
Speaker 0: when people need more computers we'll just make more m5.

498
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:46,308
Speaker 1: no workstation on do VR and play video games on is a sixth gen Intel i7 and a 1080 video GPU.

499
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:53,443
Speaker 0: yeah my computer is from 2018. it's five 8700.

500
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,731
Speaker 1: I think it's a 6700 K right.

501
00:36:56,273 --> 00:37:03,322
Speaker 0: it's like it's like five four or five generations of Intel chip behind what's current right and it still works just fine.

502
00:37:03,402 --> 00:37:05,009
Speaker 0: I've been having some RAM issues lately.

503
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:06,375
Speaker 0: I just add it.

504
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:08,003
Speaker 0: I had 32 gigs of RAM in there.

505
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,094
Speaker 0: I said you know what it's so inexpensive.

506
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:11,361
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna add 32 more.

507
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:12,949
Speaker 0: I got 64 gigs of RAM in there.

508
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:25,862
Speaker 0: it cost me nothing to add that and that's probably gonna extend the life of this computer for like another year or two if it weren't for the fact that you cannot run Windows 11 on a sixth-generation Intel.

509
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:36,562
Speaker 0: yeah mine at my 8700 is the the oldest one that can run Windows 11. yeah mine is Windows 10 and Windows 11 aren't really and only the user interface is different.

510
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:39,160
Speaker 1: oh I don't even care at all other than security like I don't want.

511
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,536
Speaker 1: Windows 10 is still supported until 2025 so I got some time still.

512
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:50,865
Speaker 1: yeah so you got two years right until planning to build a new computer until like the end of next year or maybe the following year.

513
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:52,590
Speaker 1: we'll see but you know.

514
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:57,969
Speaker 1: uh if I could run Windows 11 on this existing workstation.

515
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:04,644
Speaker 1: with this current CPU architecture I would just replace the power supply in the video card and I'd be good for seven or eight more years easily.

516
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:08,597
Speaker 1: so maybe this would be a good thing.

517
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:14,521
Speaker 1: but as we discussed this angers capital and I don't know what happens when capital is angry in this regard.

518
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:21,467
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

519
00:38:21,788 --> 00:38:27,344
Speaker 1: so I am a big fan of just one-off music videos that happen to be animated.

520
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:35,417
Speaker 1: I have a gigantic YouTube playlist that is just animated music videos not anime music videos that there are many a MVs in that list.

521
00:38:35,798 --> 00:38:42,644
Speaker 0: I just have an actual music videos like the official music video for a song but it happens to be that it was animated.

522
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:47,783
Speaker 0: such as you know Take on me or yeah sledgehammer both

523
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:52,782
Speaker 1: of those both of those are in my playlist or one of the reasons to join the playlist

524
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:59,914
Speaker 0: of the those all basically every song by that that project group that came up again recently that I forgot about for 20 years.

525
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:04,748
Speaker 0: yep so uh uh uh Fleet Fox really has got a few.

526
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:06,752
Speaker 0: yeah uh.

527
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:13,611
Speaker 1: so what I present to you Jonathan Young's starship velociraptor and just watch it.

528
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:25,328
Speaker 1: this is anime homage macross bubblegum crisis Gundam Akira the music video a little bit of ghost in the shell in there on your mark qualifies.

529
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:27,198
Speaker 1: oh yeah on your mark definitely qualifies.

530
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,909
Speaker 1: it was what was the name of that band?

531
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:33,653
Speaker 1: I for anyway it was that was a music video commissioned for a specific band that was popular at the time.

532
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:37,588
Speaker 0: I guess all right my thing of the day.

533
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:43,957
Speaker 0: so you know keep it in the AI theme that's been going on and is gonna keep going on for I don't know what you're thinking today.

534
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:44,661
Speaker 1: is I opened it?

535
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:45,969
Speaker 1: but I haven't I didn't.

536
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,934
Speaker 0: Oh look at it.

537
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:47,959
Speaker 0: look at it.

538
00:39:48,320 --> 00:40:01,333
Speaker 0: so you click on it and you're just gonna see a boring old in browser text editor and the top right it's like hey give us your you know open AI chat GBT API key right so that we don't have to pay the bills for you using this.

539
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:08,503
Speaker 0: and basically you give it your open AI API key in the top right and you can check a box for chat to use GPT for.

540
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:14,391
Speaker 0: and if you do that it'll obviously be better but also slower and I don't know how the pricing works on any of that.

541
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:31,877
Speaker 0: but basically what you do is you type in this box right English text and then this text editor Merlin editor dot verse l dot app will act as an editor so you don't have to hire an editor.

542
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:42,466
Speaker 0: hmm like you're talking like you know not just your spell checks and your grammar checks but like I've see you've used this you keep using the same word over and over again.

543
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:46,139
Speaker 0: try some different words like an editor like a human editor.

544
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:48,266
Speaker 0: it is quite.

545
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:48,808
Speaker 0: you know.

546
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:51,938
Speaker 0: it's obviously imperfect as all the machine learning.

547
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:59,990
Speaker 0: you know it's equal parts impressive and imperfect as you would expect from any of your other experiences with chat GPT.

548
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:06,951
Speaker 0: yeah but you know I think this is a yet another example of a good use of it right?

549
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:10,023
Speaker 0: it's like most people out there right.

550
00:41:10,063 --> 00:41:12,232
Speaker 0: this isn't taking work away from editors.

551
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:17,116
Speaker 0: someone who writes a novel isn't going to be using this right even if this improves tenfold.

552
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:21,556
Speaker 0: someone who writes a real book to be published I guess could use it if it was approved.

553
00:41:21,597 --> 00:41:30,107
Speaker 0: tenfold maybe but I think it's more likely that an actual editor would use it to make their own job easier.

554
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:40,147
Speaker 0: yeah but also someone who writes English text or maybe text in some other language I don't know what language is it supports who doesn't have an editor?

555
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:47,538
Speaker 0: because you're just writing your own damn blog post your own damn newsletter your own comment on a someone else's blog.

556
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:54,926
Speaker 0: you could get a pass from a virtual editor and improve the quality of the text you put into the world.

557
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:57,319
Speaker 1: and you know what it won't be perfect just like you know.

558
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:58,807
Speaker 1: I was testing Adobe podcast.

559
00:41:58,827 --> 00:41:59,190
Speaker 1: you know what.

560
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:02,903
Speaker 1: it's only 90% as good as I am doing it myself.

561
00:42:03,304 --> 00:42:04,027
Speaker 0: that's a lot.

562
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:07,159
Speaker 0: how does that compared to doing nothing exactly?

563
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,130
Speaker 0: so if I do if I happen it's like yes it was.

564
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:15,048
Speaker 0: this compared to a real like the best editors on earth is obviously flawed.

565
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:18,820
Speaker 0: how does it compare to throwing up the text I wrote unedited?

566
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:31,114
Speaker 1: that is that point is something a lot of people are missing in the AI debate there there and they look at the flaws of these kinds of tools today and say things like yeah it can never replace you.

567
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,547
Speaker 1: oh it day it is definitely going to replace a human.

568
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:34,993
Speaker 0: yes it's like.

569
00:42:35,154 --> 00:42:38,246
Speaker 0: you know this the artwork generator right.

570
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:40,757
Speaker 0: it's like is it taking a work away from an artist?

571
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:44,775
Speaker 0: and it's like anyone who is gonna pay an artist is still gonna pay an artist.

572
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:49,676
Speaker 0: but me I was gonna use some Google image search or I was gonna draw something really hideous.

573
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:56,659
Speaker 0: so replacing my hideous drawing with a generated drawing that is superior it's good.

574
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:13,277
Speaker 0: yeah as long as I'm not like lying about it or anything you know in the moment geek nuts book club book the satanic versus pretty good I'm more than halfway done and I know I got to say now not right is that?

575
00:43:13,518 --> 00:43:14,282
Speaker 0: you know this is just.

576
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:21,190
Speaker 0: you know they I guess if you went to a library or a bookstore right they would just qualify this as like adult fiction.

577
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,664
Speaker 0: right it would be in that adult fiction section.

578
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:24,428
Speaker 0: we're like.

579
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,436
Speaker 0: you know the bestsellers are and such.

580
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:27,018
Speaker 0: right.

581
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,454
Speaker 0: but let's be honest with ourselves this is a fantasy novel right?

582
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,920
Speaker 0: oh yeah this is just.

583
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,217
Speaker 0: this is just a fantasy novel right this is very geek nights appropriate.

584
00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:38,725
Speaker 0: this shit goes on the show.

585
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:42,004
Speaker 0: it's not a series fantasy novel where there's gonna be multiple books.

586
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:43,291
Speaker 0: it's just a one a one booker.

587
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:49,951
Speaker 0: but you know you can put this on the shelf right next to all your your dragon.

588
00:43:50,131 --> 00:44:04,157
Speaker 1: oh if you had someone picked it up and did not know any of the context in the world of the creation of this book they would just that they would just think oh another fantasy novel.

589
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:04,801
Speaker 1: that was pretty good.

590
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:08,338
Speaker 0: and I think you know it's like William Gibson.

591
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:09,403
Speaker 0: he writes the same.

592
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:10,729
Speaker 0: he writes adult novels.

593
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:13,581
Speaker 0: they just happen to actually go in the sci-fi section.

594
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:22,083
Speaker 0: yeah right it's like William Gibson could easily try to get his novels in the adult fiction section that is separate from the nerd section of the bookstore.

595
00:44:22,486 --> 00:44:23,892
Speaker 0: right and no one would question that.

596
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:25,478
Speaker 0: and I think

597
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:42,711
Speaker 1: you know what was the quote I just remember from like high school someone read a bookstore with like some friends the family or whatever and someone said something to the point of the adult fiction section is mostly books about people going through a messy divorce and finding themselves.

598
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,465
Speaker 1: yeah yeah pretty good.

599
00:44:47,505 --> 00:44:56,209
Speaker 1: if you haven't started reading it yet because of the weighty history and like geopolitics of this book just pick it up.

600
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,856
Speaker 0: treat none of those.

601
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,207
Speaker 0: none of those things appear in the text of the book.

602
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,191
Speaker 1: yeah did you?

603
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:03,479
Speaker 0: did you read Wikipedia?

604
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:14,785
Speaker 0: yeah if you didn't read Wikipedia or the news or know who Rushdie was or anything before reading this book and I you could you would just read like you know a high quality fantasy novel.

605
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:20,679
Speaker 1: if you didn't know it'd be like if you read the Lord of the Rings and then found out that people were trying to kill Tolkien for 40 years because of it.

606
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:29,600
Speaker 0: right all right it's not but even though it's fantasy novel I think you know it's not adventury it's not a event.

607
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,022
Speaker 1: you know what.

608
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:30,966
Speaker 1: you know what this book is.

609
00:45:30,986 --> 00:45:46,847
Speaker 0: it is allegorical with a capital a that's underlined like 10 times and also even though there is much magic and you know fantasy things happening it takes place in the quote present which is 1980 X of the real world right.

610
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,958
Speaker 0: so I think that might be what you know.

611
00:45:49,239 --> 00:46:03,621
Speaker 0: almost every fantasy novel takes place in you know some imaginary world that's not earth or most of them right or some future or the distant past whereas this took place in the present at the time it was published and that'll help keep you out of the nerd section of the bookstore.

612
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:06,873
Speaker 0: yeah all right.

613
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:10,329
Speaker 1: so we're not gonna talk at least much about the aesthetics of fonts.

614
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,349
Speaker 0: we're gonna know about fun episode already I think so we don't need to though.

615
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:20,276
Speaker 1: at the very end I burned before the show I thought real hard and I made a list of my five favorite fonts.

616
00:46:20,316 --> 00:46:22,286
Speaker 1: I'm sure I forgot something but I think I got.

617
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,955
Speaker 0: I got six favorite funds.

618
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:26,448
Speaker 1: I forced myself to cut it down to five and it was hard.

619
00:46:26,669 --> 00:46:33,114
Speaker 1: someone didn't make the cut but anyway I bet we have exactly one that overlaps and only one but anyway.

620
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:37,850
Speaker 0: so anyway fonts technologically speaking right is okay.

621
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:43,590
Speaker 0: you want to you know have a computer and you want text to appear on the computer.

622
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,101
Speaker 0: right how the hell do we do this?

623
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:52,988
Speaker 0: well back in the day right there were basically like these hard coded pixel fonts in ROMs.

624
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:53,891
Speaker 0: you know what they were like.

625
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:56,444
Speaker 1: they were like sprite sheets in video games.

626
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:57,690
Speaker 0: basically well they were.

627
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:12,599
Speaker 0: it's like yeah what that's what if you whether you're using MS-DOS or you know you're a BIOS on an old 90s computer or Final Fantasy 1 text right it's like there is a space in the ROM of the game.

628
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,552
Speaker 0: right and there's basically a sprite sheet.

629
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:21,034
Speaker 0: right pixels that are like on and off and it's like this is what the letter a looks like.

630
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:28,967
Speaker 0: right it's you know these pixels are white and these ones are not white or black and the other ones are not black.

631
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,759
Speaker 1: that way the computer knows I'm rendering text I can.

632
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,848
Speaker 1: the letter a is gonna go here.

633
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,018
Speaker 1: let me just go fetch what a letter a looks like.

634
00:47:36,138 --> 00:47:37,083
Speaker 0: right you have some.

635
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,268
Speaker 0: you have some binary.

636
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,946
Speaker 0: you have some binary code which is originally in the olden days ASCII.

637
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:47,475
Speaker 0: right I don't even know what ASCII stands for right but basically it's just a character mapping right.

638
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:51,833
Speaker 0: it says this series of ones and zeros equals the letter.

639
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,119
Speaker 1: a code for information exchange.

640
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:56,364
Speaker 0: okay interchange.

641
00:47:56,745 --> 00:47:58,209
Speaker 0: why it's a CII?

642
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:03,947
Speaker 1: I mean the fixed protocol stands for the financial information exchange.

643
00:48:04,068 --> 00:48:07,262
Speaker 0: so okay sure anyway but it's very much like you know.

644
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,649
Speaker 0: the number one is this letter.

645
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:09,896
Speaker 0: the number two is this letter.

646
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:11,163
Speaker 0: the number three is this letter.

647
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:24,138
Speaker 0: so you have a series of numbers right and then a string in the computer's memory and then a program comes along and says okay I have to draw that those text on this that that memory over there those bits.

648
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,604
Speaker 0: the program that I am says that those bits are text and I'm gonna draw that text on the screen.

649
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:41,695
Speaker 0: let me go look at that memory and it says number one and then I look up on the sprite sheet what letter that is and I make a light of those pixels on the screen and now you can see that letter right.

650
00:48:41,876 --> 00:48:46,173
Speaker 0: and that's how fonts worked and still work in a lot of computer things.

651
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:57,534
Speaker 0: right it's it's really straightforward and simple but there's so much to do with human languages and human alphabets that that wasn't gonna work forever.

652
00:48:57,775 --> 00:48:57,995
Speaker 0: right?

653
00:48:58,658 --> 00:49:05,845
Speaker 0: you got different languages you got all sorts of different situations you know with different accent characters.

654
00:49:05,866 --> 00:49:12,692
Speaker 1: we moved away from computers whose sole ability to interact with the screen was a grid of very large blocks.

655
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:13,957
Speaker 1: you could put sprites into.

656
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:18,397
Speaker 0: yeah computers had more memory and I could accommodate more letters.

657
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:22,173
Speaker 0: and also there's different type of graphic features.

658
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:28,358
Speaker 0: right where you're not where it's not necessarily true that just these are the X symbols.

659
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,523
Speaker 0: that's all the symbols.

660
00:49:29,563 --> 00:49:30,968
Speaker 0: there are the end right.

661
00:49:31,149 --> 00:49:35,066
Speaker 0: there's all sorts of situations that we can discuss at least some of them.

662
00:49:35,247 --> 00:49:39,206
Speaker 1: yeah now it's very important to internalize that fonts are technical.

663
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:46,212
Speaker 1: the actual technology of fonts is very confusing and often obscure and that is absolutely true.

664
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,749
Speaker 1: don't feel like you're dummy because you don't know how fonts work.

665
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,156
Speaker 1: I barely know how fonts work.

666
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:54,873
Speaker 0: no it's the people who know how to make fonts work use this like it.

667
00:49:54,913 --> 00:50:04,636
Speaker 0: you know difficult to use software and they craft fonts and it's it's very painstaking labor-intensive work and that's why they sell fonts for hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

668
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:13,570
Speaker 0: yeah and you know it's like is extremely difficult you know especially if you get everything right.

669
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:16,788
Speaker 0: and you know there's a lot of free fonts out there and free fonts.

670
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:24,884
Speaker 0: you know there's plenty of them and a lot of them are terrific but few of them are truly complete and comprehensive and totally correct etc.

671
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:25,527
Speaker 0: it's also.

672
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,672
Speaker 1: some of them are viruses.

673
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:27,798
Speaker 1: some of them are pirated.

674
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:29,667
Speaker 0: that's not that's you know.

675
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,457
Speaker 0: that's only if you go to weird shady websites.

676
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:31,759
Speaker 1: also.

677
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:39,558
Speaker 1: that's less of a problem now because one thing most of you listening to geek nights are probably young enough to just live in a world where fonts kind of just work.

678
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,350
Speaker 1: that is not how Windows computers were.

679
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:55,585
Speaker 0: they kind of just work until you try to do anything special with them and realize oh wait you know these fonts are actually super basic fonts that don't do anything fancy yeah like only rail.

680
00:50:55,645 --> 00:51:00,688
Speaker 1: only in the last six or seven years did Adobe fonts just work to the point that it literally just works.

681
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:01,874
Speaker 1: I don't think about it anymore.

682
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:04,791
Speaker 0: there you you haven't tried to do any fancy font.

683
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,016
Speaker 1: this no but I have.

684
00:51:06,116 --> 00:51:06,678
Speaker 1: I bought one.

685
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:13,834
Speaker 1: I studiously only use fonts that I can enable via Adobe because I pay for it and I just stay away from everything else for the most right.

686
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:16,007
Speaker 0: but I'm saying is even those fonts a lot?

687
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:21,148
Speaker 1: but I'm saying even that used to not work like Windows 3 1 1. good fucking luck.

688
00:51:21,188 --> 00:51:22,192
Speaker 1: installing a font.

689
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:24,059
Speaker 0: well Windows 2 fonts are different.

690
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,786
Speaker 0: then yeah it was 95 they were different.

691
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,056
Speaker 1: Windows 2000 they were different.

692
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:33,343
Speaker 1: fonts are only relatively recently generally standardized in terms of how computers use them.

693
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:34,510
Speaker 0: well there's the open type.

694
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,137
Speaker 0: you know fonts right is.

695
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:50,949
Speaker 0: basically they came up with a standard called open type and whether it's a true type font or an OTF like they're slightly different in like the headers and some other reasons but basically they're all following like this open type font standard which is like the core of all modern fonts.

696
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:59,095
Speaker 0: and what a font is nowadays technologically is a file and in the file are you know shapes right.

697
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:05,662
Speaker 0: it's not just pixels it's like a you know a vectorized shape that matches a particular Unicode character code.

698
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:07,912
Speaker 0: right ASCII only had so many characters.

699
00:52:08,554 --> 00:52:23,502
Speaker 0: Unicode encompasses all of ASCII and then a shit ton more including emojis and every character from every alphabet and every language and even more and there's empty space in it that for more characters that people come up with and that's why you see new emojis coming out occasionally.

700
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:34,769
Speaker 0: and so if you want to make a complete font your font has to in cap you know encapsulate every character from every alphabet in every language and all of Unicode.

701
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:38,020
Speaker 0: it's like almost no fonts actually cover all of it right?

702
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:43,539
Speaker 0: maybe there might even be zero fonts that I know.

703
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,787
Speaker 0: some fonts like fill in the let like.

704
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:49,344
Speaker 0: you know if a font is primarily for one language like that you know they'll like.

705
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:57,585
Speaker 0: just feel they'll just take an existing font that covers like all of Unicode and just redo the characters that they care about right in their language.

706
00:52:57,726 --> 00:53:03,652
Speaker 0: and that way at least if characters appear in some other language in someone's text it'll font will just be different.

707
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,520
Speaker 0: that happens sometimes.

708
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:17,609
Speaker 0: but yeah you have to draw all these shapes and then you have to put special instructions right to handle all sorts of weird situations and some non weird situations non weird situations.

709
00:53:17,649 --> 00:53:20,759
Speaker 0: being well bold right how do you do bold?

710
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:27,833
Speaker 0: a lot of times you just draw another shape that's like well this is the shape when it's not bold and this is the shape when it's bold.

711
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,969
Speaker 0: right just two different shapes and then it's like all.

712
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:31,733
Speaker 0: right it's italic.

713
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:34,245
Speaker 0: well okay I'm gonna draw the shape a third time.

714
00:53:34,265 --> 00:53:36,556
Speaker 0: this is what it looks like when it's italic.

715
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:43,968
Speaker 0: it's like you're just drawing the shapes over and over again and then you get the weird situations right.

716
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,076
Speaker 0: we're talking about things like ligatures.

717
00:53:46,398 --> 00:53:47,161
Speaker 0: right it's like.

718
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:51,638
Speaker 0: okay someone wrote the letter lowercase T. well okay good.

719
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:55,773
Speaker 0: and then they wrote another lowercase T. that immediately follows it.

720
00:53:55,894 --> 00:54:03,450
Speaker 0: it's like well you know if you have two lowercase T's next to each other it's pretty common to like draw two sticks and have one line across both.

721
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:10,135
Speaker 1: now that's not gonna fly with like a monospace sprite sheet font right that that's what you know.

722
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:17,108
Speaker 0: if you just put two separate lowercase T's next to each other with like a gap in between it's like it's gonna look weird right?

723
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,942
Speaker 0: it's not wrong it's you know or anything like that.

724
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:21,610
Speaker 0: it just doesn't look right it's.

725
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:27,314
Speaker 0: that's not how typography works even though right that would be easy for computers to work.

726
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:39,747
Speaker 0: so there's a thing called a ligature which detects when you know there are certain combinations of characters adjacent to each other in certain patterns and in it will replace right the characters.

727
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:50,086
Speaker 0: you know the that those shapes that would normally be there with yet another shape right two T's next to each other or you know all kinds of other.

728
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:51,593
Speaker 0: that's just the first one that comes to mind.

729
00:54:51,693 --> 00:55:00,208
Speaker 0: but there's there's quite a few of them right and that you got situations like there's capital letters and lowercase letters.

730
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:03,902
Speaker 0: some languages have uppercase and lowercase some don't.

731
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:06,914
Speaker 1: yep Turkish because I spent a lot of time in Turkey.

732
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:12,319
Speaker 1: you can have I with and without the dot and you can capitalize I with and without the dot.

733
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:20,274
Speaker 0: yep one of my favorite things that this is something I really you know once I learned about it it really bothers me because I want to use it.

734
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:33,304
Speaker 0: almost no fonts almost no fonts support it correctly right and but when you look at like professionally typeset text you see it all the time and it's like I want to be able to do that.

735
00:55:33,806 --> 00:55:40,992
Speaker 0: but to get a font that can do it is usually either very limited in your choices or it's very expensive.

736
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,640
Speaker 0: and that is small caps right.

737
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,589
Speaker 0: so there's a in the open type font.

738
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,134
Speaker 0: you know format right.

739
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:55,983
Speaker 0: if you get an actual I guess Apple computers you can open up like the fancy font dialog and see these options.

740
00:55:56,044 --> 00:55:56,929
Speaker 0: I know an InDesign.

741
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:57,632
Speaker 0: you could open it.

742
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:05,661
Speaker 0: I guess in your web browser if you CSS you can access all the open type font flags to enable and disable font features.

743
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:15,738
Speaker 0: but basically there's all these features that you can explicitly enable or disable on a font if the font supports those features right.

744
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:22,823
Speaker 0: so small caps is basically saying like okay here's the letter O lowercase here's the letter O uppercase.

745
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:31,583
Speaker 0: and but there's also small caps which is like okay you're gonna render it the way it's rendered as when it's uppercase which is not the same right.

746
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:37,812
Speaker 0: like you think a capital T the cross is on the top of the bar right it's whereas a lowercase T the cross is in the middle.

747
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:40,643
Speaker 0: but a small caps will be.

748
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:46,746
Speaker 0: the bar will be at the top because it's an uppercase letter but it'll be short because it's small.

749
00:56:46,947 --> 00:56:49,154
Speaker 0: it won't be like this big T right.

750
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:59,004
Speaker 0: and it's common to use small caps for like a heading centered on like a section or table headers or other it's.

751
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:03,500
Speaker 0: if you look at if you read books you'll see and you start thinking about small caps like.

752
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:06,391
Speaker 0: you'll see them a lot and it's like.

753
00:57:06,612 --> 00:57:08,581
Speaker 0: but now go try to type them on your computer.

754
00:57:08,923 --> 00:57:22,335
Speaker 0: yeah go to your you go to your text editor you're in design even if you have it and you go to the open type for a CSS and you enable the open type font feature flag SMCP small cap right and you'll notice.

755
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:29,301
Speaker 0: okay all the letters are now capitals and they're clearly smaller than the actual capital letters.

756
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,970
Speaker 0: right but something is off about them.

757
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:48,254
Speaker 0: they don't look the way they do when people use small caps and books right and that's because almost all software when told to do small caps will just take the actual capital letters and shrink them down right which is actually not correct.

758
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:49,561
Speaker 0: the spacing will be off.

759
00:57:49,621 --> 00:57:51,471
Speaker 0: basically everything about those will be off.

760
00:57:52,012 --> 00:58:04,795
Speaker 0: actual small caps are another set of shapes with their own rules for spacing and whatever to look correct and almost no fonts come with actual small caps with and yeah you know.

761
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:11,598
Speaker 0: so it's like and that's just one of many many you know open type font feature flags.

762
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:14,810
Speaker 0: other ones are like old-style numerals you ever see.

763
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,950
Speaker 0: like like the threes hang low like you'll often see those used in a book.

764
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:29,653
Speaker 0: for like you know page numbers yeah right we're like the three will have a little curl at the bottom of it and it what they won't just be lined up straight like the numbers will be at different elevations some hanging low some up high.

765
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:33,470
Speaker 0: you know people do that for like the address on their house.

766
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:36,042
Speaker 0: they'll have like the numbers not in a straight line.

767
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:39,577
Speaker 0: so you need to have a font that supports old-style numerals.

768
00:58:39,658 --> 00:58:45,300
Speaker 0: yeah it's just so much shit that goes into making a correct font right.

769
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:51,964
Speaker 0: and then even if you sort it out all that shit right then you got to worry about the hinting right.

770
00:58:52,245 --> 00:59:03,107
Speaker 0: back in the day we had CRT monitors where all the texts were basically everything was a little bit blurry because every phosphor on the screen was a little bit blurry.

771
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:06,279
Speaker 0: right they weren't crisp right.

772
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,712
Speaker 0: so you could just render your font as straight-up pixels.

773
00:59:10,074 --> 00:59:12,850
Speaker 0: and when it showed up on the screen it looked kind of nice and it was.

774
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,472
Speaker 0: it was all good.

775
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:14,676
Speaker 1: see also sprites.

776
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:21,280
Speaker 1: and why hard sprites on modern displays are not how anyone ever intended those old games to look right.

777
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:26,358
Speaker 0: but now we got an LCD screen and an LCD screen.

778
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:28,966
Speaker 0: everything is a square right.

779
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:35,409
Speaker 0: and even though we've made those squares really really really small nowadays there's still squares.

780
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:40,086
Speaker 0: and if you just render a font the old way with no anti aliasing no nothing.

781
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:44,302
Speaker 0: on an LCD screen it looks pixely AF and it looks bad.

782
00:59:44,322 --> 00:59:45,687
Speaker 0: it looks awful right.

783
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:54,598
Speaker 0: so they've got this thing called hinting right where you know as the the font gets bigger and smaller right.

784
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:56,023
Speaker 0: well it's like.

785
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:56,364
Speaker 0: you know.

786
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:57,848
Speaker 0: you're okay.

787
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:01,848
Speaker 0: there might be a diagonal in the font in the letter somewhere like a letter a capital.

788
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,336
Speaker 0: a has a diagonal right.

789
01:00:03,758 --> 01:00:07,176
Speaker 0: so it's like okay well do you just make a staircase of pixels that are on and off.

790
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:09,188
Speaker 0: it'll look like it'll look bad right you got.

791
01:00:09,248 --> 01:00:18,845
Speaker 0: you want to make it look like a smooth sharp angle right on both sides of the letter a or the V or the W or any kind of angular thing or curve thing as well.

792
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:24,306
Speaker 0: what you end up doing is you want to turn on parts of pixels right.

793
01:00:24,627 --> 01:00:29,307
Speaker 0: the pixels in the LCD are arranged I get is it red green then blue or green?

794
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:30,070
Speaker 0: in order.

795
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:33,719
Speaker 0: there's three colors in order right.

796
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:34,804
Speaker 0: so it's like all right.

797
01:00:34,904 --> 01:00:46,254
Speaker 0: well even though obviously the letter is all black against a white background what if on that pixel on that sort of angle there we just turn on the red part a little bit right?

798
01:00:46,716 --> 01:00:47,158
Speaker 0: and it's like.

799
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:53,526
Speaker 0: we know the red you know we know that the blue is on the right side of the pixel and we know the red is on the left side of the pixel.

800
01:00:53,547 --> 01:01:08,401
Speaker 0: so we'll just turn on those edge pixels some of the colors right and we can make the thing look really sharp without necessarily everything just being you know black right and a staircase.

801
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:22,578
Speaker 0: and so you have to put all this hinting information into the font so that the font renderer you know it has some knowledge in it whether it's like the Microsoft TrueType or whatever it has to have some hints right you're.

802
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:23,723
Speaker 0: that's why it's called a hint.

803
01:01:24,045 --> 01:01:27,702
Speaker 0: you're sort of in the font you're giving a hint to the font renderer.

804
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:31,999
Speaker 0: here is the best way to make these letters look good on an LCD.

805
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:33,244
Speaker 0: help me out here.

806
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:36,437
Speaker 0: and if you don't do this everything looks like garbage.

807
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:46,017
Speaker 0: and that's why for many years and even still today a lot of people like hey why do fonts look so good on Apple devices and not so good on other devices?

808
01:01:46,158 --> 01:01:47,264
Speaker 0: it's like they got.

809
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:49,414
Speaker 0: they were better at this earlier than other people.

810
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:51,948
Speaker 1: the rendering doesn't matter what good font you use.

811
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:54,297
Speaker 1: if it's rendered the wrong way it's gonna look weird.

812
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:58,434
Speaker 1: and beyond that what about the technology of like?

813
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:07,273
Speaker 1: if you want to put a font on a website that's actually way more complex than it used to be you can't just assume everyone has the font that you want.

814
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:08,840
Speaker 0: well it it depends right.

815
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:24,846
Speaker 0: so when you make if you're making a website in your CSS you can put the names of fonts you want to use right and if someone on their computer happens to have one of those fonts then sure enough the web browser if it's allowed to will try to use that font.

816
01:02:24,887 --> 01:02:38,077
Speaker 0: yep I do give them a priority and it uses the first one on the list that it can do exactly but you can also provide a WAF file right which is basically just another sort of format of OpenType font right.

817
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:52,233
Speaker 0: you can even provide just OTF files if you wanted to but you use WAF files like the standard and as you put these font files somewhere available and you then put a in your CSS you say all right listen up web browser.

818
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:53,297
Speaker 0: there's a font.

819
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:54,501
Speaker 0: it's called Scott's font.

820
01:02:55,324 --> 01:03:03,630
Speaker 0: the WAF file for it is here right and if you want to use it for this text right that's that's my top priority.

821
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:05,537
Speaker 0: you know you please use that one.

822
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:10,035
Speaker 0: you can't force them to but you sort of tell them to and you can also tell them.

823
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:16,243
Speaker 0: oh by the way enable these ligatures and you you know all your OpenType font flags also go in there.

824
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:23,837
Speaker 0: and the weight of the font the spacing of the font the kerning of the font the height you know line spacing all this you know.

825
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:25,165
Speaker 0: but you can put everything in there.

826
01:03:25,326 --> 01:03:29,811
Speaker 1: but then some jerk in their web browser might have just said yeah use Arial for every website.

827
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:33,001
Speaker 1: I don't care and no one will ever see it.

828
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:33,382
Speaker 0: Arial?

829
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:34,606
Speaker 0: Arial?

830
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:38,497
Speaker 1: I've never heard anyone say the name of that font out loud before.

831
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,242
Speaker 0: Just Arial?

832
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:42,729
Speaker 1: It's a bad font.

833
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:47,219
Speaker 1: it's not like I use it.

834
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:49,204
Speaker 0: But yeah it's like.

835
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:50,627
Speaker 0: you know it's it's tough.

836
01:03:50,687 --> 01:03:52,312
Speaker 0: and then there's the other problem.

837
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:52,573
Speaker 0: is it?

838
01:03:52,613 --> 01:04:05,953
Speaker 0: nowadays a lot of people are there have been you know some various privacy issues right regarding fonts in web browsers right and there's two tricks that have been used that I'm aware of.

839
01:04:05,993 --> 01:04:07,000
Speaker 0: I think there's probably others.

840
01:04:07,602 --> 01:04:22,173
Speaker 0: the first trick is that they used to be able to figure out like what fonts were on your computer right and you know most people only have like the default system fonts and so all those people would look basically the same.

841
01:04:22,194 --> 01:04:23,600
Speaker 1: Oh but you got a weird font.

842
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:25,729
Speaker 1: you're pretty easy to track now.

843
01:04:26,091 --> 01:04:28,742
Speaker 0: Right if you install a different font it's like okay.

844
01:04:29,044 --> 01:04:36,176
Speaker 0: well you know it's like if you have these fonts if you have the standard fonts plus this one extra weird font installed on your computer.

845
01:04:36,919 --> 01:04:42,161
Speaker 0: that's probably unique among computers that caught that specific combination of fonts.

846
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:50,499
Speaker 0: so if the web browser can look up a list of the fonts that your computer has now they can uniquely identify you across the whole internet.

847
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,673
Speaker 0: it's like you visit another website and like oh that's Scott.

848
01:04:52,774 --> 01:04:54,965
Speaker 0: we just saw him on that other website that has ad tracking.

849
01:04:56,030 --> 01:05:05,810
Speaker 0: so as long as you block all ad tracking shit yes won't get you but if you don't and you installed even one custom font it's like that's not a uniquely identifying thing.

850
01:05:05,931 --> 01:05:10,715
Speaker 0: I think web browsers may have also made changes to sort of prevent that maybe but it was a thing.

851
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:11,841
Speaker 0: if it's not still a thing.

852
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,009
Speaker 1: Okay cuz I got a third thing.

853
01:05:14,591 --> 01:05:23,698
Speaker 0: No the second thing is that they'll make a website that just uses a weird font right and it's like you know.

854
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:29,797
Speaker 0: the font itself is now tracking right that you know the font.

855
01:05:29,857 --> 01:05:30,800
Speaker 0: it's like your web browser.

856
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:31,523
Speaker 0: you told it.

857
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:37,566
Speaker 0: whenever I go to a website right download the fonts and use the ones that they tell me to use.

858
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:47,689
Speaker 0: okay well now these ten websites all use the same font file on the same font server and they see that you visit the website and that oh you've already got the font.

859
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:48,916
Speaker 0: you're not requesting it again.

860
01:05:49,338 --> 01:05:52,489
Speaker 0: you must have already visited one of my ten shady website.

861
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:56,763
Speaker 0: yeah right clearly I now know who you are.

862
01:05:56,783 --> 01:05:57,406
Speaker 0: right.

863
01:05:57,968 --> 01:06:02,725
Speaker 0: mister already has my shady font right on the publishing side.

864
01:06:03,247 --> 01:06:23,190
Speaker 1: a lot of people have been caught in shenanigans when Microsoft Word changed its default font to Calibri because that font didn't exist in public until 2007. so if someone purports to have a document from before 2007 and it is in the Calibri font.

865
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:25,998
Speaker 1: they're definitely lying and a lot not.

866
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:38,127
Speaker 1: a number of big court cases and big things have been solved by the fact that the default Microsoft Word font was in a document that was purported to be from before Microsoft released that fonts.

867
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:44,132
Speaker 0: yeah see it I guess you know the business of getting font files right.

868
01:06:44,192 --> 01:06:46,424
Speaker 0: it's like there are free fonts which I already mentioned.

869
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:48,859
Speaker 0: you really want to get you know some open-source e ones.

870
01:06:48,899 --> 01:06:59,181
Speaker 0: the thing is most of the open-source e fonts are gonna be you know mono space fonts that programmers made for themselves right the one font that you know.

871
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:04,806
Speaker 0: you go to Google fonts or whatever or you know something like that and you can find fonts there.

872
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:09,261
Speaker 0: but a lot of the free fonts are like not actually very good.

873
01:07:09,301 --> 01:07:16,436
Speaker 0: there's a reason that they're free yeah and it's like sure you can use them and they might look nice for whatever small time thing you're doing.

874
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:35,059
Speaker 0: but as soon as you try to do anything that's serious and you want to enable any of those open type features you know you want to actually render you know produce an actual work of text that's somewhat fancy or you know typographically correct in any way and a lot of those fonts just collapse immediately.

875
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:36,688
Speaker 0: they're like no I can't do that nicely.

876
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:37,634
Speaker 0: I can't do that nicely.

877
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,666
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter how much you fiddle with me.

878
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:46,654
Speaker 0: it's never gonna look nice if you try to Photoshop with me because I'm not a fancy font I'm some free font.

879
01:07:46,674 --> 01:07:52,076
Speaker 0: you got from somewhere right and the free fonts that support all those features are a few.

880
01:07:52,357 --> 01:07:56,452
Speaker 0: you only have a few choices but one font that's free.

881
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,998
Speaker 0: that I can suggest.

882
01:07:58,038 --> 01:08:04,521
Speaker 0: it's not one of my favorite fonts it's just a free you know sans-serif font that has a lot of features.

883
01:08:04,562 --> 01:08:05,104
Speaker 0: not all of them.

884
01:08:05,144 --> 01:08:06,188
Speaker 0: it doesn't have the small caps.

885
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:10,443
Speaker 0: yeah it's called inter by Rasmus Anderson.

886
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:19,649
Speaker 0: so if you just want some you know sans-serif text and you want a free font then you know there you go.

887
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:28,085
Speaker 0: but if you want fonts that look real nice you're gonna have and you you know you're actually gonna be doing some professional work with them.

888
01:08:28,345 --> 01:08:33,006
Speaker 0: you know printing up something or working for a business or whatever.

889
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:35,979
Speaker 0: you got to pay for fonts and the prices are outrageous.

890
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:45,826
Speaker 1: yep now what outrageous I pay for Adobe and Adobe has Adobe fonts and you cannot do anything with every font.

891
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:50,243
Speaker 1: but the license terms are pretty good and pretty understandable.

892
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:54,943
Speaker 0: yeah most of those fonts most of those fonts though are just free fonts.

893
01:08:55,104 --> 01:09:01,169
Speaker 0: also right they just happen to be in there with all the other ones but they do just work in the Adobe stuff.

894
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:12,533
Speaker 0: yeah but the problem is a lot of those fonts like I said if you actually try to do any serious typographical work a lot of them just don't support the fancy features.

895
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:13,136
Speaker 0: yeah they're.

896
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:14,724
Speaker 0: they're very bare-bones fonts.

897
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:20,345
Speaker 0: you you have to if you want fonts that actually do all those all the things correctly.

898
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:23,215
Speaker 0: your choices are limited if you don't pay money.

899
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:32,450
Speaker 1: so I guess as we've gone on long my my favorite fonts Calibri I actually do really like the default like word font like.

900
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:33,474
Speaker 1: it's a fine font.

901
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:35,662
Speaker 1: it's like very utilitarian.

902
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:40,578
Speaker 1: my favorite sans sans serif font is still source sans Pro.

903
01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:42,345
Speaker 1: I've loved that thing for a long time.

904
01:09:42,366 --> 01:09:43,752
Speaker 1: I use it a lot of stuff.

905
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:47,670
Speaker 1: I think it's a really good fun Berkeley mono the one that you let you.

906
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,858
Speaker 0: uh did you pay for that also?

907
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:51,706
Speaker 1: oh yeah it's a fucking amazing font.

908
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:56,446
Speaker 0: okay yeah I've been using that for my programming since it was a thing of the day.

909
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,680
Speaker 1: it's so stylish and it just feels really good.

910
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:01,689
Speaker 0: I can cross that off my list.

911
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:02,775
Speaker 0: they're gonna make a new font.

912
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:03,821
Speaker 0: at least they said they were.

913
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:04,805
Speaker 0: we'll see if they do.

914
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:06,231
Speaker 1: I do like Futura.

915
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:09,243
Speaker 0: it's like kind of a feature is also on my list.

916
01:10:09,263 --> 01:10:13,997
Speaker 0: that's the 2001 Space Odyssey tell card font right.

917
01:10:14,358 --> 01:10:20,863
Speaker 1: and my last one is one that is definitely not on your list and I like it for reasons highway gothic.

918
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:24,802
Speaker 1: that is the font of almost all road signs in the Western Hemisphere.

919
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:26,571
Speaker 0: okay no one cares about that.

920
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:30,109
Speaker 1: it's a cool font because it's designed for legibility and it's there.

921
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:31,375
Speaker 1: it's got some stuff going on like it.

922
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:33,787
Speaker 1: it is neat and I recommend reading about it.

923
01:10:33,887 --> 01:10:37,121
Speaker 1: but to be clear do not use that in like your essay.

924
01:10:37,141 --> 01:10:41,618
Speaker 0: hmm so the fonts that are on my list that rim didn't mention right.

925
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:43,644
Speaker 0: so there's charter.

926
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:46,995
Speaker 0: charter is actually a free font right.

927
01:10:47,256 --> 01:10:48,139
Speaker 0: that is excellent it.

928
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:57,939
Speaker 0: I don't know if the free one has all the options in it but basically it's the text that looks like text you would find in like if you got a paperback novel.

929
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:05,443
Speaker 1: I was about to say this looks like body text in a textbook from 1978. that I would know.

930
01:11:05,584 --> 01:11:08,457
Speaker 0: it's if you just buy a paperback novel off the shelf.

931
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:09,341
Speaker 0: right you know.

932
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:09,964
Speaker 0: and it's like you.

933
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:11,030
Speaker 0: look at the body text.

934
01:11:11,593 --> 01:11:12,458
Speaker 0: it's very you know.

935
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:16,736
Speaker 0: it probably might not be exactly charter but it's really similar.

936
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:17,981
Speaker 0: it's like the you know and it's.

937
01:11:18,122 --> 01:11:26,889
Speaker 0: it's a free easy to get you know designed in 1987 to be able to survive repeated faxings yep.

938
01:11:28,032 --> 01:11:29,917
Speaker 0: so it's a. that's a good one.

939
01:11:29,938 --> 01:11:31,845
Speaker 0: right is a good there's right.

940
01:11:31,925 --> 01:11:37,768
Speaker 0: another one is you know the the probably one of the most classic and famous fonts is Cooper black.

941
01:11:37,948 --> 01:11:48,003
Speaker 0: this is I am making a poster for my funky concert right but you have seen this font you know literally everywhere in your life right?

942
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:52,440
Speaker 0: the the sort of bulb II you know 70s disco II kind of style font.

943
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:55,311
Speaker 0: this is used everywhere you look.

944
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:59,852
Speaker 0: once you realize the name of this font and what it looks like it's one of those things were like.

945
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:01,883
Speaker 0: now you can't not notice it right?

946
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,711
Speaker 0: it was like a quiet part of your life.

947
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:06,082
Speaker 0: that was you know familiar to you.

948
01:12:06,443 --> 01:12:09,316
Speaker 0: you just didn't have a name for it or recognize that thing.

949
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:13,313
Speaker 0: and once you know Cooper black you see Cooper black everywhere.

950
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:14,398
Speaker 0: but it's so.

951
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:19,601
Speaker 0: the reason you see it everywhere is cuz it's so good right it didn't become everywhere for no reason.

952
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:21,108
Speaker 1: wouldn't want to read a book written in it.

953
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:24,882
Speaker 0: but no that's not for that then right?

954
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,440
Speaker 0: so there's the Helvetica's of the world of which a rile is a bad one.

955
01:12:31,062 --> 01:12:32,386
Speaker 0: right now.

956
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:41,077
Speaker 0: there are a lot of ones that are like you know newer like I guess Helvetica new and you eat right a big fan to be honest.

957
01:12:41,097 --> 01:12:42,462
Speaker 0: but they're like yeah that they're.

958
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:47,647
Speaker 0: basically there's so many versions of Helvetica's right of things that people have done with it.

959
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:53,275
Speaker 0: you know tried to improve it you know update it tweak it slightly and it's to the untrained eye.

960
01:12:53,355 --> 01:12:55,851
Speaker 0: it's really hard to tell any difference between a lot of them.

961
01:12:55,872 --> 01:13:02,267
Speaker 0: you're like that's the same font and it's like well and then someone shows you the letters side by side and you're like okay I see that that one is crook slightly.

962
01:13:02,308 --> 01:13:10,238
Speaker 0: so but you know the newer ones while I think they you know they've taken a lot of more recent.

963
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:21,357
Speaker 0: you know typographical learnings I you know at least for me and my my eyeballs I appreciate like some of the older ones I think are more stylin.

964
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:28,127
Speaker 0: so there's I guess the two are like universe which doesn't have an E at the end it's just you know it's just like universe right.

965
01:13:28,589 --> 01:13:31,218
Speaker 0: and there's also accidents grotesque.

966
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:35,691
Speaker 0: they're basically like the old original real deal.

967
01:13:36,052 --> 01:13:47,385
Speaker 0: you know Helvetica's and if you take the same text and put it in your regular everyday Helvetica next to the these older ones you'll see that they got a little bit more styling to them who apparently

968
01:13:47,525 --> 01:13:54,354
Speaker 1: most of the the old-school ones you're talking about are classified as neo grotesques and serifs.

969
01:13:54,374 --> 01:13:55,759
Speaker 0: that's yes that's correct.

970
01:13:55,779 --> 01:14:02,341
Speaker 1: that's and almost all the ones that are popular were made by a small number of people in 1957.

971
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:07,955
Speaker 0: yep and then you know the the stylin font.

972
01:14:07,995 --> 01:14:19,205
Speaker 0: my last font here is avant-garde gothic right which is basically you opened up a old stylin that is a good.

973
01:14:19,466 --> 01:14:22,114
Speaker 0: or a fashion magazine right.

974
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:30,377
Speaker 0: or a magazine with some kind of cool spread right and the fanciness the fancy font is is all over it.

975
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:37,083
Speaker 1: this would be like the pull quote and the title but not in like the body of the text in the magazine right.

976
01:14:37,606 --> 01:15:02,535
Speaker 0: the coolest thing is you know if you want to mess around with open type font features right if you want to mess around with the ligatures feature avant-garde gothic has a fuck ton of cool ligatures like if you put like certain like the letter P followed by the letter like R. I think there's a bunch of different letter combinations where you can make it do funky stuff by combining two like big letters at the start of your sentence.

977
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:10,365
Speaker 0: you can make it do like you know like the letter a with like a backwards like not italics but like weird slants.

978
01:15:11,129 --> 01:15:22,052
Speaker 0: you know you could that way like you can make like the right side of the letter a straight vertically and then followed by let's say you know the letter H right.

979
01:15:22,454 --> 01:15:23,357
Speaker 0: I don't know ahoy.

980
01:15:23,377 --> 01:15:24,199
Speaker 0: you want to write ahoy.

981
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:34,196
Speaker 1: I mean go to the Wikipedia article about it and it just has the word avant-garde and it is showing off half the things you're talking about in one set of words.

982
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:39,217
Speaker 1: yeah the G is like overlapped with the a in such a perfect way.

983
01:15:39,297 --> 01:15:41,548
Speaker 1: everything is lined up so nice everything is tighty.

984
01:15:41,749 --> 01:15:43,135
Speaker 0: ITC avant-garde.

985
01:15:43,255 --> 01:15:49,364
Speaker 0: yeah and you can see down here they show you all the companies that use it as their font right in there in their logo.

986
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:52,658
Speaker 0: I think the most famous one is remax the the US.

987
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:58,384
Speaker 1: well century 21 is what came to mind first and they both use it and they both compete with each other.

988
01:15:58,404 --> 01:16:00,736
Speaker 0: right bike and remax you their logo.

989
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:03,369
Speaker 0: you can see the sort of slant aligning thing we're like.

990
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:09,013
Speaker 0: they have that letter M slanted forward right and then the letter a vertical on the left half.

991
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,819
Speaker 0: so it's it lines up.

992
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:18,391
Speaker 1: well century 21 the C is big and they have the C just merged directly into the the line that starts the E. that's at an angle.

993
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:21,424
Speaker 0: now yep but you even look at something like you know.

994
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:25,546
Speaker 0: the Macy's logo is using the same font even though it's just a lowercase.

995
01:16:25,606 --> 01:16:27,996
Speaker 0: letters with a star instead of an apostrophe.

996
01:16:28,037 --> 01:16:28,237
Speaker 0: right.

997
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:29,744
Speaker 1: oh I didn't know I didn't.

998
01:16:29,825 --> 01:16:34,105
Speaker 1: I never clocked that PBS uses it because they don't use any of the fancy features.

999
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,532
Speaker 0: right it's like.

1000
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:45,789
Speaker 0: well the thing is that one of the other things about the font is that a lot of the letters especially the lowercase ones right are circular and they're like the same circle.

1001
01:16:45,809 --> 01:17:02,458
Speaker 0: it's like the C are basically the same shape except the C has like a little bite taken out the right side of it right and then like if you put OCP the circle on the P will be that same circle right only with a stick hanging down.

1002
01:17:02,478 --> 01:17:08,064
Speaker 1: now that is bad for eligibility of long amounts of time but that is great for style right?

1003
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:19,285
Speaker 0: it looks like you know a bunch of just circles in a row that are all exactly identical with like just one little thing different about them right and so it's a very fancy and clever clever font.

1004
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:25,616
