1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,758
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, September 18th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:11,040
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:14,290
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,997
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,571
Speaker 1: Tonight, PEX Prime 2012.

6
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:21,589
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,269
Speaker 0: You know, we go to so many conventions now.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,950
Speaker 0: I get the, and we're making less Geek Nights, so a greater proportion of Geek Nights episodes end up being convention episodes.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,670
Speaker 1: Ah, but we've gotten kind of around that by not doing full episodes about most conventions we go to anymore.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:46,290
Speaker 1: That's true, but I feel like- It's a red herring there, because the Mocha show is just a review of a whole ton of comics.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,710
Speaker 0: I get the feeling we should make a separate show that is the, like, the geek convention show.

12
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,310
Speaker 0: That's not Geek Nights.

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,569
Speaker 0: Well, we've got a- Then we'd be very, very short on Geek Nights show ideas.

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,570
Speaker 1: We've got a show like that in the hopper, but the thing is, convention season's basically over after MAGFest.

15
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:07,368
Speaker 0: Until?

16
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,590
Speaker 1: Until what, PAX East?

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,370
Speaker 0: Which is how far away from MAGFest?

18
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:12,190
Speaker 0: No.

19
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:13,988
Speaker 1: Alright, four months.

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,710
Speaker 0: PAX East is in, like, April, and you know what, when's PAX Prime?

21
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,289
Speaker 1: Not that long after that.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,070
Speaker 0: September, so it's September, MAGFest is January, PAX East is April, so they're all four months apart.

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,650
Speaker 0: So you get these little, and then New York Comic Con, if you count it, is in between PAX East and MAGFest.

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,636
Speaker 1: I have a funny feeling.

25
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,810
Speaker 1: we're not going to do a show on the New York Comic Con this year.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:35,945
Speaker 1: No.

27
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,610
Speaker 1: Just saying.

28
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,690
Speaker 1: I didn't even send my press credential crap in yet.

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,488
Speaker 1: I don't know if I will.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,170
Speaker 0: KazuCon is pretty soon after MAGFest.

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, when was the last time we went to KazuCon?

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,070
Speaker 0: I'm not saying we went to it, I'm just saying it's there, so it's still convention season.

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,330
Speaker 0: Not for us anymore.

34
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,150
Speaker 0: It's always convention season.

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,710
Speaker 1: We're old men now, we don't go to as many cons as we used to.

36
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,009
Speaker 1: When was the last time we went to, like, Anime Next?

37
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,730
Speaker 1: PenguinCon.

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,910
Speaker 0: We only went to Anime Next once, and PenguinCon once.

39
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,870
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, anyway.

40
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,857
Speaker 1: UberCon.

41
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:03,689
Speaker 1: Remember UberCon?

42
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,570
Speaker 0: We went to the two or three times.

43
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:05,870
Speaker 1: I went to three UberCons.

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,710
Speaker 1: I think it still happens.

45
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,929
Speaker 0: If you went to three, I went to two.

46
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:09,318
Speaker 0: Yeah.

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,590
Speaker 0: Anyway.

48
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,189
Speaker 1: But, yeah, we're back from PAX, but as you all know, we got other stuff going on, so we're in and out of town.

49
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:23,758
Speaker 1: There was a guest episode last week, there are probably more guest episodes to come, so don't be scared, we'll be back once.

50
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,666
Speaker 1: I'm back from India and Singapore and Turkey and Germany.

51
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, worst case scenario, we both win lottery or some shit and just start traveling around the world.

52
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,109
Speaker 0: Geek Nights will not die, episodes will just happen whenever they happen.

53
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,406
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, we got all those video shows and things in the works, but they're not ready yet.

54
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:58,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what, the other thing you gotta understand is that even though there might be a dearth of Geek Nights episodes during one of our traveling times, when one of us is out of town, that means the other one doesn't have anything to do in town.

55
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:00,790
Speaker 1: Except play Counter-Strike.

56
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:10,767
Speaker 0: Except play Counter-Strike, but also maybe, you know, instead of spending like two hours on Geek Nights, it's one hour of Counter-Strike, one hour of making a video or doing something like that.

57
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, we won't, we'll get past, that's all meta.

58
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:28,710
Speaker 1: We're back, we're bad, video games, talking about them, and one thing that we didn't talk about in all these missed episodes prior was Steam Greenlight, and the fact that it actually happened, it's going, and the community reaction has been surprisingly mixed.

59
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:41,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I mean, there was, basically the idea of Steam Greenlight, if you don't know, is Steam has a problem in that they want the awesomest games to be on Steam, but they don't want it to be the Apple Store where all the crap in the universe is on Steam.

60
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,490
Speaker 0: They want to pick and choose, you know, the good stuff to be on there.

61
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, ever try to search for a game on the Apple Store if you didn't already know the name of the game you were looking for?

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:59,728
Speaker 0: Right, so, you know, but the problem is they don't have enough manpower at Valve to know which games are to look at, you know, there's so many games they can't look at 'em all, so what do they even do about that?

63
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,790
Speaker 0: You know, so they crowdsource it.

64
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:09,249
Speaker 0: They basically sort of make a Reddit-ish of, you know, game submissions, and the games that get voted all the way up are the ones they'll take a look at to see if they can get 'em on Steam.

65
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:10,289
Speaker 0: Great idea.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:11,609
Speaker 0: Problem.

67
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,070
Speaker 0: Day one, they put this up, and it's full of crap.

68
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:21,209
Speaker 1: We're not talking crap like- We're talking like straight up spam, like Viagra spam that pretended to be a game.

69
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,310
Speaker 0: Like somebody posting Call of Duty in like Russia.

70
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:26,210
Speaker 0: It's like, what?

71
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:32,569
Speaker 1: It's not- Scott, I'm reminded, so I ask you this, is this Battletoads?

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just Battletoads.

73
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,346
Speaker 0: So anyway, so they're like, "Shit, what do we do about this,

74
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:38,648
Speaker 0: guys?".

75
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:46,570
Speaker 0: So Valve decided what they would do, and this had nothing to do, as you might think, Valve did not talk to the Penny Arcade people about this at all.

76
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,251
Speaker 0: They just did it entirely on their own, 100%.

77
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:58,410
Speaker 0: They decided that if you want to submit your game to Greenlight, you have to donate $100 to Child's Play, and then your game will be listed on Greenlight.

78
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,410
Speaker 0: So that way, it's sort of a filter that only a serious submission will go on there.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,390
Speaker 1: Now, the way it works is you pay Valve, and they just pass all the money to Child's Play.

80
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:05,950
Speaker 0: Exactly.

81
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,849
Speaker 0: So it's just a fee.

82
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,668
Speaker 0: There's no profit for them.

83
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,470
Speaker 1: Now, what amazed me was the gaming community's outrage at this.

84
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,250
Speaker 0: Well, basically their outrage was, "Look, these are indie developers.

85
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,290
Speaker 0: They have no money.

86
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:22,387
Speaker 0: Even if their game is successful, they'll have no fucking money, because it sucks

87
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:22,809
Speaker 0: balls.".

88
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,695
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

89
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:29,410
Speaker 1: $100, if you're not serious, is a lot of money.

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,929
Speaker 0: And if you don't have a real job.

91
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:41,030
Speaker 1: Even then, if I was going to make t-shirts for Geek Nights, the few hundred dollars it costs to print the first run before I sell them, I'm not going to shoulder that burden.

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,210
Speaker 1: But seriously, pretty much everything but the bottomest, bottomest tier.

93
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,430
Speaker 1: If you make a game that's worthy enough to be on Steam, you can afford the hundred bucks.

94
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,349
Speaker 1: You're going to make the hundred bucks back.

95
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:58,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing I could say to that is it could be 20 bucks, right?

96
00:05:58,773 --> 00:05:59,609
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

97
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,110
Speaker 0: Who's going to ... But nobody ... 20 bucks is going to keep out the Call of Duty submission.

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,990
Speaker 1: So Steam is not the venue for everything.

99
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,969
Speaker 1: What is their other goal?

100
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,609
Speaker 1: To keep all the crap out.

101
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:21,427
Speaker 1: I hate to say this, if you cannot muster $100, your game probably not is above the minimum line of, "I would ever bother with it on

102
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:21,749
Speaker 1: Steam.".

103
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:25,850
Speaker 1: That's the level of game that I download from your website.

104
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,428
Speaker 0: You know, it's a tough call.

105
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,230
Speaker 1: Also, if a game is that diamond in the rough where it really is worth being on Steam, people You can get the hundred dollars from somebody else.

106
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,290
Speaker 1: Yes, and you don't have a hundred dollars, you could kickstart for that hundred bucks.

107
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you've got ... If your game is worthy and you got some demo video or something, you'll get the hundred dollars from somebody.

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,490
Speaker 1: So if you are too poor to get the money.

109
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,370
Speaker 0: Do think that you could lower it and still get the same filtration effect in it.

110
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,530
Speaker 0: Like 50 bucks, no problem.

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,690
Speaker 1: See, that's why I'm saying it's serving two purposes.

112
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,950
Speaker 1: Kind of like how a captcha that involves logic or reasoning of some kind serves two purposes.

113
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,109
Speaker 1: A regular captcha nominally exists only to keep robots out.

114
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:09,190
Speaker 1: But a slightly complex captcha also keeps idiots out.

115
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,490
Speaker 1: That is a very important function.

116
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:24,710
Speaker 1: If you can't afford the 20 bucks and you cannot get $20 from anyone, you cannot get anyone you know in the world to help you pony up a hundred bucks to get your game on Steam.

117
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,290
Speaker 0: What if you're from another country where a hundred dollars is literally like a fuck ton of money?

118
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:30,950
Speaker 1: Even then, you can't get someone.

119
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,710
Speaker 1: You can't get some person somewhere.

120
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:34,909
Speaker 0: From a rich country.

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,766
Speaker 1: Anywhere.

122
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:45,470
Speaker 1: I feel like it's just to cut down on the total number of even, you know, relatively okay or they are actually a game, even if they're a bad game submissions.

123
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:52,950
Speaker 1: Because green light is useless unless the submissions are low enough for one or two people to go through all of them all the time that make it to the top.

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,970
Speaker 1: And to curate it a little bit and make sure something crazy doesn't happen and whatever.

125
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,650
Speaker 1: The other thing is, you know, I kind of mentioned this before, but the gaming community seems to have completely missed the real reason for this.

126
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:13,910
Speaker 1: It's not so that a game that is great will guaranteed be on Steam because games that are great that anyone notices will get on Steam anyway.

127
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,390
Speaker 1: If there's any game that is not noticed, it's probably going to get on Steam.

128
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:28,610
Speaker 1: Let's say someone in a very poor country makes a game and they can't get the hundred bucks and there's no way, some magical world where they cannot in any capacity get anyone to believe in them enough to help them get a hundred bucks.

129
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:39,448
Speaker 1: If anyone even finds the game and realizes that it's good, it'll still get on there because Valve can just take a game and reach out to people and say, "Hey, let's do

130
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:39,568
Speaker 1: it.".

131
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,490
Speaker 1: This is only to catch games that Valve didn't notice.

132
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,052
Speaker 0: That's true.

133
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:50,790
Speaker 0: So, speaking of Steam, in the Steam beta, there's two really interesting things.

134
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,750
Speaker 0: One of them everyone knows about is big picture mode, which is Steam working on your TV.

135
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:57,722
Speaker 0: I tried it out.

136
00:08:57,762 --> 00:08:58,269
Speaker 0: Did you try it out?

137
00:08:58,431 --> 00:08:59,009
Speaker 1: I did not yet.

138
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,996
Speaker 0: So here's how it works.

139
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,489
Speaker 0: First, you've got to activate Steam beta.

140
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,821
Speaker 0: To do that, you go to Steam settings.

141
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,570
Speaker 0: Yes, I want to participate in the beta.

142
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,390
Speaker 0: You restart Steam and then in the top right of Steam, you can activate big picture.

143
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:12,930
Speaker 1: I saw that there's a Steam mover replacement in there.

144
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,675
Speaker 0: Well, hold on.

145
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:14,990
Speaker 0: That's the second thing I'm talking about.

146
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:23,061
Speaker 0: So, you activate big picture and then you push the button and the Steam takes up your whole screen and it's sort of like using your Xbox with your gamepad, right?

147
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,330
Speaker 0: It's like this user interface to navigate Steam from your couch.

148
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,174
Speaker 0: It has a web browser.

149
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:36,630
Speaker 0: It's not a good web browser, but it's the best web browser you can make with a gamepad, which is pretty impressive, right?

150
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,990
Speaker 0: It's like, man, this real user interface is really bad for browsing the web, but this is the best you could do.

151
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:53,850
Speaker 1: You know, I've always said, and as Yumi and Connor had talked about at length at PAX, if anyone's going to make a thing that will be the PC/HTPC gaming console that is generic, it'll be Valve.

152
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:58,490
Speaker 0: The best thing about it is the way you type without a keyboard.

153
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:09,090
Speaker 0: Basically, you enter a text box or something and this thing shows up on the screen and you use the left stick to select a blob and the blobs are in a big radius, so it's a radial menu.

154
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,690
Speaker 0: And each blob has four letters and the four letters map to the four buttons on the right side of the gamepad.

155
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:22,847
Speaker 0: So you hold into the top right blob and that'll have like H, J, K, L. So it's like red is H, yellow is J, blue is...

156
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,494
Speaker 1: Oh my god, that's really nice.

157
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:29,030
Speaker 1: I just had flashbacks to the days of trying to type in a Metal Gear password without fucking it up.

158
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:35,350
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like, man, if Nintendo would have come up with that back in the NES days for typing in passwords.

159
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,650
Speaker 0: But I guess it was only eight directions, not enough really.

160
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,510
Speaker 0: Eight times two buttons is only sixteen possible letters.

161
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,581
Speaker 1: So you make passwords that only have sixteen.

162
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:51,770
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's interesting, I feel like kids who were playing games in that era could not have dealt with that.

163
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,663
Speaker 0: No, and the user interface wouldn't have updated quickly.

164
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,170
Speaker 0: Maybe you could make it anyway.

165
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,914
Speaker 0: The point is, it's a really good typing thing.

166
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:07,803
Speaker 0: The rest of it, basically when you open a game that supports gamepads by default, and is full screen by default, it's beautiful.

167
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,350
Speaker 0: It's like you're using a console.

168
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,890
Speaker 0: It's like you go "boop" and a game opens full screen and your gamepad is still working and it's great.

169
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:32,070
Speaker 0: When you open a game that is default to opening in window mode, or maybe doesn't support gamepads at all, or you have to configure the gamepad before it'll work, then suddenly everything is immediately ruined, mostly, once you open that particular, launch that game.

170
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,699
Speaker 1: Well, one step at a time.

171
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,250
Speaker 1: It is a beta.

172
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,282
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you can't do much about these games, though.

173
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,630
Speaker 0: You have to update all these games.

174
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:51,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I feel like one of the killer apps for the complete replacement of these consoles like the Xbox, where you actually just have a Steam box of some kind, will be when Valve helps developers not be dumbasses.

175
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:55,170
Speaker 1: There should never be a game where I have to use Joy to Key on Steam.

176
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,530
Speaker 0: But I'm talking about if you open up some old existing game.

177
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,370
Speaker 0: Future games probably will be, you know, but it's an existing game.

178
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,051
Speaker 0: Well, two things.

179
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:10,670
Speaker 1: One, I would do something on Valve where any game could be certified to be compatible with the big box mode, the big screen mode.

180
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you could easily filter those games out of the list that aren't certified.

181
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:27,050
Speaker 1: What I might do is offer, like, come up with some tools that will make it relatively easy for people to get that certification, like to take their old game and, like, re-edit it to make it work with the gamepad and the full screen and everything.

182
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,730
Speaker 1: And then I'd find some third party, because you know what, Valve wouldn't want to do this themselves.

183
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,650
Speaker 1: Find some third party to partner with and have them be able to offer a service of, like, we'll make your game work.

184
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:47,590
Speaker 0: All you really need to do to have a game work properly in big picture is, when you launch it for the first time by default after installing it with default config, it needs to be full screen.

185
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:56,150
Speaker 0: It should be probably 1080p or 720p, detect the resolution from the OS, but it doesn't matter as much as just being full screen, because you can change the resolution.

186
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:03,350
Speaker 0: And B, you need to be able to navigate all the menus and do everything in the game with the gamepad, with the default configuration from the get-go.

187
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,297
Speaker 0: And that's all you really got to do.

188
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,185
Speaker 0: You've got those two things and that's it.

189
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:17,087
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was kind of nice, you know, and I'd probably use it for all of my Steam PC gaming.

190
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,310
Speaker 0: that was good for a gamepad.

191
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,510
Speaker 0: And I sort of organized all my Steam games into two lists, the gamepad HTPC games and the desktop games.

192
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:33,150
Speaker 0: And, you know, I realized most of those, one thing I realized is that most of those HTPC gamepad games were all, like, indie games.

193
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:43,870
Speaker 0: And most of the play-the-PC sit-down games, not all of them, but most of them were, you know, more for serious games that cost money and made by big companies.

194
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:50,630
Speaker 1: I guess without Valve helping people out, I mean, look, Binding of Isaac doesn't just work with your gamepad.

195
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I did put that one in the HTPC list.

196
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:01,150
Speaker 1: I would too, but you really can't play it without the mouse and keyboard, because you should not install garbage like Joy to Key.

197
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:02,534
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

198
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:04,980
Speaker 0: Alright, so yeah.

199
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,384
Speaker 0: Oh, and that's the other thing, I forgot.

200
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:08,390
Speaker 0: That rim reminded me and I forgot and I remember it again.

201
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,350
Speaker 0: So, there's a hidden new feature.

202
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:11,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is big.

203
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,004
Speaker 0: You have to activate the Steam beta the same way, right?

204
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,350
Speaker 0: And here's the deal.

205
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,002
Speaker 0: There used to be, well there is, this thing called SteamMover.exe.

206
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,190
Speaker 0: It hasn't been updated in a long time, but it still exists.

207
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:36,627
Speaker 0: And what SteamMover does is, if you're like me and you have program files on a solid state drive, and you install every Steam game you've got, that's gonna fill up that solid state drive really quick, and then you're in big trouble, and it's gonna take you back to the past.

208
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,709
Speaker 0: More importantly.

209
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,990
Speaker 0: Of the DOS days, where you gotta delete one game to install another game.

210
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,990
Speaker 1: Normal person, you install Steam, it's on your C drive, which has Windows and all your other bullshit.

211
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,330
Speaker 1: Then you edit video in Premiere, and you don't know better, so now it's caching all these HD video files on that same drive.

212
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:57,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want, ideally, Steam games take up a lot of space.

213
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,723
Speaker 0: You want to install them on a separate drive.

214
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:02,550
Speaker 0: If you're a nerd, you've almost definitely got more than one drive in your computer.

215
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:11,450
Speaker 1: Now, if your computer is not already a tiny god, you want to install games that have high loading times and lots of disk crap onto an SSD so there's no loading times.

216
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,193
Speaker 0: Exactly.

217
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,290
Speaker 0: You would be very carefully choose which games go on which drive.

218
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:26,688
Speaker 1: A lot of people still will do a slow hard drive that's enormous, and they put their media files there and all their big crap there.

219
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,824
Speaker 1: And then you have a fast disk, even not an SSD, maybe it's just a 10,000 or 70, 200 RPM drive.

220
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:38,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is, you want to be able to install your Steam game somewhere that isn't program files because there are many and they are large.

221
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:46,630
Speaker 0: So the way you would do this up until now, the only way, safe way, was to use SteamMover, which is something some guy made that he hasn't updated but still works.

222
00:15:47,130 --> 00:16:05,670
Speaker 0: And what it does is it moves all the, you pick a game, you click the arrow, it moves all the files from that game to the other drive, and then it creates symbolic links in your program folder pointing at the game so that Steam doesn't know, Steam is none the wiser, and it even has a feature to let you move the games back to where they started, which is very good.

223
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:06,552
Speaker 0: And it works.

224
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:12,810
Speaker 0: But, it is no longer necessary, because now there is a feature in the Steam beta, and how it works is this.

225
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,136
Speaker 0: We're going to link, obviously, to the instructions.

226
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:21,790
Speaker 0: You have to activate the dev Steam console, you have to run the install folder UI command.

227
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,170
Speaker 1: Hold on guys, it'll be production soon enough.

228
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:33,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you gotta add the directory to the installable folders list where you want to install things, so I made mine like, G colon Steam or something.

229
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:44,610
Speaker 0: And then, you can only change where a game is installed when you install it, so if you've got a game that's already installed that you want to move, you have to uninstall it, and install it again.

230
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,375
Speaker 1: You know what's funny?

231
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,250
Speaker 1: G colon is also my data storage drive.

232
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,629
Speaker 0: Well I mean, Windows starts at the same letters, so it's pretty likely.

233
00:16:51,211 --> 00:17:06,569
Speaker 1: C is my system disk, D is a little hundred megabyte disk I use for some bullshit, E is my SSD that I had before, G is my data store, F is my DVD, H, I, J, K, and L are all these various removable disks.

234
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,689
Speaker 0: I have all these, I have so many drives now.

235
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,589
Speaker 1: M, X, Z, and Y are different drives.

236
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,292
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone cares about your letters.

237
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:23,450
Speaker 0: I have so many letters, I don't even remember what all of them are, cause now I've collected, basically I keep, every time I get a new computer I bring up the drives from all these old computers, now I've got like, too many drives.

238
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,230
Speaker 0: I don't even need them all, and I got a NAS, so I moved so much data to the NAS, like most of these drives are empty now.

239
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,210
Speaker 1: I filled my two terabyte NAS, I gotta pull stuff off it onto a secondary drive.

240
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,090
Speaker 0: Now I've got like a mega NAS, I got four two terabytes, I got six terabyte NAS, effectively.

241
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:49,490
Speaker 0: But yeah, you follow these crazy instructions, then you uninstall a game and reinstall it, which should be okay, because your save games should either be A, in the steam cloud, or B, in your my games folder or something.

242
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,070
Speaker 0: They won't be saved in program files, so uninstalling a game should not delete save games.

243
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,930
Speaker 0: Then reinstall, in most cases, check, mileage may vary based on game.

244
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,790
Speaker 1: Whatever, I delete save games all the time these days, I just don't care anymore.

245
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,350
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like, you don't need to save your Counter-Strike save game, there is no Counter-Strike, right?

246
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:13,710
Speaker 0: You uninstall a game, reinstall it, and when you reinstall it, you'll be able to choose where you want it installed, and that it will be officially supported by Steam and totally awesome.

247
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,610
Speaker 0: And this works so well, in fact, the only feature missing is the ability to move already installed games.

248
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:26,750
Speaker 0: That I see no reason why it's even in beta, they should just move this up to the real release as fast as possible.

249
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,990
Speaker 0: Because I've had no problems with it whatsoever.

250
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,008
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

251
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:31,210
Speaker 0: We will.

252
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,070
Speaker 1: So, one last thing, I just want to talk about this briefly.

253
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:44,210
Speaker 1: So, there is an article on Slashshot and a linked forum discussion on all this stuff, but the gist of it is that World of Warcraft, if you take screenshots within World of Warcraft...

254
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:49,430
Speaker 0: You have to use the World of Warcraft screenshot thing, if you use, like, fraps or something, this won't happen, right?

255
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:50,689
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, yes.

256
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:51,028
Speaker 1: Okay.

257
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:57,630
Speaker 1: It has been, for pretty much ever, been watermarking your screenshots with all this information about you.

258
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:02,730
Speaker 0: So that way, when the Blizzard people can get screenshots, they find on, like, Google Image Search and then...

259
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,189
Speaker 1: So they can be like, "Oh, that's that troll," or, "Oh, these guys are running a private pirated

260
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:07,530
Speaker 1: server.".

261
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,470
Speaker 0: They can figure out who took the screenshot and all kinds of stuff.

262
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,790
Speaker 1: I bring this up, I don't have a lot, well, I do have a lot to say about it, but I don't really want to bog the episode down.

263
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,830
Speaker 1: Suffice it to say, check out this article.

264
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:26,030
Speaker 1: The people who figured this out and did all the research and decoded what the watermarks are also provide a workaround.

265
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:36,390
Speaker 1: If you take a maximum quality screenshot, there are no artifacts, presumably because people who are doing that big, gigantic screenshot might have noticed more readily.

266
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,710
Speaker 1: Because people didn't really notice this for a long time.

267
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,790
Speaker 1: And the sleuthing is how they figured it out and everything is awesome.

268
00:19:42,671 --> 00:20:00,150
Speaker 1: And I bring it up, too, because if you are in any amount savvy to the ways of the internet in relation to piracy, security, nominal evil, hacking, all that kind of stuff, you realize there's watermarks like this and a lot of things you don't realize.

269
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:01,890
Speaker 0: Things your printer prints out.

270
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, laser printers will very often use yellow dots.

271
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,430
Speaker 0: Well, anything color printers will do this, usually.

272
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's lots of watermarky stuff like this.

273
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,629
Speaker 1: So read this article, check it out, because as a gamer, this might affect you.

274
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,130
Speaker 1: And if you've ever posted screenshots from World of Warcraft, I can learn some stuff about you.

275
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:25,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do want to say one technological thing is that Blizzard seems to have outsourced, they just bought watermarking software from some company.

276
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:37,730
Speaker 0: Right, and the way it works is it basically, in one area of the screenshot where there's a patch of the same color, it will slightly vary the color on a few of the pixels, right?

277
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,989
Speaker 0: Just so it'll be like this is a blue area.

278
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:51,390
Speaker 0: They'll basically, in that blue area, they'll make sort of like a QR code sort of thing by making some of the pixels like, OK, this one's like one darker than the one next to it.

279
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,509
Speaker 0: And this one is not right.

280
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,250
Speaker 0: And then you can sort of scan it and get data like a barcode.

281
00:20:56,371 --> 00:21:06,630
Speaker 0: The way you should do this to make it so it's not detectable by somebody noticing, oh, look, this area has like these weird, slightly off colored dots and sort of a pixelated arrangement.

282
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,330
Speaker 1: Which to be fair, until recently, no one notices shit like that.

283
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:10,917
Speaker 0: It's true.

284
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,850
Speaker 0: It's hard to notice.

285
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:21,110
Speaker 0: But to make it impossible to notice is you basically find blue all over the screenshot and you scatter the pixels all about.

286
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:25,190
Speaker 0: And then you just have a system that knows where to read from.

287
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,110
Speaker 0: So it goes forward until it finds the beginning and then it goes through.

288
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,990
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it'd be like if I took a barcode and sort of shattered it and put the pieces all over the screenshot in different areas.

289
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,890
Speaker 0: Because there wouldn't be enough different pixels in any one area for anyone to actually find it.

290
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:45,850
Speaker 0: So it's so I put like your name over here and I'll put your account username over here and the date and time of the screenshot.

291
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,330
Speaker 1: Stegonography is a very interesting subject.

292
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,830
Speaker 1: You could go even deeper and use but a variance of pixels.

293
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:52,673
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

294
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:55,750
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that small modification enough?

295
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:58,503
Speaker 0: If they had done that, we would still not.

296
00:21:58,523 --> 00:21:59,790
Speaker 0: this wouldn't even be a story today.

297
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,990
Speaker 0: Now, that would have been enough to keep it a secret probably forever.

298
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,735
Speaker 1: This was introduced, quote, immediately or soon after patch 2.1.0.

299
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:09,630
Speaker 0: That was a long time ago.

300
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,670
Speaker 1: If you're not a World of Warcraft person, that is 2007.

301
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,648
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft's old.

302
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:15,954
Speaker 1: Yeah.

303
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,010
Speaker 1: So check this out.

304
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,930
Speaker 1: But if you are one of those people who is not savvy to the Internet, I'll give you a little hint.

305
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:32,970
Speaker 1: If you're ever engaging in screenshots or audio or anything that could be compromising and you don't and you want to post it publicly somewhere or reveal it somewhere.

306
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:36,130
Speaker 1: But simultaneously do not want it traced back to yourself.

307
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:49,350
Speaker 1: You should lower the quality and run things like blurring filters, but not Gaussian blurring filters and slight crops and slight skews and transformations.

308
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,660
Speaker 1: Run audio compressors over things.

309
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 1: Re-encode to JPEG.

310
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,250
Speaker 1: A couple of there's things you should do because stuff like this is way more common than you think.

311
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,010
Speaker 1: I mean, if Blizzard is doing it in World of Warcraft.

312
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,671
Speaker 0: Right.

313
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:07,330
Speaker 0: But, you know, a lot of the times, though, let's be honest, you make a screenshot in World of Warcraft.

314
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,655
Speaker 0: Do you really?

315
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:11,370
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, here's a picture of a guy wearing a fuck ton of armor.

316
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,579
Speaker 0: Here's a picture of a monster.

317
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,547
Speaker 0: Here's a picture of a brat.

318
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:14,529
Speaker 0: Ah, but so.

319
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,509
Speaker 0: Do you really care?

320
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,648
Speaker 1: This watermark is here.

321
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,310
Speaker 1: Say some smart dudes figured this out a long time ago.

322
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:24,390
Speaker 1: They could use information that you don't know is being watermarked.

323
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,570
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people upload pictures and don't realize they're uploading EXIF data, too.

324
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:29,370
Speaker 1: That's true.

325
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,219
Speaker 1: That's not a watermark.

326
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:30,929
Speaker 1: That's straight up.

327
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,169
Speaker 1: It's just like, here's the GPS location where I took this picture.

328
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,590
Speaker 0: Here's my camera and the lens I was using.

329
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:39,130
Speaker 0: Sometimes you want to upload EXIF data on purpose.

330
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,129
Speaker 0: Like, here's the camera and the lens I used.

331
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the other.

332
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,990
Speaker 1: All right, here's a picture of my bunny.

333
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,269
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess people know my address now.

334
00:23:46,871 --> 00:23:49,109
Speaker 0: Or they can, you know, know at least the building you're in.

335
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,567
Speaker 0: If you're in a house, they know exactly where you are.

336
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:52,739
Speaker 0: Suburbia.

337
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,130
Speaker 0: Security and apartment buildings.

338
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I'm in one of these hundred apartments.

339
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,510
Speaker 1: Anyone who ordered a T-shirt back when we were selling them, you have my home address.

340
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,516
Speaker 1: You know what?

341
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:02,543
Speaker 1: I have a doorman.

342
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,470
Speaker 1: Doorman won't let you in.

343
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,670
Speaker 0: My address is on the stupid newsletter because MailChimp makes you put an address there.

344
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:08,755
Speaker 0: Oooh.

345
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:11,119
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

346
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:12,290
Speaker 0: You want to come over and visit?

347
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,349
Speaker 0: Fine, let's play some video games.

348
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:13,738
Speaker 1: Hey there.

349
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,740
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

350
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:27,280
Speaker 1: So this is kind of amazing, but it also makes me feel old.

351
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:29,280
Speaker 1: So I will preface this by saying the following.

352
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:38,620
Speaker 1: I do not recognize a single one of these Magic cards because I quit playing Magic when Fallen Empires came out.

353
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,860
Speaker 0: I started playing Magic when Fallen Empires came out.

354
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,080
Speaker 0: Because the community of Magic players and tournament people.

355
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,030
Speaker 1: I used to go to tournaments.

356
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:46,800
Speaker 1: I was really into Magic.

357
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,226
Speaker 0: I went to one tournament.

358
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,719
Speaker 0: It was Homelands would just come out.

359
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,407
Speaker 0: Or no, or Alliances.

360
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, Alliances had just come out.

361
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,364
Speaker 1: Really?

362
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:56,439
Speaker 1: The last tournament I went to.

363
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,780
Speaker 0: And then I stopped playing Magic.

364
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,770
Speaker 1: Literally the last tournament I went to.

365
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,780
Speaker 1: I kind of quit Magic in quotes, but I kept playing.

366
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,479
Speaker 0: It was middle school.

367
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,420
Speaker 1: But the last tournament I ever went to, which was actually the last game of Magic I ever played.

368
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,760
Speaker 1: Not counting when we busted out those starter decks at PAX.

369
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,720
Speaker 1: Was a tournament where Alliances had been announced and come out like two days before.

370
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,994
Speaker 1: So the tournament, I remember there was a big sign that was like, "No Alliances cards.

371
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:21,777
Speaker 1: You will be

372
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:22,760
Speaker 1: disqualified.".

373
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:31,220
Speaker 1: I used to play when a type two tournament meant, I think, revised, the dark, and Fallen Empires.

374
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:39,060
Speaker 0: I played in a type two, which meant you couldn't use, you could only use certain things that are currently available.

375
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,579
Speaker 1: You could use the current main game, and you could use the...

376
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,980
Speaker 0: Which was fourth edition at the time.

377
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:44,561
Speaker 1: Wow.

378
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, for me, I started playing before revised existed.

379
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played when revised came into existence.

380
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:52,880
Speaker 1: I have a pile of beta cards.

381
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,678
Speaker 0: Like, when I read about beta, it was like, "Whoa, there were sets before

382
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:55,860
Speaker 0: this?".

383
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:57,980
Speaker 0: I just found out about this game, and I'm late.

384
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,080
Speaker 1: In fact, when fourth edition came out, I remember I was bitching.

385
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,656
Speaker 1: We were like, "The cards don't look as good anymore, and the game's stupid

386
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:04,918
Speaker 1: now.".

387
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,590
Speaker 1: This is bullshit.

388
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:05,900
Speaker 1: Fuck this game.

389
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,007
Speaker 0: I think the cards look better.

390
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,180
Speaker 0: They improved the printing process and made the colors brighter.

391
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,640
Speaker 0: And revised, they were all sort of faded.

392
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,439
Speaker 1: No, see, that's because they were old.

393
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:15,980
Speaker 1: Hold a revised card that's freshly printed.

394
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,880
Speaker 0: No, you open up a brand new revised package.

395
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,155
Speaker 0: And a brand new fourth edition.

396
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,959
Speaker 1: Fourth edition looked like shitty laser jet, like, crapo printing.

397
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,360
Speaker 0: No, the fourth edition had much greater saturation.

398
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was oversaturated.

399
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,000
Speaker 1: It looked like garbage.

400
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,260
Speaker 0: No, the revised one looked like someone had sandblasted the cards.

401
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,319
Speaker 1: Magic cards didn't look good again until Ice Age.

402
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:35,406
Speaker 0: No.

403
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,780
Speaker 0: Ice Age looked the same as fourth edition.

404
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,668
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.

405
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,700
Speaker 1: It was like night and day.

406
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:38,970
Speaker 0: No.

407
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:42,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, so kids, fun fact.

408
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,500
Speaker 1: You can tell the difference between alpha, beta, unlimited, and revised based on primarily the borders.

409
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,300
Speaker 1: Alpha and beta have black borders.

410
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,399
Speaker 0: I think the kids know more about magic than we do.

411
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,860
Speaker 0: Considering we haven't played it in a hundred years.

412
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,720
Speaker 1: I don't think the kids know about old magic.

413
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:57,358
Speaker 0: Maybe not about old magic.

414
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,560
Speaker 0: But they know about magic in general more than we do.

415
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,599
Speaker 1: I don't think they know what a fucking Sol Ring is.

416
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:02,445
Speaker 0: They do.

417
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:03,980
Speaker 0: It costs one colorless mana.

418
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,720
Speaker 0: But when you tap it, it's an artifact.

419
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,640
Speaker 0: It gives you two colorless mana.

420
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are restricted cards.

421
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,792
Speaker 0: That card, I have one.

422
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:10,760
Speaker 0: It's basically mega illegal.

423
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:11,406
Speaker 0: One.

424
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,618
Speaker 1: I have a pile of them.

425
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,540
Speaker 0: I didn't have that many revised cards.

426
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:19,380
Speaker 0: I played when revised was there.

427
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,920
Speaker 0: My friend had a bunch of revised cards.

428
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:26,220
Speaker 0: And then I started playing and when I went to the store, revised was like expensive on its way out.

429
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,071
Speaker 0: It was like that moment.

430
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:29,400
Speaker 0: It was when I actually bought it myself.

431
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,880
Speaker 1: The thing is, fourth edition was just a gimped version of revised that took out all the good cards.

432
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,820
Speaker 0: That's correct.

433
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,860
Speaker 1: And unlimited was even better.

434
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,260
Speaker 1: I mean, back in the day, icy manipulator was basically the way you would interpret the rules.

435
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:44,798
Speaker 1: Tap this to tap or use it to tap any card, yours or an opponent's.

436
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,560
Speaker 1: And the implication was and activate that tap power.

437
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,920
Speaker 1: But they since continuously gimped the icy manipulator.

438
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ice age version of the icy manipulator has to a) tap itself.

439
00:27:57,182 --> 00:27:59,380
Speaker 0: Making it so you couldn't just tap the other guy's whole loadout.

440
00:28:00,082 --> 00:28:02,480
Speaker 0: Which you could do with the original one because it didn't tap itself.

441
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,740
Speaker 0: And b) the rules really specified that yeah.

442
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,960
Speaker 1: And everyone talks about the black lotuses like they were the biggest deal.

443
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,300
Speaker 1: No, the moxes were the big deal.

444
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,120
Speaker 0: You could still use an icy manipulator to like tap a dude's land and then he would have one less land that turn.

445
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,566
Speaker 1: Oh, so exciting.

446
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:18,480
Speaker 1: So much better than tapping his assassin to kill said assassin.

447
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,900
Speaker 0: Well, you could tap his really big creature so it couldn't attack that turn.

448
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,399
Speaker 1: Tap his really big creature to attack fucking him.

449
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,811
Speaker 0: Or you could tap something and then you could use some other card.

450
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:30,300
Speaker 0: that said do this to something that's tapped.

451
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:31,519
Speaker 0: And be like, oh, there we go.

452
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,447
Speaker 1: Alright, I'll make a reference.

453
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,680
Speaker 1: I'll use League of Leathers players.

454
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:36,279
Speaker 1: I don't know if any of you kids will even get this.

455
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,399
Speaker 1: Tap Tim to do damage to him.

456
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the original interpretation.

457
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:42,136
Speaker 1: Anyway.

458
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,099
Speaker 0: So check out my thing of the day.

459
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,499
Speaker 1: I didn't even say my thing of the day.

460
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,015
Speaker 0: Good job.

461
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:54,900
Speaker 1: So this is a Turing machine constructed with a 50 magic card combo where the cards beget other cards functions.

462
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,219
Speaker 1: This is some crazy shit.

463
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

464
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,980
Speaker 1: And again, I do not recognize a single card that is mentioned here.

465
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:02,919
Speaker 0: Not even one?

466
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,737
Speaker 1: Not even one.

467
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,700
Speaker 0: Not even the basic lands?

468
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,386
Speaker 1: Alright, let's see.

469
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:06,419
Speaker 1: Here's one of the cards.

470
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,780
Speaker 0: There has to be a basic land there.

471
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:08,719
Speaker 1: They're not listed.

472
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,739
Speaker 1: Teziah comma Orzeab Skyon.

473
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:15,139
Speaker 0: I think it's Sion.

474
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,680
Speaker 1: Human advisor.

475
00:29:17,181 --> 00:29:18,900
Speaker 1: Sacrifice three white creatures.

476
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,978
Speaker 0: Why would you do that?

477
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,540
Speaker 1: Remove target creature from the game.

478
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,020
Speaker 0: This is not a card you would use in a real game.

479
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Speaker 1: Whenever another black creature you control.

480
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,060
Speaker 1: Another black creature you control.

481
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,760
Speaker 1: Is put into the graveyard from play.

482
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,320
Speaker 1: Put a 1/1 white spirit creature token with flying into play.

483
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:43,200
Speaker 1: This is a 2/3 creature that costs one colorless, one white, and one black mana.

484
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,499
Speaker 1: And the symbol on it, I have no fucking idea what that is.

485
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:47,260
Speaker 1: It also has a black border.

486
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:48,760
Speaker 1: I don't know what that means anymore.

487
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,680
Speaker 0: It makes me wonder, like, is current magic, like, creatures are actually good?

488
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,123
Speaker 0: Because when I played magic, you basically, if you wanted to win- What, you revised?

489
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,059
Speaker 1: My green creature deck would kick the shit out of you.

490
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,660
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but I'm saying is like, in the day when I played, the way to win was to basically have no creatures.

491
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,544
Speaker 1: Whoa!

492
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,777
Speaker 1: Mindbend.

493
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:06,720
Speaker 1: Instant.

494
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:15,020
Speaker 1: Change the text target permanent by replacing all instances of one color word or one basic land type with another.

495
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:16,480
Speaker 0: That's a great card.

496
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Speaker 1: For example, you may change non-black creatures to non-green creatures or forest walk to island walk.

497
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,340
Speaker 1: But then there's a sentence at the end.

498
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,839
Speaker 1: This effect doesn't end at the end of this turn.

499
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:26,900
Speaker 0: Right, it's permanent.

500
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's an instant.

501
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Speaker 0: Right, so you play this and you would change your circle of protection red- As opposed to enchantment, which is the normal way to do that.

502
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:35,259
Speaker 0: To circle of protection blue.

503
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:35,900
Speaker 1: Anyway.

504
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,497
Speaker 1: Anyway.

505
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:45,720
Speaker 0: So, I noticed that Conrad's Twitter avatar changed to what appeared to be a drawing of Miles Edgeworth with a daft punk helmet.

506
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:46,919
Speaker 1: I did also notice that.

507
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,620
Speaker 0: And I was like, man, that is the perfect Twitter avatar for someone of Conrad's nature.

508
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:52,319
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

509
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:01,370
Speaker 0: And then I saw a link like a few minutes later, and I played this link, and onto my screen came Phoenix Wright, and I said, "Huh, I wonder if this is a-".

510
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,690
Speaker 0: Yep, it's related.

511
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:10,650
Speaker 0: What this is, is somebody took a song, which is a, I guess the song is by the Mystery Skulls.

512
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,429
Speaker 0: It's called Money?

513
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:15,650
Speaker 0: Or it's the song called Mystery Skulls by a band called Money, I'm not sure.

514
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,389
Speaker 0: I think it's, the band is Mystery Skulls because the URL is MysterySkulls.bandcamp.com.

515
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:25,070
Speaker 0: And they made an animated video to this song on their own.

516
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,069
Speaker 0: It's not a real official work, it's by a fan.

517
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:34,330
Speaker 0: And basically, it starts with Phoenix Wright sort of slamming his hands on the table on the beats.

518
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,250
Speaker 0: And then it gets pretty crazy, and totally awesome, and the song's not half bad.

519
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,870
Speaker 0: So you should watch this for internet awesomeness.

520
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,668
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

521
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,049
Speaker 1: So because my thing of the day wasn't a video, I have one more thing of the day.

522
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:51,310
Speaker 1: You may remember in the old days, Dance Dance Revolution was the game.

523
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:51,850
Speaker 0: Yep.

524
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:52,948
Speaker 1: And there was a dude.

525
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,519
Speaker 1: Dude's name was DJ 8-Ball.

526
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:57,208
Speaker 0: He's probably still alive.

527
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:04,550
Speaker 1: DJ 8-Ball was famous for faking a limp for an extended period, showing up at a Dance Dance Revolution style tournament.

528
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:05,510
Speaker 0: With a cane.

529
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,350
Speaker 1: Not a perfect attack, with a cane.

530
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,206
Speaker 1: And everyone's like, "Alright, he's gonna take the stage and do the best he

531
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:10,548
Speaker 1: can.".

532
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,950
Speaker 0: And the cane was incorporated into his routine, and his leg was just fine.

533
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,265
Speaker 1: The crowd went bullshit batshit.

534
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:18,170
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

535
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:20,050
Speaker 0: And the routine wasn't half bad.

536
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,130
Speaker 1: I'm not linking to that video, I'm linking to a video which is clearly made with a camcorder.

537
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:28,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the videos of DJ 8-Ball are so low quality.

538
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,489
Speaker 0: Some guy with a crappy old camcorder.

539
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,050
Speaker 1: This is from October 13th, 2001.

540
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,590
Speaker 0: You really didn't have high resolution digital video cameras in 2001.

541
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,560
Speaker 1: Somehow, in 2001, however, we saw this video.

542
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:44,148
Speaker 0: Yep.

543
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,583
Speaker 1: This is DJ 8-Ball performing

544
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:47,207
Speaker 1: "Cafe."

545
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:47,965
Speaker 1: Doubles.

546
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,963
Speaker 1: On a Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix machine.

547
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:52,150
Speaker 1: 4th Mix Plus, I believe.

548
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:53,129
Speaker 1: The best machine.

549
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:55,890
Speaker 1: In a tournament where he won the shit out of it.

550
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:56,385
Speaker 0: That's right.

551
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,810
Speaker 0: So I just want to point out something I learned today.

552
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,290
Speaker 0: The current version of DDR, I think, is X3.

553
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,072
Speaker 1: It is.

554
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:04,169
Speaker 1: I played that in Japan.

555
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:08,090
Speaker 1: DDR X3, I learned from-- I also have every song from it in StepMania.

556
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:08,929
Speaker 0: From Wikipedia.

557
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,646
Speaker 0: Has a mode in it known as "Second Mix

558
00:33:12,747 --> 00:33:13,089
Speaker 0: Mode."

559
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:20,070
Speaker 0: You basically can turn it into a second mix machine with all 30 second mix songs plus two extra songs.

560
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:21,830
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

561
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,827
Speaker 0: It turns into a second mix machine.

562
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:26,187
Speaker 1: X2 or second mix?

563
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:27,647
Speaker 0: Second mix.

564
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,790
Speaker 0: As in the second DDR ever.

565
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,093
Speaker 0: Whoa.

566
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,329
Speaker 0: Also, every single one of those second mix songs is available in the X3 mode.

567
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,530
Speaker 0: So you can just play the regular X3 and have access to the full second mix library.

568
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:42,369
Speaker 0: This makes me wonder.

569
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:46,209
Speaker 0: X2 did not contain a DDR first mix mode.

570
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,149
Speaker 1: But-- First mix sucked.

571
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,409
Speaker 0: Will-- they did.

572
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:52,730
Speaker 0: Will DDR X4 contain a third mix mode?

573
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:54,547
Speaker 1: If so, let's buy an X5 machine.

574
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,789
Speaker 0: Third mix has a lot of overlap with second mix.

575
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,390
Speaker 1: However, fourth mix is when everything changed.

576
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,610
Speaker 0: Will DDR X5, or whatever version that is, have a fourth mix mode?

577
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,384
Speaker 0: If so, how much money can we get together to finally buy a DDR machine?

578
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,998
Speaker 1: Last I checked, $14,000 is the going rate.

579
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,668
Speaker 0: I do not have that much money.

580
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:17,070
Speaker 1: I do, but I probably shouldn't spend it on a Dance Dance Revolution machine.

581
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,362
Speaker 0: Let's go quarter Z's.

582
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,350
Speaker 0: I pay one quarter, and you pay three quarter.

583
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:28,550
Speaker 1: How about I just continue to play in StepMania, but we buy some Cobalt Flux hardpads?

584
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:37,630
Speaker 0: Why don't we somehow emulate it in MAME, and then the real DDRX whatever in MAME by downloading it.

585
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,868
Speaker 1: Because I don't care about-- all I care about from the arcade, really, is that dance pad.

586
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,643
Speaker 0: I know, but it would be the true software arcade experience.

587
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,050
Speaker 1: We just did a lecture on this.

588
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:50,509
Speaker 1: You forget how amazing the dance pads are in DDR.

589
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:51,321
Speaker 0: I don't forget.

590
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:51,810
Speaker 0: They're perfect.

591
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,150
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

592
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,609
Speaker 0: Let's buy an arcade just the dance pad part, and then-- What are you going to hook that up to?

593
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,430
Speaker 0: A computer running-- An Arduino, yes.

594
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,508
Speaker 0: A computer running MAME.

595
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,329
Speaker 1: With an Arduino.

596
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:02,185
Speaker 0: No.

597
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:05,850
Speaker 1: Scott, have you seen how those connect to the machine?

598
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,267
Speaker 0: It's USB.

599
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:07,285
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

600
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:07,888
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

601
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:08,222
Speaker 1: No.

602
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,470
Speaker 0: It's not physically USB, but digitally it's USB.

603
00:35:12,332 --> 00:35:23,290
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they changed it, because last time I checked when I was trying to make a pad, I did make, you guys, to make me feel really old a long time ago, a hard DDR pad out of metal and wood, with plexiglass and everything.

604
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:33,830
Speaker 1: And I looked up and tried to buy an arcade pad and use it, and the connector and the standard and everything for it was bullshit.

605
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:41,490
Speaker 0: It's got all kinds of crazy weird wires coming out of it, but you can definitely make it work, because you know what's inside the DDR machine?

606
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:42,308
Speaker 1: Now a computer.

607
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:42,906
Speaker 0: A PC.

608
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:46,270
Speaker 0: It's always been some sort of normal PC computer.

609
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the old days it was like a DVD or a laser disc.

610
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:52,150
Speaker 0: There were laser discs in there, but you know what was reading the laser discs?

611
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,870
Speaker 0: They were just laser disc readers, like LD-ROMs hooked up to a computer and a monitor.

612
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:04,247
Speaker 0: Actually, the new DDR machines are really nice in that they have a widescreen LCD instead of a CRT.

613
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:05,777
Speaker 0: Yep.

614
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,588
Speaker 0: That's pretty nice.

615
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,850
Speaker 1: But I can't do my Matrix walk anymore.

616
00:36:09,998 --> 00:36:10,248
Speaker 0: Okay.

617
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,266
Speaker 1: I wonder if anyone knows what that is.

618
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:15,728
Speaker 1: Here's a hint.

619
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,028
Speaker 1: If you did that at an arcade, you would probably get beat the shit out of.

620
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

621
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,350
Speaker 1: So, metamoment.

622
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,969
Speaker 1: We're in and out of town.

623
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:30,287
Speaker 1: We recorded the show at some point in the distant past, actually, and it's up now because I'm in Mumbai right now.

624
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,070
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is awesome.

625
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:33,849
Speaker 0: You should listen to us.

626
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:34,889
Speaker 0: Check out our forum.

627
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,539
Speaker 0: You should check out our places on the internet.

628
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,350
Speaker 0: that we have it, which is all the places.

629
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:40,110
Speaker 1: Check out our videos.

630
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,450
Speaker 1: Many of you found us from PAX.

631
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 1: You realize a lot of our videos of panels and lectures from PAX are just on YouTube.

632
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,688
Speaker 0: Email newsletter, we have that.

633
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,249
Speaker 0: We have Twitter, Facebook, all those things.

634
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,469
Speaker 1: Book Club book is the man who was Thursday.

635
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,409
Speaker 1: We'll do the show on it real soon.

636
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,870
Speaker 1: The next Book Club book will be something at Scott's Pick.

637
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:57,350
Speaker 0: I think I know what it's going to be.

638
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,189
Speaker 1: And then I'm doing the Greg Gatsby right after that.

639
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,066
Speaker 0: I'm going with my strategy of book I own.

640
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:03,789
Speaker 0: I haven't read.

641
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,210
Speaker 0: That's how I have to save myself some money.

642
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,570
Speaker 1: The thing is, I'm going to read Richard Garfield's gaming book, so I got to squeeze that in.

643
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,770
Speaker 0: Well, don't make that the Book Club book because I don't really not that interested.

644
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,909
Speaker 1: You're really not that interested?

645
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:16,809
Speaker 1: Well, now it's the Book Club book.

646
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:17,330
Speaker 1: Great.

647
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,323
Speaker 0: It's not the great Gatsby.

648
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,486
Speaker 0: I fooled you.

649
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:21,990
Speaker 0: All right.

650
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:23,066
Speaker 1: So PAX.

651
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:27,930
Speaker 0: It was another PAX, the same as all the other PAXs before it, only different.

652
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:36,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were a surprising number of... Well, it wasn't that there were a lot of changes to PAX in the fundamental spiritual sense.

653
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,989
Speaker 1: But there were a lot of logistical changes to PAX.

654
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:41,670
Speaker 0: There are many things we can discuss about this PAX.

655
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,109
Speaker 0: We will not discuss the things that are common to all PAXs.

656
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:50,330
Speaker 1: Yes, if you want to know about PAX in a general sense or anything we did not talk about, listen to any of the episodes I'll link to.

657
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:56,450
Speaker 0: We will only discuss things that are unique to this PAX or unique to our experience at this PAX.

658
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,990
Speaker 1: So, first off, we went to PAX devs.

659
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,289
Speaker 1: We were actually in Seattle from Tuesday onwards.

660
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,270
Speaker 0: PAX dev badge says do not talk about PAX dev or you'll be banned from PAX dev in all future PAXs.

661
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,590
Speaker 1: Well, it says do not talk about the specifics of any talk.

662
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:11,390
Speaker 1: So, I think we can review PAX dev in a general sense.

663
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,750
Speaker 0: If you are a dev, you should probably go to PAX dev.

664
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,150
Speaker 1: If you're interested in game design and you are serious about that.

665
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:22,110
Speaker 0: Because that makes it worth the cost of entry.

666
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:26,068
Speaker 1: If you're just a gamer or you're like, I'd like to make games, but you don't care.

667
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,288
Speaker 1: You don't know about it.

668
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:37,186
Speaker 1: If you haven't played some German board games, you've not played Doom 2, you're not a programmer, you're not an artist who's deep into gaming, don't go to PAX dev.

669
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:38,010
Speaker 1: It's not for you.

670
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:40,067
Speaker 0: It's not worth the amount of money you have to pay to get in.

671
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:50,290
Speaker 0: But, if you are serious, you're actually a game designer, you work in the industry, you should go to PAX dev just to hang out with all the other people.

672
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,650
Speaker 0: And we can't say anything else because we don't want to be banned from PAX dev and all future PAXs dev or otherwise.

673
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,071
Speaker 1: Yes.

674
00:38:56,352 --> 00:39:02,630
Speaker 1: Though, we did do our panel, academia versus reality, psychology, game theory and games.

675
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:04,509
Speaker 1: And it went very well.

676
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:05,189
Speaker 1: It did.

677
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,122
Speaker 1: I can't say anything else, but it went really well.

678
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,290
Speaker 1: I learned a lot that I can't talk about.

679
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,610
Speaker 0: We can say that it existed because it's on the public PAX dev schedule.

680
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,530
Speaker 1: I will say this, you know what sucked?

681
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:18,110
Speaker 1: We did our 20 minute lecture at PAX prime on the ethics of mind control.

682
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:25,470
Speaker 1: And we learned some things at PAX dev that I really would have liked to have been able to say in that panel that we couldn't.

683
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,469
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, regular PAX.

684
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,735
Speaker 1: Regular PAX.

685
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:30,689
Speaker 1: The keynote was okay.

686
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:35,950
Speaker 0: It was basically sort of like a corporate... It was the guy who made Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet and Clang.

687
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,370
Speaker 1: I'm going to say the harshest thing I can say, and dude, I'm sorry to sound so harsh.

688
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:42,490
Speaker 1: It was a wannabe Ted Talk.

689
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,551
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:48,224
Speaker 0: But it's like he didn't really have anything that inspiring and it's like it sort of makes sense.

691
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:50,610
Speaker 0: he wouldn't have anything inspiring because this is going to be even harsher.

692
00:39:51,531 --> 00:40:01,610
Speaker 0: All you do is you made like three franchises and a huge pile of sequels and most of the time, most of the innovative stuff you did that he even bragged about was all the creative weapons he came up with.

693
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:07,690
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that's, you know, the part of the game industry that I give no fucks about.

694
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:14,490
Speaker 1: My favorite keynotes are still McGonagall, the first one we went to and the second one we went to.

695
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,590
Speaker 0: The Warren Specter one I think was good.

696
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,784
Speaker 1: We already forgot we're old men.

697
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:21,490
Speaker 1: Name anyone who's done a keynote at PAX.

698
00:40:21,991 --> 00:40:23,269
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Warren Specter did it.

699
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,187
Speaker 1: Alright, name anyone else.

700
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:26,450
Speaker 0: What's that guy's name?

701
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,169
Speaker 0: That guy?

702
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,109
Speaker 0: It's the guy from...

703
00:40:30,271 --> 00:40:31,570
Speaker 1: Will Whedon did the one of the first PAX East.

704
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's an East.

705
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,870
Speaker 0: That's too easy.

706
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,589
Speaker 1: I think if I had to rank him, it's the Ken Levine one in 2008, which is our first PAX.

707
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:49,570
Speaker 1: It's hard to compare any PAX because the first PAX I went to was in many ways the best one I went to, but it was mostly because I'd never experienced a fan convention that good before.

708
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,470
Speaker 1: I mean, I went into it before that PAX.

709
00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:06,830
Speaker 0: There was something that I think the reason that PAX was so great in my memory, not just because it was my first giving it a personal significance to me of the novelty of the experience, but because at that PAX '08, PAX still was not at full capacity.

710
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:14,950
Speaker 0: So it was much more intimate in its size, like going to see a concert, literally, where there's less people at the concert.

711
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,930
Speaker 0: You get this more intimate setting than when you go to the stadium concert.

712
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:33,370
Speaker 0: And now, any PAX you go to, even if it's your first PAX, you get the novelty aspect, but it's stadium arena concert all the time, whereas PAX '08 was still small enough to be intimate, and the PAXes before that were even more intimate, and I'm very sorry I missed them.

713
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,130
Speaker 0: It was my regret for the rest of my days.

714
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:45,770
Speaker 1: But there's a little more to it than that, because one, before I went to that PAX, the benchmark of great convention, the best conventions I'd ever been to, were Otacon.

715
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:57,030
Speaker 1: So I was comparing everything at that PAX to the best convention I'd ever been to, and it was so far beyond it that I, it's telling that after, yeah, we pretty much stopped doing Otacon.

716
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,810
Speaker 0: So anyway, the current PAX, PAX 2012, PAX Prime, let's see what was interesting.

717
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,170
Speaker 0: Number one, let's talk about the League of Legends area.

718
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:17,670
Speaker 0: They had this thing up in the top, taking up a big-ass room, and the room was 100% League of Legends, but it wasn't play League of Legends, it was spectate the North American Championships of League of Legends.

719
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,970
Speaker 0: So let me tell you, this shit was fucking epic, yo.

720
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,210
Speaker 1: This was so professionally done, independent of what you like.

721
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,830
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit about MOBAs.

722
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,290
Speaker 1: I think MOBAs as a genre are stupid, but that's fine, I think baseball is stupid too.

723
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:39,103
Speaker 0: I don't think it is stupid, I think it is a genre of game that has many fun aspects that I personally enjoy and really want to play, but there are many stupid things that are in the genre.

724
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,949
Speaker 0: they won't remove that ruin it.

725
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,170
Speaker 1: But Scott, removing them makes it no longer the genre.

726
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,830
Speaker 0: League of Legends removes many of those things, but not enough of them.

727
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:54,070
Speaker 1: I put League of Legends on the same level as Major League Baseball, in my opinion, in terms of my like of it as a thing.

728
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:59,030
Speaker 1: But seriously, this area was off the hook.

729
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:00,995
Speaker 0: It's like.

730
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,910
Speaker 0: you're thinking about the wizard, right?

731
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,070
Speaker 0: You know, with the freaking Nintendo World Championships, this was way beyond that.

732
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,326
Speaker 0: This was like, whoa.

733
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,130
Speaker 1: They had professional commentators, and it was packed over capacity.

734
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,490
Speaker 0: The whole convention, people were packed in there watching, cheering, screaming.

735
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:28,370
Speaker 1: I was there at the end of I think the semi-finals or whatever, and suddenly one guy ganks jungle deep something, another boat sinking dude.

736
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,869
Speaker 1: I don't know, I'm an old man.

737
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:35,470
Speaker 1: And the crowd goes crazy, and then the announcer starts to explain what happened.

738
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,230
Speaker 1: And it was just, it was louder than the Omega-Thon finale.

739
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:40,129
Speaker 0: It was great.

740
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,629
Speaker 0: But I personally, and Rym's going to argue against this, right?

741
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:52,290
Speaker 0: It sort of, even though it was awesome and big, even though I personally don't care about it, it's not because I personally don't care about it.

742
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:56,710
Speaker 0: If let's say, let's say for example it had been the Counter-Strike arena, right?

743
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:08,408
Speaker 0: I still personally feel that it should not be using space, this large amount of space at PAX Prime, that is shared PAX space, should be dedicated to any one game.

744
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,310
Speaker 0: The square footage.

745
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,130
Speaker 1: You mean like the Omega-Thon finale, which is dedicated to one game?

746
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,343
Speaker 0: That's not, that is main events area.

747
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:16,390
Speaker 0: It is used for many things.

748
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:25,250
Speaker 0: We are talking about a section of square footage that is dedicated to one game and only one game disproportionately for the duration of PAX, right?

749
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:30,270
Speaker 1: So you say disproportionately, that space could not have easily been used for much else.

750
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,276
Speaker 0: It caused other things at PAX to be moved around.

751
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:35,000
Speaker 0: It could have just been bigger expo hall.

752
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:37,085
Speaker 0: It could have been more tabletop.

753
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:39,150
Speaker 0: It could have been PC area is bigger.

754
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,510
Speaker 0: It could have been console preplays bigger.

755
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,030
Speaker 1: Tabletop was pretty much never full.

756
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:48,344
Speaker 0: That's because they had this red lion, the red lion tabletop might have had not to had existed.

757
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:50,030
Speaker 0: They could have just forgot the red lion.

758
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,990
Speaker 1: No, because there was more space for tabletop in the red lion and better space than that space would have been.

759
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,688
Speaker 1: And there's no area of PAX I would extend in there and also...

760
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,230
Speaker 0: They could have not had that stuff in the Hyatt, saved a lot of money getting these extra hotels involved.

761
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,430
Speaker 1: They're going to need those extra hotels anyway if they want to increase capacity.

762
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,270
Speaker 0: They could have gotten those hotels and used this space and been like, well PAX is just even bigger and more awesome.

763
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,602
Speaker 1: It was bigger and more awesome.

764
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:12,229
Speaker 1: Think about that.

765
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:18,590
Speaker 0: But adding more to the generic things that everyone can enjoy and not to just any one game.

766
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,010
Speaker 1: But why is one game different from two games in a space?

767
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:24,858
Speaker 0: Even two games.

768
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:27,588
Speaker 0: Every other area of PAX is dedicated to gaming.

769
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,650
Speaker 1: It's not arbitrary.

770
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:33,989
Speaker 1: One, unlike the Halo area, which was stupid because hardly anyone went in there.

771
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,407
Speaker 0: Well okay, so what if everyone had been cramming into the Halo area?

772
00:45:37,427 --> 00:45:37,950
Speaker 0: Then it's okay?

773
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:43,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, because PAX is for everyone and a lot of people at PAX really like that.

774
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:43,807
Speaker 1: A lot did.

775
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,610
Speaker 1: And that space, think about how crowded PAX was already this year.

776
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,830
Speaker 1: If all those people had been elsewhere in the convention...

777
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,839
Speaker 0: They would not have been elsewhere.

778
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,030
Speaker 0: They would have been in that area.

779
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,089
Speaker 0: It just would have been, you know, something else in that area.

780
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,669
Speaker 0: And not an area dedicated to a single game.

781
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,930
Speaker 1: That area was just tightly packed chairs and then standing room.

782
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:06,090
Speaker 1: There is nothing that could have put that many people in that space.

783
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:08,290
Speaker 0: You could put things in that space.

784
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,630
Speaker 1: That would occupy that many people.

785
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:11,797
Speaker 0: It could have been another theater.

786
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,330
Speaker 0: We could have had even more panel programming.

787
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,023
Speaker 1: One, that's a terrible place for a theater.

788
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:16,870
Speaker 1: It's out in the open.

789
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:25,090
Speaker 0: No, but there was the place that was... There were other places that could... For example, the console freeplay could have been there.

790
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:27,570
Speaker 0: And then the current console freeplay could have been there.

791
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,889
Speaker 1: No, I went into console freeplay a ton of times throughout PAX.

792
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,917
Speaker 1: There were several PAXes.

793
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,389
Speaker 1: Not that popular anymore.

794
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:34,869
Speaker 0: Didn't need more space.

795
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:35,990
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

796
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,830
Speaker 1: And I point out that, for all that too, people loved the League of Legends thing.

797
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,910
Speaker 1: The only people who complained about it were the people who equally suggest that the expo hall should have its own badge.

798
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,410
Speaker 0: Well, those are people that are crazy and stupid.

799
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,449
Speaker 0: Those are the same people.

800
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:50,250
Speaker 0: No, but...

801
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,070
Speaker 1: You're in league with them.

802
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,190
Speaker 0: No, I'm not in league with them.

803
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:52,649
Speaker 0: In league.

804
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,610
Speaker 0: No, you're pulling the thing that's like, "Oh, well you think, you know, this is wrong.

805
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,147
Speaker 0: So therefore, you know, you like abortion, therefore you must take

806
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:00,570
Speaker 0: taxes.".

807
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,810
Speaker 0: They have nothing to do with each other.

808
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,929
Speaker 1: They highly correlate, however.

809
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,310
Speaker 0: No, expo hall badge has nothing to do with League of Legends.

810
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:13,870
Speaker 0: You know, I do not think that you should dedicate a large amount of square footage to a single game in that way.

811
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,110
Speaker 0: And I'll show you, the way to do it right is, you may not have known this, Rym.

812
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,450
Speaker 0: But the world championships of Dota 2 were also at PAX.

813
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:22,868
Speaker 0: Yeah.

814
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,439
Speaker 0: But they were not in PAX.

815
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:26,190
Speaker 0: They were at Benaroya Hall down the road.

816
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:26,524
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,806
Speaker 0: Because Valve said, "Why should we take up all this space at PAX and dedicate it to just our game one

818
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:32,147
Speaker 0: game?".

819
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:37,230
Speaker 0: Well, you think Valve, would they have rather had it at PAX?

820
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:43,670
Speaker 0: Considering, if you look at pictures of the Benaroya Hall, not too many fannies in the seats compared to the League of Legends area.

821
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,490
Speaker 0: But are you saying Dota 2 is less popular by that much?

822
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:47,349
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

823
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,350
Speaker 0: I think it's because they weren't at PAX.

824
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,750
Speaker 1: No, well one, League of Legends has a much tighter...

825
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:53,229
Speaker 0: It was less visible and people didn't know to go there.

826
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:57,650
Speaker 1: No, independently League of Legends has a much tighter professional gaming structure around it.

827
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:05,890
Speaker 0: I think if you would swap them and move League of Legends to Benaroya Hall and put Dota 2 in that space, that the crowds sizes would have remained the same per space.

828
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:15,150
Speaker 1: No, because from what I see, the professional gaming fandom is not nearly as big and professional around Dota 2 as it is around League of Legends right now.

829
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,570
Speaker 0: I think the Dota 2 is much bigger than the League of Legends.

830
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,590
Speaker 1: No, as a game, yes, but not the professional gamer media culture.

831
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:27,290
Speaker 0: No, but on the internet, coming into PAX, the hype around the Dota 2 championship was much larger than the hype around League of Legends.

832
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,810
Speaker 1: See, I saw the exact opposite, so it's just anecdotes.

833
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:34,330
Speaker 0: And the Dota 1 was also the world championship and not just the North American finals.

834
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,849
Speaker 0: So it was even a bigger deal.

835
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,710
Speaker 1: And yet people seem to care about it less.

836
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,950
Speaker 0: It was only because it was in the PAX space that made it more crowded.

837
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:46,930
Speaker 0: If you had put the Dota 1 in the PAX space, it would have been just as packed as League of Legends 1 was.

838
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,690
Speaker 0: And if you put the League of Legends 1 in the Benaroya Hall, it would have been as packed as the Dota 1 was at this pack.

839
00:48:51,831 --> 00:48:53,550
Speaker 1: I actually don't think so, I disagree with you.

840
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,770
Speaker 0: You think you're saying all those people would have gone down to Benaroya Hall and packed it in for League of Legends when they didn't pack it in for League of Legends?

841
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:08,090
Speaker 1: The reason I say this is that if you look at pictures from the Dota thing versus the League of Legends thing, the sheer number of League of Legends cosplayers is ridiculous.

842
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,295
Speaker 0: There are plenty of Dota cosplayers.

843
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:12,543
Speaker 0: The other thing is how can you even tell the fucking difference?

844
00:49:12,563 --> 00:49:14,570
Speaker 0: because most of the characters are the same goddamn thing.

845
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:19,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, if anything, Scott, I think your distinction is arbitrary and silly.

846
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,289
Speaker 1: If I was going to remove something from PAX, I'd get rid of BYOC.

847
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,486
Speaker 0: I would not get rid of BYOC.

848
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:32,510
Speaker 1: If you ever go to BYOC, while it's cool for the idea, it's usually about half full because the people are off doing other stuff.

849
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,229
Speaker 1: It's just like private area people buy a special badge for.

850
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:41,210
Speaker 1: And most of the people in there are just fucking playing World of Warcraft or Solitaire or dicking around single player.

851
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,950
Speaker 1: It's really boring and chill and I would use that space for something different.

852
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,950
Speaker 1: I think BYOC doesn't have a useful purpose at PAX anymore.

853
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:50,890
Speaker 0: See, this is the thing I think we're on.

854
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,950
Speaker 0: BYOC is a specific culture, it's just not your culture.

855
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's League of Legends.

856
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:57,381
Speaker 0: No, League of Legends is a single game.

857
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,130
Speaker 0: The MOBA is a culture, right?

858
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,389
Speaker 0: If you made that the generic MOBA arena, I would have much less a problem with it.

859
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:03,832
Speaker 1: Why?

860
00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:06,830
Speaker 1: Why do you have a problem with a single game having a big space?

861
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,110
Speaker 0: Because this is PAX, it is for all gamers.

862
00:50:10,712 --> 00:50:13,122
Speaker 0: And yes, players of League of Legends are gamers, yes.

863
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,690
Speaker 0: But the amount of space, it is disproportionate.

864
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,210
Speaker 0: You should provide equally for all the different kinds of gamers.

865
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,819
Speaker 0: Scott, League of Legends had way less space.

866
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:30,550
Speaker 1: In fact, MOBAs as a total had way less space than, say, TableTop.

867
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,545
Speaker 0: I think, but that's the thing that's fucked up.

868
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:37,090
Speaker 0: If you look at the proportions, yeah, they had less space in total.

869
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:44,250
Speaker 0: But think about this, a single TableTop game, how much space did Settlers have compared to League of Legends?

870
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:48,990
Speaker 0: League of Legends had way more space than Settlers, which is just one game.

871
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,099
Speaker 0: And you know what, Settlers?

872
00:50:50,462 --> 00:50:51,450
Speaker 1: Not that popular.

873
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:52,274
Speaker 0: I'm not saying.

874
00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:53,198
Speaker 0: Okay, Dominion.

875
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,689
Speaker 0: How much space did Dominion have compared to...

876
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,629
Speaker 1: Probably more than half of TableTop.

877
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,390
Speaker 0: Compared to League of Legends.

878
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,714
Speaker 1: And why do you care?

879
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:03,590
Speaker 1: Who says that the games have to be represented in any equal proportion?

880
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:10,988
Speaker 0: I think there should be an equal representation of all gamer cultures at the get-together of gamers.

881
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:11,790
Speaker 0: that is the best get-together.

882
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,139
Speaker 1: Alright, one, I think that's silly.

883
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,829
Speaker 1: Two, why don't we have a big poker area?

884
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,650
Speaker 0: Because you don't want to marginalize any one subset of the gamer culture.

885
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,750
Speaker 0: What if you had the miniatures stuff, which was in the red line and had plenty of space.

886
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,788
Speaker 0: What if it was just like, "Nope, we hate miniatures guys, we can eat one tiny

887
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:27,070
Speaker 0: table.".

888
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:32,690
Speaker 0: Or what if it was like, "We love miniatures guys, we're gonna have this giant room, Warhammer

889
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,790
Speaker 0: only.".

890
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:36,329
Speaker 1: You know what, that'd be pretty cool if one year they had a big Warhammer area.

891
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,767
Speaker 0: Nope, and you try to bring your war machine in there and like, "Nope, this is Warhammer

892
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:39,908
Speaker 0: only.".

893
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,516
Speaker 1: But Scott, this was a spectacle.

894
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,390
Speaker 1: This was basically a big panel room the whole time, showing this competition.

895
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:45,714
Speaker 0: I don't like that.

896
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,450
Speaker 0: it was one game disproportionately taking up space.

897
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,221
Speaker 1: There's a crotchety and old manny about it.

898
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:51,630
Speaker 1: And your argument is ludicrous.

899
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,770
Speaker 0: If it had been Counter-Strike, I would have had the same complaint.

900
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,550
Speaker 1: Yes, I think your argument is ludicrous in light of the fact that no other type of event could have used that space as effectively.

901
00:52:00,253 --> 00:52:02,090
Speaker 0: It would have been space that could have been used.

902
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:02,832
Speaker 1: For what?

903
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:04,481
Speaker 0: The tabletop that wasn't full?

904
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:06,110
Speaker 1: The console preplay that wasn't full?

905
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,710
Speaker 0: There's plenty of stuff at PAX, you can always have all kinds of gaming going on.

906
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,810
Speaker 1: They never get a big arcade because they don't have space.

907
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:15,349
Speaker 0: They could have had a big arcade, they just refused to.

908
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,630
Speaker 1: Because they have no good space for it, and PAX would destroy arcade machines.

909
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:21,549
Speaker 0: They have arcade machines there!

910
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, a tiny number in a tiny room, that's on purpose.

911
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should get friggin' man up and get a big ass arcade.

912
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:28,210
Speaker 1: They can afford it.

913
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,650
Speaker 1: Scott, the only reason it works at MAGFest is because not that many people go to MAGFest.

914
00:52:32,312 --> 00:52:34,850
Speaker 0: You could have a big arcade that's proportionate to the number of people.

915
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:36,355
Speaker 1: No, you really can't.

916
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:39,270
Speaker 1: MAGFest has pretty much the biggest arcade you could have at a convention reasonably.

917
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:39,652
Speaker 0: Why not?

918
00:52:39,712 --> 00:52:42,290
Speaker 0: Why couldn't you have a large arcade with all kinds of crazy games?

919
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:43,689
Speaker 1: Power concerns, money concerns, logistics.

920
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:46,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, how much do you think that friggin' League of Legends thing costs?

921
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,048
Speaker 1: Probably... not that much, actually.

922
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,530
Speaker 1: In fact, the cost of League of Legends things in terms of running it was probably mostly the labor.

923
00:52:56,571 --> 00:53:00,850
Speaker 0: They can do anything they want, they have mad monies, they could have a mega awesome super arcade.

924
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,990
Speaker 1: Uh, Scott, who paid for all the League of Legends stuff?

925
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:03,870
Speaker 0: The League of Legends guys.

926
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if PAX does an arcade, who pays for that?

927
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,349
Speaker 0: Whoever's got the arcade.

928
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,956
Speaker 1: Uh, no, you mean PAX.

929
00:53:09,498 --> 00:53:11,930
Speaker 1: Why would I pay to bring my arcade to PAX?

930
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:13,749
Speaker 0: Make people put quarters in.

931
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:15,089
Speaker 1: Uh, no, it's free.

932
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:16,330
Speaker 0: Why does it have to be free?

933
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,750
Speaker 1: Because if it's not free, almost no one's gonna go over to it.

934
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,309
Speaker 1: MAGFest is free because otherwise people wouldn't put quarters in.

935
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:27,430
Speaker 0: I think if you had a giant Uber arcade that had a fucking everything, and you had to put quarters in, people would put quarters in.

936
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,012
Speaker 0: That's silly.

937
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:31,270
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just think you have this weird fixation on League of Legends and moments.

938
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,970
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with League of Legends, I said!

939
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:40,328
Speaker 0: If it was Counter-Strike, if the whole area was Dominion only, I would have said, "That's fucked up, you have this one giant room that's Dominion

940
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:40,468
Speaker 0: only.".

941
00:53:41,271 --> 00:53:44,170
Speaker 1: This was not the League of Legends only area in essence.

942
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,210
Speaker 1: What it really was, was the professional gaming area.

943
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:52,590
Speaker 0: And it so happens that MOBAs- If it was the professional gaming area, it should have switched between different professional gaming competitions.

944
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:56,090
Speaker 1: Scott, in the US, MOBAs are the only professional gaming area worth anything.

945
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,710
Speaker 0: No, there is plenty- what are you talking about?

946
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:03,950
Speaker 0: There is huge RTS, fighting games, and other FPS gaming.

947
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,250
Speaker 1: And they don't get nearly the press that the MOBAs are getting lately.

948
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:11,767
Speaker 0: At least, at this moment, there is plenty of professional gaming of all kinds.

949
00:54:11,787 --> 00:54:12,509
Speaker 0: The RTSs are huge.

950
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,409
Speaker 1: And I think the MOBAs have a lot more momentum right now.

951
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:19,350
Speaker 0: At this exact moment, but there is huge professional gaming in many, many genres.

952
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:26,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm saying, I think MOBAs are overshadowing all of them, and give it six months, and you're gonna see MOBAs dominating American professional gaming.

953
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:31,050
Speaker 0: No, there is professional gaming of all kinds that is all huge, all over the place.

954
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Settlers, giant tournament, not that huge.

955
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, whatever.

956
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:35,450
Speaker 0: It's not.

957
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,430
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's go to other things that are different at PAX besides this thing that Rym is wrong about.

958
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,629
Speaker 1: The thing that Scott has a ridiculous obsession with.

959
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:43,128
Speaker 0: That thing that Rym can't get over.

960
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:48,830
Speaker 1: I just don't understand why you have such a bug up your butt about one professional thing that was super popular at PAX.

961
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,490
Speaker 0: It happened because you dedicated a large area of PAX to one thing.

962
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:59,069
Speaker 0: What if there was a whole area of PAX that was just... I think we've said the same thing over and over again a hundred times.

963
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you haven't changed your argument.

964
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:07,170
Speaker 0: What if you went to Otacon, and there was one gigantic room, and that room was the Evangelion-only room.

965
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:08,514
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

966
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,190
Speaker 1: What, are they just marathoning Evangelion?

967
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:15,950
Speaker 0: It's the only thing that's in there that's Evangelion, and it's taking up this gigantic room, and that's all it is.

968
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:17,470
Speaker 0: There's no other animes in there or anything.

969
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:21,130
Speaker 1: Alright, so is that room completely packed for the entire count of people lining up trying to get in?

970
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:21,377
Speaker 1: Yeah.

971
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:22,670
Speaker 1: Then yeah, that's awesome.

972
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,930
Speaker 0: So, you got no problem with that?

973
00:55:25,074 --> 00:55:25,118
Speaker 0: No.

974
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,070
Speaker 0: See, I think that's fucked up, because it's supposed to be an anime con.

975
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:31,930
Speaker 0: It's sort of fucked up to have one thing overrepresented in that way.

976
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,310
Speaker 1: You mean have one thing that's ridiculously popular represented to a relative proportion of its popularity?

977
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:41,710
Speaker 0: Yes, I think a convention is better when it equally services all of its subcultures, right?

978
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:43,089
Speaker 0: Because the idea of PAX is...

979
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,150
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott, so then Kineticon had better equally service the furries.

980
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:48,230
Speaker 0: It does equally service the furries.

981
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,502
Speaker 1: We had one furry panel.

982
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:50,350
Speaker 1: I denied all the rest.

983
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:57,330
Speaker 0: That is panel-wise, there is plenty of furry service at Kineticon in proportion to the number of furries who were there.

984
00:55:58,432 --> 00:55:58,894
Speaker 1: How so?

985
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,221
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them there, actually.

986
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:02,130
Speaker 1: Way more than the relative panel content.

987
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,238
Speaker 0: Just panel content you're looking at.

988
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,810
Speaker 0: There is plenty of things at Kineticon for furries to do.

989
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,650
Speaker 0: They are very happy there and they come often and they are welcome.

990
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,169
Speaker 1: But they're not dedicated to furries.

991
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,550
Speaker 0: There are many things at Kineticon that are dedicated to furries.

992
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,032
Speaker 1: Alright, fine.

993
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:14,455
Speaker 1: Otakon.

994
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:15,582
Speaker 1: Huge furry culture.

995
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:16,830
Speaker 1: Basically nothing for them.

996
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:18,370
Speaker 0: There are things at Kineticon for furries.

997
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,970
Speaker 0: Only unofficial cosplay photos.

998
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,690
Speaker 0: There are plenty of things in the dealer's room in the artist alley.

999
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:23,173
Speaker 1: What?

1000
00:56:23,193 --> 00:56:24,349
Speaker 1: What in the dealer's room?

1001
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:27,330
Speaker 0: There's plenty of people selling furry shit in the dealer's room.

1002
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,940
Speaker 1: Also, what's in the dealer's room?

1003
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,450
Speaker 1: That content is not run by the convention.

1004
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,533
Speaker 0: It's still content.

1005
00:56:31,614 --> 00:56:36,190
Speaker 0: It's still a proportion of the convention is dedicated to the things that they want.

1006
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:40,470
Speaker 1: Alright, so why aren't you mad that Firefall is this gigantic area in the expo hall?

1007
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:41,434
Speaker 0: That's the expo hall.

1008
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:43,826
Speaker 0: And the expo hall was not the Firefall hall.

1009
00:56:43,926 --> 00:56:44,690
Speaker 0: It was the expo hall.

1010
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:48,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the Firefall had this gigantic edifice inside of it.

1011
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they bought it.

1012
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:50,490
Speaker 0: That was part of the expo hall.

1013
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, so League of Legends bought that bit.

1014
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:54,110
Speaker 1: Consider that part of the expo hall.

1015
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,230
Speaker 1: Scott, that's just the annex of the expo hall.

1016
00:56:56,532 --> 00:56:57,740
Speaker 0: No, it's not part of the expo hall.

1017
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,170
Speaker 0: It was the League of Legends area.

1018
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,890
Speaker 1: Would you have had a problem if that was just in the expo hall?

1019
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:04,138
Speaker 1: No.

1020
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,090
Speaker 1: It was the League of Legends area in the expo hall?

1021
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,070
Speaker 0: No, that would have been okay.

1022
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,630
Speaker 1: But they're the same thing for all intents and purposes.

1023
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,173
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

1024
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:11,950
Speaker 0: It's a specialized separate area.

1025
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,130
Speaker 0: It was not integrated in the expo hall next to all the other expo hall things.

1026
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,390
Speaker 1: What if they just called it the expo hall annex and it was the League of Legends thing the whole time?

1027
00:57:21,953 --> 00:57:27,110
Speaker 0: See, did they enlarge the expo hall by a whole room just to give it to them?

1028
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,340
Speaker 0: Or was it, "Here is this giant expo hall.

1029
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,848
Speaker 0: They happen to buy a large piece of

1030
00:57:30,928 --> 00:57:30,988
Speaker 0: it.".

1031
00:57:31,677 --> 00:57:32,330
Speaker 0: That's the difference.

1032
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:33,116
Speaker 1: Who cares?

1033
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:34,450
Speaker 1: That intent doesn't matter.

1034
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,570
Speaker 1: What matters is that it was super popular.

1035
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:38,569
Speaker 0: Why can't you just get off this?

1036
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,290
Speaker 1: Because you bring it up constantly.

1037
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,210
Speaker 0: I brought it up once and you wouldn't let it go.

1038
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,310
Speaker 0: And then we spent the whole pack show talking about this one thing.

1039
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we got it long enough.

1040
00:57:45,437 --> 00:57:46,202
Speaker 1: This isn't the pack show.

1041
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,390
Speaker 1: It's that show and we'll call it a night.

1042
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:48,730
Speaker 0: Okay, fine.

1043
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:25,590
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
