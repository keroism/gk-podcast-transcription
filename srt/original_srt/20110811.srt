1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,366
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, August 11th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:10,547
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,635
Speaker 0: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,589
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,599
Speaker 1: Tonight, Play Dead.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,978
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,933
Speaker 0: Hey Rym, I am not a lawyer.

8
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:28,459
Speaker 0: Did you know that?

9
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:29,227
Speaker 1: Uh, you know what?

10
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,220
Speaker 1: I am also not a lawyer.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,900
Speaker 1: Nothing ever said on Geek Nights should be construed to be legal advice of any kind.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,340
Speaker 0: Hey Rym, do you want to give me some non-legal advice?

13
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:37,020
Speaker 0: Perhaps.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,658
Speaker 0: I want to read some law to you.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,150
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,440
Speaker 0: This is from the back of my lease renewal.

17
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:42,216
Speaker 1: Oh no.

18
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:47,900
Speaker 1: I love how my lease renewal has, it says "you cannot sublet" and an asterisk.

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,960
Speaker 1: And then there's a separate thing included by the city that is like, regardless of what your lease says, you can sublet.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,199
Speaker 0: According to these restrictions.

21
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:56,677
Speaker 0: Yup.

22
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:57,311
Speaker 0: And whatever.

23
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:57,619
Speaker 0: Anyway.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Speaker 0: If the owner offers a renewal lease less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the existing lease, the lease term selected by the tenant shall begin at the tenant's option either (1) on the date a renewal lease would have begun had a timely offer been made, or (2) on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the date that the owner does offer the lease to the tenant.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,160
Speaker 0: So, this lease was offered, the date on, it says dated July 26, 2011.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,373
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,178
Speaker 0: My rents are due on the first of the month.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,280
Speaker 0: Therefore, 90 days from that is like October 10th-ish, something like that.

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:46,360
Speaker 0: Meaning, that if I chose option (2) on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90, no less than 90 days after the date the owner does offer the lease to the tenant.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,520
Speaker 0: So, the rent, the lease expires September 30th, 2011.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:00,979
Speaker 0: Which means, the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after the owner does offer the lease to the tenant would be November 1st, and not October 1st.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,563
Speaker 1: Ah.

33
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:18,160
Speaker 0: The guidelines rate applicable for such a lease shall be no greater than the rate in effect on the commencement date of the lease for which a timely offer should have been made, and the increased rental shall not begin before the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days after such offer is made.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,520
Speaker 1: So, I feel like you could get away with having one more month of the previous rent.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
Speaker 0: That is my reading as well.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,607
Speaker 0: My rent is going to go up by $57.52 per month if I choose a one-year extension.

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,757
Speaker 0: Which means I think I should be paying the old lower rent in the month of October and not have to pay the extra $57 until the month of November.

38
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:41,740
Speaker 1: I would, however, run that by a lawyer.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,826
Speaker 0: So, I gotta call a lawyer for $57.

40
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,614
Speaker 0: It's going to cost me more than $57.

41
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:46,940
Speaker 0: It's not until a lawyer.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Speaker 1: The problem here is that there's so much weird legality around rents and leases, partly because tenants get fucked if they're not well-regulated on one side, and landlords get fucked if they're not well-regulated on the other side, and I don't think there is a middle ground that is good for everybody.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Speaker 0: Well, I think I'm going to call the State of New York Division of Housing in something something here, or there's like a rent panel or something.

44
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, you may file a complaint with the DHCR if you have something.

45
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,988
Speaker 1: I hope my rent doesn't go up that much.

46
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,335
Speaker 1: It only went up like $20 last time.

47
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:28,880
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm going to call up, because there's a new management company and I couldn't find their phone number.

48
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,920
Speaker 0: I found out they're actually two management companies with different names, but they're the same company.

49
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,631
Speaker 0: So, I was able to find the other company, call him up.

50
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:36,817
Speaker 0: I found the right guy.

51
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,440
Speaker 0: I talked to him.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,637
Speaker 0: He seemed like a nice enough guy, but when I confronted him with this question, he was like, "Uh...".

53
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:45,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine is like all business.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,115
Speaker 1: It's like a call center.

55
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:48,078
Speaker 1: It gets outsourced.

56
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:48,680
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,735
Speaker 0: But then I also asked him, he was like, "Is there anything wrong with the

58
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:52,056
Speaker 0: building?".

59
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:52,740
Speaker 0: He was trying to be nice.

60
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,768
Speaker 0: And I was like, "No, the building's

61
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:54,031
Speaker 0: good.".

62
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,120
Speaker 0: And you know, he's chatting.

63
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,480
Speaker 1: Except when my apartment got robbed.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,386
Speaker 0: Well, no, but then I was like, "Wait a minute.

65
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,911
Speaker 0: There is one thing.

66
00:04:01,272 --> 00:04:03,059
Speaker 0: Can I get some fucking Fios up in this

67
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:03,340
Speaker 0: shit?".

68
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,482
Speaker 0: Right?

69
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:08,978
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Call Verizon, and then if they need something from me, call

70
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:09,118
Speaker 0: me.".

71
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:10,868
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call them and do it.

72
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:12,216
Speaker 0: Why not?

73
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:12,760
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt.

74
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,440
Speaker 1: It's sad that you have to come over here and ration your BitTorrents if they're big enough.

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,466
Speaker 0: Uploading is the main thing.

76
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,839
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt to fucking call, so I'm gonna.

77
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,520
Speaker 0: But I'm also gonna call someone about my... I'm not gonna get a lawyer for $57.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,247
Speaker 0: If I need to fight to get $57, and it costs money to fight...

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,420
Speaker 1: See, that's why I wouldn't go for it.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,260
Speaker 0: I mean, going to small claims court is $50 already, right?

81
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:36,979
Speaker 1: That's why I wouldn't go for it.

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,957
Speaker 0: But if I can do it for free...

83
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,178
Speaker 1: Even if you're right, and you do it for free, they'll probably fight because economy or scale...

84
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,134
Speaker 0: If they want to fight, let them fight.

85
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:46,800
Speaker 0: That's fine by me.

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,039
Speaker 1: But then you'll have to fight back.

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,200
Speaker 0: It won't cost me anything to fight back.

88
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,040
Speaker 0: I'm just showing up and filling out papers.

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,319
Speaker 1: No, no, so here's what would happen.

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,620
Speaker 1: Here's my expectation if they wanted to fight.

91
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,945
Speaker 0: For $57 and 52 cents.

92
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,594
Speaker 1: How do you go about paying the lower rent?

93
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,520
Speaker 1: You just pay the lower rent?

94
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:11,860
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, hopefully, I would call someone else, and then they would send me a rent statement for the lower amount.

95
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,578
Speaker 1: They won't do that.

96
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,768
Speaker 0: So I'll send them a check in October.

97
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:16,637
Speaker 0: that is $57 and 52 cents under what they're asking for.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,740
Speaker 1: And you know what I would do if I were the landlord?

99
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,359
Speaker 1: I just wouldn't say anything.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:29,820
Speaker 1: Your next rent bill would say current rent due X, past due from previous rent Y, and I would just bill you for it.

101
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,519
Speaker 0: I would just keep paying whatever I was owed properly.

102
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,659
Speaker 1: I would keep accruing interest on that and eventually send a collections agency after you.

103
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,719
Speaker 0: I would go...

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,980
Speaker 1: Then you're going to have to fight and pay money.

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,886
Speaker 1: You're going to do that?

106
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,400
Speaker 1: You're going to pay the $57.

107
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,431
Speaker 1: Now, plus interest.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,678
Speaker 1: Also, they would have ammo if they wanted to kick you out.

109
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Speaker 0: The thing is, I would take care of it before it got to the collections agency.

110
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,780
Speaker 1: But they probably wouldn't say anything.

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,911
Speaker 1: Or maybe they'd call you one day and be like, "You owe us

112
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,701
Speaker 1: $4,000.".

113
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,796
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Fuck, no I

114
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:03,019
Speaker 0: don't.".

115
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:05,279
Speaker 1: I don't know.

116
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,120
Speaker 0: I'm just going to see if I can call someone and get it sorted out for free.

117
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,079
Speaker 0: Here's the trouble.

118
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:15,040
Speaker 1: They don't know if they're obligated to do this or not.

119
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:16,538
Speaker 1: And you don't know.

120
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,259
Speaker 0: I'm going to call someone and find out.

121
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:21,280
Speaker 0: Who are you going to call?

122
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Speaker 1: The city's not going to tell you.

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,120
Speaker 1: I'd call 311.

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,960
Speaker 1: Those city hotlines, Scott, are not allowed to give you legal advice.

125
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
Speaker 0: No, but I can call the Division of Housing and whatever.

126
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I've called places like that before.

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,438
Speaker 0: For administration.

128
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:37,660
Speaker 1: Emily, her old landlord, which was also our old landlord, never gave her a security deposit back.

129
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 1: She actually had no... At least we put a hole in the ceiling and we left some messes behind.

130
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,739
Speaker 1: So I don't feel that bad.

131
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,811
Speaker 0: Even though he said, "That's

132
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:45,176
Speaker 0: fine."

133
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Speaker 0: We just never asked for it.

134
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:49,834
Speaker 1: I didn't want to fight too hard.

135
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:50,380
Speaker 1: Just a pain in the ass.

136
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,860
Speaker 1: But Emily's fighting and it's really hard to learn what the law really is without a lawyer.

137
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,639
Speaker 1: Because any city agency you call will be like, "Uh, we can't give you advice, so..." Click.

138
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,506
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

139
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:08,260
Speaker 0: The city should... It's like, I'm asking the government for what the law is.

140
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,440
Speaker 0: They should have to fucking tell me.

141
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:13,760
Speaker 1: Scott, I got an assessment of the property lines of that house I was going to buy in Beacon.

142
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,013
Speaker 1: You realize any question I asked anyone was responded to with, "We cannot give you advice on

143
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:21,254
Speaker 1: this.".

144
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,669
Speaker 1: And I was like, "So, what?

145
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,078
Speaker 1: Is this a form I should fill out to get an

146
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:27,519
Speaker 1: assessment?".

147
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:28,872
Speaker 1: "It says assessment form.

148
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:29,297
Speaker 1: Is this the

149
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:29,499
Speaker 1: form?".

150
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,529
Speaker 1: They're like, "We can't give you

151
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:30,913
Speaker 1: advice.".

152
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:36,339
Speaker 1: I'm like, "So I'm going to fill this form out and I'm going to give you a

153
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:36,580
Speaker 1: check.".

154
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,608
Speaker 1: "Because it says you need like

155
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,281
Speaker 1: $100.".

156
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,557
Speaker 1: "Will an assessment form come out of you after I do

157
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:42,798
Speaker 1: this?".

158
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,699
Speaker 1: And they wouldn't tell me.

159
00:07:45,723 --> 00:07:46,820
Speaker 0: Well, they should have to tell you.

160
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,500
Speaker 0: I know they should.

161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:55,705
Speaker 0: There's a difference between giving legal advice, obviously this isn't what it is, but legal advice should be like, "Okay, look.

162
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:56,809
Speaker 0: I have a business.

163
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,634
Speaker 0: Some guy did something.

164
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,139
Speaker 0: Should I sue him or

165
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:00,400
Speaker 0: not?".

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,090
Speaker 0: "Is it a good

167
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:01,618
Speaker 0: idea?".

168
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,694
Speaker 0: "Could I sue him for this?

169
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,379
Speaker 0: Could I sue him for

170
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:04,560
Speaker 0: that?".

171
00:08:05,262 --> 00:08:06,627
Speaker 0: "I was accused of a crime.

172
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,052
Speaker 0: Should I plead guilty?

173
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:08,615
Speaker 0: Should I

174
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:08,936
Speaker 0: settle?".

175
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:11,151
Speaker 0: "What should I do?

176
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:11,657
Speaker 0: I don't know what to

177
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:11,758
Speaker 0: do.".

178
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,277
Speaker 1: Legal advice should be, "What is the

179
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:14,660
Speaker 1: law?".

180
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,501
Speaker 1: Every time you get a new job, what do you do?

181
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,466
Speaker 1: You fill out your W-9s, W-4s, or I-9, W-4s.

182
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,427
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the W-4.

183
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:28,880
Speaker 1: Every HR person I've ever talked to, which interestingly has always been a lady in my entire life, has said, "No, wait.

184
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,384
Speaker 0: No, not

185
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:29,687
Speaker 0: true.".

186
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:32,407
Speaker 1: "I've never had a non-female HR

187
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:32,749
Speaker 1: person.".

188
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:32,972
Speaker 0: "I

189
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,135
Speaker 0: did.".

190
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,583
Speaker 1: But they will always say,

191
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,107
Speaker 1: "Alright.".

192
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,248
Speaker 1: Especially to young people, "This is the form where you pick how many exemptions you

193
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:40,470
Speaker 1: have.".

194
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,267
Speaker 1: "I can't give you any

195
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:42,490
Speaker 1: advice.".

196
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,743
Speaker 1: And it even says on the form, "They can't give you any

197
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:45,049
Speaker 1: advice.".

198
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:48,903
Speaker 1: And then they always pause and say, "You pretty much want to write either 0 or

199
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,031
Speaker 1: 1.".

200
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,124
Speaker 1: "Unless you know why you need to write a different

201
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:52,406
Speaker 1: number.".

202
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:57,689
Speaker 1: I feel like that should be okay to say.

203
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,210
Speaker 1: I don't think it is actually okay to say, though.

204
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,563
Speaker 0: But it's like you're reading the form, and you see what the form... I looked at this paper.

205
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,270
Speaker 0: I have a lease here.

206
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,219
Speaker 0: I read what it says.

207
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:13,372
Speaker 0: In plain English, that tells me I do not owe them that $57.52.

208
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:17,164
Speaker 0: But then I ask someone, "I just read this, and that's what I think it

209
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:17,567
Speaker 0: says.".

210
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,035
Speaker 0: It almost 100% clearly says that.

211
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,369
Speaker 0: Does it indeed say that?

212
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,501
Speaker 0: "You need to get a

213
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:24,828
Speaker 0: lawyer.".

214
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,759
Speaker 0: It's like, "What the fuck?

215
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,224
Speaker 0: Just tell

216
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:26,346
Speaker 0: me!".

217
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,019
Speaker 0: "You wrote the form!

218
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:28,905
Speaker 0: You can tell me what that

219
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:29,308
Speaker 0: means!".

220
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:38,710
Speaker 1: I will, however, look into this because my lease renewal came like three weeks before we had to renew last time.

221
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,070
Speaker 1: And I'm kind of thinking about moving.

222
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,510
Speaker 0: What's wrong with this building?

223
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,680
Speaker 1: This building's okay, but I got a lot of money.

224
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:51,789
Speaker 1: When we moved in here, I made way less money than I do now.

225
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,950
Speaker 0: So you had to move into an even fancier building?

226
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,490
Speaker 0: Is that just it?

227
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,421
Speaker 0: I would move into a similarly fancy building.

228
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,970
Speaker 1: I basically want the same apartment just in a nicer neighborhood.

229
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,211
Speaker 1: Like, literally, I want to go two to three stops closer to Manhattan on the 7.

230
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,609
Speaker 1: Or a little more north toward Astoria near you.

231
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,170
Speaker 0: You can cut this fancy building across the street from me.

232
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,229
Speaker 1: There are, but Vernon Jackson is really nice.

233
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:19,109
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm gonna call up this other place here.

234
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,830
Speaker 1: So, we talk a lot about trolls and hacking and all that stuff, and usually when someone trolls someone, it's on the internet.

235
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,988
Speaker 1: Usually when they hack something, it's on the internet.

236
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,290
Speaker 1: But occasionally you have the person who hacks a physical thing, hacks a person, trolls a person in real life.

237
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,537
Speaker 1: All three of these things came together in Germany.

238
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:44,722
Speaker 1: I can't believe I never thought of this, though there is a precedent in The Simpsons for this very thing happening.

239
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,536
Speaker 0: So, some people made a t-shirt.

240
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:58,290
Speaker 1: The t-shirt quotes the so-called design of a skull and right-wing flags with the words "Hardcore

241
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,154
Speaker 1: Rebels."

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,649
Speaker 1: This was aimed at neo-Nazi skinhead dickwads.

243
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,669
Speaker 0: So they gave them all free t-shirts that they would like.

244
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,256
Speaker 1: Yep, you go to a skinhead concert and you're like, "Check out this skinhead t-shirt.

245
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:10,902
Speaker 0: Totally

246
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:11,185
Speaker 0: free.".

247
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:21,550
Speaker 1: Turns out, when they get wet, or you wash them, all that design disappears and now it's an anti-racism t-shirt.

248
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,172
Speaker 0: Nice.

249
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,030
Speaker 1: I think that's pretty great.

250
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:32,089
Speaker 0: Let's give out free t-shirts to fanboys and anime cons that have perverted moe girls on it, and then when you wash, they'll never wash them.

251
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:37,669
Speaker 0: So, basically in the heat, as opposed to in the water, because they're never going to touch water.

252
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,590
Speaker 1: Now, what do you want it to turn into?

253
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,517
Speaker 1: Because I think...

254
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,901
Speaker 0: I'm a perverted fanboy.

255
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:43,849
Speaker 0: Don't come near me.

256
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:44,867
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

257
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:48,107
Speaker 1: I would simply have it turn into the Forever Alone face.

258
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:50,738
Speaker 0: That's just insulting.

259
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,829
Speaker 1: They mean the same thing.

260
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,960
Speaker 1: I'm just... I don't know.

261
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,577
Speaker 1: I love stuff like this.

262
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:57,810
Speaker 1: I mean, one, I love pranks.

263
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,921
Speaker 0: Or it could start out as like a cute little girl and then when it gets hot, it turns into porn or you go to jail.

264
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,927
Speaker 1: Scott, you know what would scare those guys the most?

265
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:05,089
Speaker 1: Trust?

266
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:09,249
Speaker 1: If it's a cute little girl, it turns into a sexy adult girl.

267
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:09,695
Speaker 0: No.

268
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,250
Speaker 0: I love pranks.

269
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,906
Speaker 1: I love hacking things.

270
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:15,999
Speaker 1: I love hacking people.

271
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,090
Speaker 1: I love messing with people.

272
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,837
Speaker 1: I love trolling.

273
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:23,046
Speaker 1: So, this is pretty much a perfect storm and I really want to come up...

274
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:23,470
Speaker 0: Is this a news?

275
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,784
Speaker 0: It sounds like a thing of the day to me.

276
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:28,609
Speaker 1: It's a news because I feel like we need to use this to greater effect.

277
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,530
Speaker 1: Who could we target that would have the most impact?

278
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,030
Speaker 0: Who do we like the least?

279
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:40,018
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's like, okay, we could give them to corrupt politicians, but they don't want free t-shirts.

280
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:40,970
Speaker 1: They don't wear t-shirts.

281
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,513
Speaker 0: Right.

282
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:46,323
Speaker 0: It has to be someone we don't like that also likes free t-shirts and will wear them.

283
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:46,890
Speaker 1: Tea party.

284
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,979
Speaker 0: Are they going to wear the free t-shirt and give them immediately?

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,449
Speaker 1: The only trouble with the tea parties is you're going to have to get from.

286
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:55,090
Speaker 1: your sizes are pretty much from XL up.

287
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,629
Speaker 0: Let's just get into religious people.

288
00:12:59,027 --> 00:12:59,090
Speaker 1: Oh.

289
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,009
Speaker 1: That's the way to do it.

290
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:05,070
Speaker 1: When I talk about pranks, my favorite kind of prank is the subtle prank.

291
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:08,182
Speaker 0: Or we can give them to randy type people.

292
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:12,949
Speaker 0: It's like a pro-fake medicine shirt and then it's like science is king.

293
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,149
Speaker 0: Sciencebasedmedicine.org.

294
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,828
Speaker 1: You just give them homeopathic shirts.

295
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,029
Speaker 0: Here's one rim.

296
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:23,860
Speaker 0: You're wearing it.

297
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,990
Speaker 1: I am indeed.

298
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,949
Speaker 1: Scott Johnston has a non-homeopathic sweater.

299
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,790
Speaker 1: Let's say you want to get religious people.

300
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:42,930
Speaker 1: You have a really religiously nice Jesus doing something shirt and you make it change very subtly when it's washed.

301
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,690
Speaker 0: To make them believe that something magical happened?

302
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,889
Speaker 0: Stigmata appear.

303
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:48,345
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

304
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:55,970
Speaker 0: If you could develop an even better science to where multiple washings causes more changes.

305
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:57,089
Speaker 1: It's like a gobstopper.

306
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:00,718
Speaker 0: It's perfectly synced up chemically.

307
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:00,961
Speaker 0: One wash.

308
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,230
Speaker 0: Second wash, something else happens.

309
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,909
Speaker 0: Third wash, something else happens.

310
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:13,068
Speaker 1: If we had better technology, you'd pull a Batman where the shirt is fine until a particular gas is in the room and then oh shit.

311
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:16,789
Speaker 1: Then you get everyone at once changes.

312
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:25,230
Speaker 0: You give out the shirts in winter but then the shirts have to get hot before they change.

313
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,678
Speaker 1: I feel like I want to figure out exactly how they did it.

314
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:29,569
Speaker 1: See if it works.

315
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:35,009
Speaker 0: I think they just did a one time thing where they basically had a dissolving pigment on the shirt.

316
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,533
Speaker 0: You could just silkscreen it with something that dissolves in water and then when you wash it, it goes away.

317
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:44,986
Speaker 1: I want to figure out how to do this if it can be made better and then I want to come up with a really good way to use this.

318
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,029
Speaker 1: Because I really don't like Illinois Nazis.

319
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:48,792
Speaker 0: No.

320
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:49,689
Speaker 1: Really.

321
00:14:51,642 --> 00:15:01,069
Speaker 0: So London Riots, I don't want to talk about the London Riots themselves but I do want to talk about this article on the MSNBC World Blog.

322
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,540
Speaker 1: I am going to make a prediction.

323
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:06,150
Speaker 1: This article is grossly uninformed and you're mad about that.

324
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,797
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

325
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,830
Speaker 0: Actually, this is like the only article that I think is approaching this story the right way.

326
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:16,355
Speaker 0: It's very short and it's pretty much like the title is "The Sad Truth Behind London

327
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:16,679
Speaker 0: Riot."

328
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,349
Speaker 0: And I'm only going to read a couple paragraphs here.

329
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:32,038
Speaker 0: "As political and social protests throughout the Middle East are growing in Europe and a riot exploded in North London this weekend, here's the sad truth expressed by a Londoner when asked by a television reporter, 'Is rioting the correct way to express your

330
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:32,665
Speaker 0: discontent?'.

331
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,989
Speaker 0: 'Yes,' said the young man.

332
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,817
Speaker 0: 'You wouldn't be talking to me now if we didn't riot, would

333
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,021
Speaker 0: you?'.

334
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:43,770
Speaker 0: The TV reporter from Britain's ITV had no response so the young man pressed his advantage.

335
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,570
Speaker 0: 'Two months ago we marched a Scotland Yard, more than 2,000 of us, all blacks, and it was peaceful and calm.

336
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,256
Speaker 0: And you know what?

337
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,669
Speaker 0: Not a word in the press.

338
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:55,022
Speaker 0: Last night, a bit of rioting and looting, and look around

339
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:55,204
Speaker 0: you.'".

340
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:13,729
Speaker 0: Alright, so basically I think this angle, that this is the only article I've seen taken this very intelligent angle, is the press basically is blaming itself for rioting by not covering the things that people actually care about.

341
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:14,578
Speaker 0: Right?

342
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,790
Speaker 0: The press is actually causing the people to be angry.

343
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,370
Speaker 0: I mean, they already don't have bread in circuses, but even when they didn't have bread in circuses they still didn't riot.

344
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,222
Speaker 0: It's because their peaceful means didn't work.

345
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:37,489
Speaker 0: If the media is only going to pay attention to sensationalist things, that is encouraging attention-seeking people in society to do sensationalist things.

346
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:45,330
Speaker 0: If the media would pay attention and give screen time to things that were less sensational- Ah, ah, ah, ah, but here's the rub.

347
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,090
Speaker 1: Their ratings may go down, but- Not only would their ratings go down, Scott, but I don't think anyone would watch anymore.

348
00:16:50,550 --> 00:17:04,150
Speaker 0: Possibly, you are correct, but at the same time if they paid attention to non-sensationalist, non-violent, non-crazy things, it would actually cause society to become less sensational.

349
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,756
Speaker 0: Like, if you didn't pay attention- It's like the same thing with the policy we have with a guy running on the field at a baseball game.

350
00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:11,848
Speaker 0: You don't get on TV.

351
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,221
Speaker 0: All the TV cameras cut away when you run on the baseball field.

352
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:17,401
Speaker 0: I know the soccer field, they do something different.

353
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,583
Speaker 0: They let the naked guy on TV, maybe, I don't know.

354
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:20,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

355
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,059
Speaker 1: You gotta make something happen or no one's gonna watch soccer.

356
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:35,867
Speaker 0: But in the United States, if you run on the field of a professional, nationally, or even just state locally televised professional, or even like college sporting event- You're lucky if a single frame of you even approaching appears on live TV.

357
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,310
Speaker 0: You will not be on television, period.

358
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:42,110
Speaker 0: The cameras will cut away, nobody will see you except the people at the stadium.

359
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,764
Speaker 1: Now granted, they're going apeshit.

360
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:48,613
Speaker 0: But the people at the stadium will also be pissed that you're basically just delaying the game and being a jerk.

361
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:49,643
Speaker 1: I've never seen that.

362
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,765
Speaker 0: Every time I've seen this happen at a game- I've only seen people cheer if the guy gets away.

363
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,199
Speaker 0: One time, a guy ran across the field, jumped up into the outfield, and got out.

364
00:17:57,502 --> 00:17:58,108
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

365
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,724
Speaker 0: That they cheer for, right?

366
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:04,552
Speaker 0: But if you just run on the field and get tackled like a doofus, people aren't that pleased with you.

367
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:09,563
Speaker 0: I think we need that same policy, basically for any morons.

368
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:13,849
Speaker 0: You can say dude ran on the field, but you can't show the dude who ran on the field, right?

369
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:19,967
Speaker 0: And it's like, it's kind of tough though with rioting, because it's like we need to see the rioting, right?

370
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,189
Speaker 0: But, by showing the rioting, you're causing riots.

371
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,069
Speaker 1: But, like you just said, if we don't show the rioting, they'll riot again.

372
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:29,336
Speaker 0: Well, no.

373
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:33,727
Speaker 0: If we would have showed the non-rioting in the first place, they wouldn't have rioted.

374
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,690
Speaker 1: But, non-rioting, not difficult.

375
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,429
Speaker 1: How many non-riots are there in a given day?

376
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean 2,000 people doing a peaceful protest I think is worthy of news.

377
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:47,525
Speaker 1: It's got 2,000 people in a major city is nothing.

378
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,590
Speaker 1: More people are like taking the elevator up to my part of my building.

379
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:58,495
Speaker 0: Right, but I'm saying is that a 2,000, while not that big, you know, in the old grand scheme, is a pretty significant protest.

380
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:05,849
Speaker 0: Most days, I mean, I saw an NBC union protest this morning at Bike Pass outside 30 Rock and it was like 10 union guys.

381
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,649
Speaker 0: That doesn't need to be on the fucking news.

382
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,900
Speaker 1: Here's the other question.

383
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,840
Speaker 0: 2,000 people I think could get a news clip.

384
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:11,789
Speaker 1: Riddle me this.

385
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:14,766
Speaker 1: What were those 2,000 people marching for?

386
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:17,850
Speaker 0: Uh, it doesn't say in the article.

387
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,260
Speaker 1: Huh, huh.

388
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,424
Speaker 1: What were the rioters rioting for?

389
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,109
Speaker 0: They're pissed off because they're poor.

390
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,050
Speaker 1: Alright, so we know they're pissed off because they're poor.

391
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,999
Speaker 1: There's no jobs.

392
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:27,910
Speaker 1: There's no jobs.

393
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,329
Speaker 0: And the police are abusing them.

394
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:38,670
Speaker 1: So, what sort of non-violent protest in a modern democracy could possibly make more jobs appear?

395
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,390
Speaker 0: All the people, see the thing is, people don't really, you know, they're like children.

396
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,090
Speaker 0: Everyone's like children, right?

397
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:45,462
Speaker 0: Right?

398
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:55,611
Speaker 0: People really, all people, even if you don't actually solve their problem, if you just make them believe, like really believe you're helping them and working on it, right?

399
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,855
Speaker 0: It's like when you go to the bullshit randy doctor, right?

400
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:01,690
Speaker 0: They might be giving you some fake medicine, homeopathy, that doesn't actually cure your disease.

401
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:06,784
Speaker 0: But you like them better than the real doctor, because the real doctor is like here's some medicine, get the fuck out.

402
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:07,693
Speaker 0: You know, I'm reading this book.

403
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:14,137
Speaker 0: Even though the medicine works, but if you go to the fake doctor, the fake doctor won't help you cure your disease, you're gonna still go home and die.

404
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,792
Speaker 1: I'm reading a book right now set in kind of a pseudo-bizantium, right?

405
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:19,190
Speaker 1: And the emperor just died.

406
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,390
Speaker 0: But they make you believe they're helping you and they care.

407
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:28,077
Speaker 1: So the senate is, you know, the fake senate that doesn't do anything, is convening to nominally decide who the next emperor will be.

408
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:29,895
Speaker 0: But they already know who the emperor is gonna be.

409
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:30,703
Speaker 1: Well, they don't yet.

410
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,137
Speaker 1: They're sure someone will tell them.

411
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:38,323
Speaker 1: But a mob forms and bursts into the senate chamber, like just riotous mob ready to go.

412
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:38,709
Speaker 1: Alright.

413
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:48,609
Speaker 1: So the mob stops for a second because the chamber is so grandiose, and a senator stands up and says, "Yes, people of the city, we are going to choose your next emperor.

414
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,849
Speaker 1: We need your help.

415
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,101
Speaker 1: Tell us the people you think are worthy of being the next

416
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:55,525
Speaker 1: emperor.".

417
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,737
Speaker 1: And the whole mob kind of diffuses into people shouting names.

418
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:00,515
Speaker 1: They write them all down dutifully.

419
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,586
Speaker 1: Everyone's happy.

420
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,132
Speaker 1: They all go home.

421
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:02,960
Speaker 1: They throw all the names away.

422
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:03,970
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

423
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:09,709
Speaker 1: I don't think Egypt would even have happened had they just let the protest happen and fizzle out.

424
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,830
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's just act like you're paying, you know, act like you care.

425
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,910
Speaker 0: Like, you know, be like, "Oh, you're protesting.

426
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,593
Speaker 0: Alright.".

427
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:21,527
Speaker 0: You know, and the thing is they put on like, you know, the obviously fake propaganda bullshit.

428
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,081
Speaker 0: It's like, "No, actually, just take the people in.

429
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:24,151
Speaker 0: Talk to them

430
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:24,737
Speaker 0: seriously.".

431
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:28,274
Speaker 0: You know, don't be like just, "Oh, we're just talking to you for show.

432
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,244
Speaker 0: I'm just going to let you sit

433
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:29,506
Speaker 0: there.".

434
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:30,577
Speaker 0: But you don't actually do anything.

435
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:31,809
Speaker 0: Just actually talk to the person.

436
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:36,170
Speaker 0: Actually make it seem like you're actually caring and considering them.

437
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:44,520
Speaker 1: So Scott, you're asking politicians and city officials to act like politicians and city officials as they were intended to be.

438
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:44,969
Speaker 0: Yes.

439
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:48,050
Speaker 1: I don't think that's possible.

440
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:48,836
Speaker 0: Why can't they?

441
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:49,444
Speaker 0: I'm not asking.

442
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:54,291
Speaker 0: I'm not even asking for what I really should be asking for, which is actually do that, right?

443
00:21:54,332 --> 00:21:55,725
Speaker 0: But to just act like it.

444
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 0: They can't even act?

445
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:57,809
Speaker 0: Really?

446
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,710
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, an acting job could quell the riot.

447
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,062
Speaker 0: You know, actually not acting and doing it sincerely would be even better.

448
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,737
Speaker 0: I would much rather have that.

449
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:09,370
Speaker 0: But you're telling me you can't even act and pretend?

450
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,323
Speaker 0: Have faux sincerity?

451
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:12,252
Speaker 1: So you want to know why?

452
00:22:12,273 --> 00:22:16,839
Speaker 1: The spark of the protest was a young man who was shot by the police.

453
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,990
Speaker 1: One of those whole things.

454
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:34,534
Speaker 1: But the media, the Fox News equivalents over there and a lot of the rightish leaning media are talking about it this way are selling the whole riot thing as being caused by urban youths rioting about some gang banger who got shot.

455
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:41,019
Speaker 0: Well, that's why the police, right, were always, you know, so you know, being so brutal and inappropriate.

456
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,899
Speaker 0: I mean, the UK has a long history of that anyway, especially against youths, right?

457
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:52,049
Speaker 0: The police versus youths is like the biggest, you know, like, I think social conflict they have over there, at least judging by the media that gets over to us.

458
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:58,638
Speaker 0: You know, it's pretty much police versus youths and poor people in the UK is the wrong.

459
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,110
Speaker 0: I'm like hot fuzz.

460
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:02,672
Speaker 0: It's like that whole town is like the hoodies, right?

461
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:09,169
Speaker 0: It's, you know, it's symbolizing that, you know, UK wide, you know, authority versus youth battle.

462
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:19,543
Speaker 1: Except really, it's just like the whole thing is just feeding into whatever narrative is politically expedient and sensationalism just happens to be a big part of that sensationalism.

463
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:23,563
Speaker 1: and then fear of whatever is being sensationalized followed by a paternal.

464
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:28,594
Speaker 1: We will stop that from happening when in fact they're the ones who actually indirectly caused it.

465
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,527
Speaker 0: You made it happen, yes.

466
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:30,812
Speaker 0: Ah.

467
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,174
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

468
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,385
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, an African Grey, my mom still has this African Grey.

469
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,020
Speaker 0: That's a parrot for those of you who don't know.

470
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,646
Speaker 1: They are.

471
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,013
Speaker 0: I only know because talked about this a whole bunch.

472
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,649
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have known are probably the smartest of the birds.

473
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:54,367
Speaker 1: And they're generally there.

474
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:54,690
Speaker 1: I don't know.

475
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,960
Speaker 0: I thought like most parents, you imagine like the green parrot, right?

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,605
Speaker 0: It wouldn't.

477
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,780
Speaker 1: That's that's on Amazon.

478
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,973
Speaker 1: They're actually kind of derpy compared to other parents.

479
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:04,387
Speaker 0: But the African Grey is grey.

480
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:07,540
Speaker 0: The grey parrot is smarter than the stereotypical green one.

481
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,113
Speaker 1: The grey parrot is the smartest.

482
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:09,335
Speaker 1: They.

483
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:22,059
Speaker 1: I've read real people who know about these things saying that above average intelligence, African Grey can achieve the same level of self awareness and communication as a two to three year old human child.

484
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:22,968
Speaker 0: Oh, two to three.

485
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,647
Speaker 0: OK, so we can't learn the alphabet.

486
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,566
Speaker 1: They kind of can't read.

487
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:27,557
Speaker 1: They can't read.

488
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,970
Speaker 0: No, but like a kindergartner who's five can learn the alphabet.

489
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:34,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like they can learn words and use them contextually.

490
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,203
Speaker 0: But if you made it like watch Sesame Street, would that help?

491
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,154
Speaker 1: Maybe.

492
00:24:37,397 --> 00:24:37,640
Speaker 0: Maybe.

493
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:39,817
Speaker 0: Like you can't give it books.

494
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,606
Speaker 1: She learned all the different kinds of food she liked and had names for all of them.

495
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:49,759
Speaker 1: Some of them were the names we gave them, but things we had not named for her, she made up her own names.

496
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,840
Speaker 0: So how did you know, though, that's what she was talking about?

497
00:24:52,405 --> 00:24:53,114
Speaker 1: It was pretty apparent.

498
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:57,299
Speaker 1: For example, one day she started asking, she started saying cookie nut.

499
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,846
Speaker 1: Cookie nut.

500
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,971
Speaker 1: Because we'd given her cookies and nuts before, and she started saying cookie nut, cookie nut, cookie nut.

501
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:08,760
Speaker 1: We eventually figured out that what she wanted was one particular nut, the almond.

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,100
Speaker 1: So when she'd ask for it, and if we gave her something else, she'd throw it to the ground and go, uh oh.

503
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,179
Speaker 0: I threw it on the ground.

504
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,539
Speaker 0: You can't trust the system.

505
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,917
Speaker 1: Anyway, parrots are really smart, and this is a parrot who really does not want to be pooped on.

506
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:42,506
Speaker 1: This is obviously one of those cases where the people who own this parrot are constantly yelling at it for pooping on things, so it is decided to say those things back because that is obviously what people say most of the time.

507
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:44,625
Speaker 1: Like, he thinks, "Don't poop on

508
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:44,828
Speaker 1: that.".

509
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:45,212
Speaker 1: It's like,

510
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:45,858
Speaker 1: "Hello!".

511
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:47,552
Speaker 0: Okay.

512
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:55,334
Speaker 0: I don't want to get a parrot because they're expensive or take care of it because it's a pain in the ass, and it might fly around the apartment and cause mayhem.

513
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,620
Speaker 1: But a talking animal, you want to teach it to say funny shit?

514
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:03,540
Speaker 0: I just want to see what happens if you have a parrot from when it's a little... Can you get one that's in an egg and it hatches?

515
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,479
Speaker 1: You want to start a little past that.

516
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,239
Speaker 0: Well, who takes care of it first?

517
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:09,139
Speaker 1: Uh, the mom.

518
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,159
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

519
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,722
Speaker 0: Anyway.

520
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:12,288
Speaker 1: I mean, it depends.

521
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,532
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into the breeding of parrots.

522
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,558
Speaker 0: The point is I wanted to watch Sesame Street and see what it says.

523
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,753
Speaker 0: If it grows up on Sesame Street, specifically.

524
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:21,763
Speaker 1: Scott, Google around for it.

525
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:22,753
Speaker 1: Forget the parrot's name now.

526
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:23,500
Speaker 0: Sesame Street parrot?

527
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:32,491
Speaker 1: There's one particular African gray parrot who was exceptionally intelligent, and there are tons of videos of this parrot being surprisingly coherent and chill.

528
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,389
Speaker 0: No, but see, I don't want to see the smartest parrot.

529
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,357
Speaker 0: I want to see specifically the Sesame Street parrot.

530
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:37,981
Speaker 0: Right?

531
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,285
Speaker 0: That is pretty much lived with the Cookie Monster.

532
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:42,853
Speaker 1: Well, we know Sesame Street is not suitable for children, so...

533
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:43,399
Speaker 0: I know.

534
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:44,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's the thing.

535
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:45,094
Speaker 0: Maybe get two.

536
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,580
Speaker 0: One new Sesame Street, one old Sesame Street.

537
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:48,970
Speaker 1: One, uh... And Mr.

538
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,719
Speaker 0: Rogers is the control group.

539
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:53,780
Speaker 0: See what happens.

540
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,533
Speaker 1: Alright.

541
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:56,477
Speaker 0: Oh, thing of the day, right?

542
00:26:56,497 --> 00:26:56,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

543
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:00,549
Speaker 0: So you remember, uh, was it PAX East?

544
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,893
Speaker 0: I think it was the last PAX West a year ago.

545
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,763
Speaker 0: I'm not 100% sure.

546
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:06,365
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was PAX West.

547
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:13,560
Speaker 0: Um... Gabe and, you know, Mike and Jerry and also Scott Kurz announced a new comic.

548
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:17,965
Speaker 0: As in, they're gonna keep doing Penny Arcade and something else.

549
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:18,737
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:23,520
Speaker 0: And that was called The Trenches, and basically, it's about game testing.

551
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:30,205
Speaker 0: And the difference between this and Penny Arcade is that, number one, there's a third person working on it, so it's two artists and, you know, three writers.

552
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:35,960
Speaker 0: Um... And also, it's gonna be sequential, as in, there's a story.

553
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Speaker 0: It's not topical, where, you know, so you get to read it from the beginning, like other webcomics.

554
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,030
Speaker 0: It's a serial story.

555
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:42,285
Speaker 0: It's called The Trenches.

556
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,520
Speaker 0: It's about game testing.

557
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:45,920
Speaker 0: And they stop shit talking.

558
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:50,751
Speaker 0: It's every Tuesday and Thursday, and it's Thursday today, so the second comic strip is up today.

559
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,379
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

560
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,346
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

561
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,960
Speaker 0: I added it to my webcomics queue.

562
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,946
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

563
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,179
Speaker 0: Uh, how could you not?

564
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,566
Speaker 1: It's rare that I add a new webcomic to the queue.

565
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,648
Speaker 0: But now, think about, you know, Mike and Jerry are making five comics a week, though.

566
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:04,102
Speaker 0: I guess that's good.

567
00:28:04,122 --> 00:28:06,022
Speaker 0: They're earning their... Right?

568
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:07,340
Speaker 0: 'Cause they're basically working three days.

569
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:15,257
Speaker 1: Granted, a sequential comic that has a story, like, you can chart it out, I feel like it's easier to keep the momentum going than every other day.

570
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:19,680
Speaker 1: Alright, we need one joke that will carry an entire day's comic.

571
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right?

572
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,400
Speaker 0: So, you think about it.

573
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,280
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the South Park syndrome.

574
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,469
Speaker 0: What are we gonna do this episode?

575
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:28,953
Speaker 0: Ahh... But if you do a two-parter, well, now you knock two out of the park.

576
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:35,319
Speaker 0: Well, if you do an infinite-parter that just keeps going, you just look at the previous comic and you know what the next one's gonna be.

577
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,860
Speaker 1: What has the bonds not yet jumped over?

578
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you just, you know, as long as you've mapped out a significant portion of it, you don't have to map it out to the end.

579
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:46,305
Speaker 0: You know, you can just keep going and keep going and keep going.

580
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:54,991
Speaker 0: You know, not saying it's easy, but what you get is you don't have that problem that we have with Geek Nights, which is, what do we do the show on today?

581
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:55,435
Speaker 0: Right?

582
00:28:55,455 --> 00:29:00,159
Speaker 0: Your problems are all the specifics of, you know, what exact, what's the exact wording gonna be.

583
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,929
Speaker 0: and then, you know, that stuff, as opposed to, you know, the general, you need a general idea, you know, a blank slate every fucking day.

584
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:07,840
Speaker 0: It's a huge pain in the ass.

585
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:16,545
Speaker 1: Of course, at the same time, with Penny Arcade, they just have to go to, you know, whatever gaming blog they happen to look at and see, you know, what just got talked about.

586
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:21,655
Speaker 0: Listen to those fourth panels, the old podcast and the PATV where they make comics.

587
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:23,575
Speaker 0: They have the same problems that we have in South Park.

588
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,827
Speaker 1: Everyone has those problems.

589
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:27,251
Speaker 0: They got crab peoples, they got everything.

590
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:28,786
Speaker 1: Yep, and you know what everyone needs?

591
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:30,036
Speaker 1: Writers retreats.

592
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,539
Speaker 0: South Park didn't have one, this.

593
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:34,808
Speaker 0: I know.

594
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:39,151
Speaker 1: So, briefly, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is The Ear, The Eye, The Arm.

595
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:40,140
Speaker 1: It is my book.

596
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,189
Speaker 1: The previous Book Club book, Isaac Asimov's Foundation.

597
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,280
Speaker 0: Where's that episode, Raymond?

598
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,032
Speaker 1: It'll be up tonight.

599
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,930
Speaker 1: Yesterday, you were here.

600
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:47,740
Speaker 1: What was I doing?

601
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,351
Speaker 1: Playing games with you.

602
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,238
Speaker 0: I told you to put it up.

603
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:50,944
Speaker 1: Yeah.

604
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:51,430
Speaker 1: And you didn't.

605
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:53,009
Speaker 1: And everyone left late.

606
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,778
Speaker 0: You said you did.

607
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:55,129
Speaker 1: You said you would.

608
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:56,989
Speaker 1: I said I would put it up at some point.

609
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:57,718
Speaker 1: And you didn't.

610
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:00,038
Speaker 1: I didn't say when I'd put it up.

611
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:00,180
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

612
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,148
Speaker 0: Well, you didn't yet.

613
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,846
Speaker 1: I know, but I did not say when.

614
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,060
Speaker 1: I'll probably put it up tonight.

615
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:04,663
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

616
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,967
Speaker 1: There's no reason why I shouldn't put it up tonight.

617
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:07,492
Speaker 0: Nah.

618
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:09,579
Speaker 1: We'll have to record the other one.

619
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,979
Speaker 1: So, I ordered The Ear, The Eye, The Arm a while ago.

620
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,997
Speaker 1: Still hasn't shipped from Amazon.

621
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:14,502
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up.

622
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,167
Speaker 0: I ordered it from Amazon.

623
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:15,490
Speaker 0: It shipped.

624
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,297
Speaker 1: Mine didn't.

625
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:17,389
Speaker 1: Good job.

626
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,858
Speaker 1: The fuck?

627
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,543
Speaker 0: It probably might be there when I get home today.

628
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:23,574
Speaker 1: We will be at the Penny Arcade Expo on Saturday at noon.

629
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:28,765
Speaker 1: We will be doing Discover the Forgotten Masters on Saturday from 6pm to, I believe, 8pm.

630
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:36,058
Speaker 1: We will be in the tabletop workshop area teaching people how to play Seven Wonders, Carcassonne, Spotted, and Inspectors.

631
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,067
Speaker 0: When's our panel?

632
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,250
Speaker 1: Noon on Saturday, like I just said.

633
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:42,140
Speaker 0: So everything is Saturday.

634
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,542
Speaker 0: Yes.

635
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:46,886
Speaker 0: Alright, so I declare Friday to be Day of Gaming.

636
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:51,046
Speaker 0: After that keynote and Q&A, non-stop gaming.

637
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,110
Speaker 1: On Friday, I'm going to pause the gaming to eat dinner at Von's.

638
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,860
Speaker 0: Well, obviously.

639
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,654
Speaker 1: And I'm also going to, I might go to the concert.

640
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:03,233
Speaker 1: Because one main event is in the fucking Paramount.

641
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:03,680
Speaker 1: Eh.

642
00:31:04,684 --> 00:31:05,896
Speaker 0: I've had enough of Pac's concerts.

643
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:06,279
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

644
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:09,129
Speaker 1: I've seen many of the Saturday concerts.

645
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:12,280
Speaker 1: I have skipped more of the Friday concerts.

646
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,279
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go to the Friday concert.

647
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,259
Speaker 0: What Friday concert do you want to see?

648
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:17,268
Speaker 0: I don't know.

649
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,533
Speaker 0: The only new group is Super Commuter.

650
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,210
Speaker 0: And actually, Super Commuter is pretty good.

651
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,169
Speaker 0: It's hip-hop over 8-bit backbeats.

652
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 0: I went to their website.

653
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,736
Speaker 0: I dig what they were doing.

654
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:29,840
Speaker 0: But, I don't really need to skip hours of awesome gaming.

655
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,250
Speaker 1: You seem to think that I'm going to go to the entire concert from the beginning.

656
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:42,140
Speaker 1: I'm going to do what we did at our first Pac's, which was walk into the concert a little late, and leave the concert when I've gotten my fill.

657
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:47,130
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get my fill at the from Friday.

658
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,271
Speaker 1: Well, the JoCo Mini Cruise.

659
00:31:49,412 --> 00:32:01,126
Speaker 1: So, if you want to hang out with me and Scott, in a place on a boat in New York next Friday, if tickets aren't sold out, we will be there.

660
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:01,591
Speaker 1: You know what?

661
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:05,049
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do on that boat, but listen to JoCo and hang out.

662
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:05,959
Speaker 0: Hang out on a boat.

663
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,655
Speaker 1: Play some Spotted on that boat.

664
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:08,767
Speaker 0: Fucking mermaid.

665
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:09,899
Speaker 1: Shit on Debra's desk.

666
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,818
Speaker 0: No, wrong song.

667
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:14,894
Speaker 0: Uh, what else?

668
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,924
Speaker 0: That's it.

669
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:18,070
Speaker 0: No, this board game night is this Friday.

670
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:18,514
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

671
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:26,916
Speaker 1: Tomorrow we will be at Think Coffee on Mercer Street for NerdNYC board gaming, which has had a surprising number of Geek Nights listeners showing up.

672
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,700
Speaker 0: It's getting a much bigger turnout over time.

673
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Speaker 1: It's getting to the point to where I almost feel like we need to get all the Geek Nights people and have a separate gaming night that's offset from the NerdNYC.

674
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, I just want to remind you that...

675
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,392
Speaker 1: I had a sunflower received, like, in my throat.

676
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:40,614
Speaker 1: Good.

677
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:54,050
Speaker 0: We are all over the internets on the Facebooks and Twitters and our official website and our forum and everything, so you should come and participate with us on the internets and every place that we are on the internets, because the internets work like that.

678
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:56,311
Speaker 0: And if you like us, you should like us on the internets.

679
00:32:56,776 --> 00:33:02,639
Speaker 1: And one last thing, we have put up two of our Penny Arcade Expo East 2011 panels on YouTube.

680
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:05,039
Speaker 1: You should probably watch them.

681
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:10,757
Speaker 1: You'll notice I put up that Enforcer shoutout where we talked about how great the Enforcers were.

682
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,920
Speaker 1: Notice how if you watch Game Mechanics and Mechanism Design, it starts this video with riotous applause.

683
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,979
Speaker 1: And then we introduce ourselves.

684
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,246
Speaker 1: It cheated.

685
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:29,439
Speaker 1: Those riotous applause were, in fact, for the Enforcer shoutout a moment before and not, in fact, for us coming up on stage.

686
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,220
Speaker 1: You see what I did there?

687
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,220
Speaker 0: But you pulled a Scott move in admitting what you did there.

688
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:42,539
Speaker 0: The rim move would usually be to let the secret technique and deception lie as it stands.

689
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,776
Speaker 0: It's the Scott technique to expose the deception.

690
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,520
Speaker 1: Here is a question.

691
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,840
Speaker 1: How is it deception to show the unedited fact of a situation?

692
00:33:56,268 --> 00:34:06,700
Speaker 1: There's video, which includes 20 minutes of us just setting stuff up on stage and ends with 10 minutes of us taking questions and cleaning up the room and everything.

693
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:10,639
Speaker 1: And I just picked an arbitrary point of that and showed it uninterrupted.

694
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,002
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

695
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:13,080
Speaker 0: See, that's the rim move.

696
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,132
Speaker 1: Where's the deception?

697
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:14,719
Speaker 1: Where's the lie?

698
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,031
Speaker 0: That's the rim move right there.

699
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,908
Speaker 1: How have I deceived by showing truth?

700
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,458
Speaker 0: You have obviously not turned into Scott.

701
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:22,839
Speaker 0: And you have just proved it.

702
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:31,867
Speaker 0: So, you know, I follow a lot of people on Twitters and occasionally, you know, people say things and you see them and you go, "Oh, I should check that

703
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:32,130
Speaker 0: out.".

704
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,139
Speaker 0: You forget to check that out.

705
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:41,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, I made a thing that will, it scrapes my Twitter, the things coming at me that I'm subscribed to, for links and puts them in a feed that I can then consume.

706
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:42,089
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:44,572
Speaker 1: And I even then forget to check on things.

708
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:49,100
Speaker 0: But sometimes, someone will re-mention something enough times that you won't forget it.

709
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,029
Speaker 0: It'll stick in your brain.

710
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,969
Speaker 0: Hey, marketers, that's the secret repetition.

711
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,192
Speaker 0: Head on.

712
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,540
Speaker 1: Apply directly to the forehead.

713
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,484
Speaker 0: Gavo.

714
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:55,971
Speaker 0: Gavo.

715
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:56,498
Speaker 0: Gavo.

716
00:34:57,523 --> 00:35:08,840
Speaker 0: So, one thing that I kept seeing come up over and over again and mentioned by many different people I follow on Twitter such as Neil Gaiman and Penn Gillette and Teller, who was involved in this thing, was Playdead.

717
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,068
Speaker 0: And it just so happened.

718
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:17,463
Speaker 0: Playdead was an off-Broadway production made by Teller and also Todd Robbins and a bunch of other people.

719
00:35:18,393 --> 00:35:19,887
Speaker 0: that was in New York City.

720
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:22,754
Speaker 0: So, it was like, "Hey, that sounds like a good thing to

721
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:22,915
Speaker 0: me.".

722
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,645
Speaker 0: And, you know, people who went to see it would tweet and be like, "Oh, man, that was so

723
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:28,089
Speaker 0: awesome.".

724
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:29,909
Speaker 0: And so I'm like, "I'm going to check this thing

725
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:30,091
Speaker 0: out.".

726
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:38,679
Speaker 0: So, you know, I told my mom about it and told a whole bunch of other people and then, you know, my mom was like, she wanted to see it because that's her kind of thing, you know.

727
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:42,252
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything about it other than it was an off-Broadway show.

728
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:48,780
Speaker 0: Teller was involved and it was called Playdead and the logo had like a skull on it.

729
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:49,464
Speaker 0: I was like,

730
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:49,727
Speaker 0: "Ooh.".

731
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:56,676
Speaker 1: Well, notice, now that I look at it, it's a skull coming out of the smoke of a broken light bulb, which is very important to the show.

732
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:57,019
Speaker 1: It is.

733
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,844
Speaker 0: I think that's actually a more recent logo.

734
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:00,330
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

735
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:00,715
Speaker 0: I don't know.

736
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:06,068
Speaker 0: Regardless, I went with my family to see it because my mom really wanted to see it and she says, "Hey, are we going to go see that

737
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:06,311
Speaker 0: thing?".

738
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:09,360
Speaker 0: And it actually got extended a whole bunch, so we were able to go see it.

739
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:10,591
Speaker 0: You know, it wasn't sold out.

740
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,743
Speaker 0: It was in a very tiny theater.

741
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:14,959
Speaker 0: You just walk up, buy some tickets, walk right in, sit wherever you like.

742
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,159
Speaker 0: You know, it's all good.

743
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,815
Speaker 0: And I saw it and I was very surprised.

744
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:24,086
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I expected it to be good, but it was actually quite excellent.

745
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:25,863
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it very much.

746
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,600
Speaker 1: Yep, it wasn't the greatest thing ever.

747
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,207
Speaker 0: No, I mean, Book of Mormon is the greatest thing ever.

748
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:30,914
Speaker 0: Stage shows.

749
00:36:30,995 --> 00:36:33,258
Speaker 1: I've seen, I mean, I've seen a lot of stage shows.

750
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,248
Speaker 1: I can tell by the pixels.

751
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,835
Speaker 1: Yeah.

752
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:36,651
Speaker 1: So, Scott was like, "Hey, it was pretty good.

753
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:37,076
Speaker 1: You should see

754
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:37,157
Speaker 1: it.".

755
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:38,289
Speaker 1: My mom liked it, too.

756
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:39,825
Speaker 1: So, I forgot.

757
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:44,995
Speaker 1: And then one day, I look and it's going to end, like the run's going to end, like, that weekend.

758
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:45,621
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

759
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,571
Speaker 1: "Alright!".

760
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:48,855
Speaker 1: And I bought tickets that morning and Emily and I went to see it.

761
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:49,118
Speaker 1: Yep.

762
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:51,014
Speaker 1: And it was pretty good.

763
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, Book of Mormon is the greatest show there is.

764
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:57,600
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, but this is still, it's like totally worth seeing.

765
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,307
Speaker 1: I think the main reason I liked it is something very specific in the beginning.

766
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:05,985
Speaker 1: That, you know, we sit in and there's this warning that the lights will go out completely.

767
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:07,136
Speaker 1: Like, "It's got to be dark.

768
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:09,036
Speaker 1: If you can't handle that shit, well, don't come in

769
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:09,197
Speaker 1: here.".

770
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,280
Speaker 1: And, you know, the lights go dark right away during the play.

771
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,318
Speaker 1: And the exit signs are still on.

772
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,723
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Ah, it's always like

773
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:18,046
Speaker 1: that.".

774
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:19,803
Speaker 1: And I know everyone was thinking that.

775
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:24,388
Speaker 0: And then the guy on stage is like... Well, I mean, you're in a basically, a completely pitch-back room except for exit signs.

776
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaker 0: It's the only thing there is to look at.

777
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,904
Speaker 0: Of course, everyone is looking at it, right?

778
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:30,816
Speaker 0: That is the magic the teller brought to this show, right?

779
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:34,611
Speaker 0: Is that magician's knowledge of knowing where you're going to look at all times.

780
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,923
Speaker 0: What you're going to pay attention to.

781
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:37,134
Speaker 0: All that kind of stuff.

782
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,651
Speaker 1: And then when the guy's like, "Oh, hold on a

783
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:38,873
Speaker 1: minute."

784
00:37:38,893 --> 00:37:40,672
Speaker 1: And then he turns off the exit signs.

785
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,943
Speaker 1: That's when I knew I was, I did not expect that.

786
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did not expect that either.

787
00:37:45,257 --> 00:37:48,635
Speaker 0: But the fact that the exit signs actually turned off and stayed off, I was like, "Fuck

788
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:48,898
Speaker 0: yeah.".

789
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:55,845
Speaker 0: But basically, you know, in short, Play Dead is a haunted house where you, well, a haunted show.

790
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:56,713
Speaker 0: One man show.

791
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,945
Speaker 0: Mostly one man.

792
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,117
Speaker 0: And it actually sort of works on adults.

793
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:08,187
Speaker 0: It's like even though you know, right, that they're not actually ghosts coming through and possessing or whatever the fuck they're going to do.

794
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:09,360
Speaker 0: Or people getting killed.

795
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,020
Speaker 0: You know, all the blood is fake.

796
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:12,592
Speaker 0: You know all that.

797
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:16,632
Speaker 0: And it usually, when you go to a cheesy haunted house it's like, "Frankenstein's Haunted

798
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:17,340
Speaker 0: Mansion.".

799
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,106
Speaker 0: It's like, "Okay guys, seriously lol.

800
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:22,086
Speaker 0: Put your hands in the bowl of

801
00:38:22,106 --> 00:38:23,157
Speaker 0: spaghetti.".

802
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:23,761
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yeah,

803
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:24,064
Speaker 0: great.".

804
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:28,431
Speaker 0: But this is all, this is basically like, you know it's fake but it happens and you're like,

805
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:28,531
Speaker 0: "Woo.".

806
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,470
Speaker 0: And then you're like, "Oh, they just threw some rice at me.

807
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,500
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

808
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:34,766
Speaker 1: Woo.".

809
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:40,390
Speaker 0: Because it's, you know, it's constructed in such an awesome way that it totally works.

810
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:50,170
Speaker 1: It was cool that it was part like history lesson, part stage show, like straight up magic, part haunted house, and I really like the history part.

811
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,544
Speaker 1: Like I knew about Albert Fish.

812
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:56,519
Speaker 1: I think anyone who gets bored at work eventually hits Albert Fish's Wikipedia page.

813
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,659
Speaker 0: You've got to be really bored to end up there.

814
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:06,131
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy to get there because a lot of pages end up going to Serial Killer and from there it's a short step to Albert Fish.

815
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,253
Speaker 0: Wow, what are you reading on Wikipedia?

816
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:10,595
Speaker 1: Apparently Albert Fish and Serial Killers.

817
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:11,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess so.

818
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,988
Speaker 1: But, and then I knew about him, but I didn't know about all those mediums.

819
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:19,625
Speaker 1: I really like the sexy medium.

820
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:20,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

821
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:21,545
Speaker 1: That was kind of funny actually.

822
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:24,592
Speaker 0: But basically, so I don't want to spoil the show, right?

823
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:29,039
Speaker 1: Especially because as we just learned, it's getting a revival already, like a second run.

824
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,857
Speaker 0: Well, that's another thing I was going to say, right?

825
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,938
Speaker 0: So you might be like, "Why are you telling me about this show?

826
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:33,322
Speaker 0: I can't

827
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:33,666
Speaker 0: see.".

828
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:40,572
Speaker 0: Well, even though the show ended, if you go to the official website, it says there's not much information, but it says "Rising for Halloween.

829
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,552
Speaker 0: Performances start October 7th.

830
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,069
Speaker 0: Stay connected with Facebook and Twitter.

831
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:44,453
Speaker 0: Join our

832
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:44,917
Speaker 0: newsletter.".

833
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:51,540
Speaker 0: So it is very likely that this will appear again and you will be able to see it depending on your geographic location.

834
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,724
Speaker 1: It's also, it's got a healthy dose of sideshow because Todd Robbins, he eats a lightbulb on stage.

835
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:59,017
Speaker 0: He's really eating a lightbulb.

836
00:39:59,118 --> 00:39:59,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

837
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,887
Speaker 0: And it's funny, I guess That's his thing.

838
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:11,459
Speaker 1: I realize that because we listened to Penn Radio for so long, I think we know, like, it surprises me how much I know about the stagecraft of, like, sideshows and things.

839
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,865
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's, you know, that's what happens.

840
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:15,424
Speaker 1: But, I mean, the average person doesn't.

841
00:40:15,464 --> 00:40:18,476
Speaker 1: Like, the people in the audience walking around like, "No, here, check it

842
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:18,638
Speaker 1: out.".

843
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:20,374
Speaker 1: He's like handing people the broken glass.

844
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:21,646
Speaker 1: They can't figure it out.

845
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,838
Speaker 1: They're like, "Oh, it's got to be a trick.

846
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:23,161
Speaker 1: Ah, I

847
00:40:23,222 --> 00:40:23,464
Speaker 1: can't.".

848
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,059
Speaker 1: He's not just eating a lightbulb.

849
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,826
Speaker 1: Who would do that?

850
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,179
Speaker 0: He's eating a lightbulb.

851
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,199
Speaker 1: It's not that hard to eat a lightbulb.

852
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:30,331
Speaker 0: I wouldn't do it.

853
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,000
Speaker 0: I wouldn't do it either.

854
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,807
Speaker 0: But that guy can do it.

855
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:32,655
Speaker 0: It's doable.

856
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:33,544
Speaker 0: It is indeed.

857
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:42,412
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the structure of the show, I don't want to actually go into any specific things that might, you know, you know, ruin the show.

858
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:54,109
Speaker 0: Because it is, you know, I do often say when it comes to spoilers, like, look, if something depends only on the element of surprise, and thus it can be completely spoiled just by knowing information, how good is that thing really?

859
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,846
Speaker 1: But, I mean, a haunted house boo show.

860
00:40:56,028 --> 00:41:00,189
Speaker 0: But this isn't, this isn't a matter of spoiling in terms of surprise.

861
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,825
Speaker 0: Like, oh, the surprises won't work.

862
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:06,840
Speaker 0: This is a matter of, you know, behind the curtain, you know, Wizard of Oz situation.

863
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,820
Speaker 0: Which is a different sort of spoiler.

864
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,583
Speaker 1: Here's an example of something, I can spoil what happens, but yet it won't actually ruin the event.

865
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:20,817
Speaker 1: So when the lights are totally off in the beginning, he just starts talking about how in the darkness people can do whatever the fuck they want, and you don't know who did it.

866
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:26,372
Speaker 1: And, pretty much, he knew, and it's true, that this will always happen.

867
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:28,292
Speaker 1: People in the audience start fucking with each other.

868
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:29,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's intentional.

869
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, some stranger just, like, will be in the back of the head.

870
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:34,452
Speaker 0: It is completely pitch black.

871
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:35,967
Speaker 0: You can see nothing.

872
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,959
Speaker 0: It is black black, not a photon in the room.

873
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,330
Speaker 1: None more black.

874
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:47,460
Speaker 0: They make you turn off every light emitting device that you might bring with you, be it, you know, glowy wristwatch or cell phone.

875
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:52,735
Speaker 0: So there is nothing, you cannot see a thing without some sort of light source.

876
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:59,199
Speaker 1: But it's interesting how little prompting it takes to get people to basically just start fucking with strangers in the dark.

877
00:41:59,442 --> 00:42:02,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you're probably most likely to fuck with the people you know.

878
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:05,215
Speaker 1: No, it's the guy behind me just, like, grabbed my hair, like,

879
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:05,436
Speaker 1: "Woo!".

880
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:10,151
Speaker 0: He probably was looking at your hair the whole time and was like, "I gotta touch that

881
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:10,395
Speaker 0: hair.".

882
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,100
Speaker 1: It's such good stagecraft.

883
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:15,160
Speaker 1: I don't want to spoil the thing, but it's got the crow.

884
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:16,105
Speaker 0: Yeah.

885
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:16,632
Speaker 1: Yeah.

886
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,068
Speaker 1: Every time I looked at it, I'm like, "Wait a

887
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:18,311
Speaker 1: minute.".

888
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:24,979
Speaker 0: But basically, the structure of the show is you have this one guy, Todd Robbins, and he's sort of like your host for the evening.

889
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:31,400
Speaker 0: And he basically presents to you these dead people that he has in these boxes.

890
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:41,256
Speaker 0: And he tells a story about each dead person, and then the stories sort of unfold into things that happen.

891
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:41,337
Speaker 0: Yep.

892
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,569
Speaker 1: And some of them are like, "Oh, here's the history lesson about sideshows.

893
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:52,325
Speaker 1: Oh, I love how he does two different mediums, and how the one who is sexy is portrayed kind of like this funny, kind of cool

894
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:52,628
Speaker 1: thing."

895
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:58,273
Speaker 1: Like, you can see, like, obviously these were just a bunch of people in Boston looking for an excuse to have some sexy time.

896
00:42:58,435 --> 00:42:58,699
Speaker 0: Yep.

897
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,391
Speaker 1: And yet, the other medium...

898
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,805
Speaker 0: The fat, bitchy Italian one?

899
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:04,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, that he portrays as an evil bitch.

900
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:10,145
Speaker 1: As a horrible, evil bitch, even though she didn't murder anyone compared to Albert Fish, who murdered a whole bunch of people.

901
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:14,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would definitely say Albert Fish's worst, not to say that the fat Italian lady wasn't.

902
00:43:14,246 --> 00:43:17,320
Speaker 1: But notice how he doesn't call Albert Fish evil.

903
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:23,180
Speaker 1: He calls him lots of things and goes into the horrible things he did, but he reserves that word for the other lady.

904
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:23,665
Speaker 1: Yeah.

905
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,966
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's Albert Fish most likely wasn't, you know... He wasn't evil, he was crazy.

906
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:30,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wasn't consciously malicious, right?

907
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,967
Speaker 0: He wasn't on purpose hurting people.

908
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:35,765
Speaker 0: I mean, he was on purpose hurting people because he was nuts, like, he couldn't control it.

909
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:40,840
Speaker 0: Not because he was trying to actively scam people, you know, consciously.

910
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,331
Speaker 0: There's a difference, right?

911
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:43,300
Speaker 0: Anyway.

912
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:43,912
Speaker 0: Anyway.

913
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:46,840
Speaker 0: So, what else do you say about the show?

914
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,735
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it just kind of goes from there, and it's, like I said, it's not the greatest stage show.

915
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:52,459
Speaker 1: Don't buy the expensive tickets.

916
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,960
Speaker 0: Is there a difference between the expensive tickets?

917
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:56,555
Speaker 1: You sit closer.

918
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:56,979
Speaker 0: That's it.

919
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,008
Speaker 0: You don't need to sit closer.

920
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:01,320
Speaker 0: The place that it was in, at least before, I don't know if it'll be in a different place in the future.

921
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,419
Speaker 1: No, they do involve the audience.

922
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:03,768
Speaker 0: Quite a bit.

923
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,800
Speaker 0: My brother went on stage.

924
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:05,202
Speaker 1: Really?

925
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,213
Speaker 1: Which one was he?

926
00:44:06,234 --> 00:44:06,780
Speaker 0: The Ouija board.

927
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:08,491
Speaker 0: Not that exciting.

928
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:11,140
Speaker 1: The thing is, the Ouija board, I was like, okay, I see what's going on here.

929
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:14,779
Speaker 1: But then, the table, I wasn't really sure how they did it.

930
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:15,957
Speaker 0: I could tell you how they did it.

931
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:16,099
Speaker 0: No.

932
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,896
Speaker 1: I really liked the contrast.

933
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,519
Speaker 1: I think we talked about this when we mentioned the show briefly, where he acts like he's gonna murder the rat, and the audience flips out.

934
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,086
Speaker 1: And then he totally fucking murders the person, and no one cares.

935
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:28,672
Speaker 1: They're laughing.

936
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,127
Speaker 1: Like, haha, you killed that guy.

937
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:33,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's full of that dark humor kind of joke, right?

938
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:47,060
Speaker 0: It's that weird, it's like, humor plus horror at the same time, plus thrills and chills, and also, you know, illusion, all mixed into one, you know, thing together.

939
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:48,860
Speaker 1: There is also some sexy time.

940
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this, it's this combination of many things boiled into a pot.

941
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,554
Speaker 1: I love his presentation, too.

942
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:57,060
Speaker 1: Todd Robbins is just, he's great at that.

943
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, high skills.

944
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,375
Speaker 1: Well, cause he plays the very, like the white suited gentleman.

945
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:00,759
Speaker 0: Yep.

946
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,358
Speaker 0: And then, before he wipes blood all over it.

947
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, all over.

948
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,619
Speaker 0: It was good times.

949
00:45:08,145 --> 00:45:17,100
Speaker 1: In general, I don't know, any of you out there, listeners, who live in a city of any size, I mean, even Beacon had a pretty thriving theater community.

950
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:25,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, even if you're in some middle of nowhere, right, there's always gonna be some tiny community theater that puts something on.

951
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:27,866
Speaker 0: In fact, remember, we went up and saw... Even if it's just like a Shakespeare.

952
00:45:27,886 --> 00:45:31,220
Speaker 1: Our good friend Kate and the front row crew was in a play up in Albany, we went to see it.

953
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,865
Speaker 0: I didn't go see it.

954
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:33,180
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't, everyone else did.

955
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,460
Speaker 1: It was pretty damn great.

956
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:38,071
Speaker 0: We saw, like, RIT players at RIT.

957
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:40,353
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they did Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

958
00:45:40,393 --> 00:45:41,140
Speaker 0: They did a pretty good job.

959
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,229
Speaker 0: Yeah.

960
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,949
Speaker 0: My high school did pretty good plays.

961
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:44,799
Speaker 0: Mine did.

962
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,584
Speaker 0: What did they do?

963
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,603
Speaker 0: What's the one where you shuffle off to Buffalo?

964
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:48,270
Speaker 0: That's the one they did.

965
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:49,320
Speaker 0: I forget what that's called.

966
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,017
Speaker 0: With the boat.

967
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,251
Speaker 1: Shuffle off to Buffalo?

968
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:52,960
Speaker 1: That's the song.

969
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,660
Speaker 0: What the fuck is that?

970
00:45:55,944 --> 00:45:56,249
Speaker 0: 42nd Street?

971
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:56,980
Speaker 0: I think that's what it is.

972
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,119
Speaker 1: We did Chicago, but I didn't bother with it.

973
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:06,673
Speaker 1: And we did Damn Yankees, which was... I kind of like Damn Yankees as a kind of dopey, old style musical.

974
00:46:06,714 --> 00:46:08,575
Speaker 0: Yes, it's 42nd Street is the one we shuffle off to Buffalo.

975
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:09,787
Speaker 1: I've never seen 42nd Street.

976
00:46:09,928 --> 00:46:10,271
Speaker 0: It's okay.

977
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:11,846
Speaker 0: My high school did a pretty good job.

978
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:17,639
Speaker 0: It's basically like if the high school had upgraded, like two steps, it would have basically been a Broadway show that had a low budget.

979
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,020
Speaker 1: But go to local theaters.

980
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:22,250
Speaker 1: It's so cheap.

981
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:25,400
Speaker 1: It's like five bucks in some towns to see a live play.

982
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:25,945
Speaker 1: And you know what?

983
00:46:26,573 --> 00:46:30,170
Speaker 1: Even the crappiest live play, unless it's in middle school, is pretty good.

984
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:36,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean the people who do these things, the people who really care about it and really try, and it's very rare that it's going to be painfully bad.

985
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:43,541
Speaker 0: And the thing is, the fact that some of the worst shows you can see are usually like Spider-Man, right?

986
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:47,399
Speaker 0: It's a big, big production that just happens to suck, that someone invested a lot in.

987
00:46:47,921 --> 00:46:54,579
Speaker 0: You know, the local community is probably doing some tried and trusted play that you know is good.

988
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,168
Speaker 0: That's very old and in the public domain or something like that.

989
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,009
Speaker 1: Or especially things that are really good.

990
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:00,759
Speaker 1: Like a Shakespeare or something.

991
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,617
Speaker 1: But you probably haven't seen or read.

992
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,613
Speaker 1: Like, I went to see with Emily a few years ago.

993
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:05,723
Speaker 1: Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?

994
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,140
Speaker 1: Just in the city, off-Broadway.

995
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:08,700
Speaker 1: It was great.

996
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course it's great.

997
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it's a great play anyway.

998
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

999
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:17,380
Speaker 1: In general, I've always been a huge fan of one-room acts, like one-room plays.

1000
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,490
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, you can go see Glass Menagerie or Death of a Salesman.

1001
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,500
Speaker 0: I think Death of a Salesman has two rooms, because there's an outside the house.

1002
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, technically.

1003
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,593
Speaker 0: I don't know, but yeah, it's mostly one room.

1004
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:31,720
Speaker 1: The thing is, the way I've always seen it done, is the outside is in a set... Through the window?

1005
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,793
Speaker 1: Yes, through a screen.

1006
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:34,579
Speaker 0: I've seen through the window trick before.

1007
00:47:34,983 --> 00:47:45,469
Speaker 1: Noises Off is interesting, that it's a one-room play, but the movie shows you the front, you know, where the audience can see, but then it also shows you the back, where the audience can't see.

1008
00:47:45,934 --> 00:47:48,759
Speaker 1: But the play in the play, Yo Dawg, is a one room.

1009
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:54,719
Speaker 1: Oh man, Glass Menagerie, I'm suddenly like, I suddenly want to go see a play, like right now.

1010
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:56,400
Speaker 0: Go see the Book of Mormon.

1011
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:58,658
Speaker 1: I saw it.

1012
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:00,899
Speaker 0: I'd go see it again, if I could.

1013
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, there are tickets free in February.

1014
00:48:04,056 --> 00:48:04,239
Speaker 0: Free?

1015
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,832
Speaker 1: As in, you can buy them.

1016
00:48:05,852 --> 00:48:07,407
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you should do that.

1017
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:07,852
Speaker 1: I should.

1018
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:08,540
Speaker 0: Right now.

1019
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,266
Speaker 1: I probably will.

1020
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:12,315
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you're probably not going to see the original cast, though.

1021
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:13,062
Speaker 1: I don't care.

1022
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,052
Speaker 0: Who knows at this point?

1023
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:15,243
Speaker 1: I've learned in my life.

1024
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:18,400
Speaker 0: Actually, February's getting pretty close, and I'm pretty sure the original cast is still there.

1025
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,871
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like, Les Miserables had like a million different casts.

1026
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:27,932
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter for some plays, because if a play is that big, they're going to get people who are good enough to where you won't notice.

1027
00:48:27,993 --> 00:48:31,167
Speaker 0: I'm sure, I mean, they're already going to do Book of Mormon in London and all these other places.

1028
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:36,277
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, like springtime for Hitler, Matthew Broderick was off of that for a long time, and it was still super good.

1029
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:42,660
Speaker 0: Right, but the point is, like, you know, having seen the Book of Mormon, it's like I just couldn't imagine it with someone else, right?

1030
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,811
Speaker 0: Because I saw the original one.

1031
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:44,660
Speaker 1: Scott, I had that problem.

1032
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,287
Speaker 1: I saw Les Miserables with like the international touring cast, where they sounded like it was the CD.

1033
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,420
Speaker 1: Like, it was perfect.

1034
00:48:51,123 --> 00:49:07,610
Speaker 1: And then I saw it years later, you know, kind of like a revival thing, and it was a totally different cast, and the only time it stood out like that it was different, like where I was like, ah, was there was one song near the beginning where like the cadence was a little different, but otherwise it was great.

1035
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:07,933
Speaker 1: It was fine.

1036
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:11,406
Speaker 0: Actually, you're right, because I did, I heard the Les Mis CD before ever seeing it.

1037
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:12,980
Speaker 0: Actually, dual cassette tape.

1038
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,238
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, son.

1039
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:14,340
Speaker 0: Shit.

1040
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:17,612
Speaker 0: And I did go to see it on Broadway, right?

1041
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:30,359
Speaker 1: See, I saw the, because interestingly for shows like that, you sometimes get a better performance outside of New York just because the best cast does the world tour of like one weekend in every city.

1042
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,940
Speaker 0: Sometimes, sometimes not.

1043
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:39,529
Speaker 0: But it's like, I did see it on Broadway and it was definitely not any of the original people, but I didn't notice a fucking difference.

1044
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:39,772
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1045
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:52,180
Speaker 1: I must have been in high school, middle school- Oh, the only other difference I noticed is the, when they're doing the song with cassette, the actor started to say Colette and corrected himself, but obviously- I make that mistake.

1046
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was obviously on purpose because it was played up for a laugh and there were canned responses.

1047
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:08,014
Speaker 0: Plus, the other thing is, right, when I went to see it, even though it was not the original cast, there's always, even if it's not the original cast, there's always going to be someone who brings something special, right?

1048
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:11,369
Speaker 0: When I saw it, the master of the house was the best.

1049
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:16,260
Speaker 0: He was like this unbelievably odd, like he was born to be the master of the house.

1050
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:19,774
Speaker 0: But at the same time- People applauded for him more than anyone fucking else.

1051
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,530
Speaker 0: It was just like, "Oh my god, that guy was so

1052
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:21,874
Speaker 0: great.".

1053
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:24,398
Speaker 1: I've actually seen Les Miserables three times.

1054
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:28,119
Speaker 1: One time I got to go for free, like shortly after I'd seen it, so I just went again.

1055
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:33,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, because in high school I went to a million fucking musicals in like the- But in Detroit, though.

1056
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:33,819
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1057
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,840
Speaker 1: But they were all like the touring musicals coming into the Masonic temple or whatever.

1058
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:45,451
Speaker 1: And all three times, two different masters of the house got the most applause every time.

1059
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:46,300
Speaker 1: Same deal.

1060
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,833
Speaker 1: I think it's just that role is great.

1061
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:49,999
Speaker 0: No, but the guy was just so good at it, though.

1062
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:51,653
Speaker 0: It can't be easy to do.

1063
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,500
Speaker 1: I couldn't do it.

1064
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,740
Speaker 1: Come on, isn't it worth me to spit?

1065
00:50:55,715 --> 00:51:01,760
Speaker 0: No, but I mean it was actually, he was funnier, you know ours is a song, but the guy has actual lines outside of the song.

1066
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,495
Speaker 1: People always seem to, a lot of people I've met who don't go to see musicals.

1067
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:09,354
Speaker 0: And his physical comedy, he was almost Kramer level.

1068
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:09,920
Speaker 1: Oh man.

1069
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,160
Speaker 0: And he had that same build as Kramer.

1070
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,060
Speaker 1: I have met multiple people in my life, Scott.

1071
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:16,239
Speaker 0: And the costume with the funny shoes.

1072
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:23,639
Speaker 1: Who didn't realize there were acting scenes between the musical parts of musicals.

1073
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,660
Speaker 0: Okay, listen, it's a musical, it's not an opera.

1074
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,640
Speaker 0: Operas are singing a hundred percent.

1075
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,943
Speaker 0: Musicals, they do things between the singers.

1076
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:30,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a story.

1077
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,600
Speaker 0: It's a play, and then a song, and then a play, and then a song.

1078
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:34,715
Speaker 0: That's a musical.

1079
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:34,939
Speaker 0: Yep.

1080
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:38,025
Speaker 0: If it was just singing the whole time, it would be called an opera.

1081
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:39,660
Speaker 0: That's how it is.

1082
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,979
Speaker 0: I'm not even a theater person.

1083
00:51:41,622 --> 00:51:42,559
Speaker 1: Perhaps a review.

1084
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,863
Speaker 0: Well, a review I don't think has a story, right?

1085
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:46,105
Speaker 0: No.

1086
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:49,518
Speaker 1: It's just a bunch of unrelated songs, or loosely related songs.

1087
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,654
Speaker 1: You'll get some sort of like Appalachian melodies or something.

1088
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:56,449
Speaker 0: It's like, here's twenty song and dance numbers that are loosely related in an order.

1089
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:56,833
Speaker 1: Yep.

1090
00:51:56,975 --> 00:51:57,338
Speaker 0: Let's do them.

1091
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,920
Speaker 1: Or go see a cabaret.

1092
00:52:00,101 --> 00:52:01,866
Speaker 0: Or you can go see cabaret.

1093
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:02,454
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1094
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:02,839
Speaker 0: Period.

1095
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,027
Speaker 1: Which is not the same as a cabaret.

1096
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:08,855
Speaker 0: Actually, if you want to see cabaret, the movie is actually fantastic.

1097
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:09,179
Speaker 0: It is.

1098
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,212
Speaker 1: Actually, a lot of those, like Chicago was a pretty good movie, too.

1099
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:12,599
Speaker 1: Pretty good.

1100
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:13,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1101
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,118
Speaker 0: Actually, Chicago is still playing like right across the street from my work.

1102
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,760
Speaker 0: And it's kind of weird because I'm like, you know, I could go see it anytime I wanted, basically.

1103
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,408
Speaker 0: But it's like, all they really do with Chicago is they keep cycling out famous people.

1104
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:31,245
Speaker 0: It's like, the sign outside is always like, this is the famous person who's currently playing the main girl in Chicago.

1105
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:32,276
Speaker 0: Well, come see it.

1106
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,460
Speaker 0: And it's always they change it like every few months.

1107
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:39,912
Speaker 0: And it's like, guess some out of work Hollywood person needs something to do before their next movie deal.

1108
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:45,850
Speaker 0: So they go to Chicago and that lets them bring in some extra ticket sales because the fans of that person come in.

1109
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,779
Speaker 1: I would wager.

1110
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:51,386
Speaker 1: what's going on there is that I think a lot of people have never seen a musical.

1111
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,104
Speaker 1: They don't really like know what a musical like.

1112
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,478
Speaker 1: They don't really know what they're like.

1113
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:55,023
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1114
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:59,793
Speaker 1: So famous person in Chicago is just to trick some tourists into coming and seeing a musical.

1115
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:00,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1116
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:00,982
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1117
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:02,135
Speaker 1: And I think that's it.

1118
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:04,740
Speaker 0: Anyway, but that's that seems to be the way that they roll.

1119
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,660
Speaker 0: Every every show seems to roll differently.

1120
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,651
Speaker 0: You know, there's the shows like Rock of Ages of the Beatles show.

1121
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,571
Speaker 0: I think the Beatles show closed or is closing.

1122
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:16,156
Speaker 1: I haven't seen like Joseph the Technicolor Dreamcoat was like forever and I don't see it anymore.

1123
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:21,752
Speaker 0: No, but shows like that is what they do is they use music people are already familiar with.

1124
00:53:22,055 --> 00:53:23,388
Speaker 0: So it's like going to see a concert.

1125
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:26,559
Speaker 0: It's like we're going to sing a bunch of 80s rock tunes that you already know.

1126
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:28,699
Speaker 0: So it won't be unfamiliar or weird to you.

1127
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:29,788
Speaker 1: That Beatles one.

1128
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,257
Speaker 1: I'm not I don't I'm not feeling that.

1129
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:32,317
Speaker 0: No.

1130
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,177
Speaker 0: But, you know, of course, the thing is those things don't actually win.

1131
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:43,469
Speaker 0: The only one of those I see around that's actually like still kicking is Mamma Mia, which is all the Ava songs.

1132
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:44,500
Speaker 0: And then The Lion King.

1133
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,340
Speaker 0: does that really count in that category?

1134
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,883
Speaker 0: Kind of.

1135
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:47,570
Speaker 0: Right.

1136
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,640
Speaker 0: Lion King is weird.

1137
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,843
Speaker 0: I think I don't know if Mary Poppins is still over there.

1138
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:51,571
Speaker 0: I think it might be.

1139
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,380
Speaker 1: It comes and goes.

1140
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:53,732
Speaker 0: I'd imagine.

1141
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,682
Speaker 0: I haven't paid that.

1142
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:55,793
Speaker 0: I work at Broadway.com.

1143
00:53:55,814 --> 00:53:56,844
Speaker 0: I haven't paid that much attention.

1144
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:57,450
Speaker 1: There's the other.

1145
00:53:57,895 --> 00:54:07,994
Speaker 1: To this day, a special place in my heart exists for Moulin Rouge because it's like a musical that was designed to be a movie like it couldn't be performed on a stage.

1146
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:10,846
Speaker 0: The point is Book of Mormon is the best I've ever seen.

1147
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:14,679
Speaker 0: And also, you should go see Playdead if it comes back.

1148
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:16,280
Speaker 0: And it looks like it's gonna.

1149
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,763
Speaker 1: You know what?

1150
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:23,004
Speaker 1: Playdead is a great thing to bring a significant other to if you're a young punk kid.

1151
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:25,550
Speaker 0: Especially if they are easily timid.

1152
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:25,995
Speaker 0: Yes.

1153
00:54:26,237 --> 00:54:26,560
Speaker 1: Yes.

1154
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,834
Speaker 1: It is also great to bring your parents to.

1155
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:29,935
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1156
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:31,671
Speaker 0: If your parents are cool.

1157
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:36,622
Speaker 1: Even if they're not cool, it's hard to not chuckle at what's going on.

1158
00:54:36,683 --> 00:54:37,834
Speaker 0: Also, cool grandpa.

1159
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:38,904
Speaker 0: Cool grandpa would love it.

1160
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:42,320
Speaker 1: Oh, cool grandpa is the one who will take the kid to it without the mom knowing.

1161
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:45,632
Speaker 0: I could see totally cool grandpa and grandson going to this.

1162
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:46,400
Speaker 0: Totally awesome.

1163
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:46,801
Speaker 1: Yep.

1164
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:47,751
Speaker 1: Grandson's like, "Don't tell your

1165
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:48,236
Speaker 1: mom."

1166
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,059
Speaker 1: Grandpa, not grandson.

1167
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

1168
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:52,280
Speaker 0: Give him the old wink.

1169
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:55,351
Speaker 0: Oh, the Prairie Bible Fellowship comic with the porn behind the stove.

1170
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,060
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1171
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,975
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

1172
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,060
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
