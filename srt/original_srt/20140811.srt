1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,387
Speaker 1: It's Monday August 11th 2014.

2
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:15,758
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,869
Speaker 1: IT Disasters will be done this show.

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:19,693
Speaker 1: I don't know.

5
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:20,959
Speaker 1: we're about to find out.

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:22,873
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:29,189
Speaker 1: ah It was a good weekend had a good barbecue some hanging out.

8
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,213
Speaker 1: It was we.

9
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:37,345
Speaker 1: it's always weird to me though that it's that I'm not at Otacon despite having been so many years Since we last went to one like.

10
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,833
Speaker 1: but then again I think about it.

11
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,150
Speaker 1: most of the people I know who used to go with me don't go anymore.

12
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,609
Speaker 1: They either go to PAX or magfest.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:53,956
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like I enjoyed every Otacon I went to and I'm sure I would enjoy going to it even now Despite it still has some major flaws.

14
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:58,750
Speaker 0: well one one major flaw as more than one major flaw, but - it's in Baltimore.

15
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,697
Speaker 0: It has a lot of good.

16
00:00:59,717 --> 00:01:08,630
Speaker 0: It has many many good points as well But when I look at like the big picture of like my year, it's like man my summer just fucked if I go to.

17
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:15,769
Speaker 1: Well true because this is like our one break between convention season and convention season.

18
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:21,671
Speaker 1: yeah In fact we pretty much every year like we used to be like Otacon was the end of the summer because we go to this Thing.

19
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:27,430
Speaker 1: and then we'd all road trip to like Wildwood, New Jersey and have this crazy week of doing fucking nothing on the beach.

20
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:33,849
Speaker 1: And now our year is our summer ends by flying to Seattle for like a week and going to PAX.

21
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,056
Speaker 0: Yep, that was a good upgrade.

22
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:37,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll take it.

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,389
Speaker 1: Seattle's not as warm as I would like.

24
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:43,787
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not really beach weather out there.

25
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:45,492
Speaker 1: It's only like Tops.

26
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:46,397
Speaker 0: oh no.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,829
Speaker 1: Yeah got to go to the beach feeling Beach.

28
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,763
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's Monday news day tech day tech news.

29
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,670
Speaker 0: all right, so this is a news.

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,029
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what to make of it, but it's on the verge.

31
00:01:58,572 --> 00:01:59,074
Speaker 1: Oh, it's.

32
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,706
Speaker 0: it says the headline is really curious.

33
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,690
Speaker 1: what you're about to talk about.

34
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,790
Speaker 0: Headline is scientists made a laser that can detect explosives from half a mile away.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,470
Speaker 1: That's culture type stuff right there, right?

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,110
Speaker 0: So it says imagine a plane that can fly over large areas of land while identifying hidden stockpiles of drugs or explosives.

37
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:20,902
Speaker 0: They say there's a remote with stockpiles.

38
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,250
Speaker 1: so not like an explosion.

39
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,000
Speaker 0: No it can detect material.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:35,375
Speaker 0: so apparently it's using something called Raymond scattering which is where light goes through something and the light Vibrate.

41
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:36,440
Speaker 1: Raymond like the name.

42
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,948
Speaker 0: no Raymond r.a.m.

43
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,730
Speaker 0: An ramen Like ramen, but you take out the E and replace it with an a and it's not noodles anymore.

44
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:48,360
Speaker 1: Alright, alright, so basically some stuff.

45
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,007
Speaker 0: you shoot a laser through something and the light hey look.

46
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:51,990
Speaker 1: What's on this page?

47
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,039
Speaker 1: Feynman diagram.

48
00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:06,743
Speaker 0: right the light will scatter Based upon the material it hits and it'll scatter uniquely and you can identify molecules Based on this and you can make I guess in theory or perhaps in reality.

49
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:19,357
Speaker 0: They've made a device where you shoot a laser over an area in a burst of some kind and Over a kilometer away you can tell if certain you know Molecules are present.

50
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:31,839
Speaker 0: so they can be like oh yeah, there's um this TNT over there for sure somewhere in that area that we shot this laser this TNT 100% and It's like whoa.

51
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,950
Speaker 0: is this for reals or not for reals?

52
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,828
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know anything about this either.

53
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:41,622
Speaker 0: So let's discuss what if it was for reals if it's for real.

54
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:43,669
Speaker 1: That's really awesome.

55
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,196
Speaker 0: But what are the implications?

56
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:51,192
Speaker 1: oh you want over the implications for scientists and also Terrorists.

57
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:57,321
Speaker 1: well and normal people it allows Interesting at a distance analysis of things.

58
00:03:57,763 --> 00:04:02,250
Speaker 0: right, but you could go for example To the airport and there won't be drug-sniffing dogs.

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,110
Speaker 0: They'll just go BAM with a laser and be like well this heroin in your bag.

60
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:05,707
Speaker 0: We know it.

61
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:13,425
Speaker 1: I would be a hundred percent okay with that if they use Technology to have actual security as opposed to security cop drives down the house.

62
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:14,909
Speaker 0: BAM this THC in that house.

63
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,769
Speaker 1: Well you know what my I. I'm gonna take a meta argument there.

64
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:21,454
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind

65
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:22,418
Speaker 0: cocaine in that house

66
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:27,615
Speaker 1: that if a society is going to have a law against anything That society

67
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,846
Speaker 0: not any search warrant whatsoever just driving down the street shooting lasers at your house

68
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:38,630
Speaker 1: that society Has to be comfortable with the idea that it would be theoretically possible to enforce that law.

69
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:56,543
Speaker 1: If you're not if you have a law that you would you that you realize would cause societal issues Or you wouldn't be happy if that law were able to be or could theoretically be or was Absolutely a hundred percent enforced by magic then that law should not exist.

70
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,669
Speaker 0: They're just lasers right.

71
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,477
Speaker 0: see it I guess it's safe to shoot a person with them.

72
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,688
Speaker 0: so as a result so I shoot rim.

73
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:06,729
Speaker 0: rim You said you're a vegetarian, but looks like you ate steak for dinner.

74
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,796
Speaker 1: Well we can already do that memetically.

75
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:18,902
Speaker 1: I mean there are already a lot of algorithms that can detect to a reasonably high degree gender identity and Orientation and political beliefs and all sorts of laser at rim.

76
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:19,685
Speaker 0: you just room.

77
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,110
Speaker 0: you go to apply for any of conversation.

78
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,535
Speaker 0: You go to apply for a new job.

79
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:23,759
Speaker 0: They shoot me with a laser.

80
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,867
Speaker 0: Why is your stomach full of semen rim?

81
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:26,830
Speaker 1: That's gattaca.

82
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:28,879
Speaker 1: Are you okay with gattaca?

83
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,588
Speaker 0: I'm just saying yeah.

84
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:48,232
Speaker 1: I'm saying that these Technologies if and when they do exist cannot be avoided and thus society has to adapt to them and not the other way around Mmm, so as a result The first most important application I could see is obviously the sort of military Application.

85
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:52,408
Speaker 0: I think the most basic application is you're a scientist in a science lab you have a little laser gun.

86
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:55,390
Speaker 0: you go pew like Oh, I have two white powders here, which one is wedge.

87
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:07,977
Speaker 1: But imagine a world where I walk into the airport and instead of the fake bullshit body scanners There's a real body scanner, and I walk through it and it detects if I have anything I'm not supposed to have and that's it.

88
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,363
Speaker 1: and as a result.

89
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:10,929
Speaker 1: I don't have to take my shoes off.

90
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,505
Speaker 1: That is the human dream one day.

91
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,910
Speaker 1: This is fascinating stuff, I mean actually there's a related new.

92
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,458
Speaker 1: It's not really news, but and I'm not gonna try to find the article right now, but a guy talked about a DIY thing he was working on.

93
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:36,448
Speaker 1: but basically you know the old spy thing where you point a laser at a window and You can record you can hear like the sound in that room by the vibrations in the window like that's real.

94
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:36,890
Speaker 1: that works.

95
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make those devices Mm-hmm.

96
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:47,861
Speaker 1: so you know that other thing of the indirect photography where the very fast cameras you can take photos of Areas that might be around corners based on reflections and things mm-hmm.

97
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:58,047
Speaker 1: so by combining those two technologies You could record sounds at a distance Without there being like a window to look at.

98
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:10,720
Speaker 1: Basically by doing high-speed video and looking at different sorts of anomalies like a fluttering piece of paper inside of a room somewhere that you can't hit directly with a laser if you can just get photos of it in any capacity.

99
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:19,475
Speaker 1: and High and high enough speed photos high enough resolution photos you can reconstruct the soundscape of the room Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:26,516
Speaker 1: so that kind of technology is pretty much the same ramifications of the technology we're talking about here and Society already has a way to deal with those things.

101
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,510
Speaker 1: I can as a police officer I can spy on people theoretically.

102
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,218
Speaker 1: You know tits just dejour dip.

103
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,490
Speaker 1: well not to George de facto as much as I want.

104
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,430
Speaker 1: There's no physical thing stopping me from doing that.

105
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:44,550
Speaker 1: But if I arrest someone and the judge says hey, how did you get this evidence?

106
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,253
Speaker 1: Then the guy could get off.

107
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:52,490
Speaker 1: and that's probably the best possible compromise with technology like this because you can't physically stop it from being used.

108
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:53,795
Speaker 1: There's just no way.

109
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:58,253
Speaker 1: in fact one of the culture books actually talks about that matter talks about that But there's no.

110
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,950
Speaker 0: there's no crime in the culture because the things a crime.

111
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what about other societies like primitive societies right?

112
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,650
Speaker 0: Just absorb them into the culture.

113
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:18,777
Speaker 1: Okay, you live in our society mm-hmm, and the cultures out there Yeah, so a higher level society might have a technology that has undetectable nanobots that diffuse throughout our entire planet and record Literally everything that ever happened.

114
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:22,450
Speaker 0: is a society like the culture exists even if we're not a member of that society?

115
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,546
Speaker 0: Our society effectively has the same laws of the culture.

116
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,186
Speaker 1: Yeah in a sense.

117
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:30,796
Speaker 1: But so what do you do like?

118
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,789
Speaker 1: what do you do if a technology exists in society like this?

119
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,784
Speaker 0: It's the same reason like so for example in to bring it to reality right?

120
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:43,890
Speaker 0: Oh copyright's a law in the u.s Yeah, but I can just go to like almost any other country, and it doesn't matter at all.

121
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,929
Speaker 0: So I don't have to obey it here either except then you have the the physicality of.

122
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:50,904
Speaker 1: well I'm physically in the u.s.. Right now.

123
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:55,766
Speaker 0: I'll be alright For now if there was no place to go, but if it's like the culture is just like.

124
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,529
Speaker 0: yeah, murdering people's.

125
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:57,421
Speaker 0: okay I can murder people.

126
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:57,929
Speaker 0: go the culture.

127
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:03,083
Speaker 1: But I guess it just comes down to when there's technology that you cannot defend against.

128
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:07,764
Speaker 1: like there's nothing you can do about it like a Laser that can tell whether or not you're a vegetarian.

129
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:08,669
Speaker 0: I can defend against it.

130
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,981
Speaker 1: Mirror you're gonna coat your entire body in a mirror.

131
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:13,604
Speaker 0: I'll be Miriam.

132
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,407
Speaker 0: It'll be so awesome.

133
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:14,588
Speaker 1: You know.

134
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:18,049
Speaker 1: It's funny That's how armor works in the culture books.

135
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, you basically mirror the lasers off of you.

136
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,138
Speaker 0: All the ships just covered in mirror.

137
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,310
Speaker 1: well they have fields and one of the fields is like a reflective field.

138
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:29,909
Speaker 1: But then there's other kinds of weapons.

139
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:35,868
Speaker 1: Yeah They've got those.

140
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:41,778
Speaker 1: So Another interesting news kind of them.

141
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:45,149
Speaker 1: in the opposite side of this yahoo has announced their intention.

142
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,513
Speaker 1: Now yeah, who is it?

143
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,782
Speaker 1: and also ran dead player in the tech space.

144
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,477
Speaker 0: yeah, who's got some products though that aren't garbage liquor The weather apps.

145
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:55,442
Speaker 0: good Yahoo Games.

146
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, who sports?

147
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,415
Speaker 1: yeah Anyway name some more.

148
00:09:58,576 --> 00:09:58,897
Speaker 0: That's it.

149
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:02,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Yahoo is completely irrelevant in the email.

150
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, who owns tumblr?

151
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,061
Speaker 1: the only people.

152
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:06,810
Speaker 1: Yahoo is completely irrelevant.

153
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:13,515
Speaker 1: So Yahoo has a completely non-player Email system.

154
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,962
Speaker 1: there are people a lot of people use it a lot.

155
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,788
Speaker 1: I know in some countries.

156
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:18,510
Speaker 0: It's number one.

157
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, that amazing isn't it?

158
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:20,758
Speaker 0: huge in Japan.

159
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:26,605
Speaker 1: I think it's huge in not India because India They seem to use like MSA is Microsoft country.

160
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:32,550
Speaker 1: Yeah But I know some people use Yahoo, but Yahoo I boycotted a long time ago because of some China stuff.

161
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:47,846
Speaker 1: But all that aside yeah I was announced their intention to allow and not just allow because all male systems effectively allow this But sort of assist in using end-to-end PGP encryption of all email.

162
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:51,970
Speaker 0: when you say end-to-end Meaning which ends browser to browser.

163
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,638
Speaker 0: So in my browser I type an email.

164
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,968
Speaker 0: yes the breath the JavaScript of the Yahoo web Client uses my local private key uses JavaScript to encrypt the email.

165
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,354
Speaker 0: yeah And it's a Yahoo.

166
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,523
Speaker 1: so it's stored encrypted on Yahoo's serve.

167
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,661
Speaker 0: right gets to Yahoo encrypted It's encrypted by my computer.

168
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:09,789
Speaker 0: it gets to.

169
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:14,085
Speaker 0: Then I'm sending an email to someone who's also at Yahoo, and that's it deep right.

170
00:11:14,286 --> 00:11:15,410
Speaker 0: what have I sent an email to someone?

171
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,315
Speaker 0: Add another domain.

172
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:21,428
Speaker 1: it just sends the encrypted mail I have to have there and then that that person can't read the email.

173
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:24,317
Speaker 1: well That's the problem with all PGP.

174
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:27,550
Speaker 1: is that all these sort of trust network encryption mechanisms?

175
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,309
Speaker 1: Require me to have a trusted key of the person I want to talk to mm-hmm.

176
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:40,935
Speaker 1: So the other thing they want to do which will only apply within Yahoo is have automatic key discovery handshaking sure Which exists.

177
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:41,778
Speaker 1: like you can do that.

178
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,808
Speaker 1: There's PGP key rings and PGP trust networks like you can do that.

179
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:49,406
Speaker 1: now Nobody, but the nerdiest of the crypto nerds will set that up.

180
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:57,869
Speaker 1: because yeah pain in the ass I mean even will Wheaton who uses this stuff like if you want to email him to this day He's like yo at least use PGP to sign that shit.

181
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,235
Speaker 1: Even he does not like.

182
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:06,417
Speaker 1: it's hard to interact with him via the public key Networks of trust because that just you know.

183
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,019
Speaker 1: nerds do that.

184
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:16,517
Speaker 1: so Yahoo is going to make that easy and automatic for people who are using Yahoo to email Yahoo people and Ideally that means that it'll work.

185
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:19,549
Speaker 1: if you email non Yahoo people, but you got to do the key exchange yourself.

186
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,749
Speaker 1: This is actually a big deal because no one has done this before.

187
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:24,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, not.

188
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:30,495
Speaker 0: what needs to be done to make this really happen is if like Google and Yahoo Team

189
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:31,481
Speaker 1: up and share

190
00:12:31,622 --> 00:12:36,957
Speaker 0: team up so that it works together Automatically and there's a federated key exchange

191
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaker 1: which again

192
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,336
Speaker 0: that just works without people having to do anything except click send email and by default The encryption is all on.

193
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,988
Speaker 0: no, no opt-ins just everything's on all the time.

194
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:51,330
Speaker 1: Yes This is a huge deal because also what they should do is to do this themselves.

195
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,866
Speaker 0: They should also make it by default out people who aren't Yahoo or Gmail.

196
00:12:55,886 --> 00:13:15,859
Speaker 0: when you send them an email It should send them the encrypted mail by default and then Make them like be like what the hell just happened and you should like go through a hoop to send them a non encrypted one and then people who aren't using Yahoo or Gmail will have to figure out and like suddenly everyone will start developing, you know and Joining in on the club to make all the other males compatible.

197
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,277
Speaker 1: because that that that what you propose is exactly why this is actually Important news.

198
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:27,529
Speaker 0: It's like oh shit Everyone everyone hot males complaining because all the emails they receive are encrypted and Google's like tough shit.

199
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,740
Speaker 0: It's like suddenly Microsoft has to get on board.

200
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:38,986
Speaker 1: Otherwise all emails coming from Gmail or You can do this super nice Like you could have a system where it basically sends the person email that says yo This email came from a person.

201
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:43,889
Speaker 0: everyone Everyone with an exchange server has to suddenly add in all this stuff.

202
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:59,641
Speaker 1: but no the fact that no one's done this before and that a one of the One of the major players if you don't count Gmail is actually doing this it's a big deal because people might actually start using encryption and It's interesting to see why it's happening.

203
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:23,440
Speaker 1: Yahoo and Google both they need to have a good story on this stuff for their users because people are pretty mad about at least people who know a Little bit about the internet are mad about the current crypto spying issues, but to by doing this They Themselves do not have access to the email anymore and they can basically any time the governments of the world say hey Hey, hey, they can say not our problem.

204
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:26,289
Speaker 1: Nothing we can do math Yep.

205
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:33,370
Speaker 0: So they're basically because they're like always complaining like here's how many letters you get from the government asking for stuff all the time.

206
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:45,045
Speaker 0: We'll publish this, you know They're clearly mad about having to do all that work and spend all that money and develop systems to handle that Evil with purely self-interested is to give them no profits whatsoever.

207
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:46,590
Speaker 0: They would rather not do that.

208
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:49,256
Speaker 0: So it's easier for them to just be go We're just gonna encrypt all the emails.

209
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:52,230
Speaker 0: then we won't have to answer the government anymore when they ask for emails.

210
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,359
Speaker 1: It'll be us that old situation if Hitler saves a puppy.

211
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,629
Speaker 1: He's still Hitler, but he still did something good.

212
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,334
Speaker 1: You want to trick.

213
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:04,070
Speaker 1: the Hitler's of the world need to do good things even if they're doing them for the wrong reasons.

214
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:10,010
Speaker 1: So so as a result if they do this, we don't need to trust Yahoo anymore at all.

215
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:11,802
Speaker 0: You need to trust that encryption isn't bullshit.

216
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:16,102
Speaker 1: Well, if it's PGP It's just straight PGP with a key exchange.

217
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:16,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have to look at it.

218
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:23,810
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but that's the thing that the idea of encryption is that you don't have to trust the intermediaries.

219
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:31,742
Speaker 0: You have to trust the code you're running locally and you have which is written by Yahoo and you have to trust that the Endpoint you're sending the data to.

220
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:32,870
Speaker 1: is it self trustworthy?

221
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:38,489
Speaker 1: So the person I'm sending the email to I have to trust that they're not gonna just like forward it in ASCII to the NSA?

222
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,850
Speaker 1: Yeah so Google is also doing something interesting.

223
00:15:44,634 --> 00:15:47,950
Speaker 1: This will probably take a lot longer because Google just takes forever to do anything.

224
00:15:48,232 --> 00:16:02,190
Speaker 1: It amazes me that Yahoo is doing this encryption thing first But Google has announced that they intend to start using the fact that a website encrypts itself But with HTTPS as a signal in their algorithmic ranking engine.

225
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:07,844
Speaker 0: Yeah, whenever they do this it's always so vague cuz SEO people right.

226
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:10,911
Speaker 1: fuck SEO people by the way and it's like do that It's like.

227
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:19,230
Speaker 0: yeah, this will affect a small percentage of you know searches in a very small way But it will matter and maybe you should you know.

228
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:30,020
Speaker 0: And basically they just try to say these things all the time to sort of make web developers and people who run websites Basically behave in the way Google wants and behaves.

229
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,218
Speaker 0: the Google basically says we want every website Should always use encryption.

230
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,088
Speaker 0: They're basically Google's like we want everyone to use HTTPS.

231
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:43,990
Speaker 1: Let's just say this and then everyone will have to yep, but you know what again if Hitler saves a puppy?

232
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:51,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one thing that she does is it does make like websites that don't need it and don't have sensitive information.

233
00:16:52,473 --> 00:17:01,130
Speaker 0: Turning on HTTPS eats up a lot of CPU resources makes your site slower You know, it's not a hundred percent just better and it's not turnkey either.

234
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,313
Speaker 0: You have to pay for it.

235
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:09,270
Speaker 0: SSL cert yeah into the SSL cartel, you know, and it's not you know, a hundred percent good Yeah, they're all there.

236
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:21,209
Speaker 1: I mean if you've ever tried to set up SSL certificates in like a standard just like I've got Apache running It's actually not that straightforward and you have to keep changing it all the time because you have to set like.

237
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:26,867
Speaker 0: certain configurations like turn on this cipher and turn off that cipher make this site for a higher priority than that one.

238
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:37,124
Speaker 0: and It keeps changing all the time as new vulnerabilities and different encryption mechanisms are discovered because it's symmetric encryption I gotta make sure you know about like chaining certificates.

239
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,590
Speaker 1: and yeah CAs are trust.

240
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,236
Speaker 0: It's not like a push-button thing.

241
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:42,384
Speaker 0: You can just do if you run a website.

242
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:43,990
Speaker 0: Otherwise, everyone would have done it already.

243
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,014
Speaker 1: So I want to make a meta point.

244
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:50,893
Speaker 1: It's also not 100% free all the time by Google saying this if Anything it might raise the bar.

245
00:17:50,913 --> 00:18:00,889
Speaker 1: because imagine if one percent of the websites in the world that care about Google So that's already a pretty small percentage decide we should do this.

246
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:10,346
Speaker 1: the whatever IT guy works there is gonna have to learn a Little bit more than they already know to make that happen or they know it already and just didn't do it.

247
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:24,789
Speaker 1: I Get the impression that most IT guys don't actually know how to make SSL work and they're gonna go to like TLDP and Apache's documentation and Fumble around for a while pages already get mad hits.

248
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

249
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:29,548
Speaker 0: they can get mad hits for years about the TLDP is so out of date.

250
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,130
Speaker 1: It's almost a joke.

251
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,087
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

252
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:44,835
Speaker 1: It was kind of funny that Scott's news Involves Feynman diagrams because my thing of the day is the 60 symbols video.

253
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,360
Speaker 1: That's not so much about chemistry.

254
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:50,973
Speaker 1: It explains what a Feynman diagram is and how to read it.

255
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:51,635
Speaker 1: Hmm.

256
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,420
Speaker 1: It's 10 minutes long.

257
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:56,529
Speaker 1: It's really well done and if you ever seen you know those.

258
00:18:56,709 --> 00:19:09,518
Speaker 1: there's like two lines coming in and then a squiggle and then two lines coming out and like E's and Q's and lines all over the place in your physics test book in the in the Chapter that in high school you probably didn't get to.

259
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:12,626
Speaker 1: This explains what that shit is.

260
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:16,679
Speaker 1: It's actually really straightforward unless you try to understand what it means.

261
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:19,543
Speaker 0: All right.

262
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:22,579
Speaker 0: So check this out, you know, give a god free day.

263
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:27,656
Speaker 1: I was about to say something that he said once anyway, and then I didn't.

264
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:28,860
Speaker 1: it's kind of racist.

265
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:30,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of things.

266
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,752
Speaker 1: so I'm the pirate from Aladdin.

267
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,216
Speaker 0: No, he's the bird from Aladdin.

268
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:36,158
Speaker 0: I said the parrot.

269
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 0: Oh Parrot if I said pirate no, no, it's hard to say words correctly while doing that voice.

270
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,146
Speaker 0: I don't think he's actually.

271
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:45,579
Speaker 0: is he actually a parrot Iago or is he some kind of other bird?

272
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:47,867
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look that up.

273
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,317
Speaker 0: All right while you're looking that up.

274
00:19:50,304 --> 00:20:00,582
Speaker 0: So the people from cards against humanity Sent him some money and paid him to record some audio in an episode of some kind of mp3 Whatever.

275
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:01,428
Speaker 0: It's on SoundCloud.

276
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:02,052
Speaker 0: Just listen to it.

277
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,158
Speaker 0: That's where my link is sending you.

278
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:14,418
Speaker 0: They've paid him right - I guess number one advertise cards against humanity and - they made him read in a loud voice the speech from Independence Day.

279
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,323
Speaker 0: Hahaha That's all there.

280
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:20,291
Speaker 1: He is a red lorry a species of parrot in the.

281
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,497
Speaker 1: so not gonna say that word family.

282
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:26,722
Speaker 1: Okay sit talk coolie die Sure.

283
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:27,223
Speaker 1: Yes.

284
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,287
Speaker 0: Oh, I could have one of those.

285
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:28,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

286
00:20:29,351 --> 00:20:30,675
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's that there is.

287
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:31,839
Speaker 0: how could you not listen to this?

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,386
Speaker 1: Did you meet Levi wits yet?

294
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,054
Speaker 1: No, do you know who?

Speaker 1: you find a canticle.

298
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,413
Speaker 0: No, isn't the whole book the canticle?

299
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:57,339
Speaker 1: so you're still in.

300
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:05,700
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of priests one of whom is kind of dumb but also kind of smart As the young guy who found the stuff underground.

301
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:07,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, who's both dumb and smart.

302
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:11,049
Speaker 0: and there's an old guy who tried to make him shut up But they gave up shut up.

303
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,532
Speaker 1: Shut up.

304
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:12,016
Speaker 1: Shut up.

305
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:24,297
Speaker 1: Then there's a bunch of other random priests, okay Okay You haven't so, uh, no no like I don't know nuclear war has happened yet.

306
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:28,172
Speaker 0: No, okay Maybe in the past but not in the in the.

307
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:37,400
Speaker 0: you know, part of the book that I read In the moment, we're going to be at the penny arcade expo prime in a few weeks.

308
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:42,233
Speaker 1: Oh my god, we're doing a panel called how to win every game.

309
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,861
Speaker 1: We'll teach you how to win games like go and Football.

310
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,103
Speaker 1: we're not even joking.

311
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:48,224
Speaker 0: No, we're not.

312
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:52,790
Speaker 1: this might be the most well-prepared and greatest lecture that we have ever done.

313
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:55,928
Speaker 1: We're bringing some technology to assist us in doing this.

314
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:02,446
Speaker 1: It's on Monday at noon in the sand worm In other related news.

315
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:05,795
Speaker 0: We have two extra tickets two packs prime.

316
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:10,259
Speaker 0: I have them in my hands and It is too late for you to get them.

317
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:23,019
Speaker 0: As soon as I get home I'm gonna go through and find everyone who tweeted appropriately and use random org to select one of them To receive those two tickets in the mail.

318
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,700
Speaker 1: There is no way this episode will be uploaded by the time or before that is announced for free.

Speaker 0: The end.

329
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:18,266
Speaker 0: You will not like that.

330
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:21,179
Speaker 0: I will make it unpleasant for you in some way possible.

331
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:23,719
Speaker 1: Hang out outside your house at night.

332
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:33,679
Speaker 0: I have your Twitter account and it's probably gonna be a real person on Twitter not a fake one because You know, I'm gonna filter out the bullshit ones like the one I just said.

333
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:38,380
Speaker 1: Emily and I are also going to be at pegs dev.

334
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:44,500
Speaker 1: So if any of you are going to be there and you want to hang out We're gonna be in Seattle for like three extra days before packs.

335
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:46,849
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be chillin in New York having a good time.

336
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,596
Speaker 0: Come keep me company because I'll be lonely.

337
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:54,354
Speaker 1: Yeah All that aside up I booked my tickets so it's on.

338
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,873
Speaker 1: Scott is not coming But I am going to packs Australia in October the first packs.

339
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:01,881
Speaker 0: I will have missed since 2000.

340
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:04,348
Speaker 0: I've been to every single pack since the year 2008.

341
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:16,279
Speaker 1: Yes This is a problem because for that one that includes Australia and the problem is by going to this next packs Australia and then by going to pack south when the third packs Australia comes around.

342
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,899
Speaker 1: I'm gonna feel really shitty if I don't go.

343
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:23,097
Speaker 1: That's like when you've got a portal in ingress you've held on to for 19 days.

344
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least by just going to the one be like, alright, I did it.

345
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:27,885
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz your streak is still.

346
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,613
Speaker 1: you've been to the first packs of.

347
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:33,007
Speaker 1: I didn't go to the first time Since you started going to pack.

348
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,552
Speaker 0: I didn't go to the first packs prime.

349
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:40,320
Speaker 0: I should I said since my greatest regret in life I didn't go to every packs and I could have if I would have sacrificed everything else in my life.

350
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,000
Speaker 1: You know, our lives are pretty good considering that literally are too big.

351
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:47,090
Speaker 0: What did I miss at packs four five six and seven?

352
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,355
Speaker 0: there were four packs is there?

353
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:49,900
Speaker 1: yeah, what happened?

354
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:52,534
Speaker 1: Do you regret not going to neck for a Wamba con?

355
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:57,778
Speaker 1: No I wonder how many people listening now even know what that is.

356
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:02,296
Speaker 1: Some people know but there are people who go to packs and don't know what penny arcade is.

357
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:13,308
Speaker 1: Sure So all that aside IT and technology disasters because there was a high-profile Technology disaster this past weekend.

358
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:14,592
Speaker 0: Well, was it so?

359
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,317
Speaker 1: Otakon convention we were talking about?

360
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:17,380
Speaker 0: this is not high-profile.

361
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:23,837
Speaker 1: It's high-profile because this is an example of an IT fuck-up that was trivially avoided.

362
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,219
Speaker 1: had people known better It was still not high-profile.

363
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,929
Speaker 1: Well by high-profile, what do you mean by high-profile?

364
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,712
Speaker 0: Amazon's down for a long time people can't buy anything That wouldn't be high-profile.

365
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,759
Speaker 1: That would be Mad Max.

366
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,507
Speaker 0: Amazon's ordering system got screwed up.

367
00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:42,820
Speaker 0: everyone received the wrong package like millions of people thousands.

368
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,025
Speaker 1: That would just be hilarious.

369
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:47,360
Speaker 1: that keep whatever they mailed me and then I demand that they send me whatever I ordered.

370
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:51,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's laws around all Google searches returned wrong results for a day.

371
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,879
Speaker 1: I'd use Bing for that day.

372
00:25:55,641 --> 00:26:03,553
Speaker 1: So Otakon an anime convention that we joined the staff at one point and we've been basically since we went to packs Prime.

373
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:13,894
Speaker 1: oh wait We have told them every year they should mail the badges because handing out 30,000 physical badges the Thursday before convention This is stupid like that stupid beyond stupid.

374
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:16,442
Speaker 1: So we're going to skip The.

375
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:20,053
Speaker 1: the real solution to this problem, which was mail the badges.

376
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:21,257
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ sound of it.

377
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:22,260
Speaker 0: We've said that enough.

378
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,385
Speaker 0: We don't have to say it enough.

379
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,093
Speaker 0: Well, no, it can't be said enough.

380
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:26,460
Speaker 0: now the fucking badges.

381
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:30,179
Speaker 1: But that does that a sort of core moral to our lesson right now.

382
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:39,279
Speaker 1: If you have a technology problem and the problem seems insurmountable You need to examine your first principles.

383
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:43,720
Speaker 1: You need to decide whether or not your fundamental approach is correct or not.

384
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:52,751
Speaker 1: If your problem is something like my database can't handle 12 billion queries per second What the fuck is generating 12 billion queries per second?

385
00:26:52,871 --> 00:26:54,637
Speaker 1: Yep, like that's your problem.

386
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:55,500
Speaker 1: Not the database.

387
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:00,695
Speaker 1: So Otakon's problem was they're attempting to even do this in the first place.

388
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:07,535
Speaker 1: Yes, but assuming You know taking that first principle we have to do it physically at the convention.

389
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:26,182
Speaker 1: pass out 30,000 badges What they did and this is based on just me trying to piece it together from things They've said and other people have said because they haven't given a very good official explanation Something like 10 to 15 thousand of those 30,000 people lined up Thursday night and they had a number of computers Onside.

390
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,150
Speaker 0: and they need those computers because they need to.

391
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,867
Speaker 0: when you go up to the booth and say I am so-and-so Here's my ID proving.

392
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,960
Speaker 0: I'm so and so please give me my badge.

393
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,377
Speaker 0: They use the computer to look up if you are indeed so-and-so how many badges you are have paid for.

394
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:45,880
Speaker 0: and you know If you even are a person who paid for badges, yep, and there's no way you could look that up by paper.

395
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,019
Speaker 0: That would be the worst.

396
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:57,077
Speaker 1: So they have a number of those and those computers all have I assume a physical network cable Connecting them to a network on site.

397
00:27:57,218 --> 00:28:12,397
Speaker 1: Yep So what from what I gather what happened was those computers to authenticate whether or not you were the person We're connecting to a database Now that database containing the list of names and numbers of badges of all the people who registered for Otacon.

398
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:19,840
Speaker 1: that database as far As I can tell was not physically on site, but it was hosted wherever their website is hosted.

399
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:29,140
Speaker 0: So every time someone tried to get a badge Well, obviously you need to have the database or the website is hosted because you register on the website And then it needs to insert you into that database.

400
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:38,835
Speaker 0: So it needs to be accessible by the website application for wherever the websites hosted most likely Yep, so logically that is a pretty like it seems but then more right.

401
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:45,340
Speaker 0: but then when the convention happens You are going to have a you know, your computers at the registration booths.

402
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:49,520
Speaker 0: Are they going to connect to the internet to attach to query that database?

403
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:54,780
Speaker 0: Or are you going to make a copy of that database and bring it with you to the convention on a computer?

404
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:08,087
Speaker 1: so what I think happened what their architecture was these computers connected over the private internal network of Otacon of Otacon of the Convention Center and then out the Internet connection the real internet head.

405
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:12,620
Speaker 1: Yep to the website and that connection failed, of course.

406
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:25,939
Speaker 1: now supposedly their backup plan was to switch to the Wi-Fi at the Convention Center which apparently had a separate egress route maybe Which but it also is not going to work.

407
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:39,908
Speaker 1: But it was super slow and overwhelmed by all the other people connecting to it and also didn't work very well And as a result thousands and thousands of people were unable to pick up their badges that night independent of terrible Mismanagement of the situation.

408
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,545
Speaker 1: like they didn't send anyone to go out and tell people to get out of line They like didn't have.

409
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:48,398
Speaker 1: they obviously had no plan whatsoever for what to do if the system failed.

410
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:48,759
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

411
00:29:49,261 --> 00:30:12,119
Speaker 1: So as a technologist then before we did this show I checked to make sure that conventions we work with do not have this vulnerability Because I would have felt really shitty if I said you should do it like X and then a convention where I have some say Didn't do it like X. Why didn't they have a backup plan that involved connecting to a server rather than just giving up?

412
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,077
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean even I of course packs right but not just packs as a whole.

413
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:29,280
Speaker 0: the packs Tabletop checkout library system, which is a tiny database of just barcodes and a few hundred board games Even that system which is like two laptops and a server.

414
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:33,973
Speaker 0: They bring the database physically with them to packs on that server.

415
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:36,240
Speaker 0: There is no internet connection required whatsoever.

416
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:44,189
Speaker 1: Yes now sure you need the database to be as up-to-date as possible But at the same time you need a local copy of that database.

417
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:54,295
Speaker 1: because let's say a change was made on the master database Like I don't know an hour into when you're doing registration and then your internet connection goes down.

418
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:55,919
Speaker 1: You're missing that one change.

419
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,760
Speaker 1: 99% of the people trying to pick up badges could still pick up badges if you had a local replicated copy.

420
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:06,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean it does give people the ability to register for the convention like the day of on the website.

421
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:11,116
Speaker 0: You can pre-reg BAM right away on the website and you'll be in there, right?

422
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,602
Speaker 0: That's a good thing I guess.

423
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:17,040
Speaker 0: but is it really that necessary when you can just buy badges on-site?

424
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:18,820
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

425
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,240
Speaker 1: So what they could have done is just a much shorter line the day or two before the database before the convention.

426
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,489
Speaker 1: Just lock the database.

427
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,020
Speaker 0: lock all the tables say registration is closed.

428
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:37,188
Speaker 1: Yep dump a copy of it to a server and then drive that server to the site and Plug it directly into the local network.

429
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:37,791
Speaker 0: done.

430
00:31:38,393 --> 00:31:44,294
Speaker 1: That would have solved this problem 100% unless the local network failed.

431
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:48,307
Speaker 0: so it's very unlikely much more unlikely than the internet failing.

432
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:48,628
Speaker 0: so

433
00:31:48,648 --> 00:32:09,483
Speaker 1: I would actually because I've done this when I've run events in the past if I were them I would have with me a backup local network meaning a bunch of consumer grade switches one or two professional grade switches a Bunch of Ethernet cables and a bunch and a spool of cable that I could crimp off if I fucking needed to Mm-hmm.

434
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,699
Speaker 0: I have an even better idea.

435
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:14,594
Speaker 0: So this database is not really that complicated.

436
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:15,800
Speaker 0: You don't even need the whole database.

437
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:18,759
Speaker 0: All you really need is this one table that has names.

438
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:25,360
Speaker 0: Right, maybe the state to verify it's the right person because you have duplicate names and stuff like right, you know registration number.

439
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,460
Speaker 1: Why not just replicate it to all the individual PC and number number of badges?

440
00:32:29,661 --> 00:32:35,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, just copy that frickin database because it's like SQL lite table on every single one of those computers.

441
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,220
Speaker 0: It's a standalone.

442
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:41,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, thingy, especially because no Worst case scenario.

443
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,440
Speaker 0: So let's put it on a USB stick.

444
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,759
Speaker 0: Give a fistful USB sticks like here everybody and you just make sure none of them.

445
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,346
Speaker 0: You know, there's a little security risk.

446
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,490
Speaker 0: is someone take so great who?

447
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:50,780
Speaker 0: someone has a list of names that people went to Otakon?

448
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:51,462
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

449
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,832
Speaker 0: Well, it's not like credit card numbers are on there.

450
00:32:53,912 --> 00:33:03,085
Speaker 1: physical security could be done for email addresses Because obviously if the network fails these computers are not on the network anyway, right but to Physical security gets around.

451
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:10,113
Speaker 1: the issue like let's because let's say the master database server locally fails But I've got the replicated copy on all the local machines.

452
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:25,954
Speaker 1: in that case sure, a person could theoretically go to machine one and Then somehow go to machine two and get double their badge allocation, but the way the physical security works Once you walk into that place you go up to a table.

453
00:33:26,396 --> 00:33:27,160
Speaker 1: they take care of you.

454
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:30,276
Speaker 1: There's no path from a table to another table.

455
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:34,380
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That's trivially solved by one person watching the line.

456
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,110
Speaker 0: Also, who is going to do that?

457
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,760
Speaker 1: who would know that you had a problem and that that would work?

458
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:43,480
Speaker 1: How ballsy would it be to try that not knowing that they had a failure?

459
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:53,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, or even then say the master database goes around down Even if you don't have local replicated copies and all the pcs all those pcs could still be networked to each other.

460
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,791
Speaker 1: I mean the odds of your backup switch going down.

461
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:59,440
Speaker 1: these pcs are at most a few hundred feet away from each other.

462
00:34:00,162 --> 00:34:01,869
Speaker 1: Like this is not rocket science.

463
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:09,360
Speaker 1: No, this these kinds of problems are trivially solved by even the most Basic of IT procedure and back.

464
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:16,092
Speaker 0: Well, the fundamental problem is a problem made by many people who not only run conventions but go to them and not just conventions But pretty much anywhere.

465
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:16,679
Speaker 0: is that?

466
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,407
Speaker 0: Assuming there is going to be internet somewhere.

467
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:20,371
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

468
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,438
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many panelists I can.

469
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:28,879
Speaker 1: like 11 came up to me a kinetic on in a panic and they're like Yeah The panel staff told me to talk to you.

470
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:34,399
Speaker 1: I our panel needs internet because we're gonna show YouTube videos and we can't connect to the Wi-Fi.

471
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,739
Speaker 1: and Also, our tablet doesn't have a video output so we can't connect it to the projector.

472
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:42,588
Speaker 1: It's like really kid you ever been to a convention before?

473
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:52,480
Speaker 0: it's not just by me conventions, especially but like anywhere you go If you go to another person's office for a meeting to sell them something is you're a salesperson.

474
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,809
Speaker 0: Your entire demo.

475
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,280
Speaker 1: better run on that local laptop.

476
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:03,649
Speaker 0: You know we cannot assume that that business is going to have Wi-Fi for you to connect to the internet Let alone Wi-Fi that opens weird ports or any.

477
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:11,460
Speaker 0: if you go to a coffee shop to work You cannot assume the internet there is going to be working and will be fast and reliable.

478
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,310
Speaker 1: You can also not assume that your local wireless tether will work because again like say you go to a convention There's 30,000 people there.

479
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,040
Speaker 1: at least half of them have smartphones.

480
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:24,860
Speaker 0: If you it's like you can go someplace and assume there's gonna be electricity and water.

481
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:32,634
Speaker 1: Yes Because if electricity and what basically I said no one's gonna go to that place you can leave Assume that everything short of Mad Max will not be available.

482
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:38,860
Speaker 1: if the convention center doesn't have water Pools closed like it doesn't matter right but Wi-Fi is gonna go down.

483
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:41,894
Speaker 1: there's gonna be no Wi-Fi and this applies to your daily life.

484
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:52,794
Speaker 1: if I travel somewhere and Like we're driving long-distance, and I get like directions on my Google Glass or my phone I At least have a cash local copy of those directions.

485
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:59,384
Speaker 0: in case internet fails Yeah I'm going to drive anywhere as soon as you drive out of Wi-Fi range of your house you need to be able to get where You're going.

486
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:05,978
Speaker 0: if there is no internet whatsoever Between the end of your driveway and your destination which also will not have internet

487
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:08,929
Speaker 1: yup I even if the fucking map if I have to

488
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:16,680
Speaker 0: the only way you can guarantee that internet in your destination is It's also your beach house where you paid for Wi-Fi and internet, and you know it's work.

489
00:36:18,182 --> 00:36:20,108
Speaker 0: Maybe then it'll be trustworthy.

490
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:34,840
Speaker 1: Maybe yup, so I can't imagine having a dependency for 30,000 people picking up badges on an internet connection from a convention center in Baltimore.

491
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,079
Speaker 1: So have you ever run into Scott an IT?

492
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,814
Speaker 1: Disaster or an IT mess caused by someone who didn't quite think their architecture through?

493
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:49,579
Speaker 0: not really because I don't work on a lot Of things that other people fucked up and I've been in one place for a long time.

494
00:36:50,662 --> 00:37:01,340
Speaker 0: When I showed up there was some fuck-ups, but then once I was put in charge I made everything legit, and it's been legit for years with no problems now like the AWS like you finally getting control of that.

495
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:15,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when I got there basically we were you know there was an existing system We were replacing completely But the replacement was already written by these people and these people were like the design firm And they wrote the back-end also But they had never written a back-end before.

496
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,560
Speaker 0: so their back-end was garbage and the home page made like a thousand queries.

497
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:21,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, so first job was okay.

498
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:25,177
Speaker 0: We can't fix their code right now, but make it run.

499
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:29,409
Speaker 0: so Apparently that the IT guy had to do.

500
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:30,191
Speaker 0: you know I could.

501
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:35,871
Speaker 0: I basically just was working on fixing the code and the IT guy Was making it run, but the IT guy was a Windows guy.

502
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,080
Speaker 0: you couldn't set up Linux web servers for shit.

503
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:53,608
Speaker 0: He even though we gave him instructions and drew diagrams like how to set it up He had like this server with Apache Proxying another server with Apache to serve the static files through like three different like you know things before it actually made And it's like oh my god No Wow

504
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,328
Speaker 1: That's like when you visited

505
00:37:55,368 --> 00:38:03,867
Speaker 0: the home page like images would load halfway And then there'd be black on the bottom half because the proxy like timed out halfway On each request.

506
00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:05,393
Speaker 0: and it's like oh my god.

507
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:06,176
Speaker 0: What did you do so?

508
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,990
Speaker 0: but yeah eventually I fixed that and then we rewrote like.

509
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:17,766
Speaker 0: it took a year, so we rewrote all the code to not be garbage and Now everything just works forever.

510
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,872
Speaker 1: I think AWS is a commonplace.

511
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:22,900
Speaker 1: people run into this especially and servers in general.

512
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I set up the AWS from scratch.

513
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,612
Speaker 0: there wasn't anything bad there to begin with.

514
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:34,863
Speaker 1: I've had jobs before where I've been you know There's issues and eventually I say something to the effect of look let me log into your AWS And I'll take a look.

515
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:47,979
Speaker 1: and usually when I see that dashboard, and I see what they do UM play God Why why do you have a hundred instances and a hundred security groups?

516
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,620
Speaker 1: It's like what are you doing?

517
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,119
Speaker 0: They're all the default security group.

518
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,028
Speaker 1: I'll be not even default.

519
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,160
Speaker 1: They're all just like open to everything.

520
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,804
Speaker 1: Yeah size here I Ran into one a while like.

521
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:05,608
Speaker 1: I guess it's.

522
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,156
Speaker 1: I run into these a lot more often.

523
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:20,360
Speaker 0: one because I'm IT Instead of you know CS, so I deal like Scott dealing with servers, and I mean if you're a programmer And you go to a lot of different places and you work at places that have existing code you're gonna see disastrous code.

524
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:33,925
Speaker 0: But if you you know work at a place where there's like just one code base, and it actually got to be good and That you're not gonna see that you know if you're a contractor or something where the people hire you for little you're gonna see a Lot of bad you know for anything.

525
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:34,347
Speaker 0: Maybe you're.

526
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:35,672
Speaker 0: it's not just programming.

527
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:36,555
Speaker 0: What if you're?

528
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,579
Speaker 0: I don't know.

529
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:42,197
Speaker 0: You install a you're an electrician right?

530
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:45,909
Speaker 0: so You get called out to a house to fix something.

531
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:46,892
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

532
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:47,775
Speaker 1: Look at the wiring on.

533
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:48,538
Speaker 0: this is the horrific.

534
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:49,040
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

535
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:53,919
Speaker 0: But if you wire up a new house, it's gonna be great if you don't suck.

536
00:39:55,501 --> 00:40:03,868
Speaker 1: So my jobs though before like before my current job like there was the time when I was basically like a project manager Like assisting kind of person for a hospital.

537
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:17,640
Speaker 1: so my job basically became go-around like they give me a folder and the folder would be like here's a project that has failed or stalled or Like we don't know the status of it or like the guy in charge of it died or like something weird.

538
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:26,868
Speaker 1: And my job would always be Physically go to wherever this project was supposed to have been happening and figure out what the fuck happened to it And what to do to make it happen.

539
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:28,519
Speaker 0: and every single one of them was hard.

540
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:29,766
Speaker 1: Oh my god, there's some.

541
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:42,178
Speaker 1: well some of these things were pretty straightforward like I show up And it's just like oh no one ever actually ordered these servers or the printers aren't hooked up because no one ordered network drops And there's no power in that room.

542
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:44,930
Speaker 1: but some of them would get down to the point like.

543
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:50,715
Speaker 1: I think the two most interesting ones is There was the set of like really expensive like $30,000 printers.

544
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:56,206
Speaker 1: I don't know why this department needed these printers But they needed them.

545
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:08,975
Speaker 1: and I go to see what's going on and I see like oh, there's network drops There's power outlets there are other printers The power outlets are rated for the appropriate wattage is for these ridiculous printers are there?

546
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:10,560
Speaker 0: printers are there they have toner.

547
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,405
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have paper.

548
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:13,248
Speaker 1: That's all fine.

549
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,236
Speaker 1: All right, so they're like, yeah, we tried to plug him in.

550
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:16,300
Speaker 1: it doesn't work cables.

551
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:24,974
Speaker 1: So I see the crossover cables, I see these network jacks and the first thing I noticed that they're not labeled Mm-hmm, so don't go anywhere.

552
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:29,453
Speaker 1: So I Ask around where the server closet is or the wiring closet.

553
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,280
Speaker 1: No one knows because it's like a contract.

554
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,699
Speaker 0: You just start opening every door.

555
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:37,576
Speaker 1: So I basically eventually get a security guy with a master key and I just start fucking open.

556
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,580
Speaker 1: and all these doors.

557
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:40,519
Speaker 0: You see scary things behind each one.

558
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,660
Speaker 1: So I found a wiring closet and in that wiring closet was a bunch of switches.

559
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,660
Speaker 1: They were active and a lot of stuff was labeled.

560
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,356
Speaker 1: So I think all right This must be it.

561
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:58,080
Speaker 1: So I could take my toners and my flukes and I start trying to figure out like where this Jack terminates this closet.

562
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:05,290
Speaker 1: After about an hour I determined that there is no physical way that Jack terminates in that closet Every single port coming into the room.

563
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:06,375
Speaker 1: it did not wherever it.

564
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:11,720
Speaker 1: so to this day I do not know where those terminated in the end.

565
00:42:12,103 --> 00:42:22,518
Speaker 1: I just fucking cut them out Put new jacks in those walls over them with real cable runs that I had running to the proper server closet Never figured out where those other ones went.

566
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:33,580
Speaker 1: When I tried to chase trace it like through the wall with like a sort of like the induction device robot No, like an induction device where you put a thing up against the wall So I put a toner thing on the cable.

567
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:42,999
Speaker 0: So it's like basically the cable turns to a giant antenna just broadcasting noise And then you rub a thing up against the wall and it beeps and you're next to it Like one of those stud finders.

568
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:48,420
Speaker 1: Yeah And then I lost the signal and even like I opened the wall and I still couldn't figure out what the fuck it went.

569
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:49,053
Speaker 1: We just gave up.

570
00:42:49,842 --> 00:42:54,619
Speaker 0: So those cables are probably still in that wall in that hold on the cables where they attach to something at the other end.

571
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:58,919
Speaker 1: That well they were in the sense that I wasn't gonna just start yanking at him.

572
00:42:59,482 --> 00:42:59,784
Speaker 0: Why not?

573
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:03,080
Speaker 1: because what if they unplug something else that's actually being used?

574
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,980
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a hospital like for all I know there might be like an old token bus running like an OR machine.

575
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:11,320
Speaker 1: Okay, like I can't just fuck around in these places.

576
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:16,172
Speaker 1: No, the other the other interesting one was more of a project management thing.

577
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:18,020
Speaker 1: a classroom was supposed to be built.

578
00:43:18,302 --> 00:43:19,832
Speaker 1: I'm supposed to have like 30 computers in it.

579
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:36,325
Speaker 1: I go to the site and There's a cement building with no interior and no doors and no roof and I go in and I see a server rack with nothing in it in this exposed to the environment area and Nothing else.

580
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:38,197
Speaker 1: it is an unfinished building.

581
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:49,516
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and all I did was take a picture of it and I wrote my report and my report basically said Classroom wiring not complete because building not complete see appended.

582
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:50,380
Speaker 1: and then there's a picture.

583
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:52,870
Speaker 1: And I faxed that back and that was the end of it.

584
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:55,140
Speaker 1: Okay, I never found out what happened to that.

585
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,109
Speaker 1: No one responded and said, oh there was just nothing.

586
00:43:58,671 --> 00:43:58,992
Speaker 0: All right.

587
00:43:59,374 --> 00:43:59,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

588
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,840
Speaker 1: Oh See the most recent one I dealt with was kind of interesting.

589
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:09,470
Speaker 1: Someone asked me why the time wasn't synchronized.

590
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:11,376
Speaker 1: That's your job on these three sir.

591
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:12,078
Speaker 0: That's your jam.

592
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:18,067
Speaker 0: Yeah So I mean if it's like if there's a person falling off a building Superman comes.

593
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,538
Speaker 0: if the clock isn't correct rim just comes.

594
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:24,558
Speaker 0: You can hear it from like 10 miles away.

595
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:26,011
Speaker 1: So so I go in.

596
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,100
Speaker 0: someone's clock is wrong.

597
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:36,040
Speaker 1: The first thing I see my two milliseconds is that one of the servers has a cron job That's calling like NTP date and an IP address every five minutes.

598
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,886
Speaker 0: How do people end up with that solution?

599
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:42,380
Speaker 1: so often that solution is recommended by a lot of really bad websites.

600
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:48,395
Speaker 1: That's why that solution exists because people don't know what NTP does even came up with.

601
00:44:48,415 --> 00:44:54,680
Speaker 1: that solution is spread around to begin with I don't even know but I even better as I see people who have updated that advice.

602
00:44:54,981 --> 00:45:01,640
Speaker 1: So instead of NTP date, it's it's like NTP d - I think you like the one-off NTP command.

603
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,433
Speaker 0: Why do they even have that command to begin with?

604
00:45:04,058 --> 00:45:07,028
Speaker 0: Oh When would you legitimately use it correctly?

605
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:20,752
Speaker 0: I might use it with some other options to on boots Mmm-hmm to like with a different if there is no if there is no internal clock on the computer Maybe or maybe if I for the battery in the computer, right?

606
00:45:20,772 --> 00:45:30,225
Speaker 1: I might use that if I'm like starting a virtual machine Mmm, but even then if you do it and you don't understand what you're doing like if someone thinks oh I'll have that run it boot.

607
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:34,480
Speaker 1: So it'll force the clock to at least be close and then I'll synchronize normally.

608
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:36,119
Speaker 1: There's a big problem there.

609
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:42,580
Speaker 1: If you just run NTP like that It'll detect that the clocks too far off and crash without setting the clock just like the demon does.

610
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:44,906
Speaker 1: So it won't actually do what they think it'll do.

611
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:45,408
Speaker 1: Mmm.

612
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,820
Speaker 1: So then the other two servers have an NTP configuration.

613
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:54,780
Speaker 1: They're synchronizing to each other and they're synchronizing to their local like fake time device.

614
00:45:55,101 --> 00:46:01,759
Speaker 1: so they're basically synchronizing to their own local clocks and each other and NTP had crashed anyway.

615
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:06,455
Speaker 1: So I set it up and I said, yes, it's fixed now.

616
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:14,708
Speaker 1: and then Four months later in an email and the email asked me and I quote Why are these three?

617
00:46:14,748 --> 00:46:18,700
Speaker 1: Why do these three servers have different NTP D configurations?

618
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:22,172
Speaker 1: So I'm like what I think I vaguely remember these servers.

619
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:23,357
Speaker 1: So I go in and sure enough.

620
00:46:23,378 --> 00:46:24,464
Speaker 1: They're the servers I set up.

621
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:31,122
Speaker 1: they have they're perfectly synchronized everything's perfect everything is wonderful and The quite that.

622
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:36,879
Speaker 1: basically the people just didn't really understand NTP and they wanted to know why the servers didn't have identical NTP comps.

623
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:39,771
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, they're pairing with each other.

624
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:43,389
Speaker 1: So they have to have each other's IP addresses the end.

625
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:49,455
Speaker 1: But It seems like those sorts of server things are what I run into the most with service like.

626
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:55,460
Speaker 1: people learn How to set up a server by reading other people's blogs or by example.

627
00:46:55,864 --> 00:47:02,500
Speaker 1: So if you have a one bad server That's the only server in a company every new hire looks at that server and takes it as their examples.

628
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:04,016
Speaker 0: Well, that's you know.

629
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:06,869
Speaker 0: It's a fundamental problem with people learning.

630
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:14,873
Speaker 0: when they learn a process on how to do something They follow the process without actually understanding what it is that they are doing.

631
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:17,420
Speaker 0: so any variation from that, right?

632
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:22,280
Speaker 0: So you have people who for example learn how to use Microsoft Word?

633
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:31,702
Speaker 0: To do a mail merge and they remember click on this menu then click this then type this then click Okay, and there's a procedure and they remember that procedure Precisely.

634
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:39,080
Speaker 0: and if Microsoft Word changes or if for some reason that exact procedure doesn't do the thing that they need done.

635
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:43,380
Speaker 0: They're clueless because they don't actually understand or read or know anything about what they're doing.

636
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:47,113
Speaker 0: Yeah applies to every kind of education whatsoever.

637
00:47:47,193 --> 00:48:00,320
Speaker 0: Someone learns how to pump gas They go to pump gas lift this lever and they go to a different gas station where the pump isn't exactly the same And now they don't know what the fuck to do because they don't understand the fundamental concept of pumping gas.

638
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:07,620
Speaker 0: They simply remembered these steps and don't actually think about what the hell it is They're doing or incapable of understanding what it is that they're doing.

639
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:19,393
Speaker 1: So I think there's a more subtle thing that happens here Because this is another option because that's the option of me when I would show up at a place and I'd see a server and Servers really badly configured rather than looking at and going.

640
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:21,120
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess that's how I should set up servers.

641
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,901
Speaker 1: I would loudly go who the fuck set this up and what the fuck is wrong with this because

642
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:36,780
Speaker 0: you can tell that it's bad because you actually understand it as opposed to just assuming that there's this procedure you follow at the end and not know what being able to judge or You know, you don't have a comprehension of the system.

643
00:48:37,503 --> 00:48:59,580
Speaker 1: But I think the places that have bad IT in general will find it very difficult to hire good IT because good IT will either want a lot of money or Good IT will come and then immediately try to redo everything from scratch Because the path to building a new server from scratch as opposed to taking an old server and fixing it

644
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:00,883
Speaker 0: You're shorter.

645
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:02,389
Speaker 0: It's much much shorter.

646
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:05,140
Speaker 1: It's not only shorter, but I think the latter is actually impossible.

647
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,820
Speaker 1: But also like today I found this old server and they were like, yeah, you got to fix the some vulnerabilities.

648
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:13,834
Speaker 1: I log into it like oh, this is Susie 10.

649
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,748
Speaker 0: All right, so I googled What how old is that?

650
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:17,694
Speaker 1: So I googled.

651
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:18,559
Speaker 0: What year is that from?

652
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,355
Speaker 1: So so I go on Google to figure out what the fuck package managers Susie uses.

653
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:25,181
Speaker 0: just cuz I don't even but I forget the Name of it.

654
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,188
Speaker 1: There's like this Zephyr.

655
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:27,529
Speaker 1: Yeah.

656
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,171
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

657
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:28,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

658
00:49:29,355 --> 00:49:30,499
Speaker 1: And there's a couple other ones, too.

659
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:33,120
Speaker 1: So there's like this Yast tool that also does.

660
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:41,040
Speaker 1: So I type yes, it's like yes starts but it's like not configured and can't connect to the outside like whatever.

661
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,837
Speaker 1: So then I type the name of the other thing is like command not found.

662
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:49,255
Speaker 1: I'm like, ah So I responded I was like, yeah, there's no way to fix this server.

663
00:49:49,275 --> 00:49:51,944
Speaker 0: build from source, yep Build new server.

664
00:49:52,024 --> 00:49:57,395
Speaker 1: just install like fucking sent OS at this point like I don't even care copy Whatever this server is doing to a new server.

665
00:49:57,415 --> 00:50:04,018
Speaker 1: Yep Don't copy your opt directory or whatever it is that you do stuff in over gonna pull that shit from scratch.

666
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:13,847
Speaker 1: - guys I can't tell you how many servers I've seen they're messed up because like someone copied like user has been or Like opt just across.

667
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:25,277
Speaker 1: a lot of people just put everything that matters to their business in opt and their procedure for building a new Server is something like install the server Copy opt from this particular server and then do a whole bunch of chones on it.

668
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:27,081
Speaker 0: No Nothing.

669
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:29,471
Speaker 0: any server that I have, you know, how many files are in opt?

670
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:29,954
Speaker 0: None.

671
00:50:30,215 --> 00:50:31,460
Speaker 0: No files are in opt ever.

672
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:33,310
Speaker 1: I have a lot of shit in op, but that's cuz.

673
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:34,578
Speaker 1: I'm always everywhere.

674
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:34,980
Speaker 1: I've worked.

675
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:47,500
Speaker 1: There's a lot of like third-party software that's usually Monolithically packaged because people can't deal with dependencies and fucking nobody in the world seems to know how to package software.

676
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,671
Speaker 1: Mmm, like everywhere I've ever worked.

677
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:51,420
Speaker 1: Hey, can you make that as an RPM?

678
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:52,742
Speaker 1: The.

679
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,999
Speaker 1: the response to that question ranges from no to what's an RPM?

680
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,764
Speaker 0: But I think I'll make you all the devs Any devs you want.

681
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:15,498
Speaker 1: I think the biggest thing I've ever run into and I want to give some specific advice to you kids if you work anywhere and The any procedure you ever look at for setting up a server says disable IP tables.

682
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:18,819
Speaker 1: What and at no point does that procedure say?

683
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,424
Speaker 1: Re-enable IP tables.

684
00:51:20,484 --> 00:51:22,151
Speaker 0: Why would you disable IV tables?

685
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:24,118
Speaker 0: The majority have no IP tables.

686
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:25,384
Speaker 1: rules I think.

687
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:28,699
Speaker 0: leave it on anyway, it doesn't do anything if you just leave it on.

688
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:34,631
Speaker 0: Ah, but a lot of times there's a rule that they don't understand I'm sure and the thing is there's probably gonna be rules in there.

689
00:51:34,651 --> 00:51:36,117
Speaker 0: It's probably not no rules.

690
00:51:36,278 --> 00:51:46,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would say that the majority of the servers I have ever touched in my life that were not built by me had IP tables disabled When I logged in what?

691
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,603
Speaker 1: People don't understand.

692
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:48,526
Speaker 0: the majority of servers.

693
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:51,920
Speaker 0: I touch have IP tables enabled with no rules, which is bad.

694
00:51:52,901 --> 00:52:01,522
Speaker 1: Well, usually it's like they just never at least have the one rule that blocks all local broadcast traffic and blocks all local Traffic.

695
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:04,336
Speaker 1: that's not directed at you in case some bullshit happens on your network.

696
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,424
Speaker 1: Mmm Because I've seen so many.

697
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:07,166
Speaker 1: here's the situation.

698
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:11,439
Speaker 1: You've got a computer on a switch like all computers should be.

699
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:16,540
Speaker 1: So as a result, you never see any traffic except traffic that's directed at your computer.

700
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:25,347
Speaker 1: That's fine, but switches will usually send you also anything that at the low level is broadcast traffic 99% of the time.

701
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:27,960
Speaker 1: broadcast traffic is malicious or useless.

702
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:29,344
Speaker 1: Might as well.

703
00:52:29,384 --> 00:52:31,150
Speaker 1: just have a line at the top IP tables.

704
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,815
Speaker 1: It says like drop not log.

705
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,380
Speaker 1: just drop that shit.

706
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:35,176
Speaker 1: Just get it out of your hair.

707
00:52:35,962 --> 00:52:38,571
Speaker 1: If you're not doing anything with multicast you just drop multicast too.

708
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:40,939
Speaker 1: because why even send that up the stack?

709
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:43,609
Speaker 0: Why don't you write a little tutorial on that?

710
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:46,640
Speaker 1: Mmm, there's a lot of tutorials out there that tell this advice.

711
00:52:46,741 --> 00:52:50,186
Speaker 1: I don't need to write a better one But do people like?

712
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:58,704
Speaker 1: people will install stuff and then it doesn't work And then the first thing they do is disable IP tables because they assume that it's blocking something They just like.

713
00:52:58,724 --> 00:53:01,680
Speaker 0: why don't you just open the one thing that's being blocked?

714
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,100
Speaker 1: Why don't you just look at far log IP tables and see if that's actually what the problem is a good idea I think a lot of people.

715
00:53:10,072 --> 00:53:11,259
Speaker 1: You don't want to know what the problem is.

716
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:15,996
Speaker 1: They disable IP tables because that's like part of their standard troubleshooting procedure.

717
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:16,960
Speaker 0: How did they get that?

718
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,288
Speaker 0: I've never had that as part of my procedure ever.

719
00:53:19,308 --> 00:53:24,130
Speaker 1: not because you're smart because once in their life Something was blocked by IP tables.

720
00:53:24,431 --> 00:53:26,300
Speaker 1: It was fixed by blocking IP tables.

721
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:32,219
Speaker 1: So they added to their script of reboot the computer disable se Linux disable IP tables.

722
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:34,188
Speaker 0: Important things granted.

723
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:35,534
Speaker 1: You should disable se Linux.

724
00:53:35,574 --> 00:53:36,900
Speaker 1: I've never used it effectively.

725
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,960
Speaker 0: Well, I mean se Linux is just as a professional.

726
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:47,640
Speaker 1: Have you ever had a production environment running a configured se Linux in a capacity where it did something you could say specific?

727
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:48,561
Speaker 1: That it did.

728
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:50,087
Speaker 1: Yes, that's my point.

729
00:53:50,308 --> 00:53:54,505
Speaker 0: But if I was in a serious thing where security mattered a ton Yeah, like the financial world.

730
00:53:54,525 --> 00:53:58,300
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone in the financial world has ever enabled se Linux on purpose.

731
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:01,720
Speaker 0: I mean, it's just it's on by default in certain distributions.

732
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:03,960
Speaker 1: Yes, and the first thing they do is disable it.

733
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:08,180
Speaker 0: No The first thing you do is basically as you're setting up or they set it to like permissive mode.

734
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,033
Speaker 0: Well, no as you said what happens usually nowadays is as you're setting up the machine.

735
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:23,039
Speaker 0: if it's a distribution with se Linux by default You're gonna bump into it where it's gonna stop you from doing things and you're saying you have to be smart and you have to Know oh is the thing that I'm doing actually the right thing to do?

736
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:31,196
Speaker 0: I've been doing something wrong my whole life and you google it and make sure the thing you're doing is Indeed the thing you're supposed to be doing and then you make a specific exception.

737
00:54:31,216 --> 00:54:33,710
Speaker 0: you say, okay, I see Linux I'm gonna do this thing.

738
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:34,857
Speaker 0: Let me do this.

739
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,163
Speaker 0: I'm root I swear to God.

740
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:41,111
Speaker 0: and then it lets you do one thing and it continues to do all its other protections that you don't even Know about.

741
00:54:41,214 --> 00:54:43,025
Speaker 1: yep So it's funny.

742
00:54:43,045 --> 00:54:44,268
Speaker 1: you bring that up because that's the.

743
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,120
Speaker 1: that's the way smart or at least competent IT people should do their job.

744
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,411
Speaker 1: If you're gonna break a rule, you should understand why you're breaking it.

745
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:52,615
Speaker 1: It's the same thing in music theory.

746
00:54:53,036 --> 00:55:03,960
Speaker 1: So if a Program is blocked because the IP tables is blocking a port I look in the log first to see if that's the problem and if it is then I make an exception for that problem.

747
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,078
Speaker 1: I don't just assume that IP tables will get in my way because reasons.

748
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:13,200
Speaker 1: So with se Linux you want to know why I think most people disable se Linux.

749
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:22,440
Speaker 0: It stops you from doing anything because they copy Opt from some other fucking computer and the date says the Linux is not gonna let you run that shit.

750
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:24,467
Speaker 1: Well, even if it will the reason it won't.

751
00:55:24,647 --> 00:55:39,847
Speaker 1: usually that I've seen is because some bit, you know, like a you idea whatever is wrong or because the time that those files was created ends up being in a time in the future because NTP was also not set up right.

752
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:40,530
Speaker 0: they can't.

753
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,960
Speaker 0: just you can just wait ten minutes and then suddenly it'll work.

754
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:48,739
Speaker 1: so the problem is that usually that time in the future is some like made-up number or the time is.

755
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,005
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

756
00:55:52,367 --> 00:56:05,740
Speaker 1: so the the perfect storm of NTP is set up wrong IP tables is set up wrong possibly causing NTP to not work and Some directory like opt or s bin was stupidly copied from another server.

757
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:10,544
Speaker 1: That is the perfect storm of se Linux just giving you errors You don't understand.

758
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:17,311
Speaker 0: if you had just used like our sync with like - M time or something I forget the flag you would have the right times.

759
00:56:17,492 --> 00:56:19,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to point out Scott I don't really.

760
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:20,384
Speaker 1: you don't remember.

761
00:56:20,404 --> 00:56:22,514
Speaker 1: you'd have to look up like the exact options in our.

762
00:56:22,614 --> 00:56:24,000
Speaker 0: I know how to type man our sync.

763
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I love one of my developers.

764
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:27,271
Speaker 1: the other day.

765
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:36,231
Speaker 0: We were looking up some stuff and And also I wouldn't I would not only would I not be copying up from one computer to the other but if I was I'd be using our saying.

766
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:37,140
Speaker 1: we see a file format.

767
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,710
Speaker 1: We're like what the fuck is this and the developers like he.

768
00:56:39,951 --> 00:56:40,352
Speaker 1: I am just like.

769
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:43,324
Speaker 1: here's the command that I use to generate that And it's like t shark.

770
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:46,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just remembers that command copies and paste.

771
00:56:46,096 --> 00:56:47,060
Speaker 0: it has no idea what it does.

772
00:56:48,121 --> 00:56:48,924
Speaker 1: This isn't that problem.

773
00:56:48,944 --> 00:56:57,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we look at the command and Like I used I do packet capture a lot But every time I do I type man t shark.

774
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,240
Speaker 1: cuz I don't fucking remember all those filter details.

775
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,970
Speaker 1: No one does unless your job is just that.

776
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:04,339
Speaker 1: so I we both look at this command.

777
00:57:05,042 --> 00:57:09,859
Speaker 1: Another one of us says anything and he just types man t shark.

778
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:14,510
Speaker 1: Yep, and I gave him the silent bro fist from behind Mm-hmm.

779
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:16,906
Speaker 1: So what's the moral of this?

780
00:57:16,946 --> 00:57:20,799
Speaker 1: I guess don't you learn from the mistakes of others Monday.

781
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:21,260
Speaker 0: show ideas?

782
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,025
Speaker 0: We need more of them.

783
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:23,999
Speaker 1: Yes learn from the mistakes of others.

784
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:25,908
Speaker 1: Think about what you're doing.

785
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:31,430
Speaker 0: If you're if you're copying pasting commands Just typing them in doing it wrong.

786
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:38,992
Speaker 0: If you don't understand every single thing that you are doing fully 100% you have failed even if in the end it works.

787
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,316
Speaker 0: you fucked up.

788
00:57:40,677 --> 00:57:52,580
Speaker 1: when I installed That fucking Linux from source gen 2 back when we were at our IT I understood about 40 or 50 percent of what I was copy pasting to bootstrap that thing.

789
00:57:54,621 --> 00:58:05,875
Speaker 1: But also kind of an aside if you're setting up a system of any kind writing code anything Think about the things that could go wrong even if you don't do anything about them.

790
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:15,215
Speaker 1: if Something if you like deploy a system and then like a week later something goes wrong And you didn't at least anticipate the possibility of that going wrong.

791
00:58:15,737 --> 00:58:20,547
Speaker 1: You're a failure that You've got to think like.

792
00:58:20,808 --> 00:58:24,280
Speaker 1: think like the most horrible pessimists in the world like it like the Otacon example.

793
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:28,780
Speaker 1: If I were in charge of that apartment, I'd be I'd be thinking so what if the internet goes down?

794
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,563
Speaker 1: What are we gonna do?

795
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:30,166
Speaker 1: fine?

796
00:58:30,568 --> 00:58:31,835
Speaker 1: What if the power goes out?

797
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:32,518
Speaker 1: What are we gonna do?

798
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:41,386
Speaker 1: Fine and the answers to some of those questions might be we shut the fuck down and don't give out badges or we break out the paper copies.

799
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:51,000
Speaker 1: the fact is even if you don't have a Contingency plan that actually solves the problem of the ridiculous failure you have to at least have a plan.

800
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:53,269
Speaker 1: The plan might be give up and go home.

801
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:57,860
Speaker 0: It might be it's like oh, we actually have to tell these people Don't wait in line anymore.

802
00:58:57,922 --> 00:59:02,731
Speaker 1: Yeah Like a you know in the fit like some crazy Financial thing like you might have a plan.

803
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:18,131
Speaker 1: like even when I worked in like a broker-dealer We had plans that said things like if the trading system cannot be brought up within X minutes after whatever outage like multiple site failure The business the continuity plan after that was a business plan.

804
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:24,679
Speaker 1: That was like call our customers and tell them we're down Update our website to tell people we're down.

805
00:59:25,141 --> 00:59:28,271
Speaker 1: Disconnect all of their fixed sessions because we're down.

806
00:59:28,772 --> 00:59:31,180
Speaker 1: It's okay to have a plan that says we're fucked.

807
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:32,487
Speaker 1: This is what we do.

808
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:34,276
Speaker 0: once we're fucked you can't just do nothing.

809
00:59:34,296 --> 00:59:41,660
Speaker 0: Yes Or maybe the you know, maybe do nothing's the right answer But at least you know, you need to know why do nothing's the right answer?

810
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:49,656
Speaker 1: I can imagine conditions he found that says if the backup fails leave the office change your name never show up to work again cash that check.

811
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:59,498
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
