1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,587
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Tuesday, February 17th.

2
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:12,209
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:16,219
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights that we talk about all those old sim games.

4
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: See your mom Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were actually up in Albany this past weekend.

6
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:35,616
Speaker 0: It's been a while since we've left the geek house.

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:48,409
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah Albany it's colder There's less people there It's farther away from civilization More people there than there are in beacon.

8
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:55,986
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I'm talking about just you know more general geography Not specific geography.

9
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:59,580
Speaker 1: I mean, there's more people in Albany than there is in our backyard.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,390
Speaker 1: You know, do you got a?

11
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,120
Speaker 1: you got to compare the same radius?

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,651
Speaker 0: I don't know how it's really relevant though because you spend your whole time inside.

13
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:08,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's correct.

14
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,330
Speaker 1: Well, we went outside a little bit a little pretty much.

15
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,880
Speaker 0: we just got the crew together to celebrate one of our elders birthdays.

16
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:20,527
Speaker 0: yeah, I got him an Xbox and Played a little bit of mouse guard.

17
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:20,628
Speaker 0: Yeah.

18
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:22,435
Speaker 1: Well, we made characters.

19
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:23,480
Speaker 1: We didn't play anything.

20
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,268
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is mouse guard like burning wheel.

21
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,256
Speaker 0: character creation is in and of itself a game.

22
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:33,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know We'll probably talk about this more when we actually talk about it.

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:41,979
Speaker 1: Yes, you know the the mouse guard character creation It's like when you make a character in burning wheel or even if you make a character in D&D.

24
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:52,558
Speaker 1: The act of making a character is in and of itself like this fun activity Like I get to sit there all day burning characters choosing life paths, right and mouse guard.

25
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,860
Speaker 1: a good thing They did is they made it more collaborative.

26
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,089
Speaker 1: So it's actually sort of the beginning of the game.

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,154
Speaker 1: is the character making?

28
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,419
Speaker 1: everyone sits around and does it.

29
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,500
Speaker 1: But I think the act of doing it is a little bit less fun than the burninating.

30
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:06,646
Speaker 0: I don't know.

31
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,259
Speaker 0: It definitely it creates a different kind of character.

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does which is important because mouse guard kind of really pushes you in a certain direction.

33
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:15,959
Speaker 0: role-playing.

34
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:25,907
Speaker 1: Yes So yeah, but uh, well you have to be you know in the mouse guard You can't really can't be like you're not you're not gonna make a mouse who's you know Equivalent life paths were born in the gutter.

35
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,651
Speaker 0: peasant peasant peasant peasant.

36
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:30,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much you have to be at some point.

37
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:37,180
Speaker 1: Join the mouse guard is good actually, you know is on the side of the mouse guard.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,543
Speaker 1: You can't.

39
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:39,460
Speaker 0: of course that shouldn't be as much of a concern.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,980
Speaker 0: It's just when we play burning wheel, it seems like everybody wants to be the asshole traitor.

41
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:47,231
Speaker 1: Well, you're not gonna get in the mouse guard for the asshole traitor.

42
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like in burning wheel everyone's the asshole traitor I know right except me.

43
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:52,697
Speaker 0: I'm the good guy.

44
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:58,743
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I could talk more on this based on things that I have learned recently But I will not.

45
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:09,200
Speaker 0: because yes, I don't want to drag on and dive, you know tangent the show too much But suffice it to say oh We'll be talking about mouse guard a lot more in the days to come.

46
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,160
Speaker 0: Basically, we just have to play it a whole bunch of times first.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,120
Speaker 1: So I actually playing not just the character.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I can jive all the things that Luke and David told me about it with my actual experiences.

49
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,647
Speaker 0: Mmm, but we I got that interview.

50
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,389
Speaker 0: I got at the comic-con.

51
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,574
Speaker 0: I listened to it again on the train.

52
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,340
Speaker 0: It was pretty fantastic.

53
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,325
Speaker 1: You should give me it.

54
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:27,551
Speaker 0: I'll get it out.

55
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,099
Speaker 0: I got to edit it together a little bit.

56
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,767
Speaker 1: I would just want to hear what it was without the editing.

57
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,877
Speaker 0: All right, maybe I'll put it in experimental feed someday.

58
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:40,618
Speaker 1: Ooh Yeah raw uncut, you know, you could also just give me a copy cuz I'm right here.

59
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could.

60
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,830
Speaker 0: It's actually right here on the Marantz.

61
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be nice.

62
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:44,218
Speaker 1: All right.

63
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,706
Speaker 1: So, so, let's see.

64
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:48,489
Speaker 1: What's news?

65
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,753
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what's news.

66
00:03:50,476 --> 00:04:12,465
Speaker 1: the pirate Bay One of the best websites on to internets there was big news because they're having Ted trials alright, so basically the European RAA Swedish whatever equivalent right basically all the record labels is to you know Took the Pirate Bay to court.

67
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:24,251
Speaker 1: mostly they took the three guys at the head of the Pirate Bay who actually you know run it and one guy who gave them a bunch of money who sort of a Sympathetic rich guy in Sweden, right and they're taking that.

68
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,999
Speaker 1: that's who the trial that is being charged here.

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,780
Speaker 1: and You know, there was like questioning like oh no Is this the end for the Pirate Bay even though they've managed to avoid the law?

70
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,880
Speaker 1: You know and beat the law and courts up until now for so many years.

71
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:42,538
Speaker 0: Well do primarily to the way the legal system is over there.

72
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:47,076
Speaker 1: Yes Will they continue to be awesome and beat the law?

73
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,020
Speaker 1: or will this be?

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,758
Speaker 1: Doom for bit torrents, right and I mean I was just using Pirate Bay the other day to get legal things.

75
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,319
Speaker 1: So You know if it goes down that's not good for the world.

76
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:04,133
Speaker 1: But so I was going oh no like two days ago.

77
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:06,740
Speaker 1: We were all like, oh no, is it gonna go good or bad?

78
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,775
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I was pretty indifferent.

79
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:10,685
Speaker 1: to be honest I'm not in I'm.

80
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:14,580
Speaker 1: I definitely want the Pirate Bay's to win but you know I do in many regards.

81
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:22,173
Speaker 0: But at the same time it wouldn't affect me that much if it went away Partly because something else something else immediately appear like before even.

82
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:26,945
Speaker 1: well, I mean, that's the thing is that there are plenty of Pirate Bay equivalent slice.

83
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:35,640
Speaker 1: the thing is they all sort of suck, you know, it's like they have bad searches They have a shit ton of nasty ads or you can't trust them or their torrents suck.

84
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:44,414
Speaker 1: You know, the Pirate Bay is actually a decent clean website, you know Like how many other torrent sites are there out there that they could go after Mininova.

85
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:45,718
Speaker 1: right is that still around?

86
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:46,540
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:06:01,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just remember, you know at RIT and kind of the the peak of the post Napster piracy days I would go to where sites and it would basically be 99% horrible pornography ads and every now and then the crack I was looking for.

88
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:07,200
Speaker 1: Usually if you clicked on that you had to get like three rars from three different sites and click on a bunch of viruses?

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:16,055
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, of course I always got them on RIT computers and then copied the clean crack I got at the end from the RIT computer.

90
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:17,540
Speaker 1: if you could trust the crack is clean.

91
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:21,519
Speaker 0: Well, usually the crack was something along the lines of a CD key.

92
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:31,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was a CD key generator, I would just generate the CD key on another machine write it down in a piece of paper Bring it and maybe write generate like three or four just to make sure just in case.

93
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, then bring them over.

94
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 0: Those were good days.

95
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:53,466
Speaker 1: Yeah No But the so far the Pirate Bay went to court for one day right and in the first day they came out with the arguments and I was reading and they were actually Like surprisingly able to make their points in court and it was sort of a. I was like wow This is a Court of Commons.

96
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:59,468
Speaker 1: almost, you know, it makes our court look like, you know Frickin, I don't know a kangaroo cart.

97
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:00,913
Speaker 1: He has something like that.

98
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:05,669
Speaker 1: I was gonna say like Like what's that Wild West show?

99
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:06,836
Speaker 1: What's the dude's name?

100
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:10,790
Speaker 0: I Can think of like 10 Wild West the one with Annie Oakley.

101
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:11,954
Speaker 1: I don't know.

102
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:12,476
Speaker 1: I forget.

103
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:13,500
Speaker 1: I'm so stupid.

104
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:18,449
Speaker 1: That makes our court look like that.

105
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:26,780
Speaker 1: so, you know and they were basically like hey look we don't actually share any files There are no illegal things on our server.

106
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,740
Speaker 1: All we do is have these torrent files and all our users are doing these things and we're not filtering, you know.

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,128
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like that DMCA exception argument.

108
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:45,680
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, we are not making any publishing decisions there We're just providing this service to any torrent legal or illegal and it's not our you know bag to say yes or no, right?

109
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,814
Speaker 1: So they made this great argument in court.

110
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:59,480
Speaker 1: So the next day Apparently the lawyers for the the record labels, you know The bad guys were like, oh but apparently they understood what was just said to them and they were pretty much like off.

111
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:04,560
Speaker 1: These guys don't have any copy illegal things on their servers anywhere now didn't they?

112
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,542
Speaker 0: Couldn't?

113
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:10,819
Speaker 0: they have looked at the website and figured well good then again if they're not text They might not have been able to figure it.

114
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,503
Speaker 1: Well, that's just is.

115
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:25,500
Speaker 1: they were basically look clearly the other people don't understand the technology here but apparently now they do or they do more so and apparently the judge and whoever also Understands and as a result, they pretty much had to drop half their charges.

116
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:31,920
Speaker 1: So, I mean the Pirate Bay guys could still get a huge fine and they could still have up to two years in prison.

117
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:38,150
Speaker 1: But that's the most they could have Assuming they're found guilty of all the remaining charges and get the maximum everything.

118
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,835
Speaker 1: So so far.

119
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:43,443
Speaker 1: It's it's Pirate Bay to Everyone else.

120
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,932
Speaker 1: negative one and we'll see what the final.

121
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:50,063
Speaker 1: we'll see what the final score is pretty Hiccups hiccups.

122
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:50,685
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

123
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,153
Speaker 1: We'll see what the final score is pretty soon.

124
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:56,573
Speaker 1: But right now looking good for the Perot in.

125
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,189
Speaker 0: So not along those lines at all.

126
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:09,500
Speaker 0: there's this article in slash dot and people were kind of Overreacting to it, but at the same time it's one of those things where the concept itself brings up a lot of points.

127
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:18,532
Speaker 0: I'm sure you saw it But the headline was that the European Parliament basically wants to add a quote Red button for shutting down video games.

128
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,440
Speaker 1: What do you mean a red button?

129
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,688
Speaker 0: Well, I can read the actual quotation here.

130
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:33,174
Speaker 0: parents should have a quote red button unquote To disable a game they feel is inappropriate for their child says EP internal market committee Until Peggy online is up and running.

131
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,040
Speaker 0: I don't know what Peggy is.

132
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:44,159
Speaker 0: The report proposes fitting consoles computers or other game devices with a quote red button unquote To give parents the chance to disable a game or control access at certain times.

133
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:49,120
Speaker 1: Well, okay, you know, but that's not something needs to be legislated.

134
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:54,805
Speaker 1: all you need to do is just have parents who can go and Push the power button.

135
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:59,040
Speaker 0: Well this that's what bothers me pull the plug out of the wall.

136
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:01,420
Speaker 1: That's what you don't need legislation for this.

137
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,433
Speaker 0: Like I said, that's what bothers me the fact that I mean one.

138
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:07,620
Speaker 0: there shouldn't be any legislation about anything like this.

139
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,037
Speaker 0: Anyway, because it's ludicrous, but to the fact that anyone would be an advocate of this.

140
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,825
Speaker 0: I mean Can't parents.

141
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,890
Speaker 0: I remember when I was a kid.

142
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:21,439
Speaker 0: if my parents didn't want me to play Mario They wouldn't let me play Mario and there was nothing I could do about that.

143
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:22,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are the?

144
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,699
Speaker 0: what are these kids today that they can somehow get away with?

145
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:25,880
Speaker 0: that?

146
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:42,193
Speaker 1: I think whoever this guy is he should sit down and watch the episode of South Park where you know Cartman has all the nannies and then the dog trainer Right because he basically, you know, they take the Xbox away from him he plugs it back in they take it away He plugs it, you know, I think that's what.

147
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:51,879
Speaker 0: that's what he needs there but it worries me that this sort of thing is eventually going to actually get legislated through because Video games are still the rock and roll of our era.

148
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know You should ask him.

149
00:10:56,047 --> 00:11:02,580
Speaker 1: He was probably listening to rock and roll be like, hey What would you say if your parents had a button to just turn off your tap, you know turntable?

150
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,141
Speaker 1: It's like.

151
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,751
Speaker 1: well, we don't actually need a button.

152
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:10,240
Speaker 1: They could have unplugged it at any time It's not you know, no, of course, we're completely ignoring all the other factors.

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,409
Speaker 0: Like I don't know that this is completely technically infeasible.

154
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,415
Speaker 0: kids are smarter than their parents.

155
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,000
Speaker 0: They would just get around it anyway.

156
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, how's this button supposed to work now?

157
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:32,070
Speaker 0: apparently follow-up articles noted that the red button was a metaphorical construct only but that doesn't make any sense because All right, it's a medical metaphorical concept.

158
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:34,480
Speaker 1: still how it already exists.

159
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,575
Speaker 1: It's called the plug going into the wall, but I don't know.

160
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:38,700
Speaker 1: it's called the power button.

161
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,735
Speaker 0: I don't understand it's called the spanking at any point.

162
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,726
Speaker 0: something like that I can't imagine.

163
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:47,730
Speaker 1: Not that I advocate spanking of children.

164
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:50,280
Speaker 0: I can I advocate other spankings?

165
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:53,467
Speaker 1: Okay, if you know what I mean, I'm curious.

166
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:53,948
Speaker 0: continue.

167
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,592
Speaker 1: What do you continue?

168
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:56,675
Speaker 0: What kinds of spankings.

169
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,559
Speaker 0: do you advocate Scott the sexy kind?

170
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,824
Speaker 1: Apparently that wasn't.

171
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:02,567
Speaker 1: I didn't.

172
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:03,009
Speaker 1: I don't know.

173
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,500
Speaker 1: I didn't realize it needed to go beyond the innuendo.

174
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:08,691
Speaker 0: What kind of spanking is the sexy comment?

175
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,460
Speaker 1: all the kinds that don't involve children?

176
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:13,619
Speaker 0: All the kinds.

177
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,010
Speaker 1: Can you think of a spanking that does not involve children?

178
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,133
Speaker 1: That is not sexy.

179
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:19,414
Speaker 0: Yes.

180
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:21,540
Speaker 0: I can someone I can very much.

181
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,563
Speaker 1: It's sexy to somebody.

182
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:27,320
Speaker 0: I point out in Horatio when they catch that traitor for like the second time.

183
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,089
Speaker 1: That wasn't a spanking that was a lashing.

184
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,835
Speaker 0: No, that was a spanking.

185
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:32,115
Speaker 1: it could.

186
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,079
Speaker 1: it wasn't a paddling.

187
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:41,564
Speaker 0: He put him over his knee took off the guy's belt and hit him on the ass with it Repeatedly Thinking that's a belting.

188
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:42,989
Speaker 0: That's a belt.

189
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,474
Speaker 1: spanking involves the hand.

190
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:45,477
Speaker 0: does it now?

191
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,159
Speaker 1: Yes does.

192
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:55,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, I guess it was interesting to watch this article primarily because the internet went crazy about it, you know rambling You know, how could a red button work?

193
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,323
Speaker 0: It's completely infeasible.

194
00:12:56,383 --> 00:13:01,900
Speaker 0: all these all the obvious arguments, but then the counter argument was you people are idiots.

195
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,340
Speaker 0: It was just the red button thing was just metaphorical.

196
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,650
Speaker 0: But then the response to that is but still what do they mean then?

197
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:18,840
Speaker 0: because if it's metaphorical they're still implying that there should be Some sort of legislated way for parents to control their children that parents should already be able to control their children.

198
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:20,607
Speaker 1: Yet you can already.

199
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,471
Speaker 1: this we don't need.

200
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:25,446
Speaker 1: not only do we not need a law for this We don't need anything for this.

201
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:26,710
Speaker 1: It already exists.

202
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,500
Speaker 1: As I said the power button the power cord.

203
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,756
Speaker 0: Well, there it is.

204
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,693
Speaker 0: It kind of does illuminate the deeper issue that there's a lot of talk about.

205
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:40,000
Speaker 0: we need to protect children from the internet and Kids need to be like you got to watch him and there's stalkers and all this stuff.

206
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,540
Speaker 0: But I guess I I don't know.

207
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:52,578
Speaker 0: I feel like I should point out that when I got a computer my parents and the rest of my family Basically knew nothing about them and I had a hundred percent free rein to do whatever I wanted.

208
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:58,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too I was online unsupervised for most of my childhood and Nothing bad came of it.

209
00:13:58,793 --> 00:13:59,660
Speaker 0: No, not really.

210
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:06,413
Speaker 1: I think the major problem here is that Is not that you know, there is a power cord.

211
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,200
Speaker 1: There is a power button, right?

212
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,682
Speaker 1: It's that you know What was that?

213
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:15,234
Speaker 1: one of the the cartoons with the nerdy guys where the dad couldn't turn the computer off?

214
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:15,616
Speaker 1: Remember?

215
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:23,155
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right We have a situation where you know parents still have authority over their children.

216
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:27,942
Speaker 1: just you know in in but they Don't have.

217
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:31,072
Speaker 1: you know, their kids are smarter than they are so they can't.

218
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:37,976
Speaker 1: you know you you in the olden days Right a parent was smarter than the kid and pretty much everything like the old Bill Cosby.

219
00:14:37,997 --> 00:14:44,869
Speaker 0: all the bits about how they try To avoid getting hit with the belt, but they'd always hit hit with the belt, right or like, you know It's like oh you try to sneak out of the house.

220
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:45,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,572
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

222
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:47,460
Speaker 1: I try to sneak out of the house, too.

223
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,340
Speaker 1: I know everything there is to know about sneaking out of the house and you get caught every time.

224
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:03,076
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you know the Simpsons isn't really funny anymore but I ended up randomly watching a recent episode and there's this whole thing where Lisa was gonna be bad and My margins basically like uh, yeah, whatever you can't get out.

225
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:03,860
Speaker 0: You're locked in your room.

226
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:14,088
Speaker 0: so she's like hey and she goes out the window and she starts to climb down the tree and she jumps to the ground into Marja's arms and she says Bart fourth grade.

227
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,798
Speaker 0: You've got a lot to learn missy.

228
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,567
Speaker 1: Exactly Right, it's like the thing is.

229
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:21,771
Speaker 1: you have parents now.

230
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:24,560
Speaker 1: these parents didn't have vid you game.

231
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,190
Speaker 1: So I guess, you know younger parents did.

232
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,859
Speaker 1: we're getting you know, we're getting to that time.

233
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:31,971
Speaker 1: But the older parents, you know 40, you know pluses did not.

234
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,340
Speaker 1: so their kids are doing things that they don't understand.

235
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,611
Speaker 1: So the kids are actually able to beat parents at.

236
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:42,609
Speaker 1: you know, I guess it's not even the parents game It's just they could just beat their parents.

237
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:55,113
Speaker 1: and that is why The parents and older people feel they need Legislation or technology or something to help them, you know Keep their kids in line because now their kids are smarter than them.

238
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,700
Speaker 1: if your kids are smarter than how do you keep them in?

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,504
Speaker 1: Control they're just.

240
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:59,475
Speaker 1: you know, you can't you can't do anything.

241
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:00,500
Speaker 1: the same thing happens to teach.

242
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,909
Speaker 0: See the trick is I wouldn't in this case.

243
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:13,971
Speaker 0: I wouldn't necessarily say Smarter more that well not smarter overall, but there's a. it's not even intelligence so much It's just knowledge alone provides power over parents to children.

244
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:20,311
Speaker 0: these days even if the children have no like they're not smart They don't have any like really real aptitude for this stuff.

245
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:34,200
Speaker 0: No, but if they have knowledge It's like a magic spell that no parent can get around Mmm, but then again no matter how smart the kid is in that regard The parent can just take away the computer and not let the kid go outside.

246
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,655
Speaker 1: so Yeah, but I mean, you know, usually a parent is too stupid for that kind of thing.

247
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,468
Speaker 0: again, I wouldn't say stupid I would just say I don't know knowledgeable or timid.

248
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:45,812
Speaker 1: Oh, well, maybe.

249
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:50,467
Speaker 1: but also, you know, sometimes it's just a little ludicrous Like okay, no TV.

250
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,554
Speaker 1: They turn they push the power button on the TV.

251
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:57,836
Speaker 1: So the kid goes, okay It's like go to your room and take the TV out of the kids room.

252
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:02,160
Speaker 1: Okay Kid like tunes into TV on his iPhone.

253
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,619
Speaker 0: Clearly you take away all the kids stuff and you put him in his room with nothing.

254
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:13,859
Speaker 1: That's the thing is you don't even realize that it's you know, and then the kids got a hidden game gear with a TV tuner.

255
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:18,232
Speaker 1: You know the kids have so much electronic shit the game gear TV turn.

256
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,034
Speaker 0: It won't work anymore.

257
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,237
Speaker 0: Today's February 17th.

258
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:33,246
Speaker 0: Oh my god We have to make a digital game gear TV tutor, I know it's done, you know, the saddest thing is I Desperately wanted one of those.

259
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,180
Speaker 0: I had a game gear and every day I was like mom can I have the TV tuner?

260
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,257
Speaker 1: She's like no It's a kid had that at summer camp the best possible place to have.

261
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:42,184
Speaker 0: Oh my god That kid must have been a legend.

262
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:43,387
Speaker 1: We were it was summer.

263
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:46,135
Speaker 1: We were watching baseballs in summer camp.

264
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:54,420
Speaker 1: I mean heroes get remembered Baseballs, I mean, this is the place where you don't even have radios and we had baseball.

265
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,779
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

266
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:18,674
Speaker 0: now this past weekend We got you know an Xbox 360 and it's interesting because as much into gaming as we all are This was the first Xbox 360 in our in the front row crew, basically It's kind of surprising.

267
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,902
Speaker 1: I think Wyatt has one, but we never go to his house.

268
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,110
Speaker 0: So effectively he does not have one.

269
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,933
Speaker 0: I have not seen it.

270
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:24,737
Speaker 0: I cannot prove it.

271
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, he had an account.

272
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:27,730
Speaker 0: so I guess you're right.

273
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,239
Speaker 1: yeah, he has one trust, but we got one.

274
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,533
Speaker 0: Adam had one and of course we got Soul Calibur 4 and We played it.

275
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:43,950
Speaker 1: We played it a whole bunch because I didn't played it all because you and Nuri had to go home early You know, I had you know, she had to go home far away and I had to go to work today.

276
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,837
Speaker 0: It worked out for the best because we went.

277
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:49,530
Speaker 0: I mean yesterday you we basically went to dinner and got seafood and gluten.

278
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,723
Speaker 0: But we played Soul Calibur 4 and I have two things to say.

279
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:03,910
Speaker 0: I kind of want to review that game a little bit in depth later, but one Everyone sucked at it at first because we never really played three.

280
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:09,470
Speaker 0: So we were a whole version behind already and the timing and a lot of stuff has changed quite a bit.

281
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,439
Speaker 0: but one by one.

282
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,970
Speaker 0: like at first we're playing and Then suddenly Adam starts kicking all our asses and then Wyatt starts kicking everyone's asses.

283
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,934
Speaker 0: But Adam and then I start kicking everyone's asses But Wyatt as one by one.

284
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:28,231
Speaker 0: we all figured out like the gimmick or the trick or the timing for this new game And I really like Soul Calibur 4.

285
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:33,266
Speaker 0: It's a lot better than Soul Calibur 3 and I think if I play it enough it might supplant.

286
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:35,233
Speaker 0: Soul Calibur 2 is my favorite Fighting.

287
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:36,037
Speaker 1: I can't do that.

288
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,363
Speaker 0: Ah, you didn't play it.

289
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:38,006
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

290
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:38,890
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

291
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:47,330
Speaker 0: The thing is everyone in the room agreed it sucks to play a Soul Calibur game without a GameCube controller.

292
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,061
Speaker 1: Well, I mean how much different is it really?

293
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:54,433
Speaker 1: I mean you only really need the stick and For but

294
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,382
Speaker 0: as you do but the way the four buttons are

295
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,753
Speaker 1: in a diamond like every other controller Yes,

296
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:06,266
Speaker 0: but with the GameCube because of the way it was structured It was much more viscerally correct on this kind of low raw level.

297
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,149
Speaker 0: It just felt right.

298
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know you're talking about.

299
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:10,750
Speaker 0: Well, everyone seemed to agree.

300
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,870
Speaker 0: I mean half of that was the fact that everyone was used to the GameCube controller.

301
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,177
Speaker 1: I think 80% of it was.

302
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:16,644
Speaker 1: you're used to the game controller.

303
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:17,187
Speaker 0: Not just me.

304
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:17,810
Speaker 0: It was everyone.

305
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,210
Speaker 1: Well, everyone else is also used to a GameCube controller for Soul Calibur.

306
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:30,130
Speaker 1: Yes, but I think the other half of it and we kind of we were playing with some ps2 Soul Calibur people or Xbox Soul Calibur people they'll say oh the game controller is so bad.

307
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:34,380
Speaker 0: No, I've heard a lot of people say that they prefer the GameCube controller Even if they had a ps2.

308
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:35,709
Speaker 1: I never heard such a thing.

309
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:36,956
Speaker 0: I think I've heard of it.

310
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:48,720
Speaker 0: is the the difference between the way you use the thumb You can rock the thumb on the GameCube controller You have to move the thumb a little bit more and in a different way on the Xbox controller But anyway holding the Xbox controller properly.

311
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:49,323
Speaker 0: Yes.

312
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:50,066
Speaker 0: Yes.

313
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,095
Speaker 0: I am Scott good Yeah, you didn't even play it.

314
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,003
Speaker 1: I have an Xbox controller.

315
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:55,068
Speaker 1: So I know how it goes.

316
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,778
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll see you play some Soul Calibur 4.

317
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,461
Speaker 0: We'll see how you do.

318
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,134
Speaker 1: But anyway, I don't wanna play Soul Calibur 2.

319
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:02,536
Speaker 0: You know what?

320
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:03,378
Speaker 0: I kind of disagree.

321
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,790
Speaker 0: I think you just stuck in the past and you're nostalgic and it's a better game.

322
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,617
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

323
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:08,867
Speaker 0: but I have two things to say.

324
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,376
Speaker 0: one It is a better game and it is.

325
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,823
Speaker 0: it is incredibly enjoyable and it's great.

326
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:15,026
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

327
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:17,499
Speaker 0: Okay, mister Hasn't even played it ever.

328
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,808
Speaker 1: I don't need to play it.

329
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,136
Speaker 0: Okay, I I don't know.

330
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:25,868
Speaker 0: so you're saying that you're you forming an opinion on a game you've never played.

331
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,254
Speaker 0: yeah Okay, that's great.

332
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,278
Speaker 0: But what was your whole thing?

333
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,723
Speaker 0: Don't knock it till you tried it.

334
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:32,169
Speaker 1: I don't need to try it.

335
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:32,871
Speaker 0: Why not?

336
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:34,917
Speaker 1: because I have enough information about it.

337
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:38,247
Speaker 0: Okay, what is wrong Scott with Soul Calibur 4?

338
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,881
Speaker 1: It's not Soul Calibur 2.

339
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:59,408
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, the two the two things I have to say about it is that one it's a fantastic game and we had a lot of fun but to Yoda Really really feels fucked up like the Fed like we're playing fine and then someone picks Yoda and it's like ah Like no one could deal with it.

340
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:05,770
Speaker 0: But that was mitigated a little bit by the first time we played on the Star Wars stage and that was hilarious.

341
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:09,559
Speaker 0: I don't know why but that was like inexplicably hilarious.

342
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,343
Speaker 1: Where is the Star Wars stage?

343
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:24,700
Speaker 0: It's in the Bay of the Death Star Where the Bay we're like the Millennium Falcon is kept like you'll see outside star destroyers going by in a big space battle going on And it plays Star Wars music.

344
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:25,303
Speaker 1: Yeah.

345
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fantastic.

346
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:30,210
Speaker 0: But the problem is you look at Yoda and you just want to cry.

347
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, it took a while.

348
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:43,450
Speaker 1: every time we played everyone's like I swear Understand why they put Yoda on the 360 and Darth Vader on the ps3 because the ps3 is black and the Xbox 360 is green.

349
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,735
Speaker 0: I don't think that was the reason.

350
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:45,800
Speaker 1: that was definitely the reason.

351
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,170
Speaker 0: but do you do you have any evidence for that captain evidence?

352
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,378
Speaker 1: That's that's definitely the reason.

353
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,463
Speaker 0: did you can you back that up?

354
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:52,890
Speaker 1: It's obvious.

355
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:56,587
Speaker 0: Is there any evidence at all any any citation anything?

356
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,501
Speaker 1: Yes Look it up on two internets.

357
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:00,125
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

358
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:10,646
Speaker 1: but You know, I think even though as stupid as both of them are to be in that game, you know I'd rather have Darth Vader even though I'd rather have a 360 than a ps3.

359
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:13,539
Speaker 0: It just it doesn't work.

360
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,110
Speaker 1: at least Darth Vader's the same height and has a sword.

361
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,850
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you know uses a sword more like how the other Soul Calibur people use their swords.

362
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,543
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that doesn't make sense.

363
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:23,310
Speaker 1: or non swords?

364
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:27,062
Speaker 0: I am very happy that Siegfried is a good guy again, and not only is a good guy.

365
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,727
Speaker 0: He's like a super good guy.

366
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:31,652
Speaker 0: Yeah 10 he.

367
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:34,744
Speaker 0: you look at him you're like if ever there was a paladin.

368
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,410
Speaker 0: is that dude right there?

369
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,430
Speaker 1: I mean, I played Siegfried in soul edge, right?

370
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:47,230
Speaker 1: I've been playing him since and when they he became nightmare I was like, alright, I can still change him to the non nightmare costume and he's still control.

371
00:23:47,371 --> 00:23:52,535
Speaker 1: Well, well the not as nightmare costume The non nightmare at all costume.

372
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,340
Speaker 0: He's still kind of evil and messed up looking.

373
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,445
Speaker 1: No, not really.

374
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:56,886
Speaker 1: Yes.

375
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:58,410
Speaker 1: He's just a dude wearing armor.

376
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,106
Speaker 0: Anyway compared to uh Soul Calibur 4 where he's just like this gleaming Silverman.

377
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of sexy.

378
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:10,250
Speaker 1: No, yeah, but you know, he'd still controlled mostly the same way.

379
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,189
Speaker 1: You know guy with a big sword moves kind of slow good range lots of damage, you know.

380
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:18,850
Speaker 1: But having him separate from nightmare again is a bit nice.

381
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:23,483
Speaker 0: Of course, I have a newfound Rekindled love for Cervantes.

382
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:35,470
Speaker 0: I Always hated playing as him, but I learned that there's a a really cheap combo that is basically - vertical backup - vertical backup and it took a while for people to figure out a way around.

383
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:46,419
Speaker 1: Well, I think a problem we always have is that no one in our group is actually one of those really good fighting game players and if anyone like that came along we would just all lose every time and never be able to win.

384
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:55,920
Speaker 1: and so as a result like our level of fighting game play is like so in some Difficult to ascertain, you know realm.

385
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,360
Speaker 0: Yes, it most definitely is but here's the main reason Why Soul Calibur 4 is better than Soul Calibur 2.

386
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,049
Speaker 0: In 2, if you button mashed against anyone But an expert you could win like about a quarter of the time just by kind of button mashing.

387
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:14,046
Speaker 0: in 4 if you button mash you just lose like you can't win.

388
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:18,899
Speaker 0: There's no way Yeah that that that really makes the game for me.

389
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,969
Speaker 0: I like it and I I think you're just stuck in the past old man.

390
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:27,009
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I got you can have your Yoda there, you know.

391
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,179
Speaker 0: And every time someone played Yoda, you know what.

392
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:31,641
Speaker 0: you know who.

393
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,465
Speaker 1: no one else plays either link.

394
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:36,032
Speaker 1: no one plays link either Scott You know what?

395
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:40,349
Speaker 0: Also, I want to point out they added new characters and Hildy is the motherfucking business.

396
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:48,212
Speaker 1: Don't really care who needs any other characters besides the existing size of Aldo besides Siegfried slash.

397
00:25:48,232 --> 00:26:02,562
Speaker 0: But anyway, my thing of the day even though Soul Calibur 4 is far superior to Soul Calibur 2 is this collection of Characters from other video games made in Soul Calibur 4's game like character creation thing.

398
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:04,870
Speaker 1: See that's always funny when people do that shit.

399
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,004
Speaker 0: These are so well made.

400
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:07,890
Speaker 0: It is amazing.

401
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:14,070
Speaker 1: Well, you already did you know, but the vault the dancing fold those the dancing Voldos for Michael Jackson Voldos, right?

402
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:14,935
Speaker 0: This is better.

403
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:15,761
Speaker 0: This is really good.

404
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:18,476
Speaker 1: All right That it.

405
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:19,263
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

406
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:23,483
Speaker 1: All right, so Let's see, I got like a whole bunch of things of the day.

407
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:25,072
Speaker 1: I got to pick one of these All right.

408
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,918
Speaker 1: I'll pick this one here a lot.

409
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,775
Speaker 1: I don't know how long ago months many months maybe even over a year ago I don't know.

410
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:32,109
Speaker 1: I did a thing of the day.

411
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,970
Speaker 1: There was a guy named at least his internet's name was cicada at the time.

412
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:51,150
Speaker 1: He changed his internet's name to Tetix t-e-t-t-i-x, right and he made some cool ship tunes, you know, basically Original music in the style of you know, eight slash 16-bit video game music.

413
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,920
Speaker 1: You know and I liked his songs a lot.

414
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,810
Speaker 1: and is he gives away all his music's for free on his website.

415
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:57,897
Speaker 1: So I was like, hey check it out.

416
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:10,973
Speaker 1: So recently I discovered This guy made some videos on YouTube demonstrating how he makes the music using a software program called propeller heads reason and I Reason.

417
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,622
Speaker 0: well, I have a quote-unquote demo of reason right?

418
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:15,970
Speaker 1: I've known about and used reason in the past.

419
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:16,686
Speaker 1: It's you know.

420
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:28,339
Speaker 1: If you know how to use like an actual synthesizers and sequencers and all those sorts of machines To make music then you'll know how to use reason, you know Cuz basically you enter the way the software works.

421
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:35,289
Speaker 1: is it just gives you it works just like the physical devices work It just gives you a bit, you know a virtual interface.

422
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:43,210
Speaker 1: She's just like yeah ten synthesizers and sudden there's a rack and ten synthesizers appear, you know as if you actually had ten synthesizers.

423
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:47,456
Speaker 1: It's hard to say synthesizers a lot In grant in many times in a row.

424
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:53,355
Speaker 0: actually use reason a whole bunch way back at RIT when costume when I took that digital Music like composition.

425
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:57,350
Speaker 1: I mean when I had it, you know the demo I was able to make some bloops and bleeps and such.

426
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,979
Speaker 1: But I wasn't able to make really good.

427
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:06,547
Speaker 0: I made some pretty rockin Techno tracks, I must say they weren't getting you any DJ jobs.

428
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:07,270
Speaker 0: No, they weren't.

429
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:07,853
Speaker 0: No, they weren't.

430
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:08,315
Speaker 0: but they were.

431
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:10,565
Speaker 0: they were pretty rockin for what I expected.

432
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:20,099
Speaker 1: I would make yeah But he's got these videos here and he shows you how to use reason not just to you know Make music but specifically how to make.

433
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,870
Speaker 1: you know how to fake and bake right chiptunes.

434
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:27,710
Speaker 1: So if you want to like I don't know make a Megaman remix or something.

435
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:32,765
Speaker 1: You watch these videos and you should be well-prepared to make your Megaman remix in addition.

436
00:28:32,785 --> 00:28:42,692
Speaker 1: I want to point out I Recently tried out that if you don't know about this for the DS there is a program you can get called Korg DS 10.

437
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:46,166
Speaker 1: That is basically all the program is is a Korg.

438
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:54,874
Speaker 1: well to Korg Synthesizers that are identical right and you you know a little drum machine and a mixer and you know a few other things on a DS Cartridge.

439
00:28:54,914 --> 00:29:04,479
Speaker 1: so you can use your DS just to make music as if you had all this cord equipment and Not having any musical knowledge.

440
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,270
Speaker 1: just you know, sort of knowing the basic functions of these sorts of machines.

441
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,239
Speaker 1: I don't know any of the advanced functions.

442
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:16,060
Speaker 1: I was able to turn this program on Use it for like a little bit and make some music.

443
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,053
Speaker 1: that sounded kind of okay pretty quickly You know get.

444
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:25,090
Speaker 1: I made some drum loops and a little, you know synth loop and it was it was alright.

445
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:32,053
Speaker 1: So if you like to make music I and I highly recommend you get and you have a DS To go.

446
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:39,167
Speaker 0: get the Korg DS 10, whatever it is It's played with it for like I don't know five minutes and it was real fun.

447
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:44,490
Speaker 1: Yeah Essentially, you know and the main thing I have with synthesizers in general, right?

448
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,570
Speaker 1: Is it like I can get a synthesizer and a sequencer, right?

449
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:54,756
Speaker 1: And I can turn the knobs on the synthesizer to get cool sounds to come out and I give like oh, that's a cool sound That's a cool sound.

450
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:59,090
Speaker 1: right but I can't do and this is what you need to be able to do Right is you know?

451
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:07,170
Speaker 1: You know You've got it when you can imagine a sound in your mind and then turn the knobs to make that sound come out.

452
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,644
Speaker 1: That's what I need to learn how to do.

453
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:12,563
Speaker 1: go in reverse You know, I could turn the knobs and hear the sounds

454
00:30:12,804 --> 00:30:23,857
Speaker 0: my methodology with with you know Real synthesizers or with that was pretty much to sit there Make a sine wave or a square wave or something and then just mess with it until it sounded cool And then use that.

455
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,530
Speaker 1: for my see I can do that already.

456
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:31,630
Speaker 1: But I want to be able to like, you know Think up a techno song in my head and then push the buttons to make it happen.

457
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:42,041
Speaker 1: That's what I want to be able to do and I'm not anywhere near that point because I don't know half those knobs do If I don't even know what less than half the knobs do so in 1991.

458
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,703
Speaker 0: What was that long ago?

459
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:47,234
Speaker 1: 1991 how old are you?

460
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:47,836
Speaker 1: I was nine.

461
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:53,417
Speaker 0: I was also nine nine Nine I was not.

462
00:30:53,457 --> 00:31:00,144
Speaker 0: well I was nine by the point in 1991 When Sim City was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

463
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,690
Speaker 1: Oh my god, so it was out.

464
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:05,643
Speaker 1: Regular Sim City for the non Super Nintendo was out before then.

465
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,727
Speaker 0: Yeah long before.

466
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,209
Speaker 1: Oh god When did regular old Sim City come out?

467
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:09,808
Speaker 0: You know what?

468
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:22,581
Speaker 0: I have no idea because as much I was I wasn't really super into PC gaming other than didn't it originally come out for like You know the Mac The Amiga I believe really was that the first system.

469
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,910
Speaker 0: it was on Amiga and the Mac actually.

470
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,558
Speaker 0: So we were I don't know anything beyond that.

471
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:27,383
Speaker 1: We were less.

472
00:31:27,704 --> 00:31:28,790
Speaker 1: we were less than nine.

473
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is when it comes to Sim City in particular.

474
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:48,630
Speaker 0: I was not really a big PC gamer until like the quake one era like the quake 2 era mega TF team fortress all that and It wasn't really until the SNES started to fade that I became a full-on PC gamer.

475
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:55,250
Speaker 0: So I really only played like scorched earth and stunts 40 racing and you know mule and stuff like that.

476
00:31:55,812 --> 00:32:00,110
Speaker 0: But I never actually played Sim City until it came out on the Super Nintendo.

477
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:07,042
Speaker 1: I played Sim City at my friend's house I think for the first time.

478
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:14,109
Speaker 1: I must have been in middle school Right and he had you know a Mac and he had it on the floppy disk and you you put it in.

479
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:22,112
Speaker 1: No, I think he actually had an external hard drive maybe and it was the original Mac version in black and white Sim City 1 And it was.

480
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:23,458
Speaker 1: it was actually.

481
00:32:23,498 --> 00:32:28,638
Speaker 1: you know today the game is not so great But it was pretty alright back then.

482
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:32,530
Speaker 1: but you could do weird stuff like, you know use only railroads.

483
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,217
Speaker 1: That was great.

484
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:34,510
Speaker 1: You never had traffic problems.

485
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:38,190
Speaker 0: Yeah There was no reason to use roads unless you wanted those stupid casinos.

486
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:44,198
Speaker 0: Exactly what I would do is I'd build a whole bunch of roads in the middle of nowhere And then I'd bulldoze him after I got my casino.

487
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:45,523
Speaker 1: No, that's a good idea.

488
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:49,080
Speaker 0: Oh But it was Sim City.

489
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,630
Speaker 0: I didn't even get it when it came out.

490
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,170
Speaker 0: I kind of I found out about it through Nintendo power of all things.

491
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,767
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize it was on the Super Nintendo until like after but it was actually wasn't one of the release games.

492
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,704
Speaker 1: Uh No, it was a very early release.

493
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:07,580
Speaker 0: I remember that anyway It definitely was not one of the release games.

494
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,805
Speaker 0: Scott the Nintendo came out.

495
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:14,970
Speaker 0: Oh, no, wait a minute It wasn't a release game in Japan and I don't think it was actually released game in America.

496
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,085
Speaker 0: But it came out like right after.

497
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:18,052
Speaker 1: see that's what I said It was.

498
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,970
Speaker 1: it was one of the earliest releases for the Super Nintendo in the u.s.

499
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,650
Speaker 0: Yes, but the release games as I recall were games like radical psycho machine racing.

500
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,736
Speaker 0: I think wasn't a zero release game.

501
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:29,201
Speaker 0: f-zero was out right away.

502
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:37,064
Speaker 0: a pilot wing pilot wings Mario World, obviously Obviously, yeah anyway, but I remember as a kid.

503
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:49,204
Speaker 0: I wanted this game Desperately like I wanted Sim City more than any other game possibly because I owned Almost every other SNES game that was out because there weren't that many yet.

504
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:50,770
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't want it that badly.

505
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,055
Speaker 1: I think what it was is like.

506
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:56,331
Speaker 1: I played it at my friend's house pretty often and I sort of felt like if I had Wow.

507
00:33:56,452 --> 00:34:00,942
Speaker 0: in Japan the launch games were Super Mario World and f-zero.

508
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:01,664
Speaker 1: That's it.

509
00:34:01,764 --> 00:34:02,185
Speaker 0: That's it.

510
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:02,987
Speaker 0: Wow.

511
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:08,047
Speaker 0: in North America We also had pilot wings Sim City a Sim City and Gradius three.

512
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,454
Speaker 1: See I was right I didn't realize.

513
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:10,659
Speaker 0: Grady's three came out that early.

514
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,485
Speaker 1: I didn't either.

515
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:12,409
Speaker 1: Wow, that's pretty crazy.

516
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:13,956
Speaker 0: I uh my I don't know.

517
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:14,821
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm getting old.

518
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:18,553
Speaker 0: it all kind of blurs together before 1995.

519
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:24,036
Speaker 1: well put one on the evidence list of Scott's memory better than rims Okay.

520
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:24,485
Speaker 1: Yeah.

521
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:30,915
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, I didn't I didn't want Sim City that badly and I played it at my friend's house And I also.

522
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:34,630
Speaker 1: in summer camp we had color max and we were playing Sim City 2000.

523
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,202
Speaker 1: I think this must have been in like seventh or eighth grade summer team

524
00:34:38,362 --> 00:34:49,783
Speaker 0: in Starbase, which was like this local You know, it masqueraded as like a local space camp at the local self like the Air National Guard base But it was really half like super space stuff and half so.

525
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,650
Speaker 0: you want to join the Air Force, don't you don't you?

526
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,533
Speaker 0: Don't you don't you?

527
00:34:52,553 --> 00:35:07,918
Speaker 0: well, but it had some memorable times like we got to Hang out and actually use the military f-16 like fighter jet fights flight simulator Which was kind of awesome, especially because while the other kids were doing it I saw the console on the side that lets you.

528
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,987
Speaker 0: it had two buttons of interest button.

529
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,860
Speaker 0: one was cockpit fire button.

530
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:16,706
Speaker 0: two was irrecoverable cockpit fire.

531
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:22,990
Speaker 0: All I can say is that that button got hit a whole bunch of times before people figured out what I was doing.

532
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:24,254
Speaker 1: So that was.

533
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:27,124
Speaker 1: it's possible to have a cockpit fire that's recoverable.

534
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:32,218
Speaker 1: apparently I Mean you're sitting in this thing.

535
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,389
Speaker 1: I don't imagine there's a lot of room in there, right?

536
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,819
Speaker 0: It moved around in like full six degrees.

537
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,667
Speaker 0: It was like it was like afterburner times ten.

538
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:43,930
Speaker 1: It was a yeah Yeah, you know, but even then right the graphics I mean in the early 90s or whatever.

539
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,864
Speaker 1: Probably we're not even as good as like the we they're probably.

540
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:53,144
Speaker 1: it was all blocky Got a horizon look like it looked like virtual virtual racing.

541
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:53,586
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

542
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:55,694
Speaker 0: No, it was black and white Really?

543
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:56,860
Speaker 0: Whoa on the screen.

544
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,670
Speaker 0: You got a horizon line and vectors Whoa, so worse than virtual raising but it made up for that by having a full f-16 cockpit.

545
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not to diss virtual racing.

546
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,403
Speaker 1: I love virtual racing.

547
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:08,367
Speaker 0: That game is awesome.

548
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:10,537
Speaker 0: Yeah That's one of the best racing games ever.

549
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:11,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

550
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:14,713
Speaker 0: Oh my god, but We play.

551
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:21,314
Speaker 0: we didn't even have SimCity, but we played this ghetto like sim moon base game Just about moon bases.

552
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:24,063
Speaker 0: Let me tell you that game was broken.

553
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:31,409
Speaker 0: I had to make roads on the moon But there were no cars on the moon and apparently the roads didn't even do anything.

554
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,050
Speaker 0: Wow, there were a lot of like bad ports and people trying to make like SimCity games that were terrible.

555
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:43,106
Speaker 0: And I remember someone ported SimCity the ti-85, but it basically didn't work.

556
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,370
Speaker 0: and so yeah, I was gonna happen.

557
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:50,030
Speaker 1: No, so I played SimCity 2000 at summer camp, right and that's mostly when we were there.

558
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:58,650
Speaker 1: You didn't have a lot of time at a computer at once and your save games, you know It was a crapshoot if they'd be there the next time or if you'd be sitting at the same computer the next time.

559
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,264
Speaker 1: So, you know, I mean it was a summer camp computer lab in the in the.

560
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:05,077
Speaker 1: you know, early to mid 90s It was SimCity 2000.

561
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:06,325
Speaker 0: That's highfalutin.

562
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,170
Speaker 1: I know right.

563
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,420
Speaker 1: So you're lucky if you could play it at all.

564
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:14,052
Speaker 1: and pretty much all we did there is we would always type in the code And the code.

565
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:20,670
Speaker 1: yeah, the code for SimCity 2000 on the Mac was porn tips gazardo if anyone remembers that.

566
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:21,590
Speaker 0: See I went the other way.

567
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,484
Speaker 0: I did the more complicated thing where you do a bunch of stuff and you type.

568
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:32,631
Speaker 0: so that wasn't on the Mac that was on The Windows version, but then you get a negative interest bond and that just gives you money to do all the stuff you want To do.

569
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:35,510
Speaker 1: well, you would open up the debug menu and you could do whatever you wanted in there.

570
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,354
Speaker 0: You could do that too.

571
00:37:36,535 --> 00:37:39,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's also that the DOS code.

572
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,796
Speaker 1: That was the one we had to like.

573
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:46,725
Speaker 1: click click in all these different places, you know It is, you know specific sequence of some kind and whatever.

574
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:47,650
Speaker 0: but it was weird.

575
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:54,176
Speaker 0: I like games like this really like they show to me the progression of myself as a gamer.

576
00:37:54,537 --> 00:38:05,789
Speaker 0: nothing really kind of elucidates how far I have come as a gamer in terms of skill and aptitude and What I consider cheating or not or what I consider fair or not or what utility I get from a game.

577
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:12,810
Speaker 0: Then playing games that I played as a child when I'm older and have more reason and experience and knowledge.

578
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:21,995
Speaker 0: Mmm, because when I first played SimCity It was kind of like when I first played games like Simon's Quest or Zelda or a lot of games Not Zelda but Zelda 2 specifically.

579
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:28,935
Speaker 0: I was often very bad at those games and part of it was because I didn't analyze the games I kind of just played.

580
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:40,762
Speaker 0: like when I played SimCity like I knew I would come up with basic strategies Like I don't like pollution So I'm gonna build all my industrial stuff around the outside edge Because then some of the pollution is gonna go off the map and it doesn't count.

581
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:41,304
Speaker 0: Hooray.

582
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:42,630
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good thinking.

583
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:44,057
Speaker 0: That was like my first thinking.

584
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:54,450
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but I would have these weird utilities Like I would go after certain things and I wanted like big blocks of buildings that parks everywhere And I would never like analyze the game and play optimally.

585
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:01,190
Speaker 0: So the game in a way was more fun at first because there was a lot of replay value and cities would rise and fail.

586
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:11,790
Speaker 0: And I remember one moment in particular where this is when my mother decided that video games were Amazingly advanced was when I was playing and I ran out of money and I was patient inpatient.

587
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,030
Speaker 0: So I raised taxes like 20% and all the people started leaving my city.

588
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:19,550
Speaker 0: And I was like mom all the people are leaving my city and she's like did you do anything?

589
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,958
Speaker 0: And I look well, I raised the taxes and she was like wow What's that tell you about the world?

590
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:26,849
Speaker 0: I was like that I shouldn't raise taxes.

591
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,057
Speaker 1: No, that's I had the same kind of experience.

592
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,890
Speaker 1: I mean when I would play Sim City without cheating right I would try.

593
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:36,847
Speaker 1: You know, there were some strategies I used like I knew that.

594
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:43,250
Speaker 1: you know If I put a zone any square of zone zoned land that was too far from a road wouldn't develop, right?

595
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,290
Speaker 1: So what I did is I you know, still I wanted to make bigger blocks.

596
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:55,050
Speaker 1: so what I did is I made bigger blocks of Zoneage like I'd make a residential that's so big that the middle ones wouldn't develop.

597
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:59,769
Speaker 1: But then in the middle I would always put forests or parks or something like that.

598
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:00,532
Speaker 1: Right.

599
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:08,583
Speaker 1: that way all the residentials would be near parks But they would also all be near enough to the road to build and I would just.

600
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:13,390
Speaker 1: basically I would always go for something You know other than strategies like that.

601
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:21,000
Speaker 1: You know put a police station every so often so the whole map is covered with police and put a fire station every so often And those sorts of things right.

602
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:25,694
Speaker 1: other than that I went for like what was aesthetically pleasing to me You know, I liked.

603
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:33,630
Speaker 1: I like grids and I liked, you know I'd have a highway right up the middle and across the other middle and highway couldn't build a highway in Sim City.

604
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:38,698
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about Sim City 2000. highways were useless though I know right, but I went for.

605
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,024
Speaker 1: I wanted to be aesthetically.

606
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:41,430
Speaker 1: I like seeing that big highway.

607
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,730
Speaker 1: They just go all the way across in a straight line, you know.

608
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:55,345
Speaker 1: And yeah I liked having to connect to the neighboring cities and then I would always customize the map to be perfectly flat With a flat coastline so I could build everything completely straight and

609
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:55,846
Speaker 0: then

610
00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:06,470
Speaker 1: I would put water exactly so I could put the water pumps in a grid and get the most water from the water pumps in the fewest in the smallest possible Space and it would be just enough water.

611
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:13,034
Speaker 0: That was part of the big problem with Sim City 2000 just enough water to give everyone in the whole city water The the optimal.

612
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:21,301
Speaker 0: if you're gonna play that way what you had to do was make a giant pyramid waterfall And cover it with hydro plants, oh you did that way.

613
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:23,610
Speaker 1: so I just built like, you know the fusion plant.

614
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,250
Speaker 0: I did that once and at the top was my mansion.

615
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:27,956
Speaker 0: No, I built.

616
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:31,710
Speaker 1: I just build two fusion plants next to each other and then that would be it.

617
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,930
Speaker 0: You could power the home get a fusion plant right away unless it cheated.

618
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:43,662
Speaker 1: Well, you know eventually you just you know You keep going for it and going for it and going for it and then eventually right you Get the city to a point where it's profitable.

619
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:51,850
Speaker 1: you set it on cheetah and since you know 486 100 megahertz you just go to bed and wake up and you have a bajillion dollars and then you build two fusion plants.

620
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,270
Speaker 0: See, I guess part of the problem was that I would play these games.

621
00:41:54,490 --> 00:42:04,590
Speaker 0: I didn't really analyze them that much but I would start to fall into the mysticism of gaming in the days before you could easily Find answers to the core mathematical questions of how a game works.

622
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:08,907
Speaker 0: Like I would wonder the launch our colleges really launch know more things like.

623
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:11,900
Speaker 0: alright I have residential industrial and commercial.

624
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,910
Speaker 0: how far apart can they actually be?

625
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,320
Speaker 0: How much do things need to be connected by roads?

626
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:17,545
Speaker 0: Where do I need roads?

627
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,689
Speaker 0: What do the trains do?

628
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,769
Speaker 0: specifically does it matter where that train is because often the train would get stuck somewhere and like if I have two Discontiguous sets of roads does that matter?

629
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:37,370
Speaker 0: And I've wondered about all these things and I started to figure them out bit by bit Like I realized eventually things that really were dumb like a police station didn't need access to roads.

630
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:44,166
Speaker 0: So I would build like nine grids You know three by three of like residential and in the middle where there was I couldn't.

631
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,582
Speaker 0: Road couldn't get there So I couldn't put a residential.

632
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:47,389
Speaker 0: it would never build up.

633
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:51,930
Speaker 0: I'd put the police station there or the fire station there to maximize my space usage

634
00:42:52,231 --> 00:42:52,733
Speaker 1: mmm,

635
00:42:53,114 --> 00:43:05,010
Speaker 0: and as I went on I optimized and optimized and figured out all the math and everything of the game and Then one day I realized that the game was stupid because I had solved it and all I was doing was implementing my perfect algorithm.

636
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:14,335
Speaker 0: And as long as my city was always profitable All I had to do was let the game wait until I had enough money to do exactly what I wanted to do And there was no more game.

637
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:17,403
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the whole game right is?

638
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:26,610
Speaker 1: there are is that the rules are secret You know, it's like if let's say SimCity was a board game But it was exactly the same game with the exact same rules, right?

639
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:32,924
Speaker 1: the only thing is that you did it all by hand with you know, you figured out your money with a paper and a pencil right and Such.

640
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:46,972
Speaker 1: then there would be an instruction book and the instruction book would say, you know If there is a space of land that is X spaces away from the police station Then it's crime will be equal to such and such and such.

641
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:53,997
Speaker 1: and the only reason SimCity was challenging it All was because you didn't have that instruction book because it was kept secret from you.

642
00:43:54,057 --> 00:44:09,520
Speaker 1: I mean you knew Generally that a police station Decreases crime and you know if farther away from police stations you get the more crime there is that you knew that Generally, but you didn't know the specific details of exactly how much crime exactly what radius.

643
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:21,432
Speaker 1: So you didn't know if that you bear building too many police stations if they were too close to each other if they were too Far, but if you knew that information and it was you know, then the game would be Trivially stupid.

644
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:27,762
Speaker 1: you would just know Oh I need to build these many police stations exactly these many spaces apart and that's the best way to Do at the end.

645
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:33,866
Speaker 0: and I guess the trouble with the regular SimCity was that because the game had these rules But at the same time it was simple.

646
00:44:34,669 --> 00:44:37,160
Speaker 0: You could solve the rules and then there was no more game.

647
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,264
Speaker 0: It wasn't even a game of like.

648
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:42,680
Speaker 0: create an interesting equilibrium because the game was simple enough to where it all kind of petered out.

649
00:44:43,362 --> 00:44:49,522
Speaker 1: Yeah, then if you do play the game without cheating and without waiting overnight to get a million dollars Then you do.

650
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,728
Speaker 1: you don't just have the implementation of the algorithm.

651
00:44:52,748 --> 00:45:04,716
Speaker 1: You also have to sort of Transfer between these equilibrium states of like, you know, you know equilibrium state small city equilibrium state slightly larger city equilibrium state slightly larger city.

652
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:16,100
Speaker 1: and if you in the course of growing the city out where you know ended up in a non-equilibrium state you can get stuck and run out of money and have to pull back and then go out again or You could screw up everything and it would.

653
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,158
Speaker 1: you know, basically there might not be a way to fix it And you know that posed a slight challenge.

654
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:25,310
Speaker 1: but still it really comes down to the fact that a lot of the rules were secret.

655
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:47,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at least with SimCity 2000 despite the fact that by then I bought a book that explained everything as I was done with That BS and I didn't want to figure it out on my own but not so much so I could like cheat or whatever but just so I could know the rules of the game going in and Thus I could work on the more interesting things like making aesthetically pleasing cities that worked.

656
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:50,805
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and that was a lot more fun because the game was more complex.

657
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:56,029
Speaker 0: so I could make a Realistic city like I could make the subdivision I lived in and it kind of worked.

658
00:45:56,938 --> 00:46:00,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda Actually where I lived it worked really well.

659
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:02,750
Speaker 0: The thing is I live in a very SimCity looking place.

660
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is the SimCity 2000.

661
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:11,395
Speaker 0: you always end up with just a screen full of arcologies and then what well that that's the Problem that everyone playing Wow has to.

662
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:16,832
Speaker 0: eventually you hit the end game and the end game of SimCity is you have built a launch Arcology.

663
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:26,410
Speaker 0: now you wait until you have enough money and you build another launch arcology and eventually you have all launch Arcologies in a perfect grid and then two fusion planets in the bottom, right?

664
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know the.

665
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:31,083
Speaker 1: I think the dark ology was more aesthetically pleasing.

666
00:46:31,143 --> 00:46:35,457
Speaker 1: the launch arcology was all black and sort of Industrial shit living.

667
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:36,161
Speaker 1: No.

668
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,427
Speaker 1: No, that was like this deed.

669
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:41,426
Speaker 1: the second one I'm talking about the one right under the launch arcology the cool Blade Runner looking.

670
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:44,600
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You know the dark o Arco it was.

671
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,569
Speaker 1: it was like I had all sorts of lights all over it.

672
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,822
Speaker 1: Industrial one was like the one with the UFO on top of it, right?

673
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:51,489
Speaker 1: or was that the forest one?

674
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:52,873
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

675
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,227
Speaker 1: I don't remember either but the dark o was like awesome looking cuz I never cuz.

676
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:56,669
Speaker 1: it was like.

677
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:02,307
Speaker 1: it was like Yeah, welcome to the evil Empire, but the launch arcology was like we have a happy glass dome.

678
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,512
Speaker 1: It looked like a Gundam Colony.

679
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:08,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of ignored those things because at that point the game was no longer interesting.

680
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:08,890
Speaker 0: I'd start over.

681
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:14,832
Speaker 0: The real trouble was that the other way to make the game interesting was to introduce Disasters.

682
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:17,139
Speaker 0: but in Sim City, they were never fun.

683
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,630
Speaker 0: They just sucked and there was no like interesting way to combat them.

684
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:25,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, it basically just delayed your eventual victory or defeat on Sim City 2000.

685
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:27,530
Speaker 1: There were some fun disaster kind of thing.

686
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:33,550
Speaker 0: Well the fact that you could deal with like the Coast Guard and the firemen and the police exactly around the rioters.

687
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, the riots are pretty fun because you put the police around the rioters if you had a riot and then they would start A fire.

688
00:47:38,612 --> 00:47:44,275
Speaker 1: so you need to also bring out the firemen and if you're lucky enough to have the military base You could deploy the military.

689
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:47,105
Speaker 1: They were real helpful if like the alien came or something.

690
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:48,410
Speaker 1: That was good times.

691
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:51,940
Speaker 0: Well, the trouble I had there was that I would never like.

692
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:09,090
Speaker 0: I always turned random disasters off because that was I know right But I would be playing and I'd be doing fine I have a big city and then inexplicably I would suddenly decide to destroy that city and I would and I would just activate like Every disaster five times and then just let it all fall apart and then turn the game off.

693
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, if there's a god I hope he doesn't play the world the way I played Sim City.

694
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:26,174
Speaker 1: either that or I would like, you know I'd build a giant city or load up a giant city save game And I just let it go and then turn on all the disasters and just play the disaster fighting game because the city Managing game was done.

695
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:26,676
Speaker 0: Yeah.

696
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:30,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why you don't want to play the rebuilding game exactly exactly.

697
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:31,461
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

698
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:34,255
Speaker 0: Sim City I feel like a game like now.

699
00:48:34,335 --> 00:48:36,484
Speaker 0: I really enjoy Civ 4 and I think part of it's that.

700
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:46,980
Speaker 0: the kind of game like that that I can enjoy is The game where there is emergent behavior and I'm directing that emergent behavior to some degree But not completely like.

701
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:59,549
Speaker 0: I want a guy to civilization but I want the Interactions in the game to be complex enough to where I can't a hundred percent predict the outcome of what I'm going to do And I just I want to see interesting things happen as a result of my small changes.

702
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:10,370
Speaker 0: Mmm, I basically want a complex state machine that relies Heavily upon what I do with a kind of you know snowball effect in terms of randomness like strange attractors.

703
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is something.

704
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:12,938
Speaker 1: is that in Sim City.

705
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:22,070
Speaker 1: You didn't really have a lot of happenings other than disasters Like, you know, I mean the news stories really were just either good or bad.

706
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:23,168
Speaker 1: You didn't really you know.

707
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:24,199
Speaker 1: There wasn't.

708
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:31,510
Speaker 1: lots of you know Strange and interesting things that could occur and that you couldn't relate them directly to anything you did.

709
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:39,341
Speaker 1: It was sort of just like, you know, the news articles basically like, you know complaining about crime And it's just the crime meter going, you know up.

710
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:41,150
Speaker 1: so you had to build more police stations.

711
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:48,782
Speaker 1: You know, there wasn't sort of like this direct thing of like, you know, oh You you know bulldoze that thing.

712
00:49:48,843 --> 00:49:56,690
Speaker 1: and now therefore, you know There's a riot because of that thing and it the riot is in that area and you didn't have things going on like that.

713
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,194
Speaker 1: so It didn't really you couldn't.

714
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:04,630
Speaker 1: there wasn't a lot of you know connection between the things you did and then the things that happened.

715
00:50:05,192 --> 00:50:05,413
Speaker 0: Yep.

716
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,422
Speaker 0: Well like Sim Earth was the worst for that.

717
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:12,423
Speaker 0: I mean I played all these Sim games and Sim Earth like was just inexplicable.

718
00:50:12,463 --> 00:50:14,090
Speaker 0: Like I had no idea what was going on.

719
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,201
Speaker 1: I had no idea how to play that game and I had no instructions.

720
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:21,110
Speaker 0: I understood the science Like you said the atmosphere and the cloud cover and all those things.

721
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:27,090
Speaker 0: But what happened on the planet never seemed to have anything to do with what I did to the planet.

722
00:50:27,713 --> 00:50:30,728
Speaker 1: Well, I mean look at another look at the other sim games like sim ant.

723
00:50:30,848 --> 00:50:31,009
Speaker 1: right.

724
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,777
Speaker 1: sim Ant was like this great game and it was.

725
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,450
Speaker 1: the thing is the beginning of that game was so fun.

726
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,410
Speaker 1: You were this one ant and you would go and get food and you'd make more ants, right?

727
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,436
Speaker 1: You go and get some food and make some more.

728
00:50:41,516 --> 00:50:46,210
Speaker 0: it was fun except for the fact that again nothing you did really matter.

729
00:50:46,571 --> 00:50:46,993
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

730
00:50:47,013 --> 00:51:00,780
Speaker 1: is the things you did early mattered because you could at the beginning if you screwed up you could fail To you know succeed right but as soon as you got one that one ant colony going really strong It was pretty much invincible and would do its own thing.

731
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:13,669
Speaker 1: So then all you would do is you would send ants to the adjacent square of the map Right and then you would do the same thing again only would take you a lot less time and now you would have two squares of the map under solid control.

732
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:19,650
Speaker 1: Once you had two squares of the map under solid control, you never needed to control the ants again.

733
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:23,230
Speaker 1: All you did was say yeah send the flying ants to the next square.

734
00:51:23,853 --> 00:51:32,410
Speaker 1: You waited send the flying ants to the next square wait And eventually you just clicked on every square until you controlled the entire, you know backyard and the house.

735
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,545
Speaker 1: And the thing is obviously that wasn't the way the game was intended to be played.

736
00:51:36,585 --> 00:51:48,909
Speaker 1: because like if you actually Controlled the ants in the house, you know, it was cool You'd be like crawling on the stove or on the grill or you know The kitchen counter and the lawnmower and the dog and all these things going on.

737
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:58,690
Speaker 1: But just by you know sending, you know, the reproductive ants to the next square, you know You send enough of them and you're gonna take it over no matter what's going on over there.

738
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,994
Speaker 1: You never have to look at that stuff.

739
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:13,016
Speaker 1: So obviously the mechanics of the game sort of defeated the design and The game was you know, it's like they had this fun game, but then you didn't actually have to play the fun game Because you had all those meters.

740
00:52:13,056 --> 00:52:17,070
Speaker 0: like exactly should you be digging tunnels more or doing this more or doing that?

741
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,082
Speaker 1: It's sort of like that total war Shogun II game that people talk about right?

742
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:21,363
Speaker 1: It's like.

743
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:27,843
Speaker 1: I remember that game had this cool RTS kind of mode Rita, you know control these armies and formations and things.

744
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:32,098
Speaker 1: but when I see people actually play the game Like they don't actually do that.

745
00:52:32,158 --> 00:52:38,810
Speaker 1: They do that maybe in the beginning but then for the rest of the game They just play on the big map, you know saying yeah attack this next area.

746
00:52:39,172 --> 00:52:43,370
Speaker 1: Okay attack this next area and not actually doing the real-time strategy part.

747
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,334
Speaker 1: It just does itself.

748
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:46,864
Speaker 1: and that's sort of the same thing to happen with sim ant.

749
00:52:46,984 --> 00:52:52,789
Speaker 1: is they had this cool ant Controlling game that you didn't have to actually play once you did it a little bit.

750
00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:57,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, and sim earth again just didn't make any sense and it really I don't know.

751
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,110
Speaker 0: It's difficult to strike this balance between a game or you have full control.

752
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:05,474
Speaker 0: But then if the game expands at all, you're now micromanaging a bunch of crap You don't care about.

753
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:10,302
Speaker 0: like a lot of like even Civ 4 gets to that point We're just I don't want to micromanage all the crap.

754
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:11,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to deal with it.

755
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:12,675
Speaker 0: I'm done.

756
00:53:12,695 --> 00:53:19,949
Speaker 0: at least in Civ 4 I could split off the Eastern Greek Empire into the Byzantine Empire and they'll just be friendly to me.

757
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:27,957
Speaker 1: Well, I think you know what you really need to do, you know in a game like that And I there might be a game that does this, you know I haven't seen one yet right?

758
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,510
Speaker 1: is you want to make the you know, bring the game bigger, right?

759
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:31,912
Speaker 1: You want to.

760
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:34,970
Speaker 1: you want to sort of zoom out and then play a different game, right?

761
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,958
Speaker 1: So something like Civ 4 right.

762
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:48,510
Speaker 1: the way you could do this is I know in Civ 4 you can group units Right, but let's say for example in Civ 4 when you get beyond the point of having just a few cities, right?

763
00:53:49,153 --> 00:53:53,750
Speaker 1: it could zoom out and Just be like, okay forget cities, right?

764
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:57,783
Speaker 1: Those three cities over there are now a state and these three cities are a state.

765
00:53:57,803 --> 00:53:59,650
Speaker 1: you only manage the states.

766
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,458
Speaker 1: You don't micromanage the cities at all.

767
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:06,218
Speaker 0: You know, basically I can sum this up What Spore should have been but wasn't right.

768
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:18,755
Speaker 1: and then right instead of building say a battleship You can't just build a battleship anymore You tell the state to build a naval fleet and then you control one naval fleet, you know And you sort of.

769
00:54:18,815 --> 00:54:21,029
Speaker 1: and then if you need to zoom out even more, right?

770
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:28,710
Speaker 1: It's you have a planet or the country right and you just click on the other country and you're still playing a complex game.

771
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,529
Speaker 1: It's just as you know.

772
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:47,030
Speaker 1: The game you're playing grows and grows and as you get ahead and you have too many small things Just group all the small things up into a bigger thing and zoom out and now you're playing the same game again Only with you know different graphics to make you to give you the feeling that you're playing it on a bigger scale.

773
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:55,187
Speaker 0: yep, and no, I don't think anyone's really done that yet because otherwise you have either the super micromanage or the Options you choose don't actually make a difference.

774
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:00,706
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically what it would be like it's really no different than starting the game over right?

775
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:01,930
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

776
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,416
Speaker 1: You know you place it for right?

777
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:04,259
Speaker 1: I got one city.

778
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:05,424
Speaker 1: I'm playing this game right.

779
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:11,910
Speaker 1: when we zoom out It's sort of like I'm starting the game over with like back to one city because I'm down to like one state.

780
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,899
Speaker 0: But no, it's more that you start on.

781
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:16,490
Speaker 0: you start the next game or the next stage of the game.

782
00:55:16,972 --> 00:55:23,396
Speaker 0: But what you start with and what options you have depends upon how you beat the first game and the color of that Depends upon that.

783
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:24,362
Speaker 0: I don't know.

784
00:55:24,423 --> 00:55:25,590
Speaker 0: I really more and more.

785
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:31,494
Speaker 0: I just like to see the emergent behavior And I like to see what happens in the rest of the world even the stuff I wasn't doing anything with.

786
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:31,795
Speaker 0: like.

787
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:35,730
Speaker 0: I love nothing more than watching Tokugawa go to war with someone.

788
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:39,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want to play dwarf fortress because dwarf fortress.

789
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,290
Speaker 0: It's so obtuse to watch and control.

790
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,173
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

791
00:55:43,294 --> 00:55:45,422
Speaker 1: it has all those things, but it doesn't.

792
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,229
Speaker 1: the user interface is just so terrible.

793
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:49,623
Speaker 0: well Also, there's the problem of demystification.

794
00:55:50,167 --> 00:56:00,216
Speaker 0: I know Knowing that Dwarf fortress is actually very simple under the covers and most of the CPU utilization and all that is caused primarily by Poor programming.

795
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:07,590
Speaker 1: well, it's not about the CPU utilization It's the fact that you know regardless of the fact that it's programmed poorly in the user interface is bad.

796
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:12,207
Speaker 1: It does have this emergent behavior going on, but it's not worth getting to.

797
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:16,990
Speaker 0: it's so Obtuse and the controls are so bad and the interface is so unreasonable.

798
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:24,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if someone just took the game and actually put a real interface on it and programmed it properly that would be it.

799
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:27,030
Speaker 0: Yes, it would but it's not it's not.

800
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:29,738
Speaker 0: I wish it could be.

801
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:30,862
Speaker 1: yeah, it can be.

802
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:31,564
Speaker 0: I mean for now.

803
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:32,026
Speaker 0: I'm stuck.

804
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:40,630
Speaker 1: You know I've got what sim earth Yeah Sim or the CEO speaking of which actually one of the better sim games least what I think is sim tower.

805
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,038
Speaker 0: But sim tower was crap suck.

806
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,486
Speaker 1: and the thing is people don't realize.

807
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,472
Speaker 1: you know all these a lot of these other Sim games.

808
00:56:47,492 --> 00:56:53,290
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which ones are made by will right and which ones weren't but sim tower was actually a Japanese game.

809
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:57,990
Speaker 1: Just called the tower and they bought it and brought it to the US and called it sim tower.

810
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:58,773
Speaker 1: But it really it was.

811
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,801
Speaker 1: it's a Japanese game, and they have it on like.

812
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:02,950
Speaker 1: it's actually really popular in Japan.

813
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:05,982
Speaker 1: It's still like there's a DS version of it in Japan called.

814
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,572
Speaker 1: You know the tower and such and such It's.

815
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:15,250
Speaker 1: you know it's still played over there a lot, and you know It wasn't like the best sim game in the universe.

816
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,690
Speaker 1: It wasn't like Sim City 2000. good, but I still kind of liked it.

817
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:25,390
Speaker 1: The only thing that bothered me was that you sort of had to you know build the tower like so wide.

818
00:57:25,831 --> 00:57:39,210
Speaker 1: It was really hard to keep it aesthetically nice and also a lot of the game boiled down to elevator Management, and it's like they had these arbitrary limitations like how many elevators you could have and how you could set them in such.

819
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:49,250
Speaker 1: There's pretty much no way to make a tower with a lot of good stuff in it and also have elevators that were smooth You know and in traffic free because of those limitations.

820
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,816
Speaker 0: Yeah well plus Problems with games like that.

821
00:57:51,856 --> 00:58:02,121
Speaker 0: in general for me now is that I when I was younger and had more free time to just dabble I could just play you know open simulation style games forever But I don't have that much interest in them anymore.

822
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,610
Speaker 0: and a game like like anytime.

823
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:06,258
Speaker 0: The way to progress.

824
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:13,390
Speaker 0: in a game the only thing preventing me from progressing is Letting the game run by itself and build up a bunch of money and then coming back and doing something.

825
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:17,452
Speaker 0: That's like playing Wow I got to just wait before I can do the next thing I want to do.

826
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:21,630
Speaker 1: well at least in Wow right you can click faster to get more money, right?

827
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,863
Speaker 1: You can go to a field somewhere and kill rats or whatever you kill in.

828
00:58:24,904 --> 00:58:28,315
Speaker 1: Wow you know and Tower was just tower.

829
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:29,259
Speaker 1: all you can do is wait.

830
00:58:29,862 --> 00:58:31,067
Speaker 1: It was basically as long.

831
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:33,155
Speaker 1: at least today We have faster CPUs.

832
00:58:33,396 --> 00:58:36,710
Speaker 1: you could put it on cheetah mode and get a zillion dollars like three seconds.

833
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:43,352
Speaker 0: Sim tower was just a draw a fun tower game coupled with progress quest Kinda.

834
00:58:43,473 --> 00:58:45,670
Speaker 0: every time progress quest hit a certain level you came back.

835
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:54,289
Speaker 1: You don't have money to do the stuff you wanted to do yeah But I mean there were some things you sort of had to plan out like if you put certain things too close to each other They would be in trouble.

836
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:58,303
Speaker 1: It's like you had to also sort of plan things out in a certain way.

837
00:58:58,323 --> 00:59:09,897
Speaker 1: you had to have enough maids for the hotel and have the service elevator for the maids and Make sure the maids weren't too close to the actual hotel rooms because then the people there would get mad that make the maids are Making too much noise too much noise.

838
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:10,720
Speaker 0: I think it's.

839
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,630
Speaker 0: how dare the maids be living outside of the side?

840
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:13,815
Speaker 1: I know.

841
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:19,930
Speaker 1: Meanwhile you go to a real hotel the maids have a little room on every single floor right there.

842
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:22,009
Speaker 1: You can see them, and it doesn't bother anybody.

843
00:59:23,014 --> 00:59:24,610
Speaker 1: You know it made no sense whatsoever.

844
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:27,079
Speaker 1: It was also cool to like.

845
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,110
Speaker 1: you know some of that game.

846
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,325
Speaker 1: It just made you manage like you'd build a movie theater.

847
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:37,169
Speaker 1: to make money You had to keep going into the movie theater and buying new movies to show all the time.

848
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:40,910
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like up keeping all these different little things around.

849
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,753
Speaker 1: And I don't know.

850
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:44,061
Speaker 1: the other thing about that game is that base?

851
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,870
Speaker 1: is that you could build residential like apartments?

852
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,030
Speaker 1: But it was completely stupid to do so because it was really hard to keep people in them.

853
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:55,987
Speaker 1: They made so much less money than hotels and offices ever did so I just never built them at all.

854
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,374
Speaker 1: no There's no reason to.

855
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:03,510
Speaker 0: I can't say though that I spent a lot of time playing SimCity 2000 back in the day.

856
01:00:03,695 --> 01:00:16,210
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I would often have like SimCity 2000 going in one window And I'd have like Civ 2 going in another window And I would just play one while the other one was in the background on whatever speed it could manage building up money.

857
01:00:16,531 --> 01:00:18,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, so SimCity be in the background.

858
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,586
Speaker 0: I'll be playing Civ 2.

859
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:21,930
Speaker 0: I'd be listening to music I'd be chatting on IM.

860
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:28,209
Speaker 0: It was like not none of those games could ever Occupy my soul attention at any time.

861
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:35,957
Speaker 0: there was never a point when I could just be playing Civ 2 or just be playing SimCity and be enjoying it because So much of the time was.

862
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:39,070
Speaker 0: I'd already decided what I wanted to do and now my brain was idle while my hand did it.

863
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:52,690
Speaker 0: So I would like do all these things at the same time And I don't know I. the only reason I don't do that more is that now games like that are too complex to do that But yet still not complex enough to completely get my attention.

864
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah like Civ 4 I have to pay a lot more attention to.

865
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,628
Speaker 0: I can only like listen to a podcast and play.

866
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:02,314
Speaker 0: I can't Also be chatting with people Mm-hmm.

867
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,171
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

868
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:11,134
Speaker 1: I just I got SimCity on my iPhone and it's basically the same thing as SimCity 2000 a little different.

869
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:17,890
Speaker 0: I I played a couple of Sim cities after SimCity 2000 a little and I'd the spark never came back.

870
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:19,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

871
01:01:19,757 --> 01:01:20,640
Speaker 1: I think is there a 4000?

872
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,427
Speaker 1: I know there's a 3000.

873
01:01:22,427 --> 01:01:23,190
Speaker 0: there was another one.

874
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,812
Speaker 1: There's probably just been called SimCity 4 I don't even know.

875
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:33,999
Speaker 1: but I know I played 3000 for like a little bit and like I think they added like Trash, you know trucks and things like that.

876
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:40,686
Speaker 0: But yeah, well, I remember SimCity 2000 added the water Even though the water worked in inexplicable and often stupid ways.

877
01:01:41,027 --> 01:01:46,210
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it didn't make a lot and the subways that suck to draw completely and just were a pain in the ass.

878
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:50,670
Speaker 1: I always did the subways but because I always had a perfect grid it was easy to do the subways.

879
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:56,101
Speaker 1: I would just put you know a subway Station on every single block corner since the blocks are big.

880
01:01:56,141 --> 01:02:00,689
Speaker 1: remember because they I would always put the parks and forests in the middle Of the blocks so the blocks are big.

881
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:09,956
Speaker 1: I would put one subway station on like the southeast corner of every intersection and then I drew this big grid of green subway tunnels Under the ground and that was it.

882
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:12,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course if you're playing the game legit, the subway is so expensive.

883
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:18,430
Speaker 1: You can only build tiny bits at a time and then you had to wait Yep, and then you would just build the next one and wait and build the next one.

884
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:38,250
Speaker 1: The thing was if there was like a big Like structure on the corner I had to bulldoze that whole structure build the one subway square for the station and then you know The the structure would rebuild sort of around it and it would sometimes prevent, you know Three by three or four by four structures from being on the corner.

885
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:56,670
Speaker 0: Actually, one thing I remember kind of randomly is that in SimCity regular SimCity at least on the SNES if If a fire started somewhere and destroyed like three like parts of a zone like an airport or anything After you bulldozed it you could build something else there before it came back.

886
01:02:57,794 --> 01:03:04,150
Speaker 0: Mmm, so you could build like, you know A three block by three block residential zone because they were all like what this blocks in SimCity.

887
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:10,729
Speaker 0: You could then bulldoze like one whole side of it and overlap another residential zone and then you just get houses there.

888
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:14,068
Speaker 0: Mmm, I don't know what effect that had on the math of the game.

889
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:15,893
Speaker 0: You can do it.

890
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:17,499
Speaker 1: You sure wasn't like a bug.

891
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,390
Speaker 0: I'm absolutely sure I did it all the time.

892
01:03:20,912 --> 01:03:22,176
Speaker 1: Well, awesome.

893
01:03:22,518 --> 01:03:23,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess so.

894
01:03:24,485 --> 01:03:29,555
Speaker 0: I don't know this kind of petered out Games like this Haven't been a they can't.

895
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:36,070
Speaker 0: no one has executed a straight-up Sim game like this in a matter that can catch my attention nowadays.

896
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:48,210
Speaker 1: Well, I think also part of what it is is not just what we said before but you know The the micro managing and the complexity is that the games are really sort of sandbox.

897
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:50,670
Speaker 1: see It's like they don't give you so many goals.

898
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:57,339
Speaker 1: it's like you play SimCity 2000. your goal is what get a bigger city get more stuff and Not screw up.

899
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:59,290
Speaker 1: It's like it's sort of vague.

900
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,538
Speaker 1: So you really have to have your own.

901
01:04:01,558 --> 01:04:06,925
Speaker 1: you to bring your own motivation, you know to bring your own thing that you really want.

902
01:04:07,308 --> 01:04:13,650
Speaker 1: and If you don't have that if you don't really want anything if you don't care so much that it's just not gonna work.

903
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:14,448
Speaker 1: It's like, you know.

904
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:21,050
Speaker 1: But then again, if you do have some motivation of something you want to make then it is gonna work really well.

905
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:33,070
Speaker 1: And I think we see that in other games today that have lots of user-generated type content things You know like in a little big planet or whatever is, you know, you may not be a sim game, right?

906
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,290
Speaker 1: You're just you know making puzzles or whatever, you know maps and things.

907
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:44,316
Speaker 1: But you have this idea of something you want to create and then you create it and in SimCity You know the SimCity game is.

908
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:51,598
Speaker 1: you have an idea of a city you want to create but you can't just create it Or play this whole game.

909
01:04:51,618 --> 01:05:00,426
Speaker 1: you have to cheat or you have to work within these confines of these rules in order to make the thing you want to make.

910
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:07,290
Speaker 1: so It's like if you're playing the game to make something then you have these rules getting in your way.

911
01:05:07,953 --> 01:05:17,892
Speaker 0: But if you're playing the game with some other, you know It well if you're playing the game to beat the rules and win then the end result is a map filled with our colleges Exactly Exactly.

912
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:24,584
Speaker 0: Plus it always bothered me that elevation unless you were doing something for aesthetics Only hurt you in SimCity 2000.

913
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:25,449
Speaker 0: It never helped you.

914
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:30,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it was cool that they had, you know mountains and things like that Reticulating splines.

915
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:34,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it was like, you know, hey his sort of real geography and that was neat.

916
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:43,090
Speaker 1: But all I did was make the game Frustrating because you couldn't actually build anything on it and it always just got in the way and made things difficult.

917
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:45,650
Speaker 1: It didn't actually, you know, it's a bad.

918
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:51,500
Speaker 1: That's why I want to make a flat map because it was just freaking annoying dad I think a flat map with an ocean or a thing was.

919
01:05:51,560 --> 01:06:00,844
Speaker 1: I really wanted to build like bridges or tunnels But they were always just a pain in the butt and they were never Optimal compared to the real solution which was get enough money to bulldoze it all flat.

920
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:02,550
Speaker 1: exactly exactly.

921
