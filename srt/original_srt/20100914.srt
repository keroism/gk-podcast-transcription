1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,157
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Tuesday September 14th.

2
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,546
Speaker 0: I'm rim Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:23,321
Speaker 0: packs 2010.

4
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,338
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,760
Speaker 0: So we had packs and then we had the weekend you had packs.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,047
Speaker 1: Hey, how did you have it?

7
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:32,274
Speaker 0: as in we were at packs?

8
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:33,240
Speaker 0: We had packs happen.

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,658
Speaker 1: In what way do you own it?

10
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:40,940
Speaker 0: In that that is a common grammatical construct that is not a problem for most normal people.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,828
Speaker 1: I believe you would say you went to it.

12
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:43,793
Speaker 1: so we had part.

13
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:52,668
Speaker 0: you part took and then The following weekend without a break we had a nerd NYC board game night on Friday And then we had a nerd NYC recess.

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,712
Speaker 1: that we did.

15
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,260
Speaker 0: I basically haven't had a rest from gaming.

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,865
Speaker 1: You're not plenty games today.

17
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,813
Speaker 0: I played counter-strike as soon as I got home.

18
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,098
Speaker 1: Oh that was your choice.

19
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:04,004
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, no rest.

20
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:08,076
Speaker 1: I notice you were playing a siege a very classic map.

21
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,280
Speaker 0: It was a remake of siege.

22
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,373
Speaker 0: I did not recognize it at first because I didn't notice the name.

23
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:12,976
Speaker 0: I just joined.

24
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:13,920
Speaker 0: it was a weird server.

25
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:22,574
Speaker 0: There's a lot of weird new counter-strike servers, and it all seems to be like People who are noobs to counter-strike running servers, so they don't ban the auto.

26
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,019
Speaker 0: they don't ban the AWP.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,983
Speaker 1: Why would you don't?

28
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,149
Speaker 0: why would you ban that?

29
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,194
Speaker 0: every server does that?

30
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,360
Speaker 0: why just they do?

31
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:29,867
Speaker 1: Why would you do that?

32
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,400
Speaker 0: because they do everyone's stupid?

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,701
Speaker 0: I don't.

34
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,254
Speaker 1: that's not why that's just they do know because that's not the reason they do.

35
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:36,960
Speaker 0: how am I supposed to know they're stupid every?

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,447
Speaker 0: Counter-strike server I ever see.

37
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,698
Speaker 0: bands the AWP they ban the autos.

38
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,329
Speaker 1: well They're stupid is a reason.

39
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,048
Speaker 0: they also give everyone 16,000 money every round.

40
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:47,092
Speaker 1: what yeah?

41
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,040
Speaker 0: a lot of them even banned smoke grenades.

42
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,905
Speaker 1: What yeah why?

43
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,091
Speaker 0: and half the servers don't even run real maps.

44
00:01:53,111 --> 00:02:00,779
Speaker 0: they either just run office 24/7 dust to 24/7 or they run those weird bullshit maps like jailbreak.

45
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, jailbreak isn't?

46
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,453
Speaker 0: it looks like a quake one map.

47
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:05,256
Speaker 0: it is awful.

48
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,039
Speaker 1: I mean gun games.

49
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:12,239
Speaker 0: alright I like gun game yeah, but I like gun game and the more realistic maps more so than on like Tetris.

50
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,583
Speaker 0: Tetris.

51
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,820
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't like those Tetris weird-ass maps.

52
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:20,334
Speaker 0: But anyway all the servers run by noobs are kind of default rules.

53
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,340
Speaker 0: no bullshit, and it's great.

54
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:22,822
Speaker 0: I get to.

55
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:26,160
Speaker 0: so suddenly I'm playing all these maps that I didn't know existed in source.

56
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:28,732
Speaker 0: So I'm on this map and I play like three rounds.

57
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,240
Speaker 1: I think you need to run your own seat server.

58
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:38,585
Speaker 0: I'm working on that but other things that the geek night server is so low on my priority list right now And once it five comes out.

59
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,471
Speaker 0: It's basically at the bottom of the list.

60
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:44,162
Speaker 1: so many goddamn games unfinished damn It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:44,664
Speaker 0: sit five.

62
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,151
Speaker 1: I know, but it's like I said five.

63
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,739
Speaker 1: I never finished that borderlands game whatever.

64
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,120
Speaker 1: so five I know whatever, but the point is I paid money for it, and I haven't finished.

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,474
Speaker 0: I think my trouble with Borderlands is that once I got going in it.

66
00:02:57,534 --> 00:03:00,410
Speaker 0: It was fun, but every time I want to co-op everyone.

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,114
Speaker 0: I know is that a different level and It's not fun to be the lowest or the highest level guy.

68
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 1: that is a problem.

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,425
Speaker 1: Is that level matters.

70
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:11,200
Speaker 1: instead of just FPSing it should really game had no levels and only equipment.

71
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,903
Speaker 1: It'd be much better.

72
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:17,609
Speaker 0: or if it did a Pokemon thing and just brought everyone to the same like equivalent level just to make It work man.

73
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:24,677
Speaker 1: I think it would just be fine If there were no levels in the game and everybody just had equipment and the equipment.

74
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:25,420
Speaker 1: you had any on it.

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,533
Speaker 1: You could use any equipment no matter what but some equipment is just better right.

76
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:36,260
Speaker 0: so the better equipment would be in the harder places Alright, so then I'm loaded out with all the crazy equipment And you don't have anything.

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,213
Speaker 1: But the equipment doesn't make as much a difference as the levels do.

78
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,946
Speaker 1: so even the crazy equipment is fully better But it wouldn't be enough.

79
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,515
Speaker 0: so what about the player abilities?

80
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,964
Speaker 1: the player What do you mean?

81
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,454
Speaker 0: you got to unlock all those abilities.

82
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:47,199
Speaker 0: you got a level up?

83
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,194
Speaker 1: You just make them into items or some shit.

84
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:52,007
Speaker 0: alright But they give you a huge advantage.

85
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,351
Speaker 0: having those not really they.

86
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,538
Speaker 1: it just like the auto turret and stuff like that isn't?

87
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,120
Speaker 1: or the eagle?

88
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,038
Speaker 0: They're not that as the siren mine are.

89
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:04,620
Speaker 1: Main difference is that just as you get more levels you get more HP, and you do more damage just straight up.

90
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:06,060
Speaker 0: And yeah, I know that's a problem.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,370
Speaker 1: They should just get rid of that entirely.

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,740
Speaker 1: you just always do the same damage.

93
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:11,932
Speaker 0: You realize most gamers want that even like Dave Riley and all them like.

94
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:12,615
Speaker 0: they love games.

95
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:13,860
Speaker 0: you level up and have tech trees.

96
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:20,745
Speaker 1: Yeah The reason they like that is because it makes you feel like you're mad skilled and makes you feel like you're improving when you're actually Not improving it.

97
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,619
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the reason a lot of people like it.

98
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,189
Speaker 1: I'm a psychological reason that it's in there for some people.

99
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,755
Speaker 0: that is definitely true, but not everyone.

100
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:34,520
Speaker 0: some people just enjoy The like exploring the tree of abilities as you progress through a game, and that's a legitimate utility in gaming.

101
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,090
Speaker 1: But that a tree of abilities is the exact same thing.

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,780
Speaker 1: it psychologically they might you know not might not be conscious.

103
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:45,613
Speaker 1: But that is the reason that that is enjoyable is because it makes you Way too many assumptions.

104
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:46,580
Speaker 1: That's absolutely true.

105
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,220
Speaker 1: That's why this is why get flash games that have that mechanic are the ones that are the most popular by an order of magnitude.

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but just because a implies B. Does not being mean that B implies a.

107
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:57,164
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

108
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:58,029
Speaker 0: you're not.

109
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,240
Speaker 0: I don't agree with your premise that all Exploration of tech trees is enjoyable only because of this one mechanic.

110
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:12,407
Speaker 1: well, I mean there are things that you could call a tech tree such as for example the Technology in civilization.

111
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I level up my sieve and my better than this.

112
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,587
Speaker 0: if they didn't level up It's not leveling up.

113
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:18,391
Speaker 0: So what's the difference?

114
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,075
Speaker 1: a different thing?

115
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:19,356
Speaker 1: How?

116
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:19,999
Speaker 0: what's different?

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,869
Speaker 1: there's a difference between Leveling up and leveling to the right right.

118
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,420
Speaker 1: so for example Mario levels to the right.

119
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,957
Speaker 1: He goes to the next level where things are more difficult.

120
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:35,580
Speaker 0: all right What if so we're playing Mario, but I get the hammer suit and you don't have the hammer suit.

121
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,047
Speaker 0: I'm clearly at an advantage.

122
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:38,314
Speaker 0: I leveled up.

123
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:39,480
Speaker 0: I explored that tech.

124
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,860
Speaker 1: I got the hammer suit, but the hammer suit isn't something that you earn simply by time.

125
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,838
Speaker 1: It is something you earn by skill.

126
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:51,899
Speaker 1: So you have to get to actually do difficult things to get the hammer suit.

127
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,569
Speaker 0: yeah You can do that with tech trees too in games Yes, like in civilization where you have to generate.

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:05,160
Speaker 1: You know it's actually quite difficult to generate enough Beakers faster than the other people while also making sure everything else doesn't fall apart.

129
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,592
Speaker 1: I I still disagree with your argument.

130
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:14,360
Speaker 1: you get levels simply by Not doing anything more difficult by simply doing the easy things over and over again.

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

132
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:21,860
Speaker 0: what I'm saying is even in a game like that not everyone gets their enjoyment Just because of that one particular psychological thing.

133
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:30,834
Speaker 1: I'm saying that that if in a game where you level up by doing something that is not more difficult Right in there the difficulty of Borderlands does not increase at any point.

134
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:35,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, same difficulty throughout Yeah, and they simply scale up your numbers and the bad guys.

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't disagree with any of this and the only reason that that is enjoyable.

136
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,260
Speaker 0: No I disagree with that.

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,866
Speaker 0: It's not the only reason why would that be enjoyable?

138
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:43,888
Speaker 1: for any other reason.

139
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,451
Speaker 0: some people like unlocking stuff.

140
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:46,433
Speaker 0: some people like you know.

141
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,798
Speaker 0: Why do people like steak?

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,681
Speaker 1: Steak?

143
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:53,890
Speaker 1: is it because it tastes good?

144
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,240
Speaker 0: what someone else doesn't like steak?

145
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:58,088
Speaker 1: Yes, because it doesn't taste good to them.

146
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what if leveling up tastes good to some people?

147
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:02,700
Speaker 1: I don't know why it is leveling up taste.

148
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,824
Speaker 0: Why does steak taste good?

149
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:07,517
Speaker 1: because there's things in your tongue in your brain that you're you.

150
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,389
Speaker 1: it touches your tongue And there's fat and sugar and good stuff in there.

151
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,540
Speaker 1: all right, but not it tells your brain that it tastes good.

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,543
Speaker 0: Not everyone likes that.

153
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,730
Speaker 1: no because some people have fucked up tongues.

154
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,319
Speaker 0: some people have different tastes right.

155
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,090
Speaker 0: so Gaming as well.

156
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,279
Speaker 1: the reason that leveling up?

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,511
Speaker 0: Not everyone who likes steak likes it for that one particular reason.

158
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:27,180
Speaker 0: some people might like steak just cuz they like fucking killing cows.

159
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,869
Speaker 0: Maybe they just like eating that texture.

160
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,519
Speaker 0: There's lots of different reasons someone might like something.

161
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,301
Speaker 1: no It is.

162
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:40,646
Speaker 0: I disagree with this premise that the only reason anyone could ever have for liking a tech tree in any Capability is there at stake.

163
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,455
Speaker 1: first of all you're lumping a bunch of different tech trees together.

164
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:45,080
Speaker 1: right the thing is is that there?

165
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:46,725
Speaker 0: Clearly to find the difference?

166
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:57,514
Speaker 0: the reason that games in which simply playing repeatedly I agree with you on this too, but you need enjoyable fire for many people not for all people It's for everybody.

167
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:58,483
Speaker 1: now I don't.

168
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:02,199
Speaker 1: there's no reason to enjoy that kind of thing for you for anybody.

169
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,048
Speaker 0: now I disagree.

170
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,060
Speaker 1: otherwise you just lie to yourself.

171
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,659
Speaker 0: I don't like those games, but I'd still disagree with you.

172
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:19,107
Speaker 0: But anyway, maybe we'll have to do a show on it do a panel on it regardless The complaint we get whatever we do Panel shows or con shows or event shows on geek nights and it's always weird.

173
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:30,116
Speaker 0: because if we talk about a con we went to and We just kind of talk about our personal experiences and review the con Half the people email us and say I don't want to hear about these bullshit cons cuz I don't go to them And I don't give a shit.

174
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,467
Speaker 1: Maybe you should go to them and give a shit.

175
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:35,620
Speaker 0: and the thing is they always say why do you do these shows and we?

176
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:48,782
Speaker 0: Get an equal amount of feedback saying yeah, I'm glad to hear about it I was there and it was awesome, or I didn't get to go, but it was awesome hearing about it from you and Both sides don't seem to realize that it's 50/50.

177
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:52,296
Speaker 0: It's not like we're catering to this audience of like four people who went to PAX.

178
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:58,500
Speaker 0: when we talk about packs I would say that the majority of you guys want the shows about conventions, so shut up haters.

179
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we have figured out a plan to appease both sides.

180
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,980
Speaker 1: if you're one of those convention people You're probably you know who hates these shows.

181
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:10,336
Speaker 1: Maybe you didn't even start listening to this one because you're like oh, it's about packs.

182
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:10,959
Speaker 1: I'm not listening.

183
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:26,679
Speaker 1: well You fail because in the first half of the show we're gonna just talk about games all the games We happen to have played at PAX, and then we will do the part that some people You know might not enjoy Which is talking about the things that happened at PAX in the second half of the show.

184
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:34,395
Speaker 1: So anyone who just didn't listen to the show at all because they didn't want to listen to a convention show You missed half a show you probably want to listen to.

185
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:35,099
Speaker 1: so fail on you.

186
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:37,647
Speaker 0: Not that they'll ever know.

187
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:41,040
Speaker 1: some of them might know because they might find out eventually.

188
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:46,332
Speaker 0: So Saturday was like the gaming fucking night for us at PAX.

189
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:52,878
Speaker 0: we basically had nothing to do except our panel and We pretty much hung out in tabletop almost all night playing.

190
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:55,473
Speaker 0: in fact We were some of the last people out of the convention center.

191
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:59,160
Speaker 0: the enforcers were like all right We're locking the door, and we're going to bed.

192
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:03,300
Speaker 0: You've got to be out by to close the door behind you and then they left.

193
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:08,555
Speaker 1: That's fun guess cuz we had enforcers with us playing so it was pretty rockin.

194
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,718
Speaker 0: We played a free market.

195
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,649
Speaker 1: Yep Well that was Saturday.

196
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,220
Speaker 1: I mean what about the games we played on Friday?

197
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,010
Speaker 0: I was just talking about Saturday to start you jumping over to Saturday.

198
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,520
Speaker 1: that this doesn't matter cuz we're not talking about the convention yet.

199
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,311
Speaker 0: Plus we didn't play that many games on Friday.

200
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,640
Speaker 0: Saturday was like the game at night.

201
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:27,491
Speaker 1: I can't remember which day I played which games or all the games I played because I played so many games.

202
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 0: the note for you because I actually remember on Saturday we played free market Bonanza power boats modern art push fight Dominion jungle speed.

203
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,961
Speaker 1: We didn't play this because you probably sat there while I was biking over here and thought and tried to remember really hard and wrote Them all down.

204
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:40,222
Speaker 0: No.

205
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:41,465
Speaker 0: I just have a memory.

206
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,430
Speaker 0: captain doesn't remember anything from any media.

207
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,673
Speaker 0: We ever consume ever.

208
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:59,675
Speaker 0: I remember name any Character other than your own from the last RPG that we played with Alex the burning wheel game The burning wheel game any character NBC PC their name I could tie getting.

209
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:09,155
Speaker 1: I could tell you that like Adam was the wolf and Pete was the rat and Kate was bitch name more than two characters from the Prince of Nothing series the entire series.

210
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:19,645
Speaker 1: nay, all right as Manet, all right The the crazy priest dude Starts an M.

211
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,431
Speaker 0: My thinet Matt.

212
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:21,833
Speaker 1: Yeah.

213
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,779
Speaker 0: All right, so far you've only got two.

214
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,614
Speaker 0: You didn't even name the protagonist yet.

215
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:31,289
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, you're getting there.

216
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,100
Speaker 1: I came in all right.

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,806
Speaker 0: Regardless this is not a member.

218
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,593
Speaker 0: member of like super memory.

219
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,680
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of remembering what games I fucking.

220
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,400
Speaker 1: It's not it's not easy.

221
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:48,820
Speaker 0: So yeah, Scott ran free market at PAX cuz we had like some hours to kill and we played with some listeners.

222
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,743
Speaker 0: It was totally awesome.

223
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the thing about free market is, you know, I'm trying to Gia.

224
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:56,069
Speaker 0: I realized Scott You don't have any flavor text.

225
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,079
Speaker 1: My GM is my GM skills are low.

226
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,228
Speaker 1: So the thing is I realized.

227
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:08,379
Speaker 1: also the only way to up the GM skills is practice Which is a chicken and egg situation because nobody wants to play a game with a shitty GM.

228
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:18,780
Speaker 1: but the only way to make a good GM is either have Talent just you're born with it or Play a bunch of games with the shitty GM until the shitty GM isn't shitty anymore.

229
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,586
Speaker 0: See now here's here's the real trouble.

230
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:26,119
Speaker 0: if you want to run a shitty game with inexperienced players They're never gonna want to roleplay again.

231
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:31,019
Speaker 0: If you want to if you're gonna do that with experienced players, they know and they're not gonna show up.

232
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:31,903
Speaker 1: That's right.

233
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:32,787
Speaker 0: You know how I learned.

234
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,011
Speaker 1: it's a chicken and egg situation.

235
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,180
Speaker 0: I GM really shitty games in high school.

236
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,204
Speaker 1: That's right.

237
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:43,592
Speaker 1: It seems like that's the only way to do it because in high school People are getting the kids are gonna play no matter what right you can.

238
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:44,957
Speaker 1: you can get away with shitty GM.

239
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:48,490
Speaker 0: in my high school There's a king because they like the shitty GMing.

240
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,735
Speaker 1: they'll enjoy it no matter what.

241
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,140
Speaker 0: I ran the worst game ever.

242
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,742
Speaker 0: It was this week.

243
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:52,585
Speaker 0: We called it guns.

244
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,348
Speaker 0: It was the system.

245
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:56,278
Speaker 0: We made to fix D&D set in the modern era with d30s.

246
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,588
Speaker 0: I'm not even kidding.

247
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:14,080
Speaker 1: or even in college You know Alex got a whole bunch of GM and skills playing a bunch of D&D with us that increased in quality over time You know, yeah But free market, I don't know how much you want to talk about it now But it isn't like the easiest game in the world to GM Like it's so easy.

248
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:21,292
Speaker 0: Well, it's easy as long as you are able to come up with very detailed and very creative flavor text No matter what the characters are conflicting.

249
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:22,157
Speaker 1: Well, I have a new.

250
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:22,780
Speaker 1: I came up.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,100
Speaker 1: I realized that my flavor text was weak and now I have come up with a flavor text strategy.

252
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,460
Speaker 1: They're going on master now my flavor text strategy that I'm going to employ in the future.

253
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,429
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, because I have a very simple one.

254
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,293
Speaker 0: Let's see if it's the same thing.

255
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:35,439
Speaker 0: Just make shit up.

256
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:42,220
Speaker 1: No, because making shit up is hard And you need a. you need a procedure to follow so that it is easier to make shit up, right?

257
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,036
Speaker 1: So here's my new procedure to make my flavor text not suck.

258
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:46,839
Speaker 1: You ready for this?

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,180
Speaker 1: Whenever anything is happening, right whenever you open whenever I open my mouth to describe anything that is happening, right?

260
00:13:54,681 --> 00:14:08,350
Speaker 1: I must pick at least three of five senses of seeing tasting touching hearing smelling right the five and I must pick at least three and say what they are and that is How you will get the good flavor text.

261
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,544
Speaker 1: I'll be like instead of just being for example Here's the bad flavor text.

262
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,052
Speaker 1: you go into the dungeon.

263
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:15,135
Speaker 1: It's a dungeon.

264
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,600
Speaker 1: There's a monster here, right?

265
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,207
Speaker 1: So now I have to pick three senses ready.

266
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:21,235
Speaker 1: So you go into the dungeon.

267
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,760
Speaker 1: I'll do the seeing in the dungeon.

268
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,431
Speaker 1: It is an incredibly dark dungeon.

269
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,500
Speaker 1: You can't even see three feet in front of your face.

270
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,752
Speaker 1: Right before you there are some slimy rocks and then I'll do the smelling.

271
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:39,869
Speaker 1: it is really dank and there is a hint of Rotting flesh wafting at you from deep into the darkness.

272
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:46,791
Speaker 1: and then the hearing you hear some growling from around the corner Is a monster Scott.

273
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:48,540
Speaker 0: I head down to the loading docks.

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,326
Speaker 0: I'm looking for some dust bunnies.

275
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,309
Speaker 0: help me clean up a problem.

276
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,517
Speaker 1: You go down to the loading docks.

277
00:14:54,018 --> 00:15:18,579
Speaker 1: you see you know many barges here and there are merchant Marines running about loading and unloading cargo containers onto the boats and You hear the sounds of the waves splashing against the the boardwalk and you smell the salty sea air and It is quite humid with all the the recent this coming storm.

278
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:23,140
Speaker 1: All right, and you go to get some dust bunnies from the dust bunny dealer.

279
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:23,862
Speaker 1: And he is.

280
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:28,980
Speaker 1: he looks like a really he's a really old nasty man with a with a peg leg and an iPad.

281
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:30,491
Speaker 0: You didn't tell me what he smells like.

282
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,382
Speaker 1: I'm getting there Already.

283
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:38,320
Speaker 1: I did the three senses for the docks and now I'm doing the three senses for the dust bunny salesman.

284
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,942
Speaker 0: I'm good practice.

285
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:43,877
Speaker 0: I'm thinking because that Arabian Nights game very pointedly requires you.

286
00:15:43,897 --> 00:15:47,139
Speaker 0: when you make characters You have to describe them in terms of five senses.

287
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:52,798
Speaker 0: Every character has a sentence related to a sense and you have five sentences.

288
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,220
Speaker 0: and that's it.

289
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,270
Speaker 1: But do you see how this is?

290
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,300
Speaker 1: this is the number one?

291
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:03,340
Speaker 1: This is the key for the for the indie role-playing games is they give you a procedure some Rules to work with because nerds are good at rules.

292
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:07,517
Speaker 1: They give you a instead of D&D which just says his rules for fighting.

293
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 0: and oh, yeah You should roleplay right thinking of which I picked up again.

294
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,720
Speaker 0: You heard NYC another copy of the second edition advanced Dungeons & Dragons players handbook.

295
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I opened it up and I opened it.

296
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:28,098
Speaker 0: I happen to randomly open it to the page that says in the upper left hand corner weapon proficiencies and all this tag non weapon and on the bottom right of the next page non weapon proficiencies.

297
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,388
Speaker 0: and it's like Cooking and swimming right?

298
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:43,671
Speaker 1: The thing is the not the indie RPGs the good ones, you know Not all of them, but many of them give you an actual rules-based procedure for doing the role-playing Which turns nerds like me into quality role-playing.

299
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,120
Speaker 1: Did you see how my shitty flavor text became?

300
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,045
Speaker 1: satisfactory flavor text when I applied a procedure of Describe the three senses?

301
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,755
Speaker 1: right if if I would if you know, just make shit up.

302
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:56,999
Speaker 1: I'd be like, alright make shit up.

303
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:02,955
Speaker 1: But instead I have a specific thing I have to do do seeing.

304
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:03,838
Speaker 1: what does it see?

305
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,420
Speaker 1: What do you see?

306
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,349
Speaker 1: What does it smell like and what do you hear?

307
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,160
Speaker 1: and I'm like, okay, what do they see?

308
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,861
Speaker 1: They see this, you know and I picture it in my head and then it comes out because I have a procedure and that is The key.

309
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:23,220
Speaker 0: but at least an experienced game master who knows the rules really well can whip out free market Including character creation at a con in like four hours.

310
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,989
Speaker 1: I know the thing of the greatest thing about free market is that you really only imagine It's like learning a card game.

311
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,420
Speaker 1: It is learning a card game, right?

312
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,572
Speaker 1: It's like if you know how to play poker, you know, it's just a different poker not really related to poker But it's a card game like that and it's like those are.

313
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:38,879
Speaker 1: that's how many rules you have to know.

314
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:47,238
Speaker 1: Once you know all those rules You're good Because for example if you're GMing burning wheel or D&D their decisions the GM has to make that are sometimes difficult.

315
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,392
Speaker 1: even in D&D It's like okay, you're gonna have to do a fight.

316
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,100
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to do a skill challenge.

317
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,227
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to do.

318
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,274
Speaker 1: give me a this role.

319
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,240
Speaker 1: Give me a strength check.

320
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,855
Speaker 1: You have to figure out which rule to apply in which situations.

321
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:02,296
Speaker 1: in free market You don't have to answer those kinds of hard questions.

322
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:09,468
Speaker 1: as a GM All you have to decide is am I going to say yes and just let them do what they want at this point Or is it gonna be a challenge?

323
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:10,713
Speaker 1: if it's a challenge?

324
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:11,817
Speaker 1: It's all it's just.

325
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:12,440
Speaker 1: it's a challenge.

326
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:13,243
Speaker 1: That's it.

327
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:17,800
Speaker 1: The only two rules are roleplay or have a challenge and having a challenge is also role-playing.

328
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,044
Speaker 0: So I'm just amazed.

329
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:28,660
Speaker 1: we pulled off a free market at a con because and it did it felt like when we were doing it I felt like oh my god I'm only have three days at PAX and I'm using like four hours on a free market.

330
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,531
Speaker 1: But it totally in looking back at PAX.

331
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,896
Speaker 1: It didn't take up that much time.

332
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:33,980
Speaker 1: It was totally cool.

333
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,623
Speaker 1: I mean we could have.

334
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:39,598
Speaker 1: we should have done a few more challenges to really finish out the session But what we did was certainly enough.

335
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:42,317
Speaker 0: Saturday night was the big like board gaming.

336
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:47,740
Speaker 0: night though We played one round of this game called power boats, which actually was like it was a racing game.

337
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,606
Speaker 1: And uh, you know, the thing is like.

338
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:53,440
Speaker 1: I like racing games in theme, but not as much in practice.

339
00:18:53,782 --> 00:19:04,159
Speaker 0: See now this game had good mechanics because the mechanics of power boats is pretty simple You can roll dice to kind of build up speed but if you want to slow down, it's not so easy and if you crash too much you explode.

340
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:13,770
Speaker 0: and it's kind of this like momentum math odds game and you're racing against other people and We play it on like baby baby baby mode.

341
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,360
Speaker 0: and it was still pretty damn fun and I I sucked.

342
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:33,605
Speaker 0: It ended like I was way ahead and then a bunch of people caught up and it was a good game and I lost in the And I like third place But Scott and one other player kind of got caught in the back and Scott just went around in circles Backwards around one buoy.

343
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:38,422
Speaker 1: the problem is the problem is I tried to take sort of a Mario Party kind of route and that did Not work.

344
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,540
Speaker 0: So then you killed yourself because that was easier than making it to the head.

345
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,100
Speaker 1: You know what that game needs ramps.

346
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:45,806
Speaker 1: You can jump if you hit the ramp Whatever your speed is.

347
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:48,140
Speaker 1: when you hit the ramp plus one you jump that many forward.

348
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,062
Speaker 1: But if you land on a rock you die, but if you land in the water awesome These ramps.

349
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,133
Speaker 0: maybe if you land you should keep your momentum no matter what.

350
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,397
Speaker 1: I don't know.

351
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,140
Speaker 1: so it needs jumps.

352
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:58,879
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

353
00:19:59,101 --> 00:19:59,806
Speaker 0: I'm sure we can.

354
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:03,889
Speaker 1: you can hit the side of the ramp and you would take damage But if you hit the front of the ramp you jump.

355
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,679
Speaker 0: I say you should be able to ram other people, too.

356
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:06,865
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

357
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:09,820
Speaker 0: It needs ramming and we need to be able to drop fucking mines.

358
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:11,985
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a little bit too much.

359
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:12,930
Speaker 0: no, I don't think it is.

360
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:15,080
Speaker 0: I think oil slicks are enough plus imagine this taste.

361
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,304
Speaker 0: So take the mechanics right?

362
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:17,688
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you know what the game should be.

363
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,313
Speaker 1: You don't control the boat.

364
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,637
Speaker 1: You control a water skier, huh?

365
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,203
Speaker 1: Attached to the boat.

366
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:23,965
Speaker 0: No, so get this.

367
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:28,739
Speaker 0: take the mechanics of the game with all the momentum and everything and make it a combat game.

368
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,430
Speaker 0: It's basically Atari combat the board game and that can be pretty fun.

369
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:42,500
Speaker 1: actually maybe I kind of just want to play Formula Day Because it has a better theme because formula racing is much better than power boat racing is pretty awesome.

370
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:45,780
Speaker 1: I'm much more fan of Formula Race plus reading on board game geek.

371
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,480
Speaker 0: It seems like people actually seem to prefer power boats as a better game probably because it has a lot more replay value.

372
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 1: I think so, but formula day has so many maps and like actual Monaco.

373
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:56,477
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

374
00:20:57,061 --> 00:21:05,426
Speaker 0: But we didn't even we played on the baby mat and we put the buoys in the babyest baby places and I still sucked And I haven't played.

375
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:07,216
Speaker 1: I don't have a lot of racing games under my belt.

376
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:08,402
Speaker 1: so, you know It was hard.

377
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,249
Speaker 0: we played with me Scott and Ian.

378
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,674
Speaker 0: quick game of modern art.

379
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:12,959
Speaker 0: now you did warn him.

380
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,491
Speaker 1: Well, you said I quote watch out rim is good at bidding games.

381
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:20,024
Speaker 0: Yep, and he didn't listen and it was his game And he got owned.

382
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:20,887
Speaker 1: I even owned him.

383
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,872
Speaker 1: I was pretty close to you.

384
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:23,720
Speaker 0: actually you were but I ignored you.

385
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:24,988
Speaker 0: Cuz you suck at bidding games.

386
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,660
Speaker 1: I I was doing good at that bidding game.

387
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,884
Speaker 1: I figured it out mostly.

388
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:35,403
Speaker 0: we learned this back in the day when I was undefeated at Pizarro and you were undefeated at power grid Not power grid the web of power I like.

389
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:44,379
Speaker 1: I just really like modern art compared to the other bidding games because if you look at some of the other bidding games Like say Pizarro, right the values of things are pretty much set.

390
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:49,460
Speaker 1: But in modern art the values of the things are bidding on might change in the next auctions.

391
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:59,100
Speaker 1: Not only are you bidding on who will own this thing that is up for auction But you're also bidding on how will the value of the things that are currently available?

392
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,080
Speaker 1: Change based on the results of this auction and what comes up for bid next.

393
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:17,589
Speaker 1: So you might be bidding a whole bunch on something because you think it's gonna be really valuable and then it ends up being worth Shit, yep, especially when you bust out or vice-rare Picasso or vice versa, you know It's the game with good mechanics.

394
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,360
Speaker 0: And I like all that has all the Rainier Kinizia.

395
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,022
Speaker 1: How can you go wrong?

396
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:25,080
Speaker 0: has all these different kinds of bids like the sealed bid the open bid the once-around that is.

397
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:30,500
Speaker 1: That is something I also love about it is that a lot of bidding games only have one kind of auction.

398
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,571
Speaker 1: You know every auction in this game is the is a one.

399
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:36,160
Speaker 1: you bid once and whoever bids the most is it or a power?

400
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,462
Speaker 1: Grid.

401
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:39,298
Speaker 1: every auction is go-around, you know bidding.

402
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:44,700
Speaker 0: But in this game you have the jumping bidding where one jump is huge and you can leapfrog people and all that.

403
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in this game all that you do all different kinds of auctions all the time, which is totally sweet.

404
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:51,626
Speaker 0: So it's a fun game.

405
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:52,550
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it.

406
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,680
Speaker 0: I actually bought it because it was really cheap on Amazon.

407
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,054
Speaker 1: I want to make a side note here.

408
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:57,764
Speaker 1: right because We do.

409
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,991
Speaker 1: we buy board games British.

410
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,460
Speaker 1: every board game we have we bought right?

411
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we've only re-boxed a few games.

412
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,180
Speaker 1: re-boxing is pretty popular.

413
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:17,036
Speaker 1: That's when you have a board game that takes up a lot of room or has a really big box and you go to the craft store or whatever and you buy maybe a Compartmentalized plastic box or something so that you can store the same board game in a smaller area

414
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,800
Speaker 0: row made for me as a gift A long time a while ago that carcass own bag.

415
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:25,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it takes up a lot less space than a carcass own but although it has the little patch on the outside for the starting Tile.

416
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:29,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, because when you have a lot of board games each of those boxes a lot of air in it.

417
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,140
Speaker 1: So if you can compress the games to a smaller area, you can save a lot of space in your board game shell.

418
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,232
Speaker 1: However, I've discovered a new thing which is the printout board game.

419
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:38,753
Speaker 1: Basically.

420
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:39,937
Speaker 0: I was impressed by this.

421
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:40,740
Speaker 0: that was Ian again.

422
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's more.

423
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:41,603
Speaker 1: it's.

424
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:49,132
Speaker 1: it's more common than I thought because people talking about it at recess to where let's say there is a board Game that is out of print or do or difficult to get a

425
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:49,614
Speaker 0: dune

426
00:23:49,875 --> 00:24:00,435
Speaker 1: right or something like that Don't buy it at the store Alright Just print your own copy make your own box Get your own chits and pawns and make your own copy of the game.

427
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:01,900
Speaker 1: Just get the rules off board game geek.

428
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,306
Speaker 1: Look at the parts list.

429
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:09,276
Speaker 0: get some dice and with the right kind of glue and a little bit of skill I mean he had this doom set and it looked really good.

430
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,790
Speaker 1: like it looked at me I didn't realize that it was a printed out set.

431
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:13,373
Speaker 1: I thought it was.

432
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:17,592
Speaker 0: he owned the game as well as I said to him Hey that dune is in crazy good condition.

433
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,687
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, I made it myself Yeah, and I was like what?

434
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:21,269
Speaker 1: no way.

435
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,145
Speaker 1: so if this some out-of-print game that you just can't buy You know make it.

436
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,360
Speaker 1: and the thing is you might think I'm making it is some kind of evil piracy.

437
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:35,399
Speaker 1: The thing is making a copy of the board game will often be just as if not more expensive than buying a copy.

438
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,739
Speaker 0: is Making a copy of a board unless the game is good.

439
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:49,115
Speaker 0: I have a moral question for you is making your own copy of a board game from you know Engineering it on your own any worse than singing Britney Spears songs to yourself.

440
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:49,938
Speaker 1: No.

441
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,620
Speaker 0: Well, there we go.

442
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:52,248
Speaker 1: It's nothing wrong with it at all.

443
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:52,710
Speaker 1: I'm not.

444
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:54,037
Speaker 1: I'm not putting it down in any way.

445
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:54,600
Speaker 1: I'm lifting it up.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,663
Speaker 1: I'm saying people should do this.

447
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's totally cool.

448
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:01,699
Speaker 1: Especially because if you make it right not only let's say I make my own Carcassonne, right.

449
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,978
Speaker 1: Okay, the Carcassonne guys are gonna miss out on a few bucks But you know what?

450
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,860
Speaker 1: It cost me more to make it than it in time and money than it would cost to buy one.

451
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,134
Speaker 1: so really I'm not cheating them out of anything.

452
00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:15,359
Speaker 1: I put in hard work for that.

453
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:20,900
Speaker 1: and Secondly, I might put some probably gonna put some unique touches on my own carcass.

454
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,135
Speaker 1: Oh, and so it's really a different game because I'm gonna make some better meeples.

455
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:27,716
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll use camels Maybe I'll you make a different theme you get creative.

456
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:28,340
Speaker 1: It's like artwork.

457
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:33,017
Speaker 1: So it's totally cool to make your own board games, you know, why would you buy a monopoly?

458
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:33,780
Speaker 1: make your own monopoly?

459
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,235
Speaker 0: So we played this really quick game called push fight and it's kind of like a.

460
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:39,420
Speaker 1: it is an online version.

461
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,778
Speaker 0: I found out yeah, it wasn't in unity - yeah of all things.

462
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,354
Speaker 0: Yep It's kind of like oshi not as good but it's pretty.

463
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:47,520
Speaker 1: you don't think it's as good as oshi.

464
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,940
Speaker 0: I think oshi is a much better game.

465
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:57,811
Speaker 1: I think that it actually had a slight advantage over oshi in that you don't get the oshi has a special Exception rule so that you don't go back and forth.

466
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,620
Speaker 1: push fight didn't even need that rule.

467
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:01,567
Speaker 0: No push right has the rule.

468
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:05,420
Speaker 0: you move that piece around and you can't remove a piece that has that piece.

469
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,840
Speaker 1: But I think that the red the red guy was a little more elegant than the oshi rule.

470
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:12,953
Speaker 0: I think we should just incorporate the red guy into oshi.

471
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:16,960
Speaker 1: whoever you push with Whenever a piece you move can't be pushed.

472
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:18,665
Speaker 0: Put the red guy on him.

473
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,859
Speaker 0: We could try it or put the red guy into the spot where he came from or something like that.

474
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:25,747
Speaker 0: Something we'll have to fiddle with it.

475
00:26:26,008 --> 00:26:28,299
Speaker 0: It was fun, but it's another one of those games.

476
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,013
Speaker 0: notice I'm bringing up all the games that I was awesome at before.

477
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:31,817
Speaker 0: we talk about all the games.

478
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:32,259
Speaker 0: I lost.

479
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,708
Speaker 0: I Was undefeated at this game.

480
00:26:34,748 --> 00:26:36,055
Speaker 0: I played Scott like six times.

481
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,000
Speaker 0: I played a bunch of other people.

482
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,868
Speaker 0: No one can beat me because this game.

483
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:45,115
Speaker 0: you realize here's everyone's mistake, you know that game I always talk about with the sticks where you cross off sticks taking turns.

484
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,200
Speaker 0: Whoever picks up the last tick lose.

485
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,764
Speaker 1: I was the same.

486
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:48,658
Speaker 1: Oh, they're the stable state in the unstable state.

487
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:50,303
Speaker 1: I knew.

488
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:51,949
Speaker 1: I knew it was that game right away.

489
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,640
Speaker 1: The problem is I could recognizing the pad.

490
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,510
Speaker 0: I could stable and I couldn't recognize the state.

491
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 1: I recognize some of the stable and unstable states.

492
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:03,575
Speaker 1: Mostly I had a hard time recognizing the unstable states.

493
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,120
Speaker 1: I recognized the stable states All right.

494
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:16,100
Speaker 1: The other problem I had is there were some unstable states that were actually one turn away from an obvious unstable state But there was still no escape from them and I couldn't recognize those for shit.

495
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, see but it was that.

496
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:24,678
Speaker 1: it was one of those situations where there's things, you know There's things you don't know there's things you know, you don't know and there's things you don't know you don't know.

497
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game was full of things.

498
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,680
Speaker 1: I knew I didn't know.

499
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:32,929
Speaker 0: See I guess the game actually broke down really simply pretty much two turns in.

500
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:42,472
Speaker 0: I knew if I won or not and if I and if I knew that I Lost I knew that the other person sucked and I could just push it back I could flip the unstable state and then I'd win no matter what.

501
00:27:42,854 --> 00:27:43,035
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:49,620
Speaker 0: Yeah It had the neat mechanic and like oshi though where you can basically move pieces anywhere.

503
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:55,328
Speaker 0: So it's more about blocking off areas of the board Than it is necessarily about like push.

504
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,210
Speaker 0: that was always.

505
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,800
Speaker 1: if you got your guy you're square behind their lines.

506
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:00,485
Speaker 1: That was it.

507
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:02,540
Speaker 1: You're that was a huge advantage right there.

508
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,780
Speaker 1: All right, what other games we play?

509
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,554
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll ever play that game again because I'm undefeated at it and I want to remain that way.

510
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:12,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played Bonanza so of an end.

511
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:13,449
Speaker 0: I want to talk about this.

512
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:16,440
Speaker 0: Bonanza is a. it's a game that looks stupid.

513
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,325
Speaker 0: It's awesome box.

514
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:18,270
Speaker 0: You're like, yeah fuck this game.

515
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:25,160
Speaker 1: and when they brought it out ultra rare cocoa bean I was gonna bring up the ultra rare cocoa bean ultra rare and cocoa is the best root bean in the game.

516
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:28,532
Speaker 0: We started this game late like after this game.

517
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:30,960
Speaker 0: We played like two rounds of Dominion and then it was two in the morning.

518
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,735
Speaker 0: This is like the last real normal and we had like a ton of people playing.

519
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:35,940
Speaker 1: It was a full loadout.

520
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,194
Speaker 0: It was the West Coast crew the West Coast front row crew and the Azen posse.

521
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 1: It was loaded up big time.

522
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:45,750
Speaker 0: So they whip out this game and I'm really tired Like they whipped it out while I was out getting the drink.

523
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,540
Speaker 0: and I come back and I'm like, what the fuck is this game?

524
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,793
Speaker 0: We're playing it and they're like we bid on beans.

525
00:28:51,114 --> 00:28:51,977
Speaker 0: and he explained to the rules.

526
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,765
Speaker 0: and I'm like this look I don't remember who won.

527
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:54,990
Speaker 0: I did handily.

528
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,055
Speaker 0: I kicked everyone's asses.

529
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,023
Speaker 1: I thought I did really well I don't remember now.

530
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:58,867
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I did.

531
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,354
Speaker 0: Well, I want hand over fist.

532
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:01,639
Speaker 0: Whatever I did.

533
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:07,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway this game they whip it out and every packs are.

534
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:08,818
Speaker 1: now on we're gonna have a game log.

535
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,980
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm very very very much a proponent of this because I won almost every freaking game.

536
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,080
Speaker 1: I played a pack and now once you have a game log, you're gonna lose every game.

537
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:18,666
Speaker 1: That's gonna be awesome.

538
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:21,020
Speaker 0: So this game looked dumb and then it was row.

539
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:25,380
Speaker 0: You know our West Coast front row crew friend and she starts off in the game.

540
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,910
Speaker 0: You know, she's starting to play and I'm just like whatever.

541
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,730
Speaker 0: I'm gonna bid on this and she turns to the guy She can bid from and she's like yo brother.

542
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,694
Speaker 0: I need this bean.

543
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:34,758
Speaker 0: I need some green beans.

544
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:35,846
Speaker 0: right now I need the bean.

545
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:40,332
Speaker 0: Give me the bean then fuck y'all B. And she got really into it and then they all got into it.

546
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,059
Speaker 1: Everyone got into it big time.

547
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,960
Speaker 0: The West Coast crew is into this game the way we're into our own games.

548
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,680
Speaker 0: They had a shtick and the shtick is 90% of the fun of this game.

549
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:51,244
Speaker 1: I don't know.

550
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,079
Speaker 1: I think the game would have been fun even without the shtick.

551
00:29:53,361 --> 00:29:54,465
Speaker 1: It wasn't even so.

552
00:29:54,485 --> 00:30:03,420
Speaker 1: it is a game where I think the best thing about this game Is that you look at other games that have trading settlers even traders of Genoa Genoa, right?

553
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:10,200
Speaker 1: Is it's often a good idea not to trade and in fact it usually want to reject most trade offers in this game.

554
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:14,380
Speaker 1: People are desperate to trade because the rules are so ingenious.

555
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,528
Speaker 1: So you're basically trading constantly.

556
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:19,680
Speaker 1: you want to get rid of this shit and in fact you need to get rid of it.

557
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:23,020
Speaker 1: So you will try to get something for it, right?

558
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,164
Speaker 1: hopefully there'll be competition for whatever there is.

559
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:28,535
Speaker 1: you're trading away like say I need that Pinto be like.

560
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:34,260
Speaker 1: if I really need to get rid of this Green bean and there's more than one person who wants it then I can get a good deal for it.

561
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,230
Speaker 1: But if there's only one person who wants it or if nobody wants it I still really really really need to get rid of it.

562
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:42,277
Speaker 1: So I'll give it away for free.

563
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:45,894
Speaker 1: I'll give it as a gift I'll you know, and if it gets accepted I would get.

564
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:46,919
Speaker 1: I just get rid of it.

565
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,006
Speaker 1: So people are bargaining every single turn hardcore on every single bean big time So every.

566
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,359
Speaker 0: you might wonder why we keep saying the ultra rare cocoa bean.

567
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:02,700
Speaker 0: So every round it goes around and you can only like make actual trades with the active player.

568
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:05,953
Speaker 0: So every round the active players trying to trade with everyone.

569
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:15,625
Speaker 0: Everyone's kind of like I got I got pitobee I got black beans I got this bean I got that bean and then there'd always be a silence and then Scott would just say with the exact Intonation and pacing and everything.

570
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,332
Speaker 0: Does anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean?

571
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:23,167
Speaker 0: and he would say it in that exact way Every single person's turn.

572
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:29,000
Speaker 0: and it got to the point that like what he said it and we just like we all lost it I couldn't deal with the ultra rare cocoa bean.

573
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,668
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the thing is is I drew this.

574
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:36,300
Speaker 1: every card every bean has a number on it And that number is how many beans of that bean are in the dead black eyed beans.

575
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,565
Speaker 1: So for example the game.

576
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:46,740
Speaker 1: I use a lot of wax beans in the game and there are like a zillion wax beans in the Game like 20 something like a ton of them, but I drew early in the game the ultra rare cocoa bean.

577
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,566
Speaker 1: It had the number four on it Which means there's only four cocoa beans in the whole game and it paid out real quick and I was like goddamn this bean It's in my hand.

578
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:59,000
Speaker 1: I need to get it out of my hand and Anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean, right?

579
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:08,740
Speaker 0: so I'm like no one else has one and if they do big deal right cuz then he would hold his cards like in two fists and he Would like make this earnest gesture like does anybody want my ultra rare cocoa bean?

580
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:12,885
Speaker 1: So what eventually happened though is I drew and I Randomly completely by luck.

581
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:16,900
Speaker 1: I drew another one and another and then I had three out of the four cocoa beans.

582
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,109
Speaker 0: So then you cashed in.

583
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,560
Speaker 1: I cashed in cocoa bean.

584
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,082
Speaker 1: it worked.

585
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:23,494
Speaker 1: but the thing is I was trying to trade that first one away cuz.

586
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,183
Speaker 1: it was no good if you only have one of them.

587
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,967
Speaker 1: and Yeah, it was pretty ultra rare.

588
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:30,940
Speaker 0: So I note this two bidding games at PAX.

589
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:42,126
Speaker 0: I sat to the left of Ian who's good at bidding games and He ignored me because I was the new guy and then I won left-right mechanics Mechanics big big deal.

590
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:46,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were talking about left-right mechanics a lot for some reason in fact Cuz we kept talking like it kept coming up.

591
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:50,080
Speaker 1: It was weird Yeah, so I think it was Saturday morning before he played free market.

592
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:55,280
Speaker 1: I played this game that I've seen around but I never played it before and it looked really stupid.

593
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:57,275
Speaker 1: But I played it anyway, and it's called we didn't play.

594
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:57,919
Speaker 1: test this at all.

595
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,506
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we play and it has.

596
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:01,956
Speaker 1: it has an expansion pack called we didn't play.

597
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:02,719
Speaker 1: test this either.

598
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,200
Speaker 1: now The way this game works is it's a lot like flux.

599
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,776
Speaker 1: You have cards and every turn you play it draw a card play a card or I forget.

600
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,803
Speaker 1: if you play and then draw Doesn't matter.

601
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:14,212
Speaker 0: you say it's like flux, but I it is like flux.

602
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:20,680
Speaker 0: if flux had almost no rules Well, that's the looks has so much more like game to it.

603
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:27,580
Speaker 1: It's like flux in that the only rules are draw card play a card and all the rest of the rules are on the cards.

604
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:36,670
Speaker 0: that's the similarity right, but there are cards like you win or You lose or Everybody loses or make everyone vote.

605
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,333
Speaker 0: Yes or no.

606
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:38,316
Speaker 0: if they all vote.

607
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:39,039
Speaker 0: Yes you win.

608
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:44,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love the voting cards or the rock-paper-scissors cards because there's like a whole bunch of different ones.

609
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:49,460
Speaker 1: So it'd be like art everyone rock-paper-scissors and you have no idea which rock-paper-scissors card it is.

610
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,055
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a card that says everyone who plays rock loses.

611
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:54,528
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a card That says everyone who plays scissors loses.

612
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,225
Speaker 1: There's all three of them are in the deck somewhere Unless you've seen what it got to

613
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:09,639
Speaker 0: the point where you don't know the guy who happened to be the shortest person playing the game with us Drew a card that said something to the effect of if you just lost and you're the shortest person at the table you win.

614
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,560
Speaker 1: Instead I think it was just play this card if you're the shortest person at the table you win.

615
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:20,907
Speaker 1: It was something like otherwise you get five points and anyone who has 15 points wins But you can change that to 100 points.

616
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:28,993
Speaker 0: now Scott played this game and none of us did so he whips it out like 11 O'clock after playing bonanza on like Saturday night, and we're all like.

617
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,438
Speaker 0: I don't want to play this stupid game.

618
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:31,442
Speaker 0: shut up Scott Go away.

619
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:33,592
Speaker 0: Don't play this game with us, and he makes us play it.

620
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:35,060
Speaker 0: and it was funny.

621
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,766
Speaker 0: Everyone said this sucks this sucks.

622
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:38,589
Speaker 0: Let's stop.

623
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,393
Speaker 0: and yet when we said alright.

624
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:40,975
Speaker 0: Let's stop.

625
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,830
Speaker 0: They all said now one more round No, let's play one more time.

626
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:46,179
Speaker 0: Let's see this again.

627
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:47,601
Speaker 1: It's just.

628
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:48,806
Speaker 1: it's not a good game.

629
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:49,228
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

630
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,054
Speaker 1: it's not a skill game or anything like that.

631
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:52,520
Speaker 1: It's just epic lols.

632
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:53,266
Speaker 0: It's a game.

633
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,739
Speaker 0: I think I might buy it.

634
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,405
Speaker 1: I guess oh, that's a lol generator.

635
00:34:56,525 --> 00:35:03,674
Speaker 0: because if you buy it this game has one purpose you whip it out at a convention Once and you'll be the guy.

636
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:06,640
Speaker 1: the thing is every convention I've been to has the game in their library.

637
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,152
Speaker 1: So there's no reason for me to buy it because I'd only want to play it at a convention.

638
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:12,145
Speaker 0: so here if you run a Convention buy this game.

639
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, and put it in your conventions game library for open gaming.

640
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,845
Speaker 0: if I were at Connecticut Let's make a tournament happen.

641
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,729
Speaker 0: That's hard.

642
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,055
Speaker 0: Yeah for serious.

643
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:21,080
Speaker 0: It would take like 10 minutes.

644
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,427
Speaker 1: All right sure I'll run it.

645
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,432
Speaker 1: We didn't play.

646
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:25,115
Speaker 1: test this at all.

647
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:26,924
Speaker 0: tournament listeners We might forget.

648
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:28,170
Speaker 0: remind me to run this tournament.

649
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,496
Speaker 0: I totally will if you remind us.

650
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:37,744
Speaker 1: there's another game I played the rim didn't play called squirrels and the guy who made the game was there pimping it at a little table and robot it.

651
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:44,580
Speaker 1: so we played it with her and some other people and Basically the way the game works is you're a bunch of squirrels fighting over nuts, right?

652
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,840
Speaker 1: So what you're trying to do is you're trying to get sets of nuts in sets of three.

653
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:54,820
Speaker 1: So you're looking for like, you know the card with four daddy three nut You'll have a card with four nuts on it and the number four.

654
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,547
Speaker 1: so you want three of those right.

655
00:35:56,627 --> 00:36:04,099
Speaker 1: and then you if you when you get them you make sets out of the nuts and Basically, I didn't have a good time because I basically couldn't get a set to save my life.

656
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:08,040
Speaker 1: But there are some special cards sort of like jungle speed, right?

657
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,579
Speaker 1: So one of them it's like slap your hand down on the hoard and whoever does it first gets the hoard And stuff like that.

658
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,160
Speaker 1: And there was a whole bunch of or there would be like a quarrel and the way the quarrel works.

659
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,494
Speaker 1: You have a quarrel with somebody.

660
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,477
Speaker 0: Oh squirrel quarrel is.

661
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:28,397
Speaker 1: so If you have a squirrel with someone you play the highest card you have and then the second highest and so on.

662
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,620
Speaker 1: and it's like War, you know, where whoever has the highest wins.

663
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:37,703
Speaker 1: Ah, so I did a quarrel with someone and I got all the way down to the last card And then I won.

664
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:41,660
Speaker 1: and then I got a whole bunch of cards and I laid down a whole bunch of sets.

665
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,847
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of like that.

666
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:48,960
Speaker 1: So it's not a huge skill game It's a lot of luck, but it is still pretty entertaining if you play it a few times.

667
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:54,073
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's if you're gonna play war you're better off playing squirrels time.

668
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:59,633
Speaker 1: It's like war plus jungle speed plus Like, you know rummy is squirrels.

669
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:00,920
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

670
00:37:01,582 --> 00:37:06,180
Speaker 0: So we played a whole bunch of Dominion and there's not a lot to say about it except that it was Dominion.

671
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:09,840
Speaker 0: Scott and I had a joint victory because we exhausted the tiebreakers.

672
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,223
Speaker 1: That's a good win.

673
00:37:13,243 --> 00:37:14,388
Speaker 0: That was a good win.

674
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:17,780
Speaker 0: I was very disappointed at the lack of a final tiebreaker though.

675
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played roll through the ages, but I think we've talked about that before.

676
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:24,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Yahtzee plus Civilization.

677
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:28,197
Speaker 0: We played a whole bunch of jungle speed because you can just whip that out nowhere and it just works.

678
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:29,060
Speaker 1: We played jungle speed.

679
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:31,560
Speaker 0: Yes, you played I didn't play in this that catacombs game.

680
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,852
Speaker 1: Oh, so catacombs a real interesting game because what it is is it's a dexterity game where you flick things just like crocodile But it's a dungeon crawler.

681
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:40,880
Speaker 1: So you'll be there.

682
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,968
Speaker 1: You'll have a wizard and you want to do a melee attack.

683
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:46,060
Speaker 1: you flick your wizard and try to hit a skeleton.

684
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:50,520
Speaker 1: That's a bad guy and the one person plays all the bad guys and four people play the heroes.

685
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:51,526
Speaker 0: It looks really fun.

686
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,034
Speaker 0: The game looked like it had problems.

687
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:53,960
Speaker 1: It needed to be bigger.

688
00:37:54,161 --> 00:38:03,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, conceptually the game was mad fun, right because like I want to shoot a fireball So you take the fireball token put it down within an inch of your wizard and flick it at a bad guy and that does The damage to him.

689
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:07,777
Speaker 1: and you do the day and I some of the guys have one HP and they just die.

690
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,659
Speaker 1: and some guys Have more than one HP.

691
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,616
Speaker 1: so when they get hit you flip them over and then you hit him again and then they die and they have different powers like Some guys will paralyze you or whatever.

692
00:38:17,736 --> 00:38:28,753
Speaker 1: and you know It was a dungeon crawl where you flick Your bat your got your heroes and your spells and your arrows at the bad guys to kill them and we got all the way To the Lich, but then he killed us, which is pretty good.

693
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,919
Speaker 1: We got all the way that far.

694
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:32,733
Speaker 0: Um, I want to see more games like this.

695
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:33,800
Speaker 0: It's a really cool concept.

696
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:37,760
Speaker 0: I just I want metal pieces and the board to be like ten times bigger.

697
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, the board is really small and has the obstacles and it's not really precise.

698
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:48,100
Speaker 0: I also want someone to make that game but make it shuffleboard size and run it at a con.

699
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:53,222
Speaker 1: That is exactly what needs to happen because the game would be so much better if you you know There was.

700
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:56,920
Speaker 1: the pieces are so small and sort of flaky and the board is small.

701
00:38:57,261 --> 00:39:06,100
Speaker 1: So it's really sort of imprecise, you know, not like crocodile, which is incredibly precise or shuffleboard, which is incredibly precise You know if you have a you have a dexterity game like this.

702
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,180
Speaker 1: It needs to be like on the money, you know, so it needs to be bigger in the scale and everything.

703
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:18,540
Speaker 1: So get it needs a ruler You know to make sure that you're putting the spell within one inch of you and all that kind of stuff.

704
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:24,599
Speaker 1: But other than that, I mean it was you know It was mechanically sound and conceptually original and interesting and I applaud it.

705
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:26,628
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'd buy it probably never.

706
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,520
Speaker 0: but and I guess the only other game there was that poo flinging game.

707
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,525
Speaker 0: We didn't actually play.

708
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,188
Speaker 0: play the poof.

709
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,900
Speaker 0: a lot of people were talking about it and playing it at the con.

710
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,655
Speaker 1: The poofling game seemed like a random card game and the way it worked is.

711
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,282
Speaker 1: you played cards But you would.

712
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:43,020
Speaker 1: the cards would fling poo with the other monkeys and the other monkeys of the other players.

713
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,660
Speaker 1: So you had these gems and you would basically put the gems on the other people to signify who got.

714
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,751
Speaker 0: You know, why doesn't the game come with little pieces of poo?

715
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:53,079
Speaker 1: because it doesn't have that high production value.

716
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,480
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, are there any other games I can remember?

717
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,815
Speaker 0: So things of the day, what do you got for me Scott?

718
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:19,152
Speaker 1: So You know, I'm always complaining about those guys in the city who You know, they use the stupid track bikes, which are totally cool But they use them on the street where you're not supposed to use the stupid

719
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,177
Speaker 0: hipster assholes

720
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:24,280
Speaker 1: because there's you know I mean and I'm usually I'm not a person who's in favor of a helmet law.

721
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:28,540
Speaker 1: I mean, you know because it's like hey, if you don't have a helmet, who are you putting in danger yourself?

722
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,060
Speaker 1: It's your own decision, right?

723
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,880
Speaker 1: Obviously a children is a little different situation like the helmet laws that say children have to wear them.

724
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,496
Speaker 1: It's like okay because then it's a parent putting their child in danger, whatever.

725
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:39,440
Speaker 1: There's arguments to be made.

726
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,715
Speaker 1: The point is you want to put yourself in danger.

727
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:42,399
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

728
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:51,287
Speaker 1: If you want to put other people in danger, that's not cool and riding around a bicycle on a street where there are pedestrians and cars Without brakes is not cool.

729
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,853
Speaker 0: and you might think who would do that?

730
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,440
Speaker 0: and the answer is New York hipsters.

731
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,067
Speaker 0: I see them every day.

732
00:40:56,087 --> 00:41:02,383
Speaker 1: about like 25% of the bicycles that I see going around the city Have no brakes at all just because they're track bikes They're meant for.

733
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:05,560
Speaker 0: they try like their stupid boot on the back to try to slow down.

734
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:12,540
Speaker 1: No, they put their crusty old van They rub the bottom of their crusty old van on the bottom the back tire to slow down.

735
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:17,478
Speaker 0: I I'll admit every time I see these people I want to just jump out in front of them.

736
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,907
Speaker 0: Yep You're like, oh couldn't stop could you?

737
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then they hit me.

738
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:22,899
Speaker 1: so yeah, that's the thing.

739
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:29,556
Speaker 1: and it's like Okay, if you hit the back of a car because you have no brakes The thing is oh you're hurting yourself, which is fine.

740
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:32,129
Speaker 1: I don't mind that You're damaging this dude's car.

741
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:34,620
Speaker 1: and what if you hit an old lady trying to cross that in the crosswalk?

742
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,099
Speaker 1: I mean, come on, that's not cool.

743
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,130
Speaker 1: but anyway There was this video.

744
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,158
Speaker 1: It was on College Humor.

745
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,420
Speaker 1: All right that showed an actual track race and I actually learned a lot about track racing.

746
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:49,439
Speaker 1: I knew already the track racing is done in a velodrome, which is a nice smooth banked track.

747
00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:52,239
Speaker 0: That's where roller derby used to happen.

748
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,600
Speaker 0: But now roller derby happens on a flat which is why roller derby is heaven.

749
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,520
Speaker 1: It's actually helping it out because there aren't too many velodromes.

750
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,310
Speaker 1: In fact, there's so few velodromes that in Wikipedia.

751
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,597
Speaker 1: There is a page list of velodromes.

752
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:10,860
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, so anyway I knew that and I knew that it was incredibly fast and that they use these bikes with no brakes.

753
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:19,330
Speaker 1: what I did not know is that the reason that the bikes have no brakes is because Moving backwards is actually ixnay.

754
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:20,294
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

755
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,680
Speaker 1: You get in trouble if you go backwards.

756
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,245
Speaker 1: So if you had.

757
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:28,228
Speaker 1: and the other thing is that they don't go fast the whole race They don't just go go go go go from the beginning.

758
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:30,680
Speaker 1: It's actually the whole beginning of the race.

759
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,539
Speaker 1: What they will do is they will purposefully go slow.

760
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:36,375
Speaker 1: In fact, they will try to stop which is really hard to do with.

761
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:36,978
Speaker 0: no play that game.

762
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,224
Speaker 0: as a kid I'm going slower than you.

763
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,128
Speaker 0: I'm going slower than you.

764
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:47,720
Speaker 1: All right, they'll purposefully try to slow down Which is really hard when you know, the the the pedals are directly attached to the wheel.

765
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,570
Speaker 1: You know pedaling backwards makes you go backwards.

766
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:52,256
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's that kind of bike.

767
00:42:52,859 --> 00:43:08,139
Speaker 1: So It's really you can stop with the power of your legs and you know by going up high on the track on the bank You know oval and turning the tire inwards and physically holding yourself still now Why would you want to do that in a race?

768
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,690
Speaker 1: Well, the reason is because of aerodynamics and other things.

769
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:12,231
Speaker 1: you're.

770
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:21,820
Speaker 1: it's actually advantageous to be behind the other guy because then you can get into his Aerodynamic trail and that'll and then you can use that to just boost around the side of him at the very end of the race.

771
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:31,951
Speaker 1: All right, so you will try to purposefully these guys go slow on purpose to be behind to win and That's why there's no brakes.

772
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:36,596
Speaker 1: because if you had brakes You could just sit there on your brakes without going backwards and it would be no point to the race at all.

773
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,800
Speaker 1: So Is this cool video that shows a really sort of dramatic race?

774
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:53,018
Speaker 1: And you know the stronger buffer dude is dramatic But other than the very end it looks like two kids playing a dumb game with their bikes Exactly, which is why track racing I think is not that popular in the u.s.

775
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:56,412
Speaker 1: However When they do go behead hitting.

776
00:43:56,472 --> 00:43:56,814
Speaker 1: that's right.

777
00:43:56,854 --> 00:44:00,940
Speaker 1: when they do go fast They do go incredibly fast like oh my god fast.

778
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:14,485
Speaker 1: Now the other thing about this is I actually looked up, you know by you know I was researching and I found out about this other kind of track racing called the care in and it's in Japan and The way the care in works is.

779
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:19,100
Speaker 1: you actually have like say I think eight dudes maybe and they all race at once.

780
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:22,160
Speaker 1: But the way it works is to prevent the going slow and the stupidness.

781
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,494
Speaker 1: There's a motorcycle and the motorcycle goes in front of them.

782
00:44:25,615 --> 00:44:26,760
Speaker 1: It's not like a Harley, right?

783
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,467
Speaker 1: it's like a you know a bicycle but it's motorized and He that guy will pace the race.

784
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:36,540
Speaker 1: So he basically they go around one lap and you're not allowed to pass the motorcycle.

785
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:37,546
Speaker 1: That's the only rule.

786
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:43,717
Speaker 1: you can't pass the motorcycle and the first lap He'll go like 20 miles an hour and then 40 at what kilometers?

787
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:44,280
Speaker 1: now, right?

788
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:48,118
Speaker 1: Every lap he'll speed up and then on the final lap or two, right?

789
00:44:48,782 --> 00:44:50,499
Speaker 1: He'll just get out of the way and you can go nuts.

790
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,699
Speaker 1: so basically everyone speeds up gradually to a ludicrous speed and

791
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,301
Speaker 0: Then

792
00:44:56,642 --> 00:45:08,993
Speaker 1: and then everyone gets let loose and sometimes is amazing high-speed crashes which are epic And sometimes it's just a really fast awesome race where like eight dudes are on bikes go in like 50 kilometers an hour All right, maybe even 70.

793
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:09,760
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

794
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,030
Speaker 1: So here's some awesome track bike racing videos.

795
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,280
Speaker 1: and if you want to be a track bike racer, that's totally awesome.

796
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:16,783
Speaker 1: Go for it.

797
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:19,980
Speaker 1: Keep that fucking bike off the street and get one with fucking brakes.

798
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:20,562
Speaker 0: You know what?

799
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:24,700
Speaker 0: I gotta look for on YouTube now videos of hipsters on track bikes hurting themselves.

800
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:27,428
Speaker 0: That would be totally out there gonna make compilation.

801
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,211
Speaker 0: Yep.

802
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:34,373
Speaker 0: So pig with the face of a boy Is it just genetically modified or was a band?

803
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:44,479
Speaker 0: Okay in the UK Alright and they made a music video that is entitled a complete history of the Soviet Union arranged to the melody of Tetris.

804
00:45:45,263 --> 00:45:47,754
Speaker 0: This is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

805
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:49,160
Speaker 0: This is fucking awesome.

806
00:45:49,281 --> 00:45:51,479
Speaker 0: Like this is way off the hook.

807
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,227
Speaker 0: How off the hook could it be one?

808
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:57,727
Speaker 0: the production values are super super super high like it is Amazingly, well, that's I guess.

809
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:01,040
Speaker 1: I guess pig with the face of a boy is a popular band like the big.

810
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:04,080
Speaker 1: Or is it like an okay go situation?

811
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,546
Speaker 0: I really can't tell.

812
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:21,940
Speaker 0: but this is like it's off the hook that the quality is so amazing Like it looks really really professional and not only is the song good and the video good But it really is the history of the Soviet Union as set to the melody of Tetris and furthermore the metaphor of Tetris.

813
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:27,740
Speaker 0: You know building these walls that disappear as you complete them never finishing.

814
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:34,852
Speaker 0: Your only options are to play forever and achieve nothing or die trying Yeah, and apply that to the Soviet Union.

815
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:43,229
Speaker 0: and it goes through, you know The czar all the way up to perestroika And they today are all the czar the last czar.

816
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,572
Speaker 1: Oh, that's where it starts.

817
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:47,360
Speaker 1: It starts right around with Nicholas the second.

818
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:49,027
Speaker 1: Yes, see I won't.

819
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:52,746
Speaker 1: why does it start with like Peter the great and shit you're missing all the good stuff I've in the terrible.

820
00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:53,912
Speaker 0: there was no Soviet Union.

821
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:59,920
Speaker 0: Catherine the also great Starts with you know, the advent of the Soviet Union and the Bolshevik Revolution.

822
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,049
Speaker 1: It's not the history of Russia is the history of the Soviet Union.

823
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:03,731
Speaker 1: Yes.

824
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:18,197
Speaker 0: Okay, but every section of the song Covered like it's weird It embodies the the sentiment of that era and like what Russia was like but is also like a video period piece like it looks like video looked from that era

825
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:18,779
Speaker 1: and it's

826
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,079
Speaker 0: Stylized like it's from that era and like Russia in the 80s and Russia in the 50s and Russia's in the 20s

827
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,730
Speaker 1: The video keeps getting better and better.

828
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,455
Speaker 0: the video looks better and better But it looks better and better in the stylized way and it ends with Putin and it.

829
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,446
Speaker 0: this is fucking brilliant And I think everyone's got to see this.

830
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:36,314
Speaker 1: So if we were gonna make history of the u.s.

831
00:47:36,776 --> 00:47:40,183
Speaker 1: In You know starting I guess with 1776 right.

832
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,338
Speaker 1: So what song would we do?

833
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:44,862
Speaker 0: We need a song.

834
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:47,089
Speaker 1: what would video look like in 70?

835
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:48,594
Speaker 0: we need a song that looks.

836
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:49,256
Speaker 1: think about that.

837
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,285
Speaker 1: film is older than the Soviet Union.

838
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:56,199
Speaker 1: well Soviet Union is also dead but Film is not older than the United States.

839
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:57,708
Speaker 0: But they could do those silver prints.

840
00:47:57,768 --> 00:48:00,020
Speaker 0: even back then and in the Civil War we had photography.

841
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,089
Speaker 1: There are no silver prints of George Washington.

842
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we didn't have those then.

843
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:04,640
Speaker 0: so you know what?

844
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:09,547
Speaker 0: It's just black and then it's just paintings maybe Yeah in the beginning.

845
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:11,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got to come up with a song there.

846
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,265
Speaker 0: Remember, it can't just be a good song And it's be a good song that we cover.

847
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:28,785
Speaker 0: that itself is a metaphor for everything that the United States stands for across all Of its eras from a video game cuz the lyrics are like I am the man who arranges the blocks and it's This is this is fucking brilliant.

848
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:32,555
Speaker 0: All right, so we've played a whole bunch more games at PAX.

849
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,992
Speaker 0: Oh Sweet and I don't.

850
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:40,280
Speaker 0: yeah You know anything to say about the games we played.

851
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:42,548
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to remember because they were all video games.

852
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:48,469
Speaker 1: in this huge blur because the expo hall was double big Hall, I keep saying off the hook.

853
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,800
Speaker 0: my friend Conrad I think infected me with that phrase.

854
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,519
Speaker 0: But if anything at PAX was off the hook it other other than the omega-thon finale.

855
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,209
Speaker 1: Yeah The omega-thon finale was on the hook.

856
00:49:02,013 --> 00:49:03,319
Speaker 0: It was only on the hook for the winner.

857
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:12,494
Speaker 0: Anyway, if anything at PAX other than the omega-thon finale was off the hook It was the expo hall PAX East and the previous PAX Prime.

858
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:24,843
Speaker 0: the expo hall was awesome But there were like two to four like big tall like crazy boots and everything else was awesome But it was like kind of smaller and normal This year.

859
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:34,360
Speaker 0: it seems like everything in the entire place was just like gigantic Like every booth was crazy tall and filled with spectacle everywhere you went spectacle.

860
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:39,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the thing is a lot of the spectral was for things I didn't know about or care about, you know.

861
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:43,076
Speaker 1: And then even some of the things I completely ignored.

862
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:50,089
Speaker 1: later I found out that they might have actually been good and some of the things I paid attention to that I thought might be good and maybe we're not as good.

863
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:53,200
Speaker 1: I found, you know, it was like ah disappointing.

864
00:49:53,462 --> 00:50:05,700
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna talk about the expo hall We're just gonna talk about the games we saw that stood out beyond the spectacle in the expo hall Except of course Duke Nukem forever because Duke Nukem forever.

865
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,640
Speaker 1: I played it technically so we can talk about it, but that is probably only time we'll ever be played in the history of the world.

866
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:14,275
Speaker 1: It's an elaborate scam and it wasn't the full thing.

867
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:14,717
Speaker 1: We should demo.

868
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:15,220
Speaker 1: it doesn't count.

869
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,640
Speaker 0: I was talking to people in line to play it, you know, I went in and just played it.

870
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:21,580
Speaker 1: You know when you go in that room, they just gas you and rape you.

871
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,591
Speaker 0: No, the guy in line like he was talking to his friend.

872
00:50:23,611 --> 00:50:25,240
Speaker 0: He's like, I don't think the games in there.

873
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,140
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna tell us to lie to everyone else and give us a t-shirt and some money.

874
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:39,260
Speaker 0: No, they gave me a t-shirt and some steroids But the spectacle of that booth is worth noting because it had it was a solid black booth.

875
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:41,769
Speaker 1: You couldn't see anything that was going on inside.

876
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:45,643
Speaker 1: So that was like adding to sort of the mystique of oh, oh what's in here?

877
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:56,300
Speaker 0: all around the outside was security guards and this long queue and These portraits of Duke Nukem much much like the portraits of George Washington on the civilization booth.

878
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:00,195
Speaker 0: I would not mind having one of those portraits in my apartment as a poster.

879
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:02,522
Speaker 1: I'd buy one Astronaut.

880
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:03,264
Speaker 1: one was pretty good.

881
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:07,660
Speaker 0: So was the one with him accepting like every possible award ever at the same time.

882
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:09,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was also.

883
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,942
Speaker 1: they had two things, you know The things.

884
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:13,609
Speaker 1: you put your face in it and then have a picture.

885
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,020
Speaker 0: It was Duke Nukem with two Catholic schoolgirls.

886
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:19,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you could put your face in the Catholic schoolgirl and have your photo.

887
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:19,876
Speaker 1: take it that it.

888
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:20,900
Speaker 0: that sounds really horrible.

889
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:23,607
Speaker 0: They also had a whole bunch like this.

890
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:24,590
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

891
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,117
Speaker 0: But inside I did play Duke Nukem forever.

892
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:28,100
Speaker 0: I played it.

893
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,265
Speaker 0: I've actually played that game.

894
00:51:29,305 --> 00:51:29,687
Speaker 0: John St.

895
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:30,993
Speaker 0: John was like, hey rim, come on in.

896
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:31,656
Speaker 0: I skipped the line.

897
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:32,460
Speaker 0: I stood there.

898
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:34,129
Speaker 0: I watched them talk about it.

899
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:35,115
Speaker 0: And then I played it.

900
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:40,385
Speaker 0: I urinated in a urinal and It was exactly what I expected.

901
00:51:40,505 --> 00:51:51,540
Speaker 0: it's really fucking dirty and really really tasteless in this kind of hilarious Homage kind of like how Duke Nukem 3d was almost this like homage to schlocky horror movies.

902
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:56,454
Speaker 0: This was sort of homage to like Duke Nukem itself.

903
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:57,817
Speaker 0: It's like this meta thing.

904
00:51:57,837 --> 00:52:03,400
Speaker 1: I Kind of I think I'm actually gonna buy it maybe not right away because I don't think the multiplayer is gonna go anywhere.

905
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:05,312
Speaker 0: But I don't know cuz Duke Nukem 3d.

906
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,680
Speaker 0: It's a fucking awesome multiplayer.

907
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:12,060
Speaker 1: But I do want to play all the single-player just to see all the stuff that I know is gonna be crude.

908
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:17,120
Speaker 1: But I will also find it hilarious and I'll probably buy it when it's like 20 bucks on Steam or whatever.

909
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,012
Speaker 1: See, it's almost late.

910
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:27,048
Speaker 1: through the whole thing It's almost a period piece because remember because I haven't had enough a single-player FPS action lately, you know I mean It's pretty much valve is the only one still cranking that.

911
00:52:27,088 --> 00:52:33,799
Speaker 0: so remember the 90s when video games that were violent like that was the thing Like oh my god Mortal Kombat on the Sega with the blood code.

912
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:36,840
Speaker 0: This game is like homage to that era.

913
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:43,055
Speaker 0: specifically I Feel like the whole game is just saying hey remember those days check this out hookers.

914
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,760
Speaker 0: Oh my god She's giving you a blowjob and the Duke's just saying Duke stuff the whole time.

915
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:57,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't actually go in to play it but I saw enough of it to know that it was real.

916
00:52:57,156 --> 00:52:58,160
Speaker 1: people actually played it.

917
00:52:58,643 --> 00:52:59,450
Speaker 1: I looked inside.

918
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,519
Speaker 1: I saw people playing it.

919
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,134
Speaker 0: Remember when I said hey, I gotta go and I ran down.

920
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:03,879
Speaker 0: that was when I went in.

921
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the Duke just texted me is like, hey, you want to see you want to come in.

922
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:11,693
Speaker 0: and I was like, okay Yeah, and the the booth babes were funny because they were.

923
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:15,434
Speaker 1: they were being very Want to talk about the booth baby.

924
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:17,560
Speaker 1: This is the first year of packs booth babes.

925
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,860
Speaker 0: Well save it for the proper review of packs.

926
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:28,379
Speaker 0: But suffice it to say there were booth babes at many of the things and Duke Nukem I think had more booth babes than everyone else combined.

927
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:42,259
Speaker 0: But when once the fanboys were gone like they let him into the next room and then it's just like us and like all the People who work for the company's involved in Duke Nukem forever The booth babes totally stopped smiling and are checking their Twitter and like, oh my god.

928
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:42,849
Speaker 0: Yeah.

929
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:45,364
Speaker 1: So did you?

930
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:48,214
Speaker 1: um, did you play any the packs 10 games?

931
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:49,840
Speaker 0: I played a whole bunch of them.

932
00:53:50,302 --> 00:53:51,690
Speaker 1: I don't have anything really.

933
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:58,380
Speaker 0: they all were really interesting But I didn't have anything really to say about them other than the meat game was really fucking hard.

934
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, the meat that's the one I wanted there.

935
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,380
Speaker 1: a couple I wanted to talk about.

936
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,284
Speaker 1: I don't wanna talk about all the meat.

937
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,772
Speaker 0: game was advertised like hell.

938
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:05,460
Speaker 0: I came with that comic book in the bag.

939
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,465
Speaker 1: Right super meat boy, right looks like a really fucking good platform game like oh damn It's really good, but it's like.

940
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:15,614
Speaker 1: it's not a puzzle platformer, which seems to be all the rage these days.

941
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:17,178
Speaker 1: It's a real platformer.

942
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:28,677
Speaker 1: aware Incredibly precise jumping is necessary and it is hard as balls Like you must jump precisely and with perfect timing and the right place in order to get past these levels.

943
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:34,238
Speaker 1: and you know since you're made of meat you can sort of slide on the walls and that's what makes it a little bit interesting.

944
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,300
Speaker 1: and I think I think I might buy it when it comes out.

945
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,239
Speaker 1: It's gonna come out for pretty much all the downloadable so you can download it on Xbox Wii or PC.

946
00:54:42,742 --> 00:54:44,753
Speaker 1: I guess not PlayStation, you know, that's.

947
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:45,900
Speaker 1: I think that's gonna be a good one.

948
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:48,773
Speaker 1: The other ones that looked interesting were the Retro City rampage.

949
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:48,994
Speaker 1: You see?

950
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:54,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, that looked awesome Like it looked like the old Grand Theft Auto's mixed with passage.

951
00:54:54,282 --> 00:54:57,580
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, it's basically it's the original Grand Theft Auto games, right?

952
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,846
Speaker 1: Not too many people have played them.

953
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,620
Speaker 1: A lot of people have only played the 3d ones, but I hate the 3d ones.

954
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:06,571
Speaker 1: I only really like the old 2d ones Especially the London one which I think not many people like or have played.

955
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:10,586
Speaker 1: where there it's a top-down 2d game I love when I'd good voice act.

956
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:23,862
Speaker 1: the original Grand Theft Auto was a top-down 2d game And this is basically the exact same game as that only obviously newer But it has 8-bit graphics whereas the original Grand Theft Auto games had DOS graphics it also.

957
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:30,826
Speaker 0: what I noticed at least playing it a little bit was that the cops were smart and the AI like it felt like Those cops had a plan.

958
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:45,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though the game was only 8-bit Style graphics not actual 8-bit but pixelated retro styling the game play was ultra modern Like way better than any Grand Theft Auto 2d game ever, you know.

959
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,320
Speaker 1: And you can like go in all the buildings and there was stuff in there and the cops just chase you in and a corner.

960
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:52,710
Speaker 1: It is damn good.

961
00:55:53,212 --> 00:55:53,995
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to that.

962
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,260
Speaker 1: It's gonna be we only though.

963
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,413
Speaker 0: So speaking of top-down 8-bit style and games now, we're gonna get.

964
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:08,440
Speaker 0: uh, we're gonna have an interview about this But we played this game that is basically 8-bit top-down Lupin the third mixed with Grand Theft Auto.

965
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I it's called Monaco.

966
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:15,120
Speaker 1: I've known about it for a while So when I saw it there, I really wanted to play it bad badly and I did.

967
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,267
Speaker 1: But we're gonna interview the creator.

968
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,658
Speaker 1: So I don't want to devote too much time to talking about it.

969
00:56:20,683 --> 00:56:27,859
Speaker 0: So we got to the expo hall kind of early and we played it with two other people and it was super fun But it blue-screened the first time we played it.

970
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,611
Speaker 1: That's why don't we save this for the time?

971
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,703
Speaker 0: we talked to the guy now But we can do.

972
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,752
Speaker 0: it's the unbiased geek nights opinion.

973
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:36,792
Speaker 0: before we have him on to moderate our view I was gonna talk about the blue screen.

974
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,730
Speaker 0: when he was on the show I tried to blue-screen it again and I couldn't.

975
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:41,740
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure their PC just overheated.

976
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:43,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably that's what it felt like.

977
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:44,289
Speaker 1: anyway.

978
00:56:44,389 --> 00:56:52,226
Speaker 1: next to it was a game that was incredibly popular called spy party Which I didn't get a chance to play but it was kind of like the ship but it was more from what I heard.

979
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:56,122
Speaker 1: the way it works is this like a sniper and there's and there's a whole bunch of People and

980
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,366
Speaker 0: the sniper has one bullet

981
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:09,237
Speaker 1: and the sniper has one bullet and the other person is the spy the secret agent and they're Trying to do accomplish a mission Without giving away the fact to the sniper that they are the spy because the sniper will shoot them.

982
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:19,609
Speaker 1: if they shoot the sniper shoots The right person then the sniper wins But the sniper shoots the wrong person or misses then or if the spy does what they're supposed to do Right, then the spy wins and it's it's.

983
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:27,518
Speaker 1: it seems like a much better execution of Sort of the ship Concept by limiting it to such that narrow focus of the sniper.

984
00:57:27,638 --> 00:57:34,400
Speaker 0: and yes But I feel like if it does well what they could do is take that Focused like perfected game and make that a part of a larger game.

985
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:35,484
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.

986
00:57:36,046 --> 00:57:38,756
Speaker 1: Like if it was a give us three things in sequence like a three-parter.

987
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:39,780
Speaker 1: I would that be cool.

988
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:49,119
Speaker 1: Oh if you took that sort of style of thing and mixed it with like rescue the embassy mission It basically is it a lot of it is I think now that I think about it.

989
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:51,764
Speaker 0: Rescue the embassy mission.

990
00:57:51,804 --> 00:57:52,967
Speaker 1: Yeah rescue the embassy mission.

991
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:53,890
Speaker 1: Why don't we?

992
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,056
Speaker 1: there's a fucking egregious the unrealized potential.

993
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:57,119
Speaker 1: Where's the new version of a?

994
00:57:58,461 --> 00:58:00,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would only chemco was my man.

995
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:02,579
Speaker 1: rescue the embassy missions got to come back.

996
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:04,525
Speaker 1: Let's just do it.

997
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:06,131
Speaker 1: Let's just make a modern version of rescue.

998
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:08,320
Speaker 0: So we also know this was cool.

999
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:19,760
Speaker 0: There was a game called jam city roller girls and it is basically the real rules of roller derby Plus a little bit of Mario Tennis mixed in Mario Kart Mario any Mario sport.

1000
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I think that the the logic there.

1001
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,620
Speaker 1: we talked to these guys quite a bit for like five or ten minutes.

1002
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,715
Speaker 0: They actually is frozen code base and they actually had a real roller derby team the rat city roller girls.

1003
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:32,480
Speaker 0: They're like hanging out.

1004
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:39,930
Speaker 1: Yep, and basically we learned about roller derby recently from Luke Crane who you know and friends who are heavily involved With the Gotham City roller girls.

1005
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:41,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, Luke Crane, you know the guy who rode.

1006
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:50,900
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I knew the roller derby was girls roller rollering guys So - I asked, you know, they rollerskate in a circle and they hit each other.

1007
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,502
Speaker 1: That's all I knew.

1008
00:58:51,522 --> 00:59:03,459
Speaker 1: but he apparently there was a change in roller derby some years ago to where instead of using the bank track They just do it in a gym on a flat surface which makes it much more accessible and a lot more people can do it in different places.

1009
00:59:03,479 --> 00:59:05,566
Speaker 1: and The rules changed.

1010
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,980
Speaker 1: and actually he told me the rules and just based on a pure theory.

1011
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,164
Speaker 1: It's way awesome.

1012
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:14,032
Speaker 1: Like because you're playing offense and defense simultaneously.

1013
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,560
Speaker 1: go look up the rules of roller derby and watch some of it on YouTube.

1014
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,484
Speaker 1: It's totally sweet.

1015
00:59:17,544 --> 00:59:21,600
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna you know, get more involved in it when I have more free time at least be a spectator.

1016
00:59:21,821 --> 00:59:25,718
Speaker 1: It says something about roller derby when plus we have a team to go check out.

1017
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:26,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

1018
00:59:26,341 --> 00:59:28,861
Speaker 1: It's not like we have to go figure out what team to root for But

1019
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:39,237
Speaker 0: anytime you can take a sport and turn it into a video game and the rules are awesome for a video game Independently of a sport like if you remove the athleticism and make it just about the rules of the game.

1020
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:40,180
Speaker 0: It's still a fun game.

1021
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:43,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game looked pretty good too when it's their first like big effort.

1022
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:49,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently they had made a bunch of other games before on contracts to other people But they really wanted to make this game on their own.

1023
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:55,020
Speaker 1: So they did it and it's gonna be on the Wii as a downloadable You know WiiWare game and it's bit, you know.

1024
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,028
Speaker 1: They had to add something to it to make it a little bit more appealing to the rest of the world because they made it a pure simulation Which I guess they thought about doing.

1025
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:05,200
Speaker 1: it would really only appeal to people who already knew and cared about roller derby.

1026
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,220
Speaker 1: So they added some Mario Kart to it, you know.

1027
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:13,194
Speaker 1: So you can like put a boost to go faster and you know do like a big magical hit to freaking crush someone that kind of stuff.

1028
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:16,448
Speaker 1: But yeah, this game actually looks like it's gonna be.

1029
01:00:16,468 --> 01:00:20,240
Speaker 1: at least it'll be equivalently fun to like Mario soccer.

1030
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,785
Speaker 1: I think you know Mario well.

1031
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:25,336
Speaker 1: Mario strikers like that level of game if that's you're looking for.

1032
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:27,590
Speaker 0: so sadly There's a ton of other stuff.

1033
01:00:27,611 --> 01:00:29,665
Speaker 0: that was in the expo hall But it didn't like.

1034
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:33,179
Speaker 0: I'd either didn't play the games or I wasn't gonna stand in line to play the games.

1035
01:00:33,783 --> 01:00:36,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean for example portal too, right?

1036
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:36,800
Speaker 1: I mean it was there.

1037
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,900
Speaker 1: It was looking awesome from what I saw on one of the video screens, but you know what?

1038
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:44,195
Speaker 1: I'm not waiting in line to play a game that I'm gonna buy no matter what.

1039
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:49,484
Speaker 0: Yep, like Civ 5 I could have waited in that line forever to see but I'm I mean It's already on my computer.

1040
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:51,912
Speaker 0: if I could crack that fucking encryption.

1041
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:52,333
Speaker 0: I could play.

1042
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:54,380
Speaker 1: now one week from today is Civ 5.

1043
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,598
Speaker 0: By the way, yeah, their gig nights is done on that day.

1044
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:06,241
Speaker 0: The gig nights will be a 24/7 stream of me explaining my strategy as I play Civ 5.

1045
01:01:06,241 --> 01:01:07,386
Speaker 0: You think we're fucking joking.

1046
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,172
Speaker 0: you think this is some sort of game.

1047
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,040
Speaker 0: even my co-workers they know me.

1048
01:01:11,443 --> 01:01:15,431
Speaker 0: I was like, yes if I've comes out, you know Like it's actually gonna come out and my boss is like.

1049
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,757
Speaker 0: so you're gonna take like a month off.

1050
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:24,639
Speaker 1: Yeah Mom I've learned a long time ago Well a beer or two ago that taking a day off for a video game is a bad idea.

1051
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:26,291
Speaker 0: That depends on the game one.

1052
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:27,500
Speaker 0: You can't mess it up.

1053
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:31,497
Speaker 0: You don't want to take the 21st off if the game unlocks at midnight that night.

1054
01:01:31,778 --> 01:01:32,140
Speaker 1: That's true.

1055
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:34,860
Speaker 0: You also don't want to take the day off for an alpha or a beta.

1056
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:35,704
Speaker 1: That's also true.

1057
01:01:35,724 --> 01:01:37,612
Speaker 0: If I had taken the day off for the NS alpha.

1058
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:39,199
Speaker 0: I might have cried myself to sleep.

1059
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:42,675
Speaker 1: That's a waste of a day off I play.

1060
01:01:42,736 --> 01:01:45,310
Speaker 1: so far The thing is in the history of gaming right.

1061
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:49,840
Speaker 1: there has never been a single day Where I've never actually taken a day off for a game.

1062
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:51,808
Speaker 1: There has never been a single time.

1063
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:56,246
Speaker 1: I have considered it though and every time I considered it in retrospect It would have been a bad idea.

1064
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:57,251
Speaker 1: It never would have.

1065
01:01:57,271 --> 01:01:59,120
Speaker 1: I never regretted going to work.

1066
01:01:59,240 --> 01:01:59,722
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

1067
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:04,380
Speaker 0: think about the fun, especially a single-player game like this where it's infinite.

1068
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:13,020
Speaker 0: It's not like portal where two hours and you've played it, but this if I take the day off It's not like I'm spending my entire Saturday in the apartment playing this game.

1069
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:16,753
Speaker 0: I have this day with nothing but Civ 5.

1070
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:17,877
Speaker 1: Here's the problem, right?

1071
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:21,256
Speaker 1: Problem number one You have to assume the game will actually come out in the morning.

1072
01:02:21,336 --> 01:02:26,840
Speaker 1: number two If you do the no take the day after off take okay, so even if you do the next day, right?

1073
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,289
Speaker 1: Maybe the game will be all buggy because it's the.

1074
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,636
Speaker 1: it's just at the release time.

1075
01:02:30,736 --> 01:02:31,500
Speaker 1: Is it really gonna work?

1076
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:31,904
Speaker 0: You know what?

1077
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:32,228
Speaker 0: I'll do that.

1078
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:32,978
Speaker 0: I'll just go into work.

1079
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:37,560
Speaker 1: Also, you need all your friends to take the same day off for a single-player game.

1080
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,920
Speaker 0: I gotta play a day's worth of Civ 5 before I start the multiplayer game.

1081
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,988
Speaker 1: It was a single-player game.

1082
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,466
Speaker 1: just bring your laptop to work and play it Probably can't play that game.

1083
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,120
Speaker 0: What I'll have to check my laptop.

1084
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:51,560
Speaker 0: It does okay with Civ 4 but it runs the battery out in like an hour and a half.

1085
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:57,720
Speaker 0: If you're gonna be sitting at your desk at work So plug it in and the video kind of stutters and I had to turn off a lot of the effects.

1086
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,620
Speaker 1: Yes, the thing is you can play it at work next to your work on your laptop your personal laptop.

1087
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,568
Speaker 0: Nah, I don't think my laptop can do it.

1088
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:05,150
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1089
01:03:05,171 --> 01:03:05,934
Speaker 0: I gotta try.

1090
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,460
Speaker 1: you can go buy a new laptop.

1091
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:11,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could buy a new laptop and then Play it next to your work.

1092
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:17,460
Speaker 1: My laptop's got like three more years of use though I would I would my laptop had more use too, but I bought a new one anyway.

1093
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,491
Speaker 1: But this one is definitely gonna last many years.

1094
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,135
Speaker 0: There's no doubt.

1095
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:27,913
Speaker 0: I'm holding off though I think I'm gonna get two more years out of this laptop because you know Unless it breaks now that I don't have the commute on the train anymore.

1096
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:29,920
Speaker 1: All you use it for is like presentations and stuff.

1097
01:03:30,261 --> 01:03:33,250
Speaker 0: I don't even need my laptop to be small anymore.

1098
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:36,560
Speaker 0: My laptop is something I bring to like conventions for display.

1099
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:37,651
Speaker 1: Small is still better.

1100
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:38,540
Speaker 1: I would not get a big one.

1101
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,430
Speaker 0: I don't need a gigantic one, but I don't need like.

1102
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:44,220
Speaker 0: I don't need it to be tiny tiny tiny and weigh nothing.

1103
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,218
Speaker 0: In fact size matters more than weight.

1104
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:48,090
Speaker 1: now I was still would not buy a 15 inch.

1105
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,278
Speaker 1: 13 inches pretty much the man.

1106
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,340
Speaker 0: I would be willing to buy a 13 inch that weighed a fuck ton more and was more powerful.

1107
01:03:54,882 --> 01:03:57,632
Speaker 0: Because now I'm not carrying it everywhere, but you wouldn't.

1108
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:00,929
Speaker 1: but sitting is if you're not carrying it everywhere You're never using that power.

1109
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:09,810
Speaker 0: because the thing is you know I use my laptop for I travel somewhere and I have a computer where I am or I'm on a plane or I'm on a boat, right?

1110
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:15,290
Speaker 1: So you in fact it'd be a better idea to just get a netbook which would be even lighter and he has not gonna place it.

1111
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,796
Speaker 1: Five that's true.

1112
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:21,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, but maybe by the time that this laptop is dead If six a netbook will place it.

1113
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:24,002
Speaker 1: five six six six won't be.

1114
01:04:24,183 --> 01:04:28,921
Speaker 0: I I'm loving though like much like the pictures of the Duke Those pictures of George Washington and Bismarck.

1115
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:30,930
Speaker 1: I need that as my wallpaper, but I can't find it.

1116
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:33,260
Speaker 1: I could find other George Washington's and other Bismarck's.

1117
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,590
Speaker 1: they have a Bismarck wallpaper on the official sit by website Yep, but they don't have the George Washington and they don't have him pointing.

1118
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:43,095
Speaker 1: I looked if you're searching Google Images for like Civ 5 Washington He's there but he's not pointing.

1119
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:54,148
Speaker 0: but the the style be like art deco style like I kept walking over to the Civ 5 booth like All right, that's enough about that.

1120
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,698
Speaker 0: What we didn't get to see rage.

1121
01:04:56,758 --> 01:04:58,606
Speaker 0: I kind of wanted to see that but we totally missed.

1122
01:04:58,646 --> 01:04:59,530
Speaker 1: I totally missed it.

1123
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a new game FPS from id software.

1124
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,784
Speaker 1: That's probably a skill based FPS.

1125
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:05,490
Speaker 1: Yeah kind of interested in that.

1126
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:08,942
Speaker 1: What other there was that firefall which I didn't even look at.

1127
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:11,271
Speaker 1: cuz I saw a big booth and I'm like firefall Whatever.

1128
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:13,479
Speaker 1: that sounds like shit and it had a big booth and whatever.

1129
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:16,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what it was actually apparently tribes.

1130
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,649
Speaker 1: ish.

1131
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,936
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of disappointed.

1132
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:20,390
Speaker 1: I didn't look at it, but it wasn't tribes.

1133
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,558
Speaker 0: No, I just remember when we did egregiously unrealized potential.

1134
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:29,045
Speaker 0: as soon as I said tribes to about a quarter of the audience went all tribes.

1135
01:05:29,574 --> 01:05:32,783
Speaker 1: There was a game called Brink.

1136
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:45,110
Speaker 1: well I knew about brink because I saw some videos before the packs that talked about how it has an interesting thing to help noobs figure Out what to do sort of like giving them mini quests like hey go heal this guy or hey go defend this area.

1137
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,627
Speaker 1: Right and they would help the noobs out if they didn't know what to do.

1138
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,189
Speaker 1: But I went to watch it.

1139
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:56,494
Speaker 1: So we're standing there watching other people play because I wasn't about to wait in line and they basically were spending like five minutes Customizing their characters.

1140
01:05:56,515 --> 01:05:57,077
Speaker 1: I was like, okay.

1141
01:05:57,097 --> 01:05:57,217
Speaker 1: Fuck.

1142
01:05:57,237 --> 01:06:03,311
Speaker 1: I don't want to watch this Lego universe Which is an MMO very disappointing.

1143
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:09,340
Speaker 0: Oh, here's here's what's wrong from a distance Just looking at someone else playing for more than five seconds.

1144
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:09,901
Speaker 0: It is.

1145
01:06:10,202 --> 01:06:15,256
Speaker 0: it is entirely obvious why this game is completely not worth bothering with and that answer the.

1146
01:06:15,437 --> 01:06:22,900
Speaker 0: the reason you're able to determine This is that the Lego characters are Lego characters and the enemies are Lego characters and there's Lego stuff around.

1147
01:06:23,301 --> 01:06:25,430
Speaker 0: The ground was brown MMO dirt.

1148
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:29,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't Lego ground Because the world is not Lego.

1149
01:06:29,225 --> 01:06:33,760
Speaker 0: It is just a generic MMO where you collect Lego pieces and then build Lego shit in your sand.

1150
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,540
Speaker 1: It's really not really a generic MMO.

1151
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:37,647
Speaker 1: It's more of an action MMO right?

1152
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:41,720
Speaker 1: because it's basically like Lego Star Wars Lego Indiana Jones Lego Batman.

1153
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,807
Speaker 0: They go Harry Potter not worth play.

1154
01:06:43,827 --> 01:06:45,413
Speaker 1: It's exactly that game.

1155
01:06:45,815 --> 01:06:47,340
Speaker 1: You know that game you've played it, right?

1156
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:56,298
Speaker 1: It's that exact same game only Everyone in the world is playing it all at once in one spot And the only cool thing about it is that you can customize your own Lego guy your

1157
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:58,286
Speaker 0: avatar Just wait until with any

1158
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:08,379
Speaker 1: Lego piece and apparently you collect Lego pieces while by playing the game and you can take those Lego pieces back to a Private area where you can make anything you want out of Lego.

1159
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:15,260
Speaker 1: But it's like the whole game should be one shared area where anyone can make anything out of Lego and everyone has infinite Legos.

1160
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,988
Speaker 0: Imagine if I make my Lego clan and I build.

1161
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:24,654
Speaker 0: we build a castle out of our own fucking Lego and that is our base And people attack us and steal our Lego to make their own Lego base.

1162
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:25,760
Speaker 1: That should be the whole game.

1163
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:26,502
Speaker 1: That's it.

1164
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:27,445
Speaker 1: That's all they needed to do.

1165
01:07:27,485 --> 01:07:32,360
Speaker 1: make one giant world where everyone can make anything out of infinity Legos anywhere.

1166
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:36,399
Speaker 0: So if you want if you think at all, I should play the Lego MMO.

1167
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:43,518
Speaker 0: No Just get like Lego Star Wars and Minecraft and World of Warcraft and between the three door fortress and war fortress.

1168
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:46,720
Speaker 0: between those four You will get everything that Lego whatever has to offer.

1169
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,708
Speaker 1: What other games are going there?

1170
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,140
Speaker 0: Nothing else really stands out in my memory to be honest.

1171
01:07:51,602 --> 01:07:55,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did other than the games we played like the board games and stuff.

1172
01:07:55,401 --> 01:08:00,560
Speaker 0: There was crazy gaming Thursday before the con like all day in the Sheraton Lobby.

1173
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:05,400
Speaker 1: Oh, the Sheraton Lobby was basically like but is where packs like it was like an extra tabletop area.

1174
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:11,858
Speaker 0: So before pack started gaming after packs ended gaming Monday, there were people gaming Sunday people gaming after the con.

1175
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:12,740
Speaker 0: I'm worried.

1176
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:16,495
Speaker 0: We want to do an after-party like a for real after party like all.

1177
01:08:16,535 --> 01:08:17,438
Speaker 1: let's call the red line.

1178
01:08:17,459 --> 01:08:18,389
Speaker 1: I'm telling you We don't know.

1179
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,788
Speaker 0: Here's the problem It's not over the holiday this year.

1180
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:24,240
Speaker 0: Are people gonna not stay all day Sunday?

1181
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:28,194
Speaker 1: No, let's just do the Thursday night to be safe as a trial Thursday night trial.

1182
01:08:28,214 --> 01:08:30,000
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, this is critical.

1183
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,723
Speaker 0: We're on the show.

1184
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:31,005
Speaker 0: Now.

1185
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:34,420
Speaker 0: Are we gonna commit to something like we've committed to in the past?

1186
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,920
Speaker 1: No, we're not committing because we don't know how much it's gonna cost.

1187
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:45,340
Speaker 1: but okay, let's see what it would cost to get a ballroom with Rented tables and chairs rectangular tables six to eight chairs each.

1188
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,774
Speaker 0: I wonder if I can get the Sheraton now out from under pack.

1189
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:48,520
Speaker 1: You don't want to do that.

1190
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,207
Speaker 1: We don't want to interfere with packs, right?

1191
01:08:50,247 --> 01:08:50,791
Speaker 1: We want to get.

1192
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:52,096
Speaker 1: let's go to one of the other.

1193
01:08:52,318 --> 01:08:56,595
Speaker 0: imagine this So we get the Sheraton ballroom for Thursday and then cuz coo remember there's the problems.

1194
01:08:56,656 --> 01:08:57,640
Speaker 1: I'll just take it from us.

1195
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:03,404
Speaker 0: No There was that other stupid convention that was in the way on Thursday that he couldn't get rid of if we got it and they Needed it.

1196
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:07,106
Speaker 0: We'd be like, here you go Yeah, yeah, what's that gonna do?

1197
01:09:07,346 --> 01:09:07,647
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1198
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:08,149
Speaker 0: I'm looking.

1199
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,939
Speaker 1: I'm poking around but check the nearby hotels that are at the Sheraton.

1200
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,091
Speaker 0: We can talk about this off the show.

1201
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,015
Speaker 0: get a ballroom.

1202
01:09:16,055 --> 01:09:23,944
Speaker 0: what we need to say Officially is that if it is feasible we will run a non sanctioned pre-party.

1203
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:25,951
Speaker 0: and if that works, what's a pre?

1204
01:09:26,032 --> 01:09:28,359
Speaker 1: it's a pre packs tabletop event.

1205
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,899
Speaker 1: It's a pre packs prime party and we're looking for sponsors.

1206
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:34,625
Speaker 1: Anyone who wants to sponsor this?

1207
01:09:34,645 --> 01:09:37,613
Speaker 1: we're looking at you RPG tabletop game companies.

1208
01:09:37,995 --> 01:09:47,898
Speaker 0: more importantly if this succeeds Then I guess packs prime 2012. if it's back on Labor Day, then we're gonna do it after packs instead of before maybe both both.

1209
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,426
Speaker 0: Oh, man Why not?

1210
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:51,060
Speaker 1: why just one half just all week?

1211
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,455
Speaker 0: Why not just make a pack store in Seattle cuz it wouldn't be crowded all week.

1212
01:09:54,817 --> 01:10:00,973
Speaker 1: It might be It'll be Thursday night and Sunday night after packs closes from like 7 p.m.

1213
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:02,076
Speaker 1: To midnight both times.

1214
01:10:02,217 --> 01:10:04,243
Speaker 1: That's a good schedule All right.

1215
01:10:04,303 --> 01:10:06,911
Speaker 0: So this was not obviously a review of packs.

1216
01:10:06,971 --> 01:10:08,957
Speaker 0: This was a review of the games at packs.

1217
01:10:09,218 --> 01:10:09,980
Speaker 0: We will soon.

1218
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,700
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say when we love a show.

1219
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:17,060
Speaker 1: I guess this sort of voids the the Opening part where we talked about how we were gonna talk about packs in the second half of the show.

1220
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:17,442
Speaker 1: We're gonna

1221
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:35,660
Speaker 0: talk about it in the second half of this show, which is a two-parter Though I do want to give a couple of shoutouts to Robert Greg Khalil Matt Graham Molly 23 And I'll have a reasons why I was shouting out to you and I'll shout out to more people in the next show.

1222
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,610
Speaker 0: But you guys rocked it for us.

1223
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:45,137
Speaker 0: Every single Aaron Z is shadow Every goddamn enforcer and everyone we played games with was awesome.

1224
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:52,260
Speaker 0: at no point Did anyone I interact with in any capacity annoy bother or offend any of my senses ever?

1225
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,305
Speaker 0: Yep, and I hate to say that.

1226
01:10:54,345 --> 01:10:59,583
Speaker 0: I have to say that but I have to say that because other game dramatic theory and anime Conteo.

1227
01:10:59,623 --> 01:10:59,864
Speaker 0: lady.

1228
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:00,145
Speaker 0: Yip.

1229
01:11:00,788 --> 01:11:01,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're sorry.

1230
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:05,945
Speaker 0: We couldn't come to your wedding reception, but your husband Steve are omega.

1231
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:06,707
Speaker 0: not I'm sorry.

1232
01:11:06,748 --> 01:11:10,140
Speaker 0: You lost in the first the random round, which is bullshit.

1233
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:11,327
Speaker 0: Zombie dice.

1234
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:13,260
Speaker 1: Oh, let's talk about zombie dice for a sec.

1235
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:18,440
Speaker 0: Zombie dice is a random odds game, but Steve Jackson is brilliant and he's going to make boatloads of money off.

1236
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,043
Speaker 0: he already did.

1237
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:26,371
Speaker 1: I mean the thing with zombie dice is it is a random game completely random, but it Is a lot of fun for I think gate.

1238
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:28,319
Speaker 1: This is what micro hoolick said, right?

1239
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:33,060
Speaker 1: He easily it's a lot of fun for a fucking cup full of dice and it is right is really fun.

1240
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:41,051
Speaker 1: And the thing is the first time I played nobody told me that the green dice have more brains and the yellow dice have a kind Of even and the red dice are all shotguns.

1241
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:42,440
Speaker 1: No one told me that right?

1242
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:45,819
Speaker 1: So if I would have known that I would have done much better on my first few playthroughs.

1243
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:52,324
Speaker 1: So if you play zombie dice, remember if you've got a lot of green brains out and you're right Then you want to stop rolling.

1244
01:11:52,364 --> 01:11:57,020
Speaker 1: if you've got like a red and yellow brains fucking roll, baby roll and you'll get more brains.

1245
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,402
Speaker 1: That's how it goes.

1246
01:11:58,904 --> 01:12:01,210
Speaker 0: So pecs review proper will be coming.

1247
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:07,338
