1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,179
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday May 23rd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,070
Speaker 1: We go back to German games for a bit and review an old standby Alhambra.

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,587
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:23,281
Speaker 0: So I'm kind of bored at work with no work to do.

5
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:30,990
Speaker 1: as I've said many many times before I Don't have any work to do yet, but that's because I've been working at my new job a grand total of two days.

6
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at least you're not bored out of your gourd.

7
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,327
Speaker 1: No it's awesome.

8
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:38,490
Speaker 1: actually today I went to the data center like the main data center for my company.

9
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:45,950
Speaker 1: Now I have to say I mean I worked at IBM, and you'd think IBM would have like these crazy awesome data centers.

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,961
Speaker 0: No, I think they have mad old shit.

11
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:59,285
Speaker 1: the data center I was in for my company was probably the most well organized well documented well labeled Perfectly put together well staffed awesome data center.

12
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:05,321
Speaker 1: I've ever seen in my life Like I think I stumbled on a gold when I took this job.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,410
Speaker 0: God damn you see you think it's gold, but here's the thing right?

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,573
Speaker 0: On the one hand you have IBM a company that's incompetent and all you do is bitch and moan about how they could be doing Things.

15
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,709
Speaker 0: the way the company you work for now is doing them.

16
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:24,609
Speaker 0: But then there's the other situation where if they were doing things the way that your company does them you have no work to do.

17
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:33,085
Speaker 1: Well actually no I have a lot of work to do because there's the big difference between where I'm working now Which is kind of a normal company in IBM at IBM.

18
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:34,370
Speaker 1: It was a factory environment.

19
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:38,956
Speaker 1: I wasn't doing the fancy client facing you know Igs blah blah blah.

20
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:45,941
Speaker 1: I was doing the keep the factory running at all cost thing Which meant that my only job was retroactive.

21
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,005
Speaker 1: It was never proactive.

22
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,270
Speaker 1: I never made anything better.

23
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,850
Speaker 1: I just fixed things that were broken and maintain the status quo.

24
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:53,558
Speaker 1: The only goal was keep it working.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,309
Speaker 1: here the goal is always make it better make it better make it better.

26
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,270
Speaker 1: if you think of Something cool make it better mm-hmm, but how can it be better if it's already so great because they're doing more?

27
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:03,355
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

28
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:11,708
Speaker 0: All right, so anyway being bored at work I my new hobby is to turn on Skype and set it to Skype me mode.

29
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,890
Speaker 1: now It's funny because Emily did that by accident when she first got Skype.

30
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,853
Speaker 1: She had it set to.

31
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:25,360
Speaker 1: you know Skype me instead of just I'm online and I was talking to her over You know and she said these weird people keep trying to talk to me.

32
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,869
Speaker 1: I Think the same people were trying to talk to you.

33
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:38,299
Speaker 0: So first of all if you go on Skype and you search for users that have Skype me mode enabled There are very few like a handful.

34
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,223
Speaker 0: you can count them.

35
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:49,450
Speaker 0: There's so few yet Skype advertises in the bottom right corner that they're like six million people online With less than a hundred of them have Skype me mode enabled.

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:59,209
Speaker 0: so If you turn on Skype me mode the number one Category of people that will try to talk to you by the text or voice are Chinese people.

37
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:06,429
Speaker 1: It's insane Chinese people or Chinese people who only speak Chinese People from China.

38
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:08,875
Speaker 1: Do they speak English?

39
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,850
Speaker 0: I only talked to one of them and they barely spoke English.

40
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:20,263
Speaker 0: It seems like everyone who messages me even if they're from a foreign country Which most of them are like 90% of the people are from foreign countries.

41
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,329
Speaker 0: They want to speak English.

42
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:39,490
Speaker 0: So today the two best calls I got one of them wasn't a call it was a text just a chat with some truck driver from Ohio and He Seemed like he didn't like truck driving and he was bored and lonely and I was like, alright, whatever

43
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:42,280
Speaker 1: Did he want to make the hot online man love with you?

44
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,569
Speaker 0: You know, he didn't go that far, but he's like.

45
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,938
Speaker 0: You know, he started out with like a or hunk.

46
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,162
Speaker 0: I'm like, okay.

47
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,068
Speaker 0: Whoa, and then he was like.

00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,533
Speaker 0: so he did I know.

49
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:58,561
Speaker 0: and then he was like, hey your roommates risk a cuz he he was you know He my link to my flicker was in there.

50
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,990
Speaker 1: Oh god, wait a minute.

51
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,810
Speaker 1: So because of you some guy was ogling me, I guess and it was like you about it.

52
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,043
Speaker 0: He was like a roommate who had his shirt off and I'm like whatever.

53
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,417
Speaker 0: and then he's like Where are the pictures of you with your shirt off?

54
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:16,469
Speaker 0: I'm like, alright, if you're if you want some porn You can just search for it on Google.

55
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:26,232
Speaker 0: You don't have to Skype me and waste my time Wow, so Then the best one was these two German guys Email.

56
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:26,653
Speaker 0: they come.

57
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:30,266
Speaker 0: they conferenced me in so I was talking to two German guys and one guy.

58
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,470
Speaker 1: you asked him about board games.

59
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,400
Speaker 1: Yes, did you ask them if you're saying bevagung odoric schlagen Z.

60
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:35,003
Speaker 0: No, I didn't.

61
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:35,545
Speaker 1: you should have.

62
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,135
Speaker 0: I already knew the answer to that one but you know They were like they.

63
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,168
Speaker 0: their English is really bad and they knew it and they kept talking to each other in German.

64
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:44,670
Speaker 0: a whole bunch.

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,186
Speaker 0: I was trying to figure out what they were saying, which I did a mediocre job of.

66
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:52,961
Speaker 0: yeah, and Then they would like ask me a question and I would answer it.

67
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:58,742
Speaker 0: and then I tried to ask them some questions and I was like Brett spiel.

68
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:05,628
Speaker 0: well Like they were like, uh, and I was like board game Brett spiel.

00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:28,936
Speaker 0: Yes.

75

Speaker 0: Oh nice.

00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,609
Speaker 0: Not every time I said something they liked they were like nice nice.

77
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,792
Speaker 1: You know, I've heard that like the f1 people seem to say that a lot of them He was.

78
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,303

Speaker 0: the other guy was like I don't he does.

84
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:49,310
Speaker 1: you should have told him to watch.

85
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,295
Speaker 1: Listen to geek nights.

86
00:05:50,998 --> 00:06:01,319
Speaker 0: I don't think they barely understood me Like we could only use words that were the same in both languages Or it wouldn't work like names of video games.

87
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,130
Speaker 0: Like they were like 1.6 or source and I said both.

88
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,965
Speaker 0: That was how far it went and then eventually I got bored.

89
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,790
Speaker 0: I just hung up on him, you know You could probably get him to listen anyway.

90
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,330
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll note that we seem to be once again more popular with foreigners than we are with Americans.

91
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:24,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we thought for all of you we just got and if you're listening It's awesome because I know you're trying hard.

92
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,370
Speaker 1: We got a listener in Bangkok who was complaining that he speaks English properly.

93
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,263
Speaker 1: Yeah, he speaks English better than some of you fools in the forums now.

94
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,489
Speaker 0: No offense, but mr Period won't be hurting him anytime soon.

95
00:06:35,131 --> 00:06:41,514
Speaker 1: but he was complaining because apparently Libsyn doesn't allow resume and all this stuff and He's in Bangkok.

96
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:48,208
Speaker 1: He doesn't have the best internet connection to the US Nope, but he's listening to geek nights anyway, and he's trying to download it.

97
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:49,994
Speaker 0: Keep going man.

98
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,419

Speaker 0: we're gonna have to start doing the Akamai to get people so everyone in the whole world can listen All right.

102
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:08,384
Speaker 0: So some news is some news is it's video game day, right?

103
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:09,086
Speaker 0: Well, it's a day.

104
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:14,809
Speaker 0: It's some DS news in Europe, I think It's your news.

105
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:28,290
Speaker 1: So apparently the DS light is gonna come out here in June, I think yeah I'm really I want one, but I shouldn't waste the money especially because I'm not sure when my first paycheck's coming, but I want one.

106
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,680
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, when are you getting paid real soon?

107
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,423
Speaker 1: It's bi-weekly.

108
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,448
Speaker 1: So at most it'll be three weeks All right.

109
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,961
Speaker 0: So I don't want you to be without money for too long.

110
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:39,641
Speaker 1: if I'm without money for too long you pay rent once and then I pay you back when I get my giant check.

111
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:43,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Plus I'm getting a check from IBM Thursday.

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,224
Speaker 0: No, that's good.

113
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,489
Speaker 1: I might get one next Thursday, too.

114
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,413
Speaker 1: Ooh, all right.

115
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:56,392
Speaker 0: So Europe apparently is not only getting the DS light, you know, I think in July I didn't look but they're also getting a black DS light Huh?

116
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:58,177
Speaker 0: Why does Europe get the black DS light?

117
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:58,538
Speaker 0: How come we?

118
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,082
Speaker 1: don't my best guess?

119
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:03,090
Speaker 1: This is accomplices rims speculation time.

120
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:15,870
Speaker 1: I think that they've realized that the DS and Nintendo in general doesn't do so well in Europe But a lot of things don't do so well in Europe mainly because Europe is kind of the last place finish of video gaming.

121
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,187
Speaker 0: It seems like anywhere that's not Japan or the US is all PC gaming action.

122
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:20,589
Speaker 0: Mostly.

123
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,751
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean look at the PlayStation 3 it's gonna be the equivalent of over $800 in Europe.

124
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:28,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean god damn All the games come there late.

125
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,590
Speaker 1: all the movies from the West and from Japan get there late.

126
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,499
Speaker 1: They really get the stick end of the stick.

127
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,929
Speaker 0: Europe should make more of its own stuff.

128
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,251
Speaker 0: You know what?

129
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:37,015
Speaker 0: I think it is though.

130
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:40,409
Speaker 0: I think the problem is they get our stuff late and we get their stuff never.

131
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean many Americans aren't interest interested in anything foreign.

132
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:48,785
Speaker 1: I know some punk kids where if you told them anime was Japanese.

133
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,609
Speaker 1: They'd probably freak out.

134
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:53,854
Speaker 0: Guess what?

135
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,520
Speaker 0: All your video games are Japanese - yeah Possibly Korean.

136
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:06,624
Speaker 1: Yep But I could see this is Nintendo trying to do like a a little olive branch to Europe saying hey Here's something just for you.

137
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:12,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've also got this Weird European DS commercial.

138
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,397
Speaker 0: you can go watch.

139
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,904
Speaker 0: that looks like a clothing fashion commercial.

140
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,930
Speaker 0: only the people aren't wearing as many clothes.

141
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:22,030
Speaker 1: See it could also be part of the fact that they you know, you have to market to Europe differently.

142
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,050
Speaker 1: I mean they know how to market to the US and they know how to market to Japan.

143
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:28,089
Speaker 1: I mean look at the commercials here versus Japan and how different they are.

144
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's weird that they're actually trying in Europe.

145
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:33,184
Speaker 1: You know what?

146
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:37,238
Speaker 1: No other video game company tries So well, no console video game company.

147
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:43,049
Speaker 1: So in Nintendo's trying to you know, blue water strat blue ocean They're trying to open up to as many people as possible.

148
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:54,489
Speaker 1: If they even nothing else all the Americans in the Japanese will try to get this black DS Early and then the sales numbers will look like they were sold from Europe and then antenna will take the lead over there to.

149
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,593
Speaker 1: yeah You know also

150
00:09:56,633 --> 00:10:09,450
Speaker 0: they're gonna put out a new Nintendo's in Europe with like a new dog and then it's sort of like the best hits where they took the most popular dogs from all the existing ones and Added like a Dalmatian and they put it out in Europe.

151
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,534
Speaker 0: They're gonna do that too.

152
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:15,070
Speaker 1: I think this is the beginning of a push by Nintendo to penetrate the European market.

153
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,044
Speaker 1: We'll see if it works and I did not mean any sexual metaphor there.

154
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:26,290
Speaker 1: I Don't know if it's gonna work You know, I mean look how they're doing now, I mean brain age and all these games for non gamers.

155
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,590
Speaker 1: I think those are the games they're really gonna push in Europe to try to make the DS sell more.

156
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:32,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't think people in Europe care about games at all.

157
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,983
Speaker 0: They have better things to do because they're in fucking Europe where there are things to do.

158
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,321
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, they can live their lives They don't have to work.

159
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,781
Speaker 1: For all of you European listeners.

160
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:46,590
Speaker 1: I'll just let you know that Americans I don't think you realize how little vacation time and free time we get in this country.

161
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:57,104
Speaker 1: None I get a month as in four or twenty thirty days of vacation a year And that's really kind of crazy that I get that much right now.

162
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:58,870
Speaker 0: I get ten days at IBM.

163
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,359
Speaker 0: I got five next year.

164
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,948
Speaker 0: I'll have fifteen days five.

165
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:08,550
Speaker 1: Imagine if you got five days off a year, you know plus weekends and a few holidays.

166
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:10,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus the holidays.

167
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,029
Speaker 1: we get off for the crap ones when everyone gets them off and you can't go anywhere because everyone's trying to go somewhere.

168
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard we.

169
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:20,281
Speaker 1: it's hard for us to go on trips like.

170
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,253
Speaker 1: it's hard for us to say let's pop off to Europe and Backpack for a month.

171
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:28,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're in Europe, you can just take trains to the other countries to see all the castles and shit.

172
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,481
Speaker 0: We can't see castles.

173
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,673
Speaker 0: No, there's no nice Over here.

174
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,018
Speaker 0: There is nothing nice here.

175
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,922
Speaker 1: We've got a castle.

176
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:34,645
Speaker 1: We've got banner.

177
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:35,810
Speaker 0: It's a shit castle.

178
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,841
Speaker 0: It's not a real medieval castle to shit post 1700 castle.

179
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:40,724
Speaker 0: Yeah 1800 castle.

180
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:41,285
Speaker 0: That sucks.

181
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,720
Speaker 0: I want to see some 1200 castle to its credit.

182
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,250
Speaker 0: It's an 800 castle to bannerman castles credit.

183
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:54,190
Speaker 1: It did explode and then burn down and now it is covered in poison ivy great and possibly wild animals.

184
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:58,129
Speaker 0: I want to go see the German castles and the Welsh castles.

185
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,990
Speaker 1: You know by night this time next year we have more money because we've kind of spent a lot of money lately.

186
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,742
Speaker 1: We should just go to Europe and meet all our listeners over there.

187
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:11,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there won't be Any podcast for like two weeks.

188
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:14,468
Speaker 0: They'll be one really long line.

189
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:18,070
Speaker 0: It's like here's what Rimmins got recorded while in Europe.

190
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:19,599
Speaker 1: Actually, I got a better idea.

191
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,110
Speaker 1: if things get bad enough in this country Can we stay with one of you guys out there in the free world?

192
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,238
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't think it's that free over there.

193
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:28,803
Speaker 0: It's just an illusion.

194
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could always go to Canada.

195
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's so much better.

196
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, it kind of is except for the weather.

197
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:35,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

198
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,649
Speaker 0: Why can't Canada be on the bottom?

199
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,079
Speaker 1: Yeah Because then it would be Mexico.

200
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:41,407
Speaker 0: Let's go to Mexico then.

201
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,803
Speaker 1: All right Yeah, we'd probably make a lot of money in Mexico's IT guys.

202
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:48,497
Speaker 0: We got to find some internets in Mexico The there's internet and learn some Spanish is.

203
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,110
Speaker 1: I know French a little I know Spanish.

204
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:57,563
Speaker 0: I can read a Spanish newspaper kinda Yeah, but I can't speak it a lot because I don't like.

205
00:12:57,603 --> 00:13:03,787
Speaker 0: if I see a word I can figure out what it means But I can't just come up with the word in my brain to say it.

206
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:08,070
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I'm a further step removed because I can kind of read a French newspaper.

207
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,962
Speaker 1: So then a Spanish newspaper is I can kind of read.

208
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,850
Speaker 1: I get almost nothing out of it.

209
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:20,466
Speaker 1: So you go to Canada and I'll go to Mexico All right, and then and then we'll wait for them to build that highway over the u.s.

210
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:21,028
Speaker 1: Between the two.

211
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:22,673
Speaker 1: good idea All right.

212
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:25,365
Speaker 1: I got a non video game news because there's no other video game news.

213
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:26,290
Speaker 1: I care about today.

214
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:35,090
Speaker 1: now Microsoft supposedly is going to take administrator rights away from most of their employees on their computers.

215
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:39,220
Speaker 0: Why would employees have administrator rights if they're not the network administrators?

216
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:44,532
Speaker 1: the vast majority of people who use Windows run it as administrator Always.

217
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,419
Speaker 1: you may not be called administrator.

218
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,170
Speaker 1: You might be called something else, but you're probably in the administrator group.

219
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,170
Speaker 0: You're basically root on your computer and that's bad for a zillion reasons.

220
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,030
Speaker 0: But because Windows sucks you need to do it that way or else it's incredibly frustrating and that's why Windows sucks.

221
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's not just Microsoft's fault.

222
00:14:01,103 --> 00:14:02,129
Speaker 1: It's kind of complicated.

223
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:08,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Microsoft made because Windows 3 1 and earlier had really no permission model at all.

224
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:22,050
Speaker 1: No You just you had a computer with NT early NT like NT 3 and such and even like early windows like Windows 95 You could futz with it to make a kind of log in as different users.

225
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:26,104
Speaker 0: Windows her work groups had it in the wussiest possible way.

226
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:30,518
Speaker 1: Yeah back with wins and all that Yeah, but even then it barely work barely worked.

227
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,789
Speaker 0: Remember when Windows 95 had that inbox on the desktop.

228
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:36,863
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, no one had an email system where that would work.

229
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:45,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know to this day But When they as they added they started adding security stuff and permission stuff kind of like what?

230
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,038
Speaker 1: Unix and Linux have only kinda.

231
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:51,830
Speaker 1: it's actually fairly robust and well done in terms of the concept.

232
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,150
Speaker 1: It's just really counterintuitive and annoying and not easy or trivial to use at all.

233
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:04,110
Speaker 1: Like I it's not easy if you don't know about computers to deal with Linux file permissions the first few times.

234
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:07,369
Speaker 1: It's a thousand times harder to deal with the windows ones.

235
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,892
Speaker 0: Well, that's because you know They came over.

236
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:15,076
Speaker 0: the Unix file permissions is lean years ago and there was nothing wrong with them and they haven't changed And they're not complicated.

237
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,421
Speaker 1: They're well documented too.

238
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just a number.

239
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,633
Speaker 1: Windows.

240
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:26,719
Speaker 1: don't don't even get me started on Windows file permissions File permissions, what are the versions for other things?

241
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:33,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have some stories about file permissions But they had the security model and it's gotten more and more robust over the years.

242
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:55,005
Speaker 1: but they've tried to make windows so that you don't have to run as administrator anymore or as root anymore, basically and One of the ways they've did this is they made a thing called run as where you can be a normal user But you can right-click on a program and say run this as administrator Because many programs need the access that administrator has usually

243
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,430
Speaker 0: when you're trying to install software.

244
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,822
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but there's a lot of software that was won't run at all.

245
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:00,825
Speaker 1: Unless you're administrator.

246
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:01,447
Speaker 0: Well, it's terrible.

247
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,230
Speaker 0: That's really bad.

248
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly I've seen stuff that won't install properly unless you're administrator.

249
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:12,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but lots of proprietary applications some office II things Earlier versions of narrow.

250
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,070
Speaker 1: you had to be administrator to burn.

251
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:21,858
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah all sorts of stuff and One Microsoft permissions are kind of wonky.

252
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,067
Speaker 1: So this run as thing doesn't work like at all.

253
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:26,350
Speaker 1: It's really useless.

254
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:32,289
Speaker 1: You still have to log in as administrator and you might as well just stay administrator because otherwise half the things you have won't work.

255
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:46,445
Speaker 1: Yeah to people who write programs for Windows Often don't understand how the permissions work or don't understand how to you know, write code Selena writing a program that needs administrator access to work for no other reason than that.

256
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,789
Speaker 1: They're stupid and they don't know any better.

257
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,828
Speaker 1: Microsoft yells at him They don't know or care.

258
00:16:51,272 --> 00:17:02,417
Speaker 1: But then Microsoft's thing is almost as broken and in the end You have to be administrator all the time or your Windows computer is almost useless and that leaves it Incredibly open to all sorts of security problems.

259
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:05,724
Speaker 0: because if anyone gets control of your computer run out there.

260
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:12,006
Speaker 0: the administrator and they have complete control Is if you were running as some other account and they got control of your computer.

261
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:13,210
Speaker 0: they couldn't do that much.

262
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, the worst they could do is ruin your user space.

263
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,490
Speaker 0: Oh, they deleted my my documents folder.

264
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if your user space is the administrator space then they're gonna raise your hard drive.

265
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,047
Speaker 1: This is base includes everything.

266
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,150
Speaker 1: Yeah every day.

267
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:32,650
Speaker 0: See now the real reason for this that I see design wise is that in Linux ever in Unix and any Nix?

268
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,569
Speaker 0: Everything is a file.

269
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,829
Speaker 0: Absolutely, everything is a file.

270
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:46,919
Speaker 0: So you only need to set a permission structure that deals with files and that can deal with everything devices Users everything because it's all files.

271
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,906
Speaker 0: See all you need is to control the files and Windows.

272
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:51,410
Speaker 0: It's not just the files.

273
00:17:51,631 --> 00:18:00,249
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of other things that aren't files and that makes it so that your permission structure has to be incredibly Complicated to deal with all sorts of different things

274
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:08,905
Speaker 1: Which also wouldn't be that bad Except that they don't document a lot of it because it's their proprietary secret internal closed source code

275
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,931
Speaker 0: and the implementation is really Crappy

276
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,641
Speaker 1: and kind of arbitrary kind of spotty.

277
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:19,928
Speaker 0: different things work in different ways for no reason Yeah, and the active directory and the domains don't help.

278
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, they work really well if you know what you're doing But if you know what you're doing.

279
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,985
Speaker 0: You probably hate them and if you try to do anything out of the ordinary it fucks up.

280
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:29,210
Speaker 0: and the worst is this is a?

281
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:37,922
Speaker 0: Problem I think my company has is that you know you have let's say you set up an active directory and a bunch of Windows 2000 clients by the book right.

282
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,410
Speaker 0: it's perfect glorious.

283
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,522
Speaker 0: Then you start to add something.

284
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:44,278
Speaker 0: well you add Let's say a printer a network printer.

285
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,368
Speaker 0: you add it by the book and everything's still cool.

286
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:59,561
Speaker 0: Then add maybe a file server still cool, then you go out and you get this proprietary device that your company needs say a Fancy machine and the machine needs to get on your active directory.

287
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:03,332
Speaker 0: well now you need to modify your active directory somehow to accommodate This machine.

288
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,620
Speaker 0: then you get another proprietary software.

289
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,329
Speaker 0: We have to modify your active directory to accommodate that.

290
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:08,690
Speaker 0: yeah.

291
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,301
Speaker 0: Then you start getting conflicts between the different accommodations.

292
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,088
Speaker 0: now other things stop working.

293
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,399
Speaker 1: so you got User needs Oracle database.

294
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,250
Speaker 1: I defy you to install Oracle database properly without being administrator.

295
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, or even use it.

296
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:35,709
Speaker 0: That's the thing is if it was written properly then I would as if I was a sales working at a company right and I had a User account that was not administrator, and I had a properly written Oracle database.

297
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,574
Speaker 0: as soon It doesn't exist, but let's say it did.

298
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:46,009
Speaker 0: I should be able to install it into my my documents folder into my user space With no one else on the computer having access to it.

299
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,899
Speaker 0: That's what you're allowed to do in Unix.

300
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,170
Speaker 0: you can install any software you want to your home folder.

301
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:56,163
Speaker 0: No one can stop you unless they decide that they don't want to let you write to your own home folder But that you know.

302
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:59,800
Speaker 0: you get the idea You can do anything you want in your little box.

303
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,939
Speaker 1: now despite this most corporations still don't give their users They're run-of-the-mill users administrative access you shouldn't?

304
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,989
Speaker 1: I have administrative access to my computer because I know what I'm doing.

305
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,752
Speaker 0: yeah They should.

306
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,854
Speaker 0: you can give them administrative access to the local machine But you should not not.

307
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:17,466
Speaker 1: even then most companies most companies give you nothing to your local machine.

308
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,661
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah Well it really depends a lot of the time.

309
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:21,446
Speaker 0: I mean remember.

310
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:25,147
Speaker 1: We're tech workers We see it from the entirely different side, and they usually accommodate us.

311
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:26,559
Speaker 0: well Yeah, but you know that's.

312
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,749
Speaker 0: that's besides the point now.

313
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:40,709
Speaker 1: I think this whole you know the actual news here is great because now Microsoft and Microsoft employees are gonna have to deal with all the brokenness of the windows Permission scheme which might drive them to try and fix it.

314
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:42,873
Speaker 0: It's if they got it.

315
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:44,338
Speaker 0: if they don't fix this in Vista.

316
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:45,181
Speaker 0: It's the end.

317
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:47,047
Speaker 1: It's the end for Vista anyway.

318
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:47,870
Speaker 1: I'm can I'm done?

319
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:49,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know, but it's the super end.

320
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:52,406
Speaker 1: I mean corporations aren't even gonna go to Vista.

321
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:53,550
Speaker 0: No no one is.

322
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,881
Speaker 1: They're probably gonna stay on XP.

323
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:55,910
Speaker 1: they might even hire people.

324
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,940
Speaker 0: You know who's going to Vista.

325
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:05,610
Speaker 0: the crazy Too much money buy a new computer every week from Alienware gamers because it's gonna provide some fancy words.

326
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:13,046
Speaker 0: You know what I'll keep playing Half-life 1 & 2 and the yuppies who you know gotta have all fancy gadgets that they don't use.

327
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,410
Speaker 1: you know we're kind of yuppies.

328
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,741
Speaker 0: We're not yuppie like those guys yeah, but we're young.

329
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,490
Speaker 1: we're upwardly mobile for professionals.

330
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:25,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, so so But we're not like those guys who are just like buying boats and shit.

331
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:28,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that's because we're not upper middle class.

332
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,915
Speaker 1: We're just middle class.

333
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:34,698
Speaker 1: mm-hmm if you combine us, but we're there's only if we combine our salaries But there's just one of us.

334
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:35,808
Speaker 1: then yeah, we're upper middle class.

335
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:46,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah anyway Microsoft is probably gonna have some trouble with this new policy, and I can't wait for the hilarity Microsoft employees will be pissed.

336
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:47,220
Speaker 1: I'm waiting.

337
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,842
Speaker 0: you know what though?

338
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,910
Speaker 0: what it's gonna happen is the Microsoft employees.

339
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:53,007
Speaker 0: They know how to hack windows because they get all the reports.

340
00:21:53,067 --> 00:22:03,210
Speaker 0: if he has the new Vulnerability and then they're just gonna start hacking their own machines it might And they're not gonna want to fix those vulnerabilities because then their own hacks won't work anymore, and it'll be funny.

341
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,047
Speaker 1: This is gonna be great all right.

342
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,336
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is pretty old.

343
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,663
Speaker 1: in fact It's real old.

344
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:18,942
Speaker 1: we saw it way back at RIT in like 2003 2004.

345
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:22,239
Speaker 0: So this is like a thing of the day of ancient times.

346
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:23,707
Speaker 1: It's more than I realized.

347
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:24,290
Speaker 1: it's so old.

348
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:30,864
Speaker 1: it was before we started doing geek nights And I don't know how many of you have seen it because it's kind of faded from The limelight.

349
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:35,779
Speaker 0: should we start doing archaeological things of the day we could do a thing of the day Dinosaurs.

350
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, right all right.

351
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,060
Speaker 1: This is a series of movies.

352
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,107
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll ever be completed, but there's four of them.

353
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:46,919
Speaker 1: the second one is in my opinion by far the greatest of them.

354
00:22:48,103 --> 00:23:01,980
Speaker 1: They are Mario the story done in a super overdramatic Really really dark and serious way, but with the original sprites Like the Mario one and doki-doki panic sprites.

355
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:08,713
Speaker 1: The only doki-doki panic sprites are the toads which they needed to use because there was no sideways facing toad in Mario 1.

356
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:12,230
Speaker 0: No There was only the front facing toad at the end of the level.

357
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,717
Speaker 0: who said the princess is another castle bitch?

358
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:15,700
Speaker 1: in the very least.

359
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:18,146
Speaker 1: Watch the second of these videos.

360
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:21,034
Speaker 1: the first one first works, but the second video is the best one.

361
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:27,965
Speaker 0: It's really really cool Yep, and if you already know as you've seen is already Yeah, it did show.

362
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:32,640
Speaker 1: I mean it shows the army of Koopa attacking the Mushroom Kingdom in an awesome way.

363
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:36,472
Speaker 1: It feels very much like the second Lord of the Rings movie hmm.

364
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:37,395
Speaker 0: Yeah.

365
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,259
Speaker 0: Yeah with the epicness Yeah, maybe giant army all right.

366
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:48,639
Speaker 0: so everyone knows about YouTube and We have a lot of things of the day that are specific videos from YouTube and/or Google video.

Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we got to get one of those Firefox extensions and lets us download videos from YouTube.

382
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

383
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,109
Speaker 0: It is pretty slow But what it's worth it.

384
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:02,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see to watch some of these old shows that aren't on DVD or won't be on DVD.

385
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:06,938
Speaker 1: the Super Mario Brothers show is Yeah, it's actually in the Netflix queue.

386
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,430
Speaker 0: I think it's actually in this giant box set you can get for like 20 bucks.

387
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, like eight discs all of the Mario Super Show 20 bucks 30 bucks.

388
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,090
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't remember.

389
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:22,790
Speaker 1: So we haven't talked about board games in a while mostly because there's been you know e3 and all this video game news lately.

390
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:29,830
Speaker 0: Yep, and recently the let's look at Mark Johnson who has the cool board games to go podcast.

391
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:39,610
Speaker 0: He meant she found discovered us and mentioned us in his podcast and so a lot of his listeners came over So we will entertain them with some board game talk that they have been no doubt awaiting.

392
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, now one of our favorite game.

393
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,490
Speaker 1: I mean we have we have a huge pile of games.

394
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,800
Speaker 1: We have more games than most people we know just piled up.

395
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:52,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course compared to super board game guys We got nothing.

396
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:55,204
Speaker 1: Well, partly because we don't really if a game sucks.

397
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:56,569
Speaker 1: We just get rid of it or we don't buy it.

398
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the only bad game we really have is Hellas.

399
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:01,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

400
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:04,323
Speaker 0: Yep, and Hellas is really small.

401
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:08,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, physically speaking I don't really like Ticket to Ride Europe, but it wasn't that bad.

402
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:09,846
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll sell it someday.

403
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:10,550
Speaker 0: I like it.

404
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:12,354
Speaker 1: I don't like it.

405
00:26:12,374 --> 00:26:13,558
Speaker 0: All right, whatever.

406
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:15,224
Speaker 1: I like railroad tycoon a lot more.

407
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a different kind of game though.

408
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,826
Speaker 1: But anyway, we realized that a lot of these games are so good.

409
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:21,730
Speaker 1: We play them so often.

410
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,249
Speaker 1: We never even thought to really talk about him on the show.

411
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:25,558
Speaker 0: I thought to talk about him.

412
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:31,828
Speaker 0: the problem is he kept talking about the new games We were acquiring and we never went into the backlog of games that we've had forever.

413
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:35,010
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, we haven't really talked about Puerto Rico Tigers and Euphrates.

414
00:26:36,172 --> 00:26:40,290
Speaker 0: No, none of those games that we've had for years that we played a zillion times.

415
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:46,508
Speaker 1: So we just we decided one game that I actually didn't play it this weekend, but all the rest of these fools did Alhambra.

416
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:57,746
Speaker 0: Alhambra is a game that we played a whole bunch and we got it and then we stopped playing it just because we didn't have An opportunity even though we tried to play a bunch of times and then finally this weekend.

417
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,050
Speaker 0: We finally got a game out.

418
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:03,150
Speaker 1: It's a real handy game because the man it's two to six players.

419
00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:07,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing with more players than that is something like Citadel.

420
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:08,170
Speaker 1: Citadel's.

421
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,080
Speaker 0: I think Scotland Yard is also two to six, right?

422
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,424
Speaker 0: I think so three to six.

423
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:17,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, so six players is pretty good.

424
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:28,054
Speaker 1: Of course, I don't recommend the two-player of Alhambra because it It added it gave us an inside joke Matt Yeah.

425
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:28,516
Speaker 0: All right.

426
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,221
Speaker 0: Let's start with that.

427
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:35,083
Speaker 0: Alhambra is a Yeah, Alhambra is a game where it's better to have more players.

428
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,430
Speaker 0: six players is best two players is worst.

429
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:46,744
Speaker 0: But if you play with two players, the way it works is you're actually playing a three-player game But the third player is an imaginary player.

430
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:50,900
Speaker 1: He's just some guy named Matt Yeah, the book actually names him as Matt.

431
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,930
Speaker 0: Yes, and Matt has a set.

432
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,010
Speaker 0: It's sort of like black check where the dealer just follows some rules and doesn't actually play.

433
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,210
Speaker 0: Matt is like the dealer in black check.

434
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:04,525
Speaker 0: He just follows the rules of Matt and makes the decisions that Matt makes.

435
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:05,388
Speaker 1: I don't think it really.

436
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,070
Speaker 1: it makes many.

437
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,898
Speaker 1: I think he just starts with a bunch of tiles.

438
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:10,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just starts with a bunch of tiles sits there.

439
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:21,324
Speaker 1: Yep He generally just makes the game crappy to play with Matt Mostly because I have to dig through the tile deck pull out X number of tiles do all this other stuff to the game before I can play it.

440
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:26,824
Speaker 0: yeah, so Basically you don't want even though Alhambra says two to six.

441
00:28:26,884 --> 00:28:28,490
Speaker 0: don't mistake it for a two-player game.

442
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:38,097
Speaker 0: The two-player game is a hack and it's not fun more unless you're in an emergency and you really have this insane Raging urge to play Alhambra.

443
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:39,761
Speaker 1: We've had that before.

444
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:42,750
Speaker 0: so yeah, we did play it with Matt once or twice.

445
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:43,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was terrible.

446
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:44,850
Speaker 0: Very terrible.

447
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:50,330
Speaker 1: All right, Alhambra is a very in terms of what you need to do and know an incredibly simple game.

448
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:51,613
Speaker 1: It has.

449
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,195
Speaker 1: there's money.

450
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:56,405
Speaker 1: there are four colors of money orange blue green and yellow.

451
00:28:56,446 --> 00:29:00,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like dinars ducats Somethings and somethings.

452
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:01,656
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

453
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:04,203
Speaker 0: I heard it doesn't matter four colors of money.

454
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:05,005
Speaker 1: and there's what?

455
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,630
Speaker 1: five or six colors of tiles.

456
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,594
Speaker 0: I think the six and You.

457
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:18,430
Speaker 1: the tiles are square and they have a color on them They have a price on them and they have one two, three four or zero wall segments on them.

458
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,655
Speaker 0: They have zero one.

459
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,986
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, they can't have four walls.

460
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:27,429
Speaker 0: No, they can't Have zero one two or three walls on them.

461
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:34,898
Speaker 1: and all you do on your turn is you either take some money from a money pool or Buy a piece and put it in your Alhambra.

462
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,930
Speaker 0: Now the gimmick of this game is that You don't have money like monopoly where you make change all over the place.

463
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,402
Speaker 0: You have cards with numbers and colors on them.

464
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:46,889
Speaker 1: You don't make change.

465
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:48,357
Speaker 0: So, let's say the only.

466
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,610
Speaker 0: let's say I have a card that says nine orange.

467
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:56,167
Speaker 0: It's a has a number nine and it's orange and I want to buy a tile that costs five orange.

468
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,598
Speaker 0: I Can't put the nine in and take four back.

469
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,470
Speaker 0: I have to pay with the nine and then take the tile.

470
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:13,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is if you pay with exact change Let's say I have a nine orange and the tile cost nine orange I buy it and then I get a free action.

471
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,040
Speaker 0: so I could buy something and then take money on the same turn or Buy two things and take money where.

472
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,323
Speaker 0: normally if you don't get any free actions Your turn is either buy something or take money.

473
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get one action per turn.

474
00:30:27,932 --> 00:30:30,222
Speaker 1: This is very much a game of when it's not your turn.

475
00:30:30,463 --> 00:30:31,729
Speaker 1: There is nothing you can do.

476
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:36,990
Speaker 1: Don't try to think about your strategy because all it'll do is piss you off.

477
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:42,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, really in Alhambra you have no decisions and no actions that you may take when it's not your turn.

478
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:44,113
Speaker 1: Absolutely nothing.

479
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:54,169
Speaker 0: pestering people of course pestering which is key and you know paying a ten counting other people's Alhambra's and how many colors Are and then to see if you're ahead or behind and what moves you should make in the future.

480
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,888
Speaker 0: But other than that, there's nothing you can do.

481
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:03,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the way the game works is every round you either draw money or buy an Alhambra tile or rearrange your Alhambra.

482
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,069
Speaker 1: But that basically means wow, I suck.

483
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,837
Speaker 0: Yeah This game is all managing actions.

484
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:09,563
Speaker 0: you get only one.

485
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,830
Speaker 0: you get this pretty much the same number of actions as everyone else.

486
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,098
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get more or less and less.

487
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:17,670
Speaker 0: by some miracle the game ends on a certain players turn.

488
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:22,388
Speaker 0: You know and oh my god, you get maybe one extra turn of actions by.

489
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:23,880
Speaker 0: you know Some stroke of luck.

490
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,949
Speaker 0: you can't count on that shit.

491
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:29,270
Speaker 1: Yep Scoring rounds are semi random as in they occur at semi predetermined.

492
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:42,310
Speaker 0: Yes about one-third of the way through the game There's a scoring round and about two-thirds of the way through the game of the scoring There's a mechanic of putting the scoring rounds triggering cards in the deck at certain places and then the deck of money.

493
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:43,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, the deck of money.

494
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:46,904
Speaker 0: So the more people take money the faster the scoring grounds come.

495
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,230
Speaker 1: now you take one action per turn.

496
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:56,949
Speaker 1: You can either take money because there are four money lying face-up and you can take any one money or any Number of money that are no more than five money's worth.

497
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:05,503
Speaker 0: So if there's a nine a six a two and a one out there you could take just the nine Just the six or you could take just the two or just the one.

498
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:07,570
Speaker 0: but you can also take the two and the one together.

499
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:08,895
Speaker 1: If there's all threes out there.

500
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 1: just cry yourself to sleep.

501
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:15,049
Speaker 1: Yes, the same as if there's all like fours Yeah, or you can buy an alambra piece.

502
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:22,189
Speaker 1: now the way to win is To have more than other people of the various colors of alambra pieces in your thing.

503
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:24,414
Speaker 1: So there were.

504
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:31,176
Speaker 1: there are different numbers of the colors in the bag because they're secret and they're different Point values for each color.

505
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:36,190
Speaker 1: purple is worth the most red is worth at least but there's more purple tiles and less red tile.

506
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,164
Speaker 1: Also purple tiles tend to be more aren't the blue tiles at least?

507
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:47,411
Speaker 1: the blue tiles at least blue Yeah, but the the better tiles the ones that there are more of and that are worth more points also tend to cost more Mm-hmm.

508
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:52,648
Speaker 0: So if you want there are like 11 towers in the game, but they all cost at least nine money.

509
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:53,350
Speaker 0: They're expensive.

510
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:56,370
Speaker 1: Also, we mentioned there's walls.

511
00:32:56,992 --> 00:33:03,512
Speaker 1: There's also a game of placing your Alhambra together because you start with one open piece and you put a little color thing that says Who you are on it.

512
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,970
Speaker 1: when you buy a tile you stick it on your Alhambra and the rule of that is that walls?

513
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,569
Speaker 1: cannot touch non walls.

514
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,139
Speaker 1: You cannot have holes in your Alhambra.

515
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,370
Speaker 0: Well, you can have a hole but you can't surround an empty space.

516
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:24,490
Speaker 1: Yes You can't have a full hole Yes, and you can't have a piece that a little dude couldn't walk to from any other part of your Alhambra.

517
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:38,460
Speaker 0: So if there was a purse an imaginary human being in your Alhambra and it was a real place He has to be able to walk from every place in your Alhambra to every other place in your Alhambra without Jumping over the table or jumping over a wall.

518
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,647
Speaker 1: and you can not rotate pieces.

519
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:42,850
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

520
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:51,097
Speaker 1: Unlike Carcassonne and The walls the other than making difficulty for you They are worth points.

521
00:33:51,418 --> 00:34:01,050
Speaker 1: every time there's a scoring round in addition to all the points people get for tiles Everyone gets one point for each wall segment in their longest exterior wall.

522
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:08,270
Speaker 1: Yep, so there are many games in one but the games don't interfere with each other too much as long as you plan ahead.

523
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,675
Speaker 0: Yeah Alhambra is really a game about planning.

524
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:21,889
Speaker 0: some people will try to make a giant wall and the thing about making a giant wall Is that you lock yourself in your Alhambra becomes has a giant wall surrounding it?

525
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,469
Speaker 0: And it becomes very difficult to add new tiles to it.

526
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,449
Speaker 0: So even if you have the money to buy tiles You have nowhere to put them in the Alhambra where they will fit.

527
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:31,324
Speaker 1: You'll see the people who fall for this trap.

528
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:38,760
Speaker 1: at the end of the game they're buying pieces and putting them in their sideboard and then spending action after action trying to get these pieces into the Alhambra by Moving things around

529
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:44,090
Speaker 0: and in the meantime They're not buying any new tiles or getting any new money and everyone else is and they lose.

530
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,429
Speaker 1: Anytime you waste an action in this game, you just drop down a peg.

531
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:54,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you ever have to rearrange your Alhambra or use the reserve board you're pretty much gonna lose unless by some.

532
00:34:54,716 --> 00:35:10,791
Speaker 0: the only time I can see using the reserve board is if you have such a Extra mounds of money and you have it A tile that you can buy on this turn that someone else who's right up on your ass on the scoring track really needs to Win.

533
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:21,250
Speaker 0: you can buy that tile to prevent them from getting it and then let's say it's a tile That's going to ruin your Alhambra or it won't get you any points by adding it to your Alhambra.

534
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,998
Speaker 0: Just stick it in your sideboard and you it won't matter.

535
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:28,090
Speaker 0: That's the only real time I can see the reserve pile being useful.

536
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:36,550
Speaker 0: Other than that if you have to use that reserve board you better be scoring a zillion points with that action or else.

537
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:40,990
Speaker 1: Now we said there were four colors of money and there are all these colors of tiles.

538
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:45,007
Speaker 1: The way you buy a tile is like we said you don't get change back you whenever.

539
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,454
Speaker 1: if you pay too much You don't get it back.

540
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:49,010
Speaker 1: If you pay exact change you get a bonus by having another action.

541
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:53,886
Speaker 1: there are four colors of money and there's a little board that has four spots with the colors on them.

542
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,698
Speaker 1: if A tile is sitting in the yellow spot.

543
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,329
Speaker 1: You can only use yellow money on it.

544
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:03,804
Speaker 0: This is what really messes with the game is because there's no way you could.

545
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:08,041
Speaker 0: you can know what tile you need But you have no idea what color of money you will need to buy it.

546
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:19,650
Speaker 0: So you have to either concentrate on a few colors of money and hope the good tiles show up there or Just keep taking all colors of money and have a nice wide spread.

547
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:22,207
Speaker 0: So no matter what tile shows up you might be able to buy it.

548
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:23,696
Speaker 0: Of course then you won't.

549
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,030
Speaker 0: you might not have enough to buy really expensive tiles.

550
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,020
Speaker 1: So now there there is.

551
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,459
Speaker 1: definitely is some luck involved in the game and you know Which tiles and which money come up when and in what order?

552
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's significant luck, but it's not out of control It's it's much.

553
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:44,290
Speaker 1: it's less luck than even poker because as long as you're making good decisions The luck can't screw you so much and you'll do well in the end anyway.

554
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:50,103
Speaker 1: And if you're a better player than your friends in aggregate, you'll win more often Significantly more often.

555
00:36:50,504 --> 00:37:00,769
Speaker 0: Yep, like people who don't know what they're doing in Alhambra will often take money when they don't need to or They will refuse to buy a tile for any exact change.

556
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,599
Speaker 0: Even when it gives them a huge advantage and score wise.

557
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:13,780
Speaker 0: or Maybe they'll hoard money hoping to buy a whole bunch of tiles, you know in the future But then they won't score in the first and second scoring rounds.

558
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 1: Actually, I've done that to great effect by ignoring the first scoring round.

559
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first scoring round you can ignore but you can't ignore completely.

560
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:26,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can ignore it a little bit, but the second scoring round you can't ignore anymore because there's too many points.

561
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,891
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the game is really fun.

562
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:30,798
Speaker 1: I really enjoy it.

563
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:36,299
Speaker 1: It starts to break down if everyone who's playing is very very very good at it.

564
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:50,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, if everyone is very very good at Alhambra and you're all playing together What ends up happening is the winner is determined by what money comes up Who draws what money at the beginning and what tiles show up when on which squares.

565
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,220
Speaker 0: because you can't do anything to anyone else.

566
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:55,919
Speaker 0: All you can do is do the best with what you get on your turn.

567
00:37:56,381 --> 00:38:10,340
Speaker 1: but luckily it has the Carcassonne effect of even though you have very few actual decisions to make during the game and The game is very much, you know You're affected a lot by what happens and what comes up on the board and what money or what pieces appear.

568
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:18,997
Speaker 1: certain people still tend to win the game a lot more often than other people and The luck is really mitigated by the skill and the decision-making in the strategy.

569
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:29,017
Speaker 0: Yep You're not gonna find a whole bunch of people who all have such a similar Strategy and thinking that they'll cancel each other out and the whole thing will come down to luck, but it could.

570
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:34,675
Speaker 1: it could happen Yep, and the game is definitely I mean Carcassonne is pretty much almost pure tactics.

571
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:36,140
Speaker 1: There's very little strategy involved.

572
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:53,879
Speaker 1: Alhambra is there's definitely a tactical element But it's much more strategic in that because there's so many turns and so many tiles even though you can't have a strategy turn to turn you can have a broad strategy and You'll be able to do it because the tiles will come up.

573
00:38:54,241 --> 00:39:00,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you come up with a really specific strategy, like I'm going to buy all the green tiles That's not gonna do it.

574
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:11,987
Speaker 0: a good strategy for Alhambra is I'm going to concentrate on the colors that other people don't concentrate on at least one of which will be one of the top Three colors of working points.

575
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:20,140
Speaker 1: Yep, or things like I'm gonna go after towers and such early in the game And then I'm gonna ignore them later in the game when everyone else is fighting over them and I'm gonna go.

576
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,599
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go after walls for the first two rounds ignore them in the third round stuff like that.

577
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:41,269
Speaker 0: Or I'm gonna take a whole bunch of money early on and only buy a couple tiles in the first scoring round So that when the second score ground comes around and I have a better idea of what people have I will buy the tiles that other people don't have to Maximize my points versus them.

578
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:43,380
Speaker 0: So no one will be competing with me on the same colors.

579
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:50,702
Speaker 1: There's also the strategy of taking money and using money in such a way that you get the most number of exact change purchases Mm-hmm.

580
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:53,633
Speaker 1: that is key and a lot of people really forget that.

581
00:39:53,714 --> 00:40:01,146
Speaker 1: or they'll see a piece and they want it so much They'll spend their money and buy it or they'll always take the big money when it comes up and they'll negotiate Like the little money.

582
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 1: that's really useful to make exact change.

583
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,980
Speaker 0: Well, the thing about big money and little money is that in general?

584
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:14,780
Speaker 0: But if you take the big money You can buy the big tiles and the people who take the big money all the time will get more big tiles and more points.

585
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:20,797
Speaker 0: But if you get enough exact changes you can beat that and that's really the way to win.

586
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:21,700
Speaker 0: is the exact change?

587
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found that the people who take the big money every time no matter what when it's there or when they need money They never have exact change.

588
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,017
Speaker 1: They never win either.

589
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:33,365
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you don't take the big money every time but let's you know Let's see if it you get.

590
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:35,959
Speaker 0: a look at what's in your hand when you take money is what it really is.

591
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:51,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you've got say a four in your hand and you have a choice between Eight and a nine Well, you're gonna take the eight instead of the nine because there are there tiles out there that cost twelve and not really so Many.

592
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:52,663
Speaker 0: the cost thirteen.

593
00:40:53,304 --> 00:41:02,080
Speaker 1: also if you see a situation like three one one are out there or two one one one It seems like whenever there's a situation like that people scoop it up.

594
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,204
Speaker 1: Of course cuz getting all those little cards is real great to fill in the cracks between your exact change making machine Yep.

595
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:11,142
Speaker 0: However, here's a good example from the game I just played.

596
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:16,140
Speaker 0: I started the game with two yellow ones, right and I didn't spend them ever.

597
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:19,269
Speaker 0: No the opportunity never came up to spend those cards.

598
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:31,280
Speaker 1: the other problem with that is if you take a bunch of money cards that now puts a bunch of new money cards out which either may trigger a scoring round or May allow someone else to take the money you actually wanted because now they have a choice.

599
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,520
Speaker 0: That's one aspect of the strategy of a lambda that I just ignore.

600
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:41,873
Speaker 0: I pay attention to the colors of the tiles the walls and The money and making sure I don't screw up my Alhambra and what other.

601
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:48,156
Speaker 0: I may pay attention to what other people have in their Alhambra, so I make sure mine isn't going to be competing with anyone who's too strong.

602
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:49,340
Speaker 1: See I count cards.

603
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,669
Speaker 1: I pay attention to who's spending what colors money.

604
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:53,957
Speaker 1: so I know who has money what color and who doesn't.

605
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:54,700
Speaker 0: I pay attention.

606
00:41:55,523 --> 00:42:00,896
Speaker 1: It's too much effort to pay attention that for me I don't keep it like specifically like I have no idea how much money someone has.

607
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:04,450
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I know I know trends like Pete's taking a lot of green money.

608
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:07,160
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I noticed that Scott's spending a lot of green money.

609
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:18,399
Speaker 0: I noticed when someone takes a specific color of money a lot or I can look and see when someone is very there's a tile That's sitting out on the board and I can tell when someone really wants it and just scoop it out from under him.

610
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:23,519
Speaker 0: Or I can tell when a money comes up that someone really wants that particular money and I'll take it.

611
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:24,565
Speaker 0: They don't get it.

612
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:27,200
Speaker 1: I really pay attention to when the scoring rounds are coming.

613
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:31,320
Speaker 0: I kind of pay attention when the scoring rounds are coming, but you know, it is sort of random.

614
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:41,100
Speaker 0: But I will look at the size of the deck and be like, okay the first scoring rounds coming up I often will take a bunch of money early on to try and blitz the first scoring round.

615
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:44,332
Speaker 0: That can work depending on what tiles show up.

616
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it once again That's a tactical decision more so than a strategic one.

617
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just kind of play it as it goes.

618
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:56,786
Speaker 0: every turn I look I see the four tiles I see the four money and I do the best I can Pretty much.

619
00:42:56,847 --> 00:43:03,815
Speaker 0: if I can buy something for exact change I'll almost always do it unless it's going to screw up my Alhambra origins to useless piece.

620
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:07,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, there isn't like sometimes someone else will have.

621
00:43:08,862 --> 00:43:14,480
Speaker 1: If everyone else has four three three and two towers respectively, you're not gonna buy that tower for exact change.

622
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:17,435
Speaker 0: I think that's all the towers in the game actually four five six seven eight.

623
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:18,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's eleven towers.

624
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,947
Speaker 0: I think so on three three three three.

625
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:25,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know buying the one tower won't help you unless it's got some really nice walls.

626
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:32,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think what happens is that the tiles that have more walls are cheaper than the ones that have less walls.

627
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:34,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they restrict you a lot.

628
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:45,050
Speaker 0: So the tile that has three walls on it the pink the tower with three walls is cheaper than the tile would note the tower With no walls, but they both count equally as towers.

629
00:43:45,812 --> 00:43:55,960
Speaker 0: So if you build your Alhambra really slick like You can fit the three walled pieces in without limiting your options and also make a nice.

630
00:43:56,502 --> 00:44:01,680
Speaker 0: You know don't go for the longest wall because you don't get special bonus points for longest wall.

631
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,770
Speaker 0: You get points for having a wall.

632
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,000
Speaker 0: So you just need to have your wall sufficiently long.

633
00:44:06,082 --> 00:44:14,525
Speaker 0: Yeah You know increases the gap between you and the other players because you're gonna get more points from the scoring rounds than you'll ever get From the walls ever though.

634
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:18,680
Speaker 1: I've seen people do very well with a wall heavy but not wall centric strategy.

635
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,780
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean there are people who they don't have so much in this car grounds.

636
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,254
Speaker 1: They just have this massive wall because it keeps getting points.

637
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:28,140
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yep, the wall will score points.

638
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:29,747
Speaker 1: No one can take those going around.

639
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:39,460
Speaker 1: basically if you can get a big wall in the first scoring round That's fantastic because that doesn't go away and in the first scoring round the wall is worth more than the scoring round is.

640
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:44,649
Speaker 1: I mean basically in the first round the first scoring round Every wall you have counts it.

641
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:51,040
Speaker 1: consider it three points because it's gonna be scored two more times Yeah, and then the wall becomes less and less valuable as the game goes on.

642
00:44:52,264 --> 00:45:01,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one good thing Especially because the wall tile the heavy wall tiles are cheaper and early in the game You have less money because you've been taking it for less time.

643
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:12,780
Speaker 0: you can buy the tiles that are wall heavy make a big wall without limiting yourself too much and Get a bunch of points and then the rest of the game buy the more expensive tiles to get the colors.

644
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 1: But the bigger wall you make the harder it is to expand later when you're buying a lot of tiles later.

645
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,251
Speaker 1: Yeah, I said later twice.

646
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:19,715
Speaker 1: Yeah

647
00:45:20,862 --> 00:45:33,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, if you make a stupid wall that you know cuts off like the top of your Alhambra and the left of your Alhambra Well now any tiles that were that need to be attached to the top or left You're not gonna be able to put him in.

648
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,111
Speaker 1: was it?

649
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,780
Speaker 1: you repeat who made the?

650
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,900
Speaker 1: Alhambra that basically had three of the three wall pieces and then there's a hole in the top and they were screwed.

651
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:42,464
Speaker 1: I think it was paid.

652
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,760
Speaker 0: I think I did it once or Pete did it once I don't know.

653
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:53,407
Speaker 1: I did something similar where I Didn't have any open spaces to the top or left of my Alhambra and all the pieces that were coming out only had holes For a top or left placement.

654
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:55,760
Speaker 1: No, I couldn't put anything in my Alhambra.

655
00:45:56,702 --> 00:46:04,254
Speaker 0: I think a good way to make an Alhambra is to just kind of stretch it out You know make it really long as you can and then sort of make branches.

656
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:09,913
Speaker 0: that way you can add any tile you want Onto the branches without needing to you know cut off.

657
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:15,120
Speaker 0: if you have a square Alhambra or you know Generally a blob then you can cut it off too easily.

658
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:22,340
Speaker 0: So if you make one that sort of branches out like a like a fractal You know just like a branch here to branch there.

659
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,360
Speaker 0: Then you can attach wall pieces to those without limiting your options.

660
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:32,480
Speaker 1: Yep, plus I mean my general strategy there is to always have at least one hole in every cardinal direction.

661
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:41,120
Speaker 0: Yep, I try to keep one hole in every cardinal direction and you know Sometimes I can't and I'm willing to sacrifice one if the tile is really important.

662
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:47,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially near the end of the game when I won't be getting many more tiles But early on I really try to keep it open.

663
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:53,817
Speaker 1: Yep, because it's sticking on one of those wall this tiles into a hole will just suddenly open your board up like crazy.

664
00:46:54,499 --> 00:47:04,959
Speaker 1: Yep Now in terms of rearranging your Alhambra We have yet to see an instance where doing it meant anything other than you fucked up earlier in the game And now you're losing.

665
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:16,060
Speaker 1: I've never seen someone win after rearranging the Alhambra ever because rearranging the Alhambra is the game Obviously is doing it as sort of a punishment, but you can still keep playing the game.

666
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,695
Speaker 1: You're not totally done, but you still can't win.

667
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:19,319
Speaker 1: it punishes you.

668
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:23,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can either take a piece from your sideboard and put it on your Alhambra.

669
00:47:24,762 --> 00:47:29,852
Speaker 1: Now if you put it in the sideboard, that means it didn't fit in your Alhambra Which means it's probably not gonna fit now either.

670
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:33,107
Speaker 1: unless you built a whole bunch of stuff You can swap it.

671
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:36,300
Speaker 0: if you you know, there might be some really ever tile.

672
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:40,415
Speaker 1: But I point out swapping a piece that just you still waste an action.

673
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,679
Speaker 0: because no waste an action.

674
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,098
Speaker 1: now You've spent an action and you still have a piece in your sideboard.

675
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,120
Speaker 0: Yep It's only worth it if the piece is worth so many points.

676
00:47:49,341 --> 00:47:55,838
Speaker 0: It's like this incredibly rare instance that you know It would be useful and they allow you to do it in that incredibly rare instance.

677
00:47:55,898 --> 00:48:03,892
Speaker 0: that way You know in case the game gets super crazy, you don't just lose because you can't do something Yep, or you can take a piece out of your Alhambra.

678
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:05,760
Speaker 1: Those are the only three options.

679
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:09,267
Speaker 1: So it usually to do anything useful with the sideboard.

680
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,071
Speaker 1: You have to spend at least two actions.

681
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:20,096
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Sideboard and that's one action and then the next turn you have to put the tiles.

682
00:48:20,176 --> 00:48:22,766
Speaker 0: so either swap the tile Which is the best situation?

683
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:25,679
Speaker 0: Well, no, the best situation is not doing anything at all.

684
00:48:26,263 --> 00:48:28,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, not using the sideboard.

685
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,760
Speaker 0: But you know the next best option is you swap it and then insert the tile on the next turn.

686
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:39,099
Speaker 0: One good strategy I've noticed is you buy something and you put it in the sideboard and you let it sit there.

687
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:47,710
Speaker 0: Then you just keep playing the game as usual and eventually at some point you buy something for exact change And then take the tile from the sideboard and bring it in.

688
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good strategy.

689
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:54,260
Speaker 0: with the free action You know, it's like I don't have a place for this now, but I need it and I'll have a place for it later.

690
00:48:55,101 --> 00:49:02,718
Speaker 0: You know you make a place with buying something for exact change bring it in on the free action and you didn't really lose an Action for that and it's it works pretty well.

691
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:05,130
Speaker 1: Now there's also a fun mechanic.

692
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,540
Speaker 1: at the end of the game the game ends.

693
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,999
Speaker 1: I mean, there are two scoring rounds about 1/3 and about 2/3 of the way through the game.

694
00:49:10,802 --> 00:49:14,318
Speaker 1: Then there's the final scoring round which happens when the bag of tiles runs out.

695
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:17,409
Speaker 1: the rule there and I just thought this was needs.

696
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:30,527
Speaker 1: at the end of the game when there are no more tiles left the fall the tiles that are left are put in the little buying box the little board and Whoever has the most money in their hand at the end of the game of each color Gets whatever tile.

697
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:31,916
Speaker 1: it was in the case of a tie.

698
00:49:31,956 --> 00:49:32,540
Speaker 1: No one gets it.

699
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:41,143
Speaker 0: so if you have the most green money and there's one tile left in the green spot at the end of the game you get That and the same for yellow orange blue, whatever It just.

700
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:43,772
Speaker 1: it makes the end game even if there's no more tiles.

701
00:49:43,832 --> 00:49:44,976
Speaker 1: you need or you can't.

702
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:46,884
Speaker 1: you don't have enough money and the game Is gonna end soon.

703
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:50,059
Speaker 1: You can still go for that and there's still some decisions to make.

704
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:58,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, generally what I do is because new tiles are put into the number one spot first Which I think is I don't know what color it is.

705
00:49:58,672 --> 00:49:59,697
Speaker 0: I don't have the board right here.

706
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:00,770
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't remember.

707
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:02,203
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The tiles.

708
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:08,660
Speaker 0: when the new tiles come out they're placed in the top left spot on the little board first Which is a particular color of money.

709
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:21,518
Speaker 0: So towards the end of the game if you pretty much aren't buying too much any more stuff Start collecting that color of money and the second color of money because those are the spots most likely to contain a tile up For auction at the end.

710
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, the last space is least likely because there's a bunch of mechanics to keep people from cheating or putting tiles.

711
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:30,959
Speaker 1: You know where they'd be useful to them on your turn.

712
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:32,843
Speaker 1: You know You buy your action.

713
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,710
Speaker 1: you either buy a tile or you take a card.

714
00:50:35,072 --> 00:50:37,160
Speaker 1: when your turn is over you replenish whatever is there.

715
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,120
Speaker 1: So if you took two money cards, you draw two more money cards.

716
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,780
Speaker 1: If you bought four tiles you put out four new tiles.

717
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:49,140
Speaker 1: You have to place the tiles on the board in the order that you draw them in the order on the board.

718
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you draw a tile you look at it and you say ooh I really need this.

719
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,312
Speaker 0: and then you say I have a lot of orange money.

720
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:55,660
Speaker 0: You just put it on the orange spot.

721
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:56,520
Speaker 0: Well, that's no good.

722
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,740
Speaker 0: You have yet to put it in the top leftmost spot and then the top right and then the bottom left in the bottom, right?

723
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:04,660
Speaker 0: Depending on which ones are open and available.

724
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:07,314
Speaker 1: Now all in all a lumber is a solid game.

725
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,283
Speaker 1: I love it Very solid.

726
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:10,708
Speaker 0: so I won this field this yard.

727
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also.

728
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:12,354
Speaker 1: it was 2003.

729
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:12,856
Speaker 1: I think that it won it.

730
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,645
Speaker 1: It's also a very fun game.

731
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,671
Speaker 1: It's it's actually pretty quick.

732
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,480
Speaker 1: It's very very easy to teach to people.

733
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:26,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a game where you don't have to be a crazy strategy gamer guy to play it.

734
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,586
Speaker 0: You know families can play this game pretty easily You know, you just got to get them to do it.

735
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:36,166
Speaker 1: and while the strategies can be fairly complex in terms of actual thinking power The game is very light.

736
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,160
Speaker 1: You can play the game and have a conversation.

737
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,999
Speaker 1: You can play the game while people are watching a movie on TV.

738
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:42,929
Speaker 1: You can play the game while friends are over.

739
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,476
Speaker 1: you can play the game while you're drunk.

740
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:56,411
Speaker 0: Yep, and While someone who's big on strategy and will win more often People who don't have a lot of strategy or thinking can still play and have fun Yep, even though they'll get their asses handed to them.

741
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way the game works You never really.

742
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:01,600
Speaker 1: even if you're losing you never really feel like you're wasting your time.

743
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:11,731
Speaker 0: Yeah Because even if you're really terrible at the game you still collect money at generally the same rate as everyone else and you still buy Tiles because no one can interfere with you.

744
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:13,740
Speaker 0: You just do whatever you do on your turn.

745
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:19,360
Speaker 0: You'll just be doing less on your turn than other people, but you'll still be buying tiles and making a happy Alhambra, which is fun.

746
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:20,805
Speaker 1: It's one of those rare games.

747
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:25,885
Speaker 1: That's very beginner friendly, but also very hardcore gamer friendly Mm-hmm.

748
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:28,240
Speaker 0: Now there's some expansions which I've never played.

749
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:31,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, they seem to be trying to pull with this what they pulled with Carcassonne.

750
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:35,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, where they have two billion expansions, but I don't know about them.

751
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:36,819
Speaker 0: I haven't played them yet.

752
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:40,755
Speaker 1: Maybe if we ever get them, it's all you because I bought all those Carcassonne expansions.

753
00:52:41,016 --> 00:52:42,140
Speaker 0: That's because you own Carcassonne.

754
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:44,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, I own a longer - that's right bastard.

755
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:46,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not getting any.

756
00:52:46,434 --> 00:52:48,340
Speaker 0: I don't buy games that require expansions.

757
00:52:48,461 --> 00:52:49,329
Speaker 1: They're not for you.

758
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:50,197
Speaker 0: That's right.

759
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:57,680
Speaker 0: But he said yeah any game that requires expansions or has expansions is definitely a bad road to go down.

760
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:58,920
Speaker 1: Well, it's I mean Carcassonne.

761
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,271
Speaker 1: We talked about it a while ago the inns and cathedrals.

762
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:06,946
Speaker 1: expansion takes a good game and makes it great Like it fixes everything with the.

763
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:10,860
Speaker 0: you know, if that's the thing then that should be the game and the other expansion shouldn't exist.

764
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:12,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it came out later.

765
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:13,854
Speaker 1: I mean look the river was an expansion.

766
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:14,960
Speaker 1: then they just threw it in the game.

767
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, and of course that's a bad expansion.

768
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a beginner's expansion.

769
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,692
Speaker 0: I say well settlers has expansions.

770
00:53:21,954 --> 00:53:22,999
Speaker 0: It's also a game you have.

771
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, but settlers is broken.

772
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:29,496
Speaker 1: like settlers was real fun until I got good at games and realized that settlers is broken.

773
00:53:29,816 --> 00:53:30,097
Speaker 0: Yeah.

774
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,547
Speaker 1: Oh Well, I think that the point was really driven home.

775
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,245
Speaker 1: when I played in a sanctioned settlers tournament at ubercon a while ago Came down to the dice rolls.

776
00:53:39,446 --> 00:53:42,715
Speaker 1: Yep, like the first two rounds I won but it was.

777
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:46,468
Speaker 1: I mean there was a wide range of skills and Decisions would end the game.

778
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, you make a decision you win you lose The fight the semi-finals where I got knocked out.

779
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:56,620
Speaker 1: I will always say that every single person in my game of four was equally good and we were all just sitting there.

780
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:58,479
Speaker 1: No one would trade with anyone.

781
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:11,455
Speaker 1: yeah, like there were maybe four or five trades in the whole game and the points were like three three three three three four three three three three three four And it was like nine nine nine nine and then someone got ten.

782
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:16,917
Speaker 1: Yeah Everyone made the exact optimal decision at every point and it just came down to the dice.

783
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,380
Speaker 0: Mmm Yeah, Alhambra doesn't have that problem.

784
00:54:20,922 --> 00:54:34,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it seems random what tiles come up, but all the decisions are made by you and by the other players Mm-hmm, so there's not so much there's no game driven randomness so much, but there's a lot of player driven not randomness But unpredictability.

785
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:38,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, another thing about Alhambra is that the game itself is really nice.

786
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:42,008
Speaker 0: It has nice Cardboard boards has nice wooden pieces.

787
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:43,573
Speaker 0: The tiles are really nice.

788
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:55,449
Speaker 0: the cards, you know, I usually hate You know, I like the cart little cardboard token money or chip money mostly and Card money is like, you know second best to that.

789
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:56,873
Speaker 1: The worst is paper money.

790
00:54:56,913 --> 00:55:01,729
Speaker 0: paper money is absolute crap, but the Cardboard money and Alhambra isn't bad.

791
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:04,219
Speaker 0: It's like great because it's like your hand of cards.

792
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,665
Speaker 1: Yes It doesn't even feel like money.

793
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:06,890
Speaker 1: It feels like a card game.

794
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:14,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, it feels like I got a hand of cards in my you know Which is really cool Easy to manage everything works out nice.

795
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a cheap high production value good game for anyone of any level of board gaming skill.

796
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:19,497
Speaker 0: Hmm.

797
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,630
Speaker 0: Yep Alhambra.

798
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:26,247
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and We thought about talking about another game today.

799
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:27,512
Speaker 1: We've already gone almost an hour.

800
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:28,716
Speaker 0: But have we really?

801
00:55:28,817 --> 00:55:36,333
Speaker 1: yeah, okay Which is good because that means you know a year from now We'll still have Tuesday episodes because we won't just do all of our games and run out.

802
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:37,456
Speaker 0: That's fine.

803
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,600
Speaker 0: We'll just have to buy more games.

804
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,046
Speaker 1: I have a feeling next week.

805
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,540
Speaker 1: We'll either talk about the new Mario DS game that we both beaten.

806
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,045
Speaker 0: I think that's what we're gonna talk about.

807
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,675
Speaker 1: and we'd like to talk about Stratego at some point.

808
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:49,060
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, we'll do that.

809
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,385
Speaker 1: It's you know, I mean, it's all crap.

810
00:55:50,405 --> 00:55:53,256
Speaker 1: Milton Bradley game, but we bought it for like four bucks.

811
00:55:53,276 --> 00:55:54,742
Speaker 0: It was ten bucks Oh us.

812
00:55:54,963 --> 00:55:55,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's still worth it.

813
00:55:56,188 --> 00:56:03,780
Speaker 0: And we pretty much any Milton Bradley or Parker Brothers game is $15 or less depending on the number of pieces and we played the hell out of it.

814
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:09,170
Speaker 1: And now that we're older and wiser and know about German games We actually have insightful things to say about Stratego.

815
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,752
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

816
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,540
Speaker 0: All right, we can maybe do in two weeks.

817
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do that at some point cool.

818
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:18,496
Speaker 1: So once again, welcome all the new listeners from all the other podcasts who have mentioned us.

822
00:56:32,925 --> 00:56:37,540
Speaker 1: it's hard to tell if our inside jokes are just American isms or if it's just us being weird.

823
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,589
Speaker 0: No, our inside jokes are very inside.

824
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:43,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, most Americans have no idea what we're talking about.
