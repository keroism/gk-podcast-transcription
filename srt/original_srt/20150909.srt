1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,480
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, September 9th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,841
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:13,809
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,475
Speaker 1: And this is The Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:19,190
Speaker 1: We're back from PAX and we're talking about One Punch Man.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,229
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, we missed a lot of shows and we're gonna miss a bunch more because I'm gonna be in Singapore and Australia for like the next three weeks.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,759
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, there was a PAX was a week early this year.

9
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:39,120
Speaker 0: And then there's Labor Day because PAX wasn't on Labor Day as usual.

10
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,660
Speaker 1: And we celebrate Labor Day by not laboring, so we didn't do any Geek Nights.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,746
Speaker 0: No, why would I do that?

12
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,420
Speaker 0: when I could lay in the park and dick around, right?

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,300
Speaker 1: I ran in a race, though, and among the old men category, I was the second fastest old man.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,979
Speaker 0: Second fastest old man?

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,128
Speaker 1: Yeah.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,780
Speaker 0: Who was the faster old man than you?

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,599
Speaker 1: The faster old man beat me by like two minutes, so there was no chance.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,539
Speaker 1: Who is this old man?

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:17,060
Speaker 1: So, the funny thing is, because they break it down by basically 10-year age groups once you get into your 20s, and what gives me hope is that the top three times for these 5K and 10K races for old men, not that much worse than the times for younger men.

20
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,209
Speaker 0: So, I feel like- But yours was two minutes.

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,399
Speaker 0: How many younger men beat you?

22
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:24,655
Speaker 1: I was sixth overall among everyone, even like- How many people were in this thing?

23
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:24,880
Speaker 0: Seven?

24
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,500
Speaker 1: Like 380.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,799
Speaker 1: Okay.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,153
Speaker 1: Yeah.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,680
Speaker 1: So, the only people who beat me were 20-somethings and 130-something who have hot bods and actually train.

28
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,750
Speaker 1: Emily did really well, too.

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,879
Speaker 1: We're both pretty fast.

30
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,360
Speaker 0: Did you get some sort of medal?

31
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,004
Speaker 1: So, yes.

32
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:42,728
Speaker 1: I got a trophy.

33
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,860
Speaker 1: It's made out of Lucite, and it's in the other room.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,858
Speaker 1: I also have this trophy from last time.

35
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:55,298
Speaker 1: So, I don't run races that often, like maybe once a year, and I kind of wanted to win this one, at least among the old man 30s age group.

36
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,855
Speaker 1: So, I ran real hard, and my time was like 19, 59, almost exactly 20 minutes.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,485
Speaker 0: We were like,

38
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:01,607
Speaker 0: "Pah!".

39
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:06,459
Speaker 1: So, I ran hard, and so at the end- Could you have run harder?

40
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,026
Speaker 1: I don't think so, actually.

41
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,760
Speaker 1: I think I ran as hard as I could have run on that day.

42
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:18,920
Speaker 1: But I ran over the finish line, walked over to some bushes, and immediately vomited into those bushes.

43
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:19,740
Speaker 0: Oh, you suck.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,572
Speaker 1: Which, I mean, that happens if you push too hard, especially in a foot race.

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,180
Speaker 1: That's just something that happens.

46
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,900
Speaker 1: Marathon runners shit themselves.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,340
Speaker 0: You also have a blarging problem.

48
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:28,534
Speaker 1: My body's go-to.

49
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,554
Speaker 1: My body, like if there's a conference inside of my body, like, "Hey, something's going on.

50
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,939
Speaker 1: Man, what should we do about

51
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,019
Speaker 1: it?".

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,440
Speaker 0: Also, if you do something that makes you bargle, that's a sign you shouldn't do that thing.

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, but running, I'll live longer if I run.

54
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,160
Speaker 0: Not if you bargle.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
Speaker 1: And maybe you shouldn't push that hard without draining your body.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,299
Speaker 0: Not if you bargle your body out.

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,730
Speaker 1: Might have been the Red Bull.

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,859
Speaker 1: I chugged before the race, too.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,303
Speaker 1: What?

60
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:50,331
Speaker 0: I think that's cheating.

61
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:51,340
Speaker 0: They didn't test for that Red Bull?

62
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:54,478
Speaker 1: What next?

63
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:02,380
Speaker 1: So I run over to the finish line, I walk over to the bushes, I just vomit, and then I turn around, and I'm feeling good, like I'm smiling, and there's a kid standing right there.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,054
Speaker 1: And he's looking at me, and he looks up at me, because he just saw me projectile vomit in some bushes, and just goes,

65
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:10,360
Speaker 1: "Wooooow.".

66
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:13,719
Speaker 1: Pretty much that made my day.

67
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,140
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe just next time you see a kid, stick your finger down your throat and bargle.

68
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,480
Speaker 1: You know, vomiting is actually pretty funny.

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,639
Speaker 0: Uh, you can do all the vomiting.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,833
Speaker 1: If someone else is doing it.

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,239
Speaker 1: Somewhere near me, and I can't smell it.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,840
Speaker 0: I am not doing any vomiting.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,260
Speaker 0: I read something recently that there might be like disease transmission from like vomit particles in the air.

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,499
Speaker 1: I could easily believe that.

75
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,338
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna avoid vomit.

76
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:44,760
Speaker 1: I read a similar article talking about how air dryers in public bathrooms are just spreading pee and fecal coliform all over.

77
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,850
Speaker 0: Well, at least they're not on my hands.

78
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,060
Speaker 0: Spread it all over the ground.

79
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,880
Speaker 1: Get it in the lungs and other people's hands.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, blast it off of my hands onto the wall.

81
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,440
Speaker 1: So yeah, we're pretty much back for a little while, and then I'll disappear to Australia for a while.

82
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,279
Speaker 1: As long as I don't die mountain biking in Singapore, or mountain biking in Australia.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,724
Speaker 0: Poison snake.

84
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,019
Speaker 0: Poison spider.

85
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,310
Speaker 1: Actually, I was reading about this place.

86
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,260
Speaker 1: It's like this semi-abandoned island.

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,759
Speaker 0: So even more poison snakes.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,606
Speaker 1: Uh, nope.

89
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 1: Snakes are not a problem there.

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,560
Speaker 1: The problem is very poisonous lizards.

91
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:14,944
Speaker 0: It's close enough.

92
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:18,600
Speaker 0: I mean, not snakes, other poisonous lizards.

93
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:23,179
Speaker 1: The website was like, if a lizard is blocking the bike path, do not antagonize it.

94
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,379
Speaker 1: Just choose another path, and it'll eventually go somewhere else.

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,558
Speaker 0: How big is this lizard that you can't just bike over it?

96
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:29,758
Speaker 0: I don't know.

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,959
Speaker 0: Or bike really past fast it.

98
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,315
Speaker 1: I guess I'll find out.

99
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:38,487
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna go to this island on Saturday, because while I'm there, as I am- Saturday is the no lizard day?

100
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,500
Speaker 0: Is the day the lizard's taking the day off from poisoning people to death?

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 1: Well, Thursday I gotta go to a convention and give a panel.

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,320
Speaker 0: How many people have died from lizard on this island?

103
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,092
Speaker 1: Not many, as far as I can tell.

104
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:47,940
Speaker 1: The island's pretty safe.

105
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,740
Speaker 0: How many people have gone to hospital through the lizard on this island?

106
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,460
Speaker 1: I think more people have gone to hospital from the mountain biking part than the lizard part.

107
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,919
Speaker 0: Well, but if you get a double whammy, you fall off the mountain bike, there's a lizard!

108
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaker 0: Well, that's what would happen in any comedy movie ever.

109
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,156
Speaker 1: That is one thing, at least with skiing, that while I am not as good as skier, I don't think- Yes, if you fall off ski, there are only poisonous lizards.

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,916
Speaker 0: There will just be a polar bear there, and a yeti.

111
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,420
Speaker 1: Not a polar bear, but probably a grizzly bear.

112
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,354
Speaker 0: I mean, the yeti comes 100% of the time, every time.

113
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,539
Speaker 0: But if you never stop- No matter what, if you ski long enough, the yeti will come.

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,079
Speaker 1: But if you never stop, and never slow down, and never fuck up, you won't actually catch you.

115
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,078
Speaker 0: Bumbles bounce you.

116
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:35,720
Speaker 1: So yeah, you got any news, or a Geek Byte perhaps, now that we're back and we're talking about anime, manga, comics, and the like?

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Speaker 0: Well, there isn't a lot of comics news lately, probably because the newer Comic-Con is like in a few weeks.

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

119
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:48,460
Speaker 0: But there is some sort of comics news, it's just releases, but there's some very important releases of things right now.

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
Speaker 0: It is currently Wednesday, you're probably listening to this on at least Thursday.

121
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,778
Speaker 0: That is Wednesday, September 9th.

122
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,380
Speaker 1: I know who listens the night we put these things up, because of who posts in the forum and tweets at me about stuff.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Speaker 0: There must be at least more people who are lurking and do that, but yeah, what's wrong with you?

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, today, in the comic book store, there are comics on the shelf that were not there yesterday.

125
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,680
Speaker 0: Unless you have a comic book store that puts things up early, but they definitely weren't there Monday.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,962
Speaker 0: And those things are, as follows, Saga Volume 5.

127
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,520
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I'm behind on Saga.

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Speaker 0: Which, if you read the trade paperbacks, that's new to you, if you read the individual issues, you've read these already, obviously.

129
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,452
Speaker 0: And also, Descender #1, well, Volume 1, which, same deal.

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,357
Speaker 0: Descender is, oh my god, it's by Jeff Lemire, one of our favorite people.

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,488
Speaker 1: Jeff Lemire is definitely up there.

132
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:43,374
Speaker 1: Jason and the like.

133
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 0: It's about this kid who's a robot in space, what else do you need to know?

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,318
Speaker 0: The art, OMG.

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,980
Speaker 0: So, go to the comic book store, if you didn't go there already.

136
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:59,839
Speaker 0: Oh, and not there yet, but you can pre-order it now.

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,840
Speaker 0: The subject of this episode, the man who punches only one time, per bad guy.

138
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:06,799
Speaker 0: The one punch man.

139
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,246
Speaker 1: He might kick a few times.

140
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,020
Speaker 1: Shove more than once on many occasions.

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,698
Speaker 0: He pretty much just punches people once and that's it.

142
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:22,719
Speaker 0: That manga, which has been only available by Scanlation in the US, is going to be legally available in like a month or two.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,656
Speaker 1: Eagle.

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Speaker 0: Yes, you can buy it at the store instead of reading it online and you can pre-order that now.

145
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:42,680
Speaker 0: I think they're putting out two volumes in one month, so it's going to be one of those deals where it's like, if you think, oh man, but I've already, I read a whole bunch of the manga online and then stopped when they were fighting a fisherman.

146
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 0: That seems to be usually when I stop reading a Shonen Jump manga.

147
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,660
Speaker 1: Except for his slayers, that's when you start reading.

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,100
Speaker 0: Now, two volumes a month, they're going to catch right the hell up to Japan and we're going to be good to go.

149
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,488
Speaker 0: You can just stop reading the illegal stuff now.

150
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,260
Speaker 0: You'll get a much better translation and printing in the legit ones.

151
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:20,240
Speaker 1: I noticed kind of randomly, I was poking around on YouTube, that a ton of those old late 80s and 90s OAVs that were mostly, like they were on the sci-fi channel just occasionally with those streamlined dubs, they're pretty much all on YouTube.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,420
Speaker 1: Just the whole movie is in super high quality.

153
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:32,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean anything that was subtitled at some point but isn't popular and no one's going to go checking on the license or anything is totally on YouTube.

154
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,960
Speaker 0: You'd also be surprised how much stuff is legally on YouTube.

155
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,260
Speaker 0: There's a Gundam info YouTube channel that has so many legal Gundams on it that you can watch.

156
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,008
Speaker 1: So I watched some Vampire Hunter D like, "Oh right, that

157
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:44,590
Speaker 1: thing!".

158
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,780
Speaker 1: and I was reminiscing over those streamlined dubs of all these things.

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,636
Speaker 1: And then I clicked on 8 Men After like, "Hey, check this out, 8 Men After.

160
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:51,737
Speaker 1: It's

161
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:52,199
Speaker 1: Robocop.".

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,078
Speaker 0: Why do you have time to watch this?

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,139
Speaker 1: It's not long.

164
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:56,139
Speaker 1: Okay.

165
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,219
Speaker 1: So we start watching it like a little bit like, "Okay, right, old

166
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:00,460
Speaker 1: OAVs."

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:09,238
Speaker 1: And we make fun of it and then instead of turning it off, we kind of just kept watching it because we kind of missed those old dumb 90s OAVs.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,160
Speaker 0: If you didn't have nostalgia for it though, would it be any good at all?

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,543
Speaker 1: You know what?

170
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:15,040
Speaker 1: It holds up way better than I would have expected.

171
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,919
Speaker 0: Well, it's not He-Man.

172
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:26,620
Speaker 1: It's other than the fact that the girl keeps wearing that Band-Aid on her head and she seems pretty dumb and she keeps saying the same thing over again.

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,779
Speaker 1: And also the streamlined dub being a streamlined dub.

174
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:36,940
Speaker 1: It was good enough and engaging enough to where we kind of just kept watching it.

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,003
Speaker 0: But you got to remember, right?

176
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:44,620
Speaker 0: These animes that were on the 90s, we were watching them as like teenagers or whatever, right?

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:10:00,480
Speaker 0: The old guys of anime who we see at the anime con sometimes who were like way older than us, like 50s, 60s, they were our age or they were adults when those things were on Sci-Fi Channel in the 90s and they were watching them, enjoying them.

178
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,733
Speaker 0: Yeah.

179
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,389
Speaker 0: So we're that age now.

180
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:09,100
Speaker 0: It's not like He-Man where we only watched it when we were three years old and that's why we liked it, you know?

181
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,621
Speaker 0: Well, you know what it is?

182
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:19,580
Speaker 1: It's that these OAVs, they have alternatingly great and terrible animation and there's just this certain like they have to finish their whole story quickly.

183
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,120
Speaker 1: So they're kind of like a movie, but they're usually based on things that would have been or were a manga or a TV show.

184
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,840
Speaker 1: So they have to kind of compress the action together.

185
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,322
Speaker 1: I don't know.

186
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,876
Speaker 1: I might do a show on 8-Man After if I get Scott to watch it.

187
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:33,559
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen it?

188
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:34,640
Speaker 0: Uh, no.

189
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,880
Speaker 1: Do you know what it's about?

190
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,460
Speaker 0: Uh, the 8th Man.

191
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,678
Speaker 1: Do you know who the 8th Man is?

192
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,059
Speaker 0: Not the 7th Man.

193
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,538
Speaker 1: Tobor the 8th Man?

194
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,283
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

195
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:43,390
Speaker 0: Tobor.

196
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:44,900
Speaker 0: It's an acronym of robot.

197
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:46,979
Speaker 1: Oh, aducardo.

198
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:47,820
Speaker 0: Yes.

199
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,466
Speaker 0: And he's some sort of hero.

200
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,680
Speaker 0: He fights bad guys, punches them, eats them with robot powers.

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,580
Speaker 1: 8-Man After is an OAV movie that basically takes place long after 8-Man's death.

202
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,630
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to say it's particularly good.

203
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,676
Speaker 1: I'm not going to hold it out on any anime.

204
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:07,700
Speaker 1: that like everyone must see.

205
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,908
Speaker 1: It's better than you might think.

206
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,360
Speaker 1: It's a pretty much straight up Robocop story.

207
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,720
Speaker 1: With some roided up cyborgs playing American football.

208
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,634
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

209
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,207
Speaker 0: Is MD Geist among them?

210
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:22,200
Speaker 0: He knows how to play American football.

211
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,299
Speaker 1: That would be the mashup I would do like my thing of the day.

212
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaker 1: But the other thing I've been watching with Emily is Bojack Horseman.

213
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,360
Speaker 1: That animated show with, you know, the guy with the horse head that you see everywhere on Netflix.

214
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,533
Speaker 0: I don't have Netflix anymore, but I saw this because people said it.

215
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,500
Speaker 0: so I googled it and I saw a horseman.

216
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,220
Speaker 0: And the first thing I thought was, well, all those people wearing a horse mask are now cosplaying something specific and not just a horseman.

217
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,060
Speaker 1: They're only cosplaying Bojack Horseman if the rest of their body looks like a frumpy 50 year old.

218
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:55,954
Speaker 0: Yes.

219
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,780
Speaker 1: So Bojack, I like I saw ads for it because and I normally came up with this thing.

220
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,988
Speaker 1: So I normally don't really notice ads.

221
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:17,020
Speaker 1: However, when I was biking home every day early in the summer, they had hired an entire brick wall along that bike path and it was a picture of Bojack.

222
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,722
Speaker 0: Oh, that brick.

223
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:22,339
Speaker 0: I know the brick wall you're talking about where they always put like really high resolution advertisements painted on.

224
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,701
Speaker 0: Yep.

225
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,560
Speaker 1: So one day I was biking home and there's a horse head.

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,487
Speaker 0: I always wonder how they do that.

227
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,680
Speaker 0: I like to be there when they put the ad out.

228
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,691
Speaker 1: They're doing one right now.

229
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:29,379
Speaker 1: You know how they do it?

230
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,900
Speaker 0: They print it out, they stick it up against the wall and hit it with a flamethrower?

231
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,060
Speaker 0: No.

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,940
Speaker 1: There's literally seven people just like sitting around on a giant scaffold just painting it by hand.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,308
Speaker 0: Really?

234
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:38,770
Speaker 0: Yeah.

235
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,479
Speaker 0: They're really good.

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

237
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,368
Speaker 1: Like I stopped and watched them for a little bit.

238
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,680
Speaker 1: If they're still there later in the week, maybe I'll stop.

239
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,578
Speaker 0: What are they painting now?

240
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,859
Speaker 1: Looks like a football, sports ball thing.

241
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:47,357
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

242
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,919
Speaker 1: But I might stop and give them a card.

243
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:49,680
Speaker 0: It is the season.

244
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,368
Speaker 1: It'd be interesting to interview someone like that.

245
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:53,397
Speaker 1: So you paint ads by hand.

246
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get paid a ton of money.

247
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,058
Speaker 0: You can't do this.

248
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,229
Speaker 1: You know, we do do a joint show.

249
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,960
Speaker 1: We also get our friend, the chalk artist.

250
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,020
Speaker 0: Now, see, I wonder the people who own the building that's getting painted on, how much are they making?

251
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:04,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

252
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:07,980
Speaker 1: Should we buy a building just to be in one of those places?

253
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,380
Speaker 0: You mean like the thing in the middle of Times Square that's basically an empty building?

254
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:11,844
Speaker 0: Yeah.

255
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,400
Speaker 1: Just like that, actually.

256
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,459
Speaker 0: It has like a Walgreens in the bottom and that's it?

257
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,388
Speaker 1: We buy a building.

258
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,660
Speaker 1: It's actually our banana stand.

259
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,499
Speaker 1: But on the outside, we make money by selling ads on it.

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:32,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the ad was a reverse centaur, basically, laying on its back in a sexy George Costanza style pose.

261
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:33,919
Speaker 1: And it just said, hey there.

262
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:40,360
Speaker 1: And I remember I biked past it and I actually stopped, went back and took a picture of it and tweeted it at Adam.

263
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:43,198
Speaker 1: Just kind of randomly because I was kind of taken aback by it.

264
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,640
Speaker 1: Only relatively recently did I actually go see what the hell that thing was and watch it.

265
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,222
Speaker 1: And you know what?

266
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:52,379
Speaker 1: If you haven't watched it, it's not what you'd expect it to be.

267
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,000
Speaker 0: Isn't it just one of those Adult Swim shows, right?

268
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,809
Speaker 1: It doesn't act, feel, sound.

269
00:13:58,191 --> 00:13:59,960
Speaker 1: It is in no way like those shows.

270
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,719
Speaker 0: The picture looks like that.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

272
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:03,740
Speaker 1: I expected it to be that kind of humor.

273
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,880
Speaker 0: Is it on Adult Swim?

274
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,340
Speaker 1: It's just on Netflix.

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,339
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a Netflix only?

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,740
Speaker 1: It is a Netflix original.

277
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,190
Speaker 1: Oh.

278
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,180
Speaker 0: But the deal is that if you- Is that the first animated Netflix original?

279
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:14,890
Speaker 1: I don't know.

280
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,660
Speaker 1: I actually really don't know.

281
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,000
Speaker 1: Are the other ones all live action?

282
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,474
Speaker 1: All the ones I liked and watched were live action.

283
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:20,957
Speaker 1: It might be.

284
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,375
Speaker 1: It's an American animated sitcom, blah, blah, blah, blah.

285
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,380
Speaker 1: It doesn't say here in a trivial reading of Wikipedia.

286
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:40,539
Speaker 1: But anyway, the show is actually a pretty hard to watch, brutal human drama that just happens to be animated and just happens to have about half the characters have horse heads and owl heads and things.

287
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,558
Speaker 0: Ooh, owl heads.

288
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually the owl girl, Wanda, is pretty much the best character.

289
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,999
Speaker 0: I like owls.

290
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
Speaker 1: You would really like this character.

291
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,189
Speaker 1: Ooh.

292
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,439
Speaker 1: I got to show you Wanda.

293
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,029
Speaker 0: Okay.

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,334
Speaker 1: The thing about Wanda, well, I'm not going to say anything about the show.

295
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,200
Speaker 1: That's not Wanda.

296
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,800
Speaker 0: None of those are the Wanda you're talking about because none of them are owls.

297
00:14:59,562 --> 00:14:59,929
Speaker 1: There you go.

298
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,379
Speaker 1: There's Wanda.

299
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,680
Speaker 0: Oh, she's pretty good.

300
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:01,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,119
Speaker 1: So the show is about a washed up actor and how fucked up he is and how fucked up his life is.

302
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,080
Speaker 1: And about 10% of the show is also jokes about the fact that half the people are animals.

303
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,680
Speaker 1: Like Bojack gets kind of messed up if he eats too much cotton candy.

304
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,560
Speaker 1: Like give a real horse cotton candy and they'll flip out.

305
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,700
Speaker 0: Shouldn't a real horse not eat cotton candy?

306
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, real horses should not eat cotton candy.

307
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,609
Speaker 0: I mean, animals shouldn't eat sugar in general.

308
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:31,198
Speaker 0: Humans get a good idea.

309
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,140
Speaker 1: Let me just say, if a real horse gets near a cotton candy machine, there's going to be some trouble.

310
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,139
Speaker 1: But it's about like a 90s TV star who's now rich and washed up.

311
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:46,060
Speaker 1: And it's just this really depressing and real human drama.

312
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:52,639
Speaker 1: And I really like it more than I expected to the point that I'm pretty much marathoning it as fast as I can.

313
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:53,959
Speaker 0: All right.

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,305
Speaker 1: I already got a second season.

315
00:15:55,385 --> 00:16:02,120
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know if you'd like it, but if you don't like it, Scott, it won't be because it's like Archer or all those other kinds of shows we like.

316
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:06,340
Speaker 1: It's going to be a different kind of not liking from any not liking that you've had up to this point.

317
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
Speaker 0: It can go to the bottom of the queue somewhere.

318
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,331
Speaker 1: You should watch a few episodes at some point.

319
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,840
Speaker 1: I wouldn't put it at the top of the queue, though.

320
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,160
Speaker 0: I mean, the queue is getting pretty deep.

321
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,080
Speaker 1: If you're not Scott Rubin, however, watch some Bojack.

322
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:24,280
Speaker 1: The only caveat is that it might be a little too real for you and it might be a little too close to home.

323
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,459
Speaker 0: Yes, the Owl Girl is too close to home.

324
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,370
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

325
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:40,730
Speaker 1: Someone made this the Antonio Maria da Silva M's films YouTube account.

326
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:46,970
Speaker 1: It got like fifteen million, five million, ten million more views or whatever since when I first found it.

327
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,650
Speaker 0: But it only has three million total views, not even.

328
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,071
Speaker 1: Yeah.

329
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:52,689
Speaker 1: It seems like it's posted on a bunch of other YouTube channels now.

330
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,188
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to figure out who originally made it.

331
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,410
Speaker 1: But it's an amazing compositing mashup of like every movie ever.

332
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, like fifty different movies and characters from them all in the same nightclub.

333
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,383
Speaker 1: And you pretty much just have to watch it.

334
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:12,450
Speaker 1: It's like ten minutes long.

335
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,448
Speaker 1: It's kind of insane that someone made this.

336
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,989
Speaker 0: Someone really had nothing to do.

337
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,409
Speaker 0: I mean, the core was really, really, really good with video editing.

338
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:31,370
Speaker 1: The characters range from Star Wars Episode One to multiple Tom Cruises from different movies to Al Pacino to Blade to Arnold from Terminator One.

339
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,875
Speaker 1: Scarface is in there.

340
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,410
Speaker 1: In fact, Scarface is a major character in the plot that unfolds.

341
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,006
Speaker 0: There's a plot?

342
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually.

343
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,170
Speaker 0: OK, I couldn't tell if there was a plot.

344
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,049
Speaker 0: There is a plot.

345
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,470
Speaker 0: A mashup for the sake of mashing up.

346
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,630
Speaker 1: A gunfight breaks out and shit goes down.

347
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:45,170
Speaker 0: All right.

348
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,749
Speaker 1: You just have to watch this thing.

349
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,060
Speaker 0: OK.

350
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,170
Speaker 0: So it might have been a thing of the day previously, the Senpai Club.

351
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,930
Speaker 0: So if you don't know, if you didn't pay attention last time, it was probably a thing of the day.

352
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,210
Speaker 1: Scott's a big fan of Senpai Club.

353
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,317
Speaker 0: There's this people.

354
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,570
Speaker 0: I think it's like, you know, this couple.

355
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,389
Speaker 0: I think they're a couple.

356
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,910
Speaker 1: Oh, here's the picture that was that was on the ad of BoJack.

357
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:06,409
Speaker 0: Great.

358
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:06,879
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:07,403
Speaker 0: All right.

360
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:07,888
Speaker 1: Anyway.

361
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:13,022
Speaker 0: And they make, you know, just cute anime for YouTube.

362
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:16,750
Speaker 0: that, you know, in their spare time, I assume it doesn't seem like they're getting paid for it.

363
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,489
Speaker 0: And their studio is named Make Babies.

364
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,587
Speaker 0: Make Babbie dot ES.

365
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:21,058
Speaker 0: Right.

366
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,657
Speaker 0: Get it?

367
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:22,130
Speaker 0: The spelling.

368
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:22,507
Speaker 0: OK.

369
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:24,050
Speaker 0: And they make the cut.

370
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,849
Speaker 0: They think they're currently making this called Senpai Club, which is like the best.

371
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:33,670
Speaker 0: And it's pretty much like this parody of anime in general, like school anime.

372
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,950
Speaker 0: And, you know, like making fun of the girl running to school with toast in her mouth.

373
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

374
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,449
Speaker 1: Or like the triangle headed be shown in.

375
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:40,970
Speaker 0: Right.

376
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:41,430
Speaker 0: Exactly.

377
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,470
Speaker 0: So the latest episode, however.

378
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,508
Speaker 0: Well, part one of episode three.

379
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:52,767
Speaker 0: The opener is like in the old school anime 70s, 80s anime style.

380
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,810
Speaker 0: And they put a lot of work into it.

381
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,890
Speaker 0: And it's it's incredible.

382
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,550
Speaker 0: So you need to see it if you haven't been paying attention.

383
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,410
Speaker 1: It's one of the better.

384
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:02,087
Speaker 0: Even more.

385
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,748
Speaker 0: Even more.

386
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:11,370
Speaker 0: Like, even if you don't want to watch all of Senpai Club, if you know anything about anime and old anime, just watch this, you know, start of episode three, part one.

387
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:13,610
Speaker 1: You do have to know a little bit about anime.

388
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,188
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen a lot of anime, you're probably.

389
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,269
Speaker 0: It's a parody of anime.

390
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,029
Speaker 0: If you don't know anime, what sense will it make?

391
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,149
Speaker 1: It's like trying to watch Excel Saga if you've never seen anime.

392
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,990
Speaker 1: In the moment, the Book Club book was the Wheel of Time.

393
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,369
Speaker 1: Book one, a fantasy book, the novel.

394
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,510
Speaker 0: But we're going to do episode on it like tomorrow.

395
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,055
Speaker 0: Yeah.

396
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:34,749
Speaker 0: Well, it'll go up.

397
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,630
Speaker 1: Who knows when we're going to try to put up episodes while I'm overseas.

398
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,850
Speaker 0: We finished reading it.

399
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,930
Speaker 0: We're going to record as many episodes as we can before it gets on a plane.

400
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,910
Speaker 0: And that will be one of the episodes you record before it goes on a plane.

401
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,829
Speaker 1: The only things I have to say about it at a time is that I'd recommend reading it if you never read it.

402
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,589
Speaker 0: If you like fantasy novel, this is fantasy now.

403
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,670
Speaker 1: It is so fantasy novel.

404
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,170
Speaker 1: It is a series of Chekhov swords that then fire within a few chapters.

405
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,469
Speaker 1: And there's a few more Chekhov swords that have not fired yet.

406
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,170
Speaker 0: And then there are eight more books, none of which were written by Chekhov.

407
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,809
Speaker 1: They're not the best books in the world, but I will say this.

408
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,308
Speaker 1: I'm about halfway through the second book now.

409
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,850
Speaker 0: Three quarters of the way through the third book.

410
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,490
Speaker 1: I bought the third book.

411
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,330
Speaker 0: Really big books.

412
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,808
Speaker 0: They don't really go by very slowly at all.

413
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,109
Speaker 1: I bought the third book.

414
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,410
Speaker 1: I'll probably read it on my travel and we'll see what happens.

415
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,330
Speaker 0: The Kindle versions are just as the same price as the paperback versions.

416
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,930
Speaker 0: Of course, you could go RMAT, right?

417
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,250
Speaker 0: But they're DRM free Kindle books, so whatever.

418
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:40,210
Speaker 0: If it was DRM'd, I probably wouldn't buy the Kindle version, but Amazon points.

419
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,610
Speaker 1: And we were at the Penny Arcade Expo.

420
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,750
Speaker 1: Videos and things will come.

421
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,290
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I burned through some of the queue.

422
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:50,330
Speaker 1: So I uploaded a video we made at PAX South in San Antonio.

423
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,830
Speaker 1: When Scott and I had some time to kill, we were bored.

424
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,250
Speaker 1: And we were already all rigged up with our equipment to go through the expo hall.

425
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,250
Speaker 0: It came out worse than I remember, but also better than I remember.

426
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:00,155
Speaker 1: You know what?

427
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:01,890
Speaker 1: The worst actually made it better.

428
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,450
Speaker 1: It was like this good mix of us laughing at our own jokes and attempting to put this thing together.

429
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,677
Speaker 1: But you know what?

430
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:09,589
Speaker 1: The concept was sound.

431
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,130
Speaker 1: And I think what says it all is that I actually laughed when I was watching it while I was trying to edit this thing together.

432
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:15,942
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

433
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:16,429
Speaker 0: I didn't.

434
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,822
Speaker 1: I did.

435
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:22,625
Speaker 1: This was all Scott's idea.

436
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:23,110
Speaker 1: Just saying.

437
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,027
Speaker 0: We had nothing to do.

438
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:25,529
Speaker 1: We could have played games.

439
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,834
Speaker 0: We did.

440
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,810
Speaker 0: We played as many games as we possibly could play.

441
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,050
Speaker 1: And we're going to be at MAGFest.

442
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,149
Speaker 1: But if you didn't get your hotel for MAGFest, we warned you.

443
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,208
Speaker 1: You're fucked now.

444
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,770
Speaker 0: Wait, I didn't get a hotel for MAGFest.

445
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:40,849
Speaker 1: I assume you're in with us and Phil and everybody and J.

446
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:42,150
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

447
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,097
Speaker 1: I'll double check to make sure.

448
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:43,903
Speaker 1: I said we were all in.

449
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:44,730
Speaker 1: If not, you're fucked.

450
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:45,329
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

451
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:45,888
Speaker 0: And we're going.

452
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,705
Speaker 0: Okay.

453
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,349
Speaker 1: MAGFest is now going to be just as hard to go to as PAX East, I think.

454
00:21:53,092 --> 00:22:00,890
Speaker 1: So we're previewing this because we only got to see one episode that had blatantly incorrect made-up subtitles.

455
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,929
Speaker 1: I'm getting the disclaimer out now.

456
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,049
Speaker 1: Do not watch it until it comes out legit.

457
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,090
Speaker 1: If you watch it early...

458
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,910
Speaker 0: This anime is coming out early October.

459
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:09,445
Speaker 0: It's highly anticipated.

460
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,390
Speaker 0: There are many trailers and teasers on YouTube and such that you can watch.

461
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:19,430
Speaker 0: But they streamed the first episode on NicoNicoLive as a preview.

462
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,410
Speaker 0: Of course, people captured that and poorly subtitled it and it's low-res.

463
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're watching.

464
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:28,270
Speaker 1: and Emily just started translating because the subtitles were...

465
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,303
Speaker 0: And Emily's like, "That subtitle's

466
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:29,607
Speaker 0: wrong.".

467
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,390
Speaker 0: And it was super wrong.

468
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:35,228
Speaker 1: At one point, a guy's like, "It will make you the strongest in the

469
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:35,510
Speaker 1: world.".

470
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:36,085
Speaker 1: Emily's like...

471
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:38,729
Speaker 0: He said that it tastes like strawberry drink.

472
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:39,420
Speaker 1: Yep.

473
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,107
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Oh, it's not even

474
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:41,370
Speaker 1: close."

475
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,650
Speaker 1: Where the subtitle just says "IDK" because whoever did it couldn't actually translate.

476
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,390
Speaker 0: Right, so it's going to be on a legal streaming site, I'm sure, because it's super licensed.

477
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:50,909
Speaker 0: It's going to be a big hit.

478
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,610
Speaker 0: But this is the One Punch Man.

479
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,910
Speaker 0: One Punch Man was getting so much talking and on Twitter that I had to check it out.

480
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,729
Speaker 0: I read a whole bunch of the manga maybe about a year ago.

481
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,470
Speaker 1: So, Scott, what is One Punch Man about?

482
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,427
Speaker 0: So, there's this guy.

483
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:08,370
Speaker 0: And he was just like a normal, totally normal dude.

484
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,570
Speaker 1: And then he got bit by a radioactive spider or something?

485
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:10,985
Speaker 0: No.

486
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:13,889
Speaker 0: And he couldn't get a job.

487
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,030
Speaker 0: And he was sort of dismayed with life or whatever.

488
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:18,656
Speaker 0: So he said, "You know what?

489
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,484
Speaker 0: I'm just going to be a hero for

490
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:21,046
Speaker 0: fun.".

491
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:23,430
Speaker 0: So he decides to become a hero.

492
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,190
Speaker 0: And to train to be a hero every day, he does 100 push-ups every day.

493
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,238
Speaker 0: 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups and 100 squats.

494
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,590
Speaker 0: And he runs 10K every single day.

495
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,229
Speaker 1: I could do that if I didn't have a job.

496
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, he didn't have a job.

497
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,409
Speaker 0: So he did that every single day.

498
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:42,570
Speaker 1: So if I quit my job and do that, can I kill anyone in one punch?

499
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,770
Speaker 0: He trained so hard that all his hair fell out and his head became super shiny.

500
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,249
Speaker 0: Deal breaker.

501
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,450
Speaker 0: And he became so powerful that any bad guy he punches goes down in one punch.

502
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,790
Speaker 0: His one punch is so ridiculously strong that he is now One Punch Man.

503
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,270
Speaker 1: Now that there is an animated television series of One Punch Man.

504
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,558
Speaker 0: I mean, it was already popular.

505
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,390
Speaker 0: Now it's going to be double popular with everyone.

506
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,909
Speaker 0: I saw maybe one cosplay of it in the past year or two.

507
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,570
Speaker 0: You're going to see so many punchmans.

508
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,890
Speaker 1: I have to redact/update a bunch of panels and lectures we've done for the past decade.

509
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,324
Speaker 1: Because for a long time, I have said, and so has Scott, that the greatest punch in the history of anime is Big O.

510
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:28,070
Speaker 0: The One Punch Man has pretty much taken over.

511
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,570
Speaker 0: I mean, it combines pretty much the best elements.

512
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,410
Speaker 0: This is sort of like the be-all end-all of anime, right?

513
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,450
Speaker 1: Wasn't that Kill La Kill?

514
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:37,900
Speaker 0: Well, no.

515
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:38,890
Speaker 0: Kill La Kill saved anime.

516
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,590
Speaker 0: It's already been saved, which is why One Punch Man can exist, right?

517
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,850
Speaker 0: In the saved anime universe.

518
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,070
Speaker 0: It has the ridiculousness and action scenes of the Kill La Kill, right?

519
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:57,170
Speaker 0: It has the crazy visual stylings and random crazy characters of a Space Dandy kind of situation.

520
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,790
Speaker 1: Well, it's directed by the person who directed Space Dandy.

521
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,346
Speaker 0: How about that?

522
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:07,767
Speaker 0: It brings in the punch and the epicness of violence of, say, a Big O, or a Fist of the North Star.

523
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,326
Speaker 1: Well, it brings in not just the epic violence and the punch, but the viscera and gore of the 90s.

524
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,170
Speaker 1: I mean, dude pulls an entire crab out of his body by the eyeball.

525
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,950
Speaker 0: And then it brings in the shounen-ness of the Dragon Ball, right?

526
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:33,530
Speaker 0: All together into this one, like, the be-all end-all singularity of shounen action manga anime that ever must exist.

527
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,283
Speaker 0: There's no reason to make any more, right?

528
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,438
Speaker 0: It's like One Piece, right?

529
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,769
Speaker 0: It's got the One Piece in there, too.

530
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,717
Speaker 0: It's Madhouse.

531
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:44,010
Speaker 1: The opening theme is Jam Project.

532
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,609
Speaker 1: It's a who's who in a lot of ways.

533
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:51,150
Speaker 0: It is the shounen anime of all time.

534
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:53,890
Speaker 0: And its first episode is even, like, half out yet.

535
00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:00,341
Speaker 1: This is the kind of anime that when I was going to anime cons when I was younger, I'd actually be like, "Oh my god, there's a new anime!

536
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:00,844
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch the

537
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:01,267
Speaker 1: screening!".

538
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:09,670
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing that I expect to see at an anime con with the screening, and a whole bunch of people go to see it, and a bunch of cosplay, people getting really into it.

539
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,829
Speaker 1: Bald guys, your day has come.

540
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,026
Speaker 0: So I've read the manga, so I know some things that weren't in the first episode.

541
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:15,710
Speaker 0: the rhythm doesn't know.

542
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,369
Speaker 0: For example, there's a sidekick, and...

543
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:20,529
Speaker 1: Why would you kick?

544
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,050
Speaker 0: No, there's a character who's a sidekick who's awesome.

545
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,990
Speaker 0: He's like a cyborg, and he actually knows about being a hero.

546
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:32,510
Speaker 0: And there's an organization that manages all heroes on Earth, and the heroes have different grades and levels.

547
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,409
Speaker 0: So they're trying to level out to be higher grade heroes to get more monies or whatever.

548
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,869
Speaker 0: There's this whole structure that gets involved and stuff, but really, you just want to see him punch something one time.

549
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:49,307
Speaker 1: The opening song's name is "Set Fire to the Furious

550
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:49,789
Speaker 1: Fist."

551
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:51,849
Speaker 1: I think it's already on fire.

552
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,930
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's so... You know, it's like, Kenshiro knows that when he punches someone, they're gonna explode, right?

553
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,710
Speaker 1: But he punches him, like, a hundred times!

554
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,610
Speaker 0: Right, and so does One Punch Man.

555
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,622
Speaker 0: One Punch Man is sort of like, "Eh, punch.

556
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:06,426
Speaker 0: Phew.

557
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:07,109
Speaker 0: Whatever.".

558
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,354
Speaker 1: He also doesn't wait.

559
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:13,290
Speaker 1: Kenshiro will sort of wait, and, like, fight his way through a bunch of minions.

560
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,025
Speaker 1: This guy's just like, "Straight to the boss.

561
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:15,247
Speaker 0: Punch

562
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:15,368
Speaker 0: him.".

563
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:20,287
Speaker 0: His name is Saitama, and it's like, he wants to save the world.

564
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:29,968
Speaker 0: He doesn't want the world to die, but he doesn't care too much, whereas Kenshiro will be like, "Use these ten seconds to think about your

565
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,350
Speaker 0: sins.".

566
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:31,910
Speaker 0: You know?

567
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,320
Speaker 0: That kind of shit.

568
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,389
Speaker 0: He doesn't do that, right?

569
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:36,298
Speaker 0: Maybe he should.

570
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:37,530
Speaker 0: Maybe he will eventually.

571
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,549
Speaker 1: But the show's got just the crazy animation, like what we saw with "Kill la

572
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:42,750
Speaker 1: Kill."

573
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,990
Speaker 1: This is really bendy, squashy, weirdy.

574
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:52,184
Speaker 1: Like, when he jumps and punches, you see his whole torso, like, tarred, and the fist, like, bends into the punch.

575
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,230
Speaker 1: It looks great.

576
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,490
Speaker 0: They have to capture, even in highly pixelated stream rips, right?

577
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,890
Speaker 0: It looks great, so the real one probably looks even better.

578
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:10,910
Speaker 0: But the manga, you know, I think actually, compared to the first episode, I think the manga actually does a better job of, like, conveying the epicness of punching something one time, right?

579
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,730
Speaker 0: And it's mostly because the bad guys start escalating, you know?

580
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,829
Speaker 0: And it's like he punches, you know, what, in episode one of the anime, he punched Crablante once.

581
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:22,669
Speaker 0: Well, and he didn't actually even punch Crablante, or he killed him using a different method.

582
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, pulling his entire viscera system out of his body through his eye socket.

583
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he punched quite a, you know, that giant guy once.

584
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:30,909
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

585
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,270
Speaker 0: He punched some other guys once, right?

586
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:41,852
Speaker 0: But when he starts punching, like, the real bad guys once, and you start seeing, like, you know, they start, when all the other heroes start showing up and all these other characters, you sort of get.

587
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:53,669
Speaker 0: the relativity aspect of it comes into play, where it's, like, the most powerful hero on Earth is, like, you know, Superman, basically, is, like, having a tough time, and then One Punch Man punches that bad guy once.

588
00:28:54,472 --> 00:29:06,570
Speaker 1: Well, it's got this nice idea of escalation, which a lot of, like, the indie comics and the kinds of things we like, like, if you see enough tropes and you see enough stories, you start to get to the point where you want to see, like, the culmination of that kind of story.

589
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,970
Speaker 1: Like, this is the culmination of the superhero story.

590
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,450
Speaker 1: What if you had the literally invincible, all-powerful, well, at least all-powerful in terms of beating bad guys guy?

591
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,850
Speaker 0: Like, push it all the way to the end and see what kind of story you have.

592
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:31,130
Speaker 0: Right, but to make it interesting, right, it's interesting because of the character that he is, right, is while he's super powerful, punch everyone once and they die, you know, it's, like, he's really sort of bored.

593
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,010
Speaker 0: Like, he wants a super awesome fight to be an awesome hero and have fun with it, but, like, he's not having fun with it.

594
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,689
Speaker 0: He just punches everyone once and it's over.

595
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,848
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Oh, God, this is so

596
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:40,030
Speaker 0: boring.".

597
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,390
Speaker 0: Right, and it's, like, he escaped the life of, you know, looking for a job.

598
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,330
Speaker 0: He gave up on that because it sucks so much.

599
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:50,649
Speaker 0: Now he's got this hero job and it sucks just as much because he's so good at it.

600
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,430
Speaker 1: But, meanwhile, like, D in Vampire Hunter D.

601
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,410
Speaker 0: I can really relate to that.

602
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,130
Speaker 0: Like, at work, I type everything once and then it's boring.

603
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:57,169
Speaker 1: One type man.

604
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:57,870
Speaker 0: I'm one type man.

605
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,550
Speaker 1: Touch the keyboard once, the problem's solved.

606
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:00,968
Speaker 0: That's pretty much what I do.

607
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,397
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,150
Speaker 1: But, like, D, because I watched some old Vampire Hunter D again recently.

609
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,228
Speaker 1: There's a midnight screening of it at a local theater, too.

610
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:14,210
Speaker 1: He is just as, like, it's the same as one punch man, except it's, like, one sword slash man.

611
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,970
Speaker 1: He just wins every fight automatically because he's Alucard.

612
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,790
Speaker 0: But Alucard doesn't have the same personality.

613
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,710
Speaker 1: Well, no, D has no personality and gives zero fucks about anything.

614
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:25,550
Speaker 1: He just wins.

615
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,583
Speaker 1: Every fight is, "Oh, D, I've beaten you.

616
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:28,684
Speaker 1: Nope.".

617
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:31,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's.

618
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:38,970
Speaker 0: no, that's another thing, is that there's no suspense of, you know, is usually when there's a fighting story, right?

619
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,630
Speaker 1: Well, like, initial D. At the end, like, we talked about this when we reviewed it.

620
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:50,867
Speaker 1: Even in episode 25, when you know he's gonna win because he wins every fucking race, Itsuki's like, "I don't think he's gonna win it this

621
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:51,089
Speaker 1: time.".

622
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,769
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Well, what if he doesn't?

623
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,142
Speaker 1: I mean, that car is real

624
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:54,668
Speaker 1: fast.".

625
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's no suspense in one punch man if Saitama is gonna get hurt or injured or die.

626
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,890
Speaker 0: It's like, you just accept the fact that he's invincible.

627
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:11,317
Speaker 0: Like, he doesn't, you know, once you see him get, like, ridiculously, like, punched a zillion times and, like, he's unharmed, like, not even a scratch, it's like, "Oh,

628
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,070
Speaker 0: okay.".

629
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,130
Speaker 0: And you don't even, like, you're never concerned that anything, like, Kenshiro sometimes is like, "Oh, shit, is he gonna lose to this guy?

630
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,103
Speaker 0: He's actually really

631
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:19,509
Speaker 0: powerful?".

632
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,643
Speaker 0: And he gets hurt.

633
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,090
Speaker 0: I mean, he's got those seven scars in his chest for a reason, right?

634
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:33,789
Speaker 1: The Shonen fighting trope is to make the character actually invincible but continue to escalate to trick you into doubting for a second that he's gonna make it.

635
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,629
Speaker 1: But then he makes it in the end anyway.

636
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,290
Speaker 0: There's no question that he's gonna make it, right?

637
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,070
Speaker 0: It's just, a lot of the suspense is like, "When is he gonna punch him?

638
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:43,368
Speaker 0: Is he gonna punch him?

639
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,168
Speaker 0: Is this guy so strong that the punch won't

640
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:46,370
Speaker 0: work?".

641
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,670
Speaker 0: You're never worried about Saitama being hurt.

642
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,630
Speaker 1: So it skips, like, every trope of a Shonen show.

643
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,970
Speaker 0: Well, but there's also other characters such as the awesome cyborg sidekick who can get hurt, right?

644
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,250
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Oh, are those people gonna get hurt?

645
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,262
Speaker 0: Is he gonna save them in

646
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:02,708
Speaker 0: time?".

647
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,490
Speaker 0: You know, those sorts of things are still coming to play a little bit.

648
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,690
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I like how it's city A and then everyone moved to city B because city A got destroyed in a fight.

649
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,570
Speaker 0: It just doesn't hold back, right?

650
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:18,008
Speaker 0: It just, you know, it doesn't even bother trying to hide, like, the Shonen structure, right?

651
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,067
Speaker 0: By making it, you know, in Dragon Ball, they're like power level 9000, right?

652
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,230
Speaker 0: They're trying to hide it a little bit, right?

653
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,429
Speaker 0: One Punch Man doesn't even try to hide it.

654
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:36,348
Speaker 0: They're like, "Let us form a structure of Shonen leveling up that we will now, is easily translated into video games, but is a parody because we're making it so

655
00:32:36,408 --> 00:32:36,650
Speaker 0: explicit.".

656
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,390
Speaker 1: It's almost a deconstruction.

657
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,375
Speaker 0: But it's not.

658
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,950
Speaker 0: It is the perfect construction.

659
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,870
Speaker 0: It is when, you know, you can't deconstruct something by being the same.

660
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,650
Speaker 1: Well, one could say the struggle is everything but the battle.

661
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:55,050
Speaker 0: By making the perfect example of a thing, you are not deconstructing that thing.

662
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:59,049
Speaker 0: You are simply constructing the best possible example of that thing.

663
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,390
Speaker 1: It's not perfect because the perfect example does all those other tropes and goes through the cycle of doubt and belief and doubt and belief.

664
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,010
Speaker 1: This is, it's going beyond the cycle.

665
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,350
Speaker 1: It's going past all that to all the other stuff.

666
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,009
Speaker 0: There comes a point where you can't tell the difference between parody and the real thing, and that is what One Punch Man is.

667
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,969
Speaker 0: It is at the pinnacle of it.

668
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,870
Speaker 0: You cannot possibly go any higher onto the top of Mount Everest when the pointy bit is in your asshole.

669
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,649
Speaker 0: That is the end of the line.

670
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,510
Speaker 1: That pointy bit is where either the best or the worst media are.

671
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,807
Speaker 0: This is the best one.

672
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:32,524
Speaker 1: Yup.

673
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:42,310
Speaker 0: But, you know, the worst one could be right alongside it because two people can be on the point at the same time if they can stand on, like, one atom of pointiness on their toe or something.

674
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,270
Speaker 1: But then you get into quantum physics and causality.

675
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,853
Speaker 1: Whatever.

676
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:54,429
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you care anything about anime at all, even if you don't care about anime, and maybe you've thought about all those other anime we've mentioned, you don't need to watch all those.

677
00:33:55,993 --> 00:34:05,110
Speaker 0: Just watch/read One Punch Man, and you will not need to see any other punches, watch any other shounen animes, or read any of the shounen mangas.

678
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,610
Speaker 0: This is the one.

679
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,469
Speaker 0: We don't need anyone to make any more.

680
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,730
Speaker 0: If you're writing one right now, just throw it in the garbage.

681
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,429
Speaker 0: Work on some shoujo or something.

682
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,830
Speaker 0: In fact, make the shoujo, like, One Kiss Girl or something.

683
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:19,809
Speaker 0: You know, because I want to read that.

684
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,259
Speaker 1: I would read that.

685
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,089
Speaker 1: I would watch that.

686
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,670
Speaker 0: And then I want to see the mashup, One Kiss Girl, One Punch Man.

687
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,472
Speaker 1: I looked.

688
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:31,330
Speaker 1: No one has drawn fanart of One Punch Man and Big O with the second punch, tier two punch.

689
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,889
Speaker 0: At least you haven't found such fanart.

690
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,489
Speaker 1: I just searched for, like, five minutes and couldn't find it.

691
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:36,909
Speaker 0: Well, searching Japanese.

692
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:44,027
Speaker 1: But seriously, while you should watch this show, just wait for it to be out legit, because-- It'll be out legit so soon.

693
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:52,768
Speaker 0: The non-legit version-- Next month is going to be the month of One Punch Man comes to America and punches every anime fan right in the junk, whatever kind of junk you got.

694
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:53,989
Speaker 0: It's getting punched.

695
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,188
Speaker 1: When he punches that one subterranean-- And it's only going to take once.

696
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,589
Speaker 1: He definitely punches him right in the dick.

697
00:34:58,851 --> 00:34:59,150
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

698
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,770
Speaker 1: Like, right in the dick.

699
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:01,509
Speaker 0: I mean, why not?

700
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,330
Speaker 0: If you didn't punch him right in the dick, that show would be a slight step lower on the Mount Everest.

701
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:11,489
Speaker 1: So, yeah, hopefully we'll have a bunch of Ginkgoz episodes up.

702
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,070
Speaker 1: We're going to trickle them out to you.

703
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,109
Speaker 1: We're going to record as many as we can before I fly.

704
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,050
Speaker 1: And starting in October, we'll actually be back in town doing our normal stuff.

705
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,809
Speaker 1: And we're going to start ramping up video production of things.

706
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:26,509
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

707
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,340
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

708
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,460
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

714
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,500
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

715
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:28,990
Speaker 0: Uh... You're not as loud as you were before.

716
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,332
Speaker 1: Bop.

717
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:32,577
Speaker 0: Eh.

718
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,213
Speaker 1: Bop.

719
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:33,907
Speaker 0: Eh.

720
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:35,888
Speaker 0: Might be even too quiet.

721
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,261
Speaker 0: Bop.

722
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:38,666
Speaker 0: Bop.

723
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:39,310
Speaker 0: Fart.

724
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,080
Speaker 0: Poop.

725
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:41,410
Speaker 0: Poop fart.
