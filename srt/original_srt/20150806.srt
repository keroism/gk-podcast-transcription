1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,491
Speaker 1: It's Thursday August 6th 2015.

2
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:15,037
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:19,020
Speaker 1: tonight on the lounge We have the geek nights lightning round.

4
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,967
Speaker 1: I should put some Creative Commons lightning sounds there.

5
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,502
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:33,649
Speaker 1: So I was sitting at work and I was doing a bunch of work like I was actually working.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,041
Speaker 0: whoa I was doing a little work lately too, but that was only a little.

8
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:45,259
Speaker 1: so my one of my like software things like I have it running in a VM environment or whatever and Sounds Monday to me.

9
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,492
Speaker 1: so customer performance things I was like.

10
00:00:47,613 --> 00:01:02,390
Speaker 1: oh whatever I need I wanted basically I wanted ammo to be able to When I talk to the developers about any changes that might need to be made whether or not the new versions of their code Performs better or worse than previous versions in some objective measures.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,273
Speaker 1: so I threw.

12
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:10,256
Speaker 1: I just whipped up an MRTG and got it running like in my VM and I was actually working on that and I just finished it.

13
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,156
Speaker 1: and then I looked at my queue of like more important work I could be doing.

14
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:14,821
Speaker 1: that I didn't want to do.

15
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:20,610
Speaker 1: and Then I looked down and I saw the windows updates into things saying hey you can do Windows 10 whatever you want.

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,249
Speaker 0: I don't get that at work because the Active Directory is like yeah, no don't do anything.

17
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,438
Speaker 1: So I look at it, and I'm like you know what.

18
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,310
Speaker 1: that's a nice excuse to go get some coffee.

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,883
Speaker 0: So it doesn't really take that long at all.

20
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:39,954
Speaker 1: it took 10 minutes Yeah, like it was awesome, and then everything worked fine till I started up a VM and The VM.

21
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:44,550
Speaker 1: I just did the thing on and of course it didn't start with all these fucked up errors.

22
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,170
Speaker 0: Well, I mean sure virtual box has all these drivers you need like the network driver.

23
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:51,530
Speaker 0: Yet in Windows you got a probably honest.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,962
Speaker 0: I would uninstall it and completely reinstall the newest newest version.

25
00:01:55,043 --> 00:02:02,470
Speaker 0: and if the new version changelog didn't say Windows 10 support it's probably gonna be in one or two versions, so yeah first thing I did was check for updates.

26
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,057
Speaker 1: I was on the newest stable version.

27
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:07,090
Speaker 0: all right did it say in the changelog like added Windows 10 support?

28
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,133
Speaker 1: No, I was already on that version.

29
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:13,330
Speaker 1: so that I Google and basically everyone's having this problem both with virtual box with VMware.

30
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:17,142
Speaker 1: Basically all virtualization platforms had this problem.

31
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,531
Speaker 0: They probably didn't update themselves to work with Windows 10.

32
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:25,210
Speaker 1: Well the problem is so Specific if you have a bridge network adapter to a host.

33
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:33,553
Speaker 1: The list of network devices with which to bridge to or through is just empty And you're fucked.

34
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:36,663
Speaker 0: but host only and NAT still work.

35
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,610
Speaker 1: everything else works, but you can't be bridged.

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,072
Speaker 0: Oh, but I don't use a bridge, so I don't give a shit But I use bridged.

37
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:47,969
Speaker 1: so I Google around and I find all these people like bitching about it and Microsoft and Oracle both being like We're working on it.

38
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:54,244
Speaker 1: And then a lot of people linked to like here's my workaround And I scanned through like four or five of these were.

39
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:54,867
Speaker 0: none of them work.

40
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:55,470
Speaker 0: They're all bullshit.

41
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:56,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm just looking at them.

42
00:02:56,816 --> 00:03:14,307
Speaker 1: I was like wow you don't even know how this stuff works, dude, so Then I resolved it by just going to the VMware or up VMware the virtual box page And I went to the unstable releases section And I saw that oh yes There is a version 5 because they're on like 4.0 whatever.

43
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:20,110
Speaker 1: right now You can just download builds of version 5. the most recent build is stable, but not production ready.

44
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,948
Speaker 0: so of course I just pulled it down and just your own machine who gives a shit?

45
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,681
Speaker 1: and Totally fix the issue, and I'm good to go.

46
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:28,857
Speaker 1: so Windows 10 is great And I'm gonna slowly upgrade all the rest of my computers.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,668
Speaker 0: Did you uncheck all the privacy boxes?

48
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,190
Speaker 0: Yeah?

49
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:39,530
Speaker 0: Though at the same time like I don't know where at first on my laptop It wasn't the greatest, but now it's like way better than Windows 7.

50
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,750
Speaker 1: It looks like it has to index a bunch of stuff before the start menu thing works.

51
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,774
Speaker 0: I think that's do.

52
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:48,744
Speaker 0: that indexing process was slowing down because I don't have a lot of CPU in my My laptop.

53
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:55,290
Speaker 1: oh yeah Cuz my computer at work as like 4 gigahertz like a lot of rare either in my laptop at home.

54
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:58,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty weak, but now your laptops like a generation.

55
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:09,250
Speaker 0: What was really interesting is like I clean installed that motherfucker and somehow it got all the Lenovo Stuff that I'm excited about getting any of the bad Lenovo stuff.

56
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:18,641
Speaker 1: I tried to install the bullshit Lenovo Wi-Fi thing and I tried to clean install on my Lenovo which is one version newer than yours, and it actually did not work.

57
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,726
Speaker 1: really there were some drivers that like.

58
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,741
Speaker 1: couldn't I gave up And use the factory reset disk?

59
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:25,210
Speaker 0: oh mine just totally worked.

60
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm kind of looking for an upgrade to Windows 10, and then doing a clean install.

61
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:29,829
Speaker 1: cuz I'll bet it'll work.

62
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,096
Speaker 1: But uh yeah, it's not Monday.

63
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:35,430
Speaker 0: It's the lounge, so we're not doing news cuz we got a show topic.

64
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,786
Speaker 0: That's might go long, so just go straight to things.

65
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:46,179
Speaker 1: Oh today Did you say things of the day.

66
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:46,943
Speaker 0: things of the day.

67
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:48,130
Speaker 1: all right you got a thing of the day?

68
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,281
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's a YouTube channel number file.

69
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,869
Speaker 0: I may have used it for things of the day before.

70
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,450
Speaker 0: I know I've used it in the second only to the periodic videos.

71
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:03,995
Speaker 0: In terms of getting some science and math education in your years after school Don't discount crash course.

72
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:05,300
Speaker 1: They're pretty much rocking it.

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,102
Speaker 0: I just don't watch that.

74
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,286
Speaker 0: you should watch that also.

75
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,954
Speaker 0: not math or science It's.

76
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:14,770
Speaker 1: there's a lot of science Scott anyway What would you you just you knew that I was watching the history ones?

77
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,781
Speaker 1: There's also ones that are all about like physiology and chemistry.

78
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,306
Speaker 0: I already learned about chemistry.

79
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,670
Speaker 0: I don't need to know about physiology.

80
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:23,400
Speaker 1: Why don't you need to the one?

81
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,710
Speaker 1: they just now was on blood vessels?

82
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,093
Speaker 1: Real interesting I learned some stuff Also.

83
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,850
Speaker 1: Phil Plait is doing one now with them on astronomy.

84
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,270
Speaker 0: He doesn't have his own thing.

85
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,781
Speaker 0: Why do you need to watch him on another thing?

86
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:43,014
Speaker 0: well cuz this thing is pretty good It's like if it's like oh go listen to this other podcast to hear Scott talk about whatever It's like.

87
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,524
Speaker 0: yeah, you can talk about.

88
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,309
Speaker 1: they got another guy.

89
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,510
Speaker 1: He's doing politics, but not like the politics that you always get pissed off about but like here's why Andrew Jackson happened.

90
00:05:52,951 --> 00:06:02,488
Speaker 1: Like here's how what the how the Constitution works in this area anyway, so on the numberphile channel they put up this video today About BMX biking which I used to do as a kid.

91
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:11,509
Speaker 0: yeah And this video is really interesting because it is basically a very geek nights kind of thing where he talks about This flaw in the game balance of BMX biking.

92
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,309
Speaker 0: well We should talk about this in our panel of heads where if you're in lane eight it sucks ass You're gonna.

93
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:19,708
Speaker 0: You know you have a hard time winning in lane eight unless you just way better than the other people.

94
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:23,930
Speaker 0: so He's like how can we make this fair by only changing?

95
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,345
Speaker 0: You know he didn't want to change all the rules of BMX biking which looking at them now because I never knew them before other Than get on a bike and race to the end.

96
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,558
Speaker 0: Looking at the rules of BMX biking now.

97
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,286
Speaker 0: They should probably change all of them because they're garbage.

98
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:36,250
Speaker 1: so it's like race walking.

99
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,700
Speaker 0: It's not that what bad not even nearly that bad making sure.

100
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,503
Speaker 0: but just you know that.

101
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:45,204
Speaker 1: you know I'm still getting occasional hate Messages about people are mad from that race walking thing we did.

102
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,350
Speaker 0: I want some hate messages.

103
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:49,330
Speaker 1: Well you gotta post the controversial stuff on your YouTube instead of mine anyway.

104
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:58,210
Speaker 0: So but he comes up with the system for keep all the rules of BMX biking except Choosing which lane people go in to make it as fair as possible.

105
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,770
Speaker 0: And it's pretty interesting how they do this with math.

106
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:07,130
Speaker 0: And it's you know the kind of thing that more video game and board game developers need to be thinking about all the time.

107
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:13,584
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid the guy at the track I cuz I remember asking like hey Isn't the outside lane worse?

108
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:18,070
Speaker 1: and The guy said no because you turn both left and right it all evens out in the end.

109
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,281
Speaker 1: And I didn't really think about his answer.

110
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,969
Speaker 1: cuz he was an adult and I was a little kid.

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,738
Speaker 0: That does make sense though when you think about it.

112
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,208
Speaker 0: right he probably believed that he probably wasn't trying to scam you.

113
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,138
Speaker 1: yeah But it's like that's the problem.

114
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,110
Speaker 1: like he was like I haven't I have a confident answer.

115
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,701
Speaker 1: I'm a little kid just like that's an adult who told me something I mean.

116
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,303
Speaker 0: and if you're if you don't think about it hard It's like that makes sense.

117
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:43,090
Speaker 0: yeah, right It's not like a on a an oval track and field track where obviously you're making four left turns.

118
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:46,825
Speaker 0: Left side is way shorter right if you made two lefts and two rights.

119
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:52,840
Speaker 1: It's like oh well Yeah Anyway, yeah, so I got a thing here.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,449
Speaker 1: I found this a while ago, and I just kind of forgot about it.

121
00:07:56,172 --> 00:08:01,794
Speaker 1: This is a slash shot article that links to a collection of articles and stuff About chess.

122
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:07,129
Speaker 1: like the current state of the game of chess and damage s just die already.

123
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,679
Speaker 1: well We haven't solved it yet.

124
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,849
Speaker 0: Why won't you be replaced?

125
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,054
Speaker 1: But well a lot of I would say it's replaced by go yeah great That's not I mean.

126
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:15,957
Speaker 0: I guess if we're home.

127
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:18,163
Speaker 0: We need to have a perfect information game.

128
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:20,229
Speaker 1: It's replaced by battle balls.

129
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:23,499
Speaker 0: Battle ball is okay, so Chaz.

130
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,164
Speaker 1: so some things are happening.

131
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:32,787
Speaker 1: This is basically a data-driven analysis of Like almost a million chess games going back to the 15th century.

132
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:38,130
Speaker 0: looking at like What's changing in the game has like the moves someone made in a chess game in the 15th century.

133
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,767
Speaker 1: Important chess games were a big deal and people recorded what happened in them even in 1400 something uh?

134
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:50,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I also learned a bunch of stuff like is that like on a stone tablet or some shit like Queens rook to whatever?

135
00:08:51,774 --> 00:09:01,670
Speaker 1: So remember back then they not only did they already know Iris the earth was round How big the earth was but like they'd figured out a lot of stuff anyway?

136
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,670
Speaker 1: So this is a super fascinating set of articles.

137
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:11,630
Speaker 1: But the things I want to point out the summary from this heading here chess games are statistically getting steadily longer.

138
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,420
Speaker 1: So in 1970 from 1970 to today games increased from 37 move games to 42 move games.

139
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:20,453
Speaker 0: That's a pretty.

140
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,877
Speaker 0: I mean that doesn't sound like a big increase.

141
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:25,990
Speaker 0: only five moves, but five out of 40 is a large percentage.

142
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, they say 75 plies multiply multiply five, right?

143
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:31,473
Speaker 0: Is that?

144
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,750
Speaker 0: is it five moves per player or five moves total?

145
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,415
Speaker 1: I don't know.

146
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:43,079
Speaker 0: even if it's five moves total take that and multiply it by the time it takes a chess player to make their Moves right and that's like fucking.

147
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,830
Speaker 0: it could be like five minutes, and we could be like a half hour extra there.

148
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,541
Speaker 1: It's a long time you're adding and it's due to defensive play Becoming more and more common because of the changes in.

149
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,269
Speaker 1: just like chess strategy over time.

150
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:58,546
Speaker 1: First move advantage has always existed and still exists to a significant degree.

151
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,093
Speaker 1: I'm white every time I'll be white every time.

152
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,319
Speaker 0: No, I called it already too late.

153
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:07,190
Speaker 1: Draws are getting more and more common at a very rapid pace.

154
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:11,090
Speaker 0: Sure, humans probably if you're gonna lose you're playing defensively.

155
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:14,290
Speaker 0: It's like I'll just force a draw if I'm like rather than lose.

156
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,809
Speaker 0: Right if I see an opportunity to force a draw and I'm playing defensively I will.

157
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,754
Speaker 0: Humans not like.

158
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,204
Speaker 0: it's not like I have a chance to go in for the kill if I'm on defense.

159
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:27,350
Speaker 1: humans arguably are Literally not contributing anything to modern chess strategy.

160
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:34,733
Speaker 1: So humans can't be even like old a eyes anymore under any Circumstances.

161
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:35,055
Speaker 0: Oh good, then.

162
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:36,101
Speaker 0: I'll stop never.

163
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:44,407
Speaker 0: so you know once in a blue moon I'll think I should install like one of those really hard chesses on my phone and just keep playing it on the subway I hope if it's a little master at site.

164
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,489
Speaker 0: So that's why I'm never gonna do that and never gonna have that two-second thought ever again.

165
00:10:49,331 --> 00:11:01,365
Speaker 1: and I learned something weird actually just now about promotion that I didn't know because while we were we were talking about we're gonna do the show on like just before and Scott asked if you could promote something other than a queen like when the pawn gets to the end.

166
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,839
Speaker 1: and my answer was I actually don't know.

167
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:09,890
Speaker 0: and Apparently the answer is that since like many everyone who plays chess is gonna be like you guys are so dumb.

168
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,674
Speaker 0: Why don't you notice?

169
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we stopped playing chess in elementary school.

170
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,450
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit about chess.

171
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:22,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I used to play a lot of chess and then I found German board games So you are allowed to promote to a queen rook knight or Bishop.

172
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:28,740
Speaker 1: not bad and apparently In an anal a recent analysis of three million something.

173
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,330
Speaker 0: games many a grandmaster and master levels aren't promotions like pretty rare Though I mean most games don't even have a promotion.

174
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,852
Speaker 1: Well, I was so.

175
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:40,020
Speaker 1: apparently there was a famous game with Bobby Fischer where there were four queens out on the board and the game Was still undecided.

176
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:40,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure you know.

177
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:48,630
Speaker 1: Percentage of chess games if they're even one promotions that I cannot learn just from looking at this page right here.

178
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,730
Speaker 1: Okay, but what percentage of times in like all chess play that was tracked here?

179
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,464
Speaker 1: Do you think people upgraded to a queen?

180
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:56,089
Speaker 0: more than half?

181
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,981
Speaker 1: It's ninety six ninety seven percent.

182
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,369
Speaker 0: Okay way more than half.

183
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,414
Speaker 1: See the it's.

184
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:07,670
Speaker 1: appears that people only upgrade to a rook or a bishop if they're being a dick and they're winning it.

185
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,630
Speaker 0: I mean a queen can do everything a rook or bishop can do and it's gonna be in the same position.

186
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:12,739
Speaker 0: So why would you choose those?

187
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,210
Speaker 0: a knight has the interesting?

188
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:23,810
Speaker 0: Situation where if the king happens to be in a certain spot and you promote a pawn in a certain spot to a knight It might be able to create a checkmate where I would not.

189
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:30,554
Speaker 0: yeah, choosing a rook or a bishop over a queen in the same position is I Mean just stupid.

190
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:31,197
Speaker 0: There's no reason.

191
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:35,073
Speaker 0: so my my suggestion was you're only limiting your possibilities.

192
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,856
Speaker 0: shoot up.

193
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:42,341
Speaker 1: promoting to a to a rook or a bishop is trolling is the same as Teabagging a dead body and counter-strike.

194
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,936
Speaker 0: That's right, but you can still lose I mean, so here's a quote from the article.

195
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:57,082
Speaker 1: a majority of under promotions in practical play are as Tim crab a put it silly jokes okay, and Then there's this whole section in the Wikipedia.

196
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:58,406
Speaker 1: This is what my real thing in the day is.

197
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:03,698
Speaker 0: that's just called Unusual situation like what I just described or even more unusual.

198
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:07,749
Speaker 1: an unusual situation occurred in a 1993 game between Karpov and Kasparov.

199
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:10,378
Speaker 1: Karpov was in serious time troubles.

200
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,628
Speaker 1: He was running out of time with one minute left to make 16 moves.

201
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:23,336
Speaker 1: Okay in his position He captured the rook on d1 and the pawn on seat with the pawn on c2 and said Queen Indicating that the pro to piece was a queen.

202
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:26,466
Speaker 1: However, no Queen was immediately available.

203
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:33,510
Speaker 0: Like there was no piece What you buy a set of chess pieces is two Queens in there a black one and a white one.

204
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:37,209
Speaker 1: It took some time for the arbiter to come up with a black Queen.

205
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:42,710
Speaker 1: Kasparov said that if he had been a tenant he would have promoted to a rook which was available.

206
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,924
Speaker 1: Kasparov's clock was running while the arbiter was getting the Queen.

207
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:46,970
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

208
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,098
Speaker 1: so he started Karpov's clock.

209
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:57,469
Speaker 1: Karpov immediately played a move and Some bullshit went down and there's arguments to this day about this game.

210
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,616
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's bullshit.

211
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,790
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be have to have the timer running with so yeah to get a piece.

212
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:07,103
Speaker 1: Even chess has cool data-driven stuff and drama.

213
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,270
Speaker 1: That's my thing of the day chest, right?

214
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,438
Speaker 0: Let's do a short meta moment.

215
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:10,640
Speaker 0: book.

216
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 0: club book is the eye of the world.

217
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,270
Speaker 0: It's a fantasy novel by Robert Jordan fancy novel a famous fantasy series.

218
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,410
Speaker 0: I feel like I should read at least one of these books because I think that one kids have nerd cred.

219
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,322
Speaker 1: I think the kid who stole the knife is gonna die.

220
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,167
Speaker 0: Maybe who knows.

221
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,894
Speaker 0: and then Pax is really soon.

222
00:14:25,954 --> 00:14:29,666
Speaker 0: the Pax the true convention is very late in August.

223
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,970
Speaker 0: You have to go to that or else?

224
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,114
Speaker 0: Well, you're nobody.

225
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:40,375
Speaker 1: we're doing the far future of gaming on Sunday sports our games on Monday And I'm doing online story-driven games on Wednesday in Portland And nothing else matters.

226
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,724
Speaker 0: find us or every place on the internet that you go.

227
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:47,939
Speaker 0: we are there Facebook's Twitter's G pluses tumblers, but whatever it is.

228
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:48,581
Speaker 0: We are there.

229
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:49,744
Speaker 0: come and find us.

230
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,168
Speaker 0: I mean you've already found this podcast.

231
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:58,912
Speaker 1: so The lightning round Scott put together a list and then I supplemented it with my own list of searching conversations We've had.

232
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:04,287
Speaker 0: we asked many people for show ideas, which you're steadily running out of especially Monday and Thursday, right?

233
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:07,959
Speaker 0: And There are many reasons we reject people's ideas.

234
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,150
Speaker 0: one common reason is that oh we don't actually know anything about that topic.

235
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,106
Speaker 0: We'd have to research it.

236
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,390
Speaker 0: The show would be us reading Wikipedia and while I admit many episodes of geek nights are us reading Wikipedia.

237
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,601
Speaker 0: Let us avoid those as much as possible.

238
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:19,923
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:25,010
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not as reading Wikipedia It's just repeating what we read on Wikipedia on our own in the past.

240
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:27,747
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read a new Wikipedia page for you tonight.

241
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:38,342
Speaker 0: Sure Another common reason we reject episode ideas is because even though it's something we know about and can talk about We just don't have enough to say to fill 20-plus minutes of talking.

242
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,930
Speaker 0: Yep, but there's still often fine ideas.

243
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,830
Speaker 0: So we had the idea today to do a lightning round.

244
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:58,850
Speaker 0: We went through the forum thread and all these other sources including our own brains for show ideas where we only had maybe like a minute of things to say and We made a list in Google Docs and we're gonna go down and do a whole bunch of show topics really fast each with a timer.

245
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,481
Speaker 0: Even to force ourselves to remain short now.

246
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,810
Speaker 0: even a minute though is actually surprisingly long.

247
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,969
Speaker 0: We can say a lot about something in a minute, especially if you talk fast, so you have a little timer over there.

248
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:11,113
Speaker 1: Ready go.

249
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,318
Speaker 0: All right credit cards.

250
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,446
Speaker 0: So credit card is only awesome.

251
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,510
Speaker 0: Everyone should have one.

252
00:16:15,952 --> 00:16:17,359
Speaker 0: It lets you buy things online.

253
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,410
Speaker 0: It can never fuck you unless you're a moron.

254
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 0: I don't think we need to spend more money than you have.

255
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,881
Speaker 1: The problem is everyone they want to ask us about credit cards It's always because they fuck up credit cards.

256
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,470
Speaker 0: Don't spend more money than you have.

257
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,333
Speaker 0: That's all there is to it.

258
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:33,550
Speaker 0: pay it off in full every single month and it will benefit you with rewards and convenience.

259
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,997
Speaker 1: Now maybe but black dynamite.

260
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:38,170
Speaker 1: I I'm poor and like I had to use it for an emergency That's fine.

261
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,834
Speaker 1: If you could you had a money available for an emergency didn't have a credit card You couldn't have done.

262
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:44,440
Speaker 0: don't use your stupid debit card.

263
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,870
Speaker 0: Use the credit card get your Amazon points get whatever.

264
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,529
Speaker 0: Just don't be a moron and spend more than you have.

265
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:56,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you need to spend more than you have because it's like medical expenses or whatever Well, just go bankrupt and then you won't have to pay it.

266
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,650
Speaker 0: Anyway, like it's I don't understand people who are like, I don't want to get a credit card.

267
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,246
Speaker 1: Not trust yourself, are you really that lack?

268
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,009
Speaker 1: maybe you are.

269
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:10,089
Speaker 1: Maybe you are your kids go into like a fugue state and buy a thousand wall scrolls and that's all we have to say about that.

270
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,560
Speaker 1: Isis.

271
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:20,300
Speaker 1: well, so we really should call it - because that is the derogatory term in the Middle East for these fuckers.

272
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:29,695
Speaker 0: I mean, I've seen a lot of different things and I don't care enough to bother but yeah sure If that's if what you said is true, then yeah, call him - yeah, but I mean I I'm.

273
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:36,932
Speaker 1: I follow this issue a lot But it's not really like Scott and I are not experts on Geopolitical like you don't say like.

274
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,001
Speaker 1: I know a lot about weird stuff Like.

275
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:43,999
Speaker 1: I know a lot about nuclear weapons and I know a reasonable amount about - and what's going on over there.

276
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:50,180
Speaker 1: But you should probably just read a like a war blog or something of informed people.

277
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,368
Speaker 1: My my opinion is not relevant.

278
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:57,287
Speaker 0: I'm not that informed, but I know enough to know that these are bad people And there is nothing good about them.

279
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,960
Speaker 0: So what is there to say other than yes, there are bad people on earth.

280
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:11,798
Speaker 1: there are bad enough actually that it looks like al-qaeda is losing members to them and Even like extremist like Islamist terror groups are also kind of fighting against them because they're fucking up.

281
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:12,660
Speaker 1: Everybody's jam.

282
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,126
Speaker 0: All right, Planned Parenthood is the opposite of Daesh.

283
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,608
Speaker 0: It's only a good thing.

284
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:25,171
Speaker 0: Anyone who's against it is evil ignorant and Misinformed.

285
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:26,093
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

286
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,197
Speaker 1: the thing is yet that this was not a bit like.

287
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:31,649
Speaker 1: this was a big issue during like Rovers Wait era and that kind of disappeared.

288
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:44,580
Speaker 0: This is a political issue again now Really specifically because of the ruling on gay marriage and it's even it's even worse than people who are against like people were against like You know free or inexpensive health care or like everyone should die.

289
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:49,600
Speaker 0: This is specifically like women should be fucked over specifically more so than others.

290
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,952
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is that the I mean, it's you as America.

291
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:55,354
Speaker 1: the Republican Party is actually everything The doctor should do.

292
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,059
Speaker 0: no problem.

293
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,290
Speaker 0: Why does it even have to be a separate thing?

294
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:06,380
Speaker 1: because of misogyny and evil like people I know who go to Planned Parenthood in New York Like there's metal detectors because they're like terrorist threats against these people from the right wing.

295
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,882
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

296
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:10,876
Speaker 1: but it's an issue now because the Republicans need a wedge issue like gay marriage.

297
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,305
Speaker 1: now that they lost gay marriage So they're doubling down on abortion.

298
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,770
Speaker 1: That is why this came up.

299
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,094
Speaker 1: I'm out of time.

300
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,660
Speaker 0: All right shaving my heads.

301
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:18,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, you shaved your head.

302
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:20,293
Speaker 0: I shaved my head a long time ago.

303
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:21,680
Speaker 0: The strategy is pretty simple.

304
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,509
Speaker 0: You know when you go to the barber and he's got that clipper go You know, yeah just buy one of those.

305
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:27,894
Speaker 1: I didn't just like tear it all out.

306
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:28,737
Speaker 0: Yeah.

307
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:43,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Buy one of those they're only like, you know There are a lot of money relatively speaking but considering how much money it cost to go to the barber I've saved money by now like so many moneys that I've saved by buying one be Pro top-level.

308
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,131
Speaker 1: getting the initial shave wouldn't be my concern.

309
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,960
Speaker 1: My concern would be continuing to shave my head without bleeding to death.

310
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't use.

311
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:52,557
Speaker 0: I mean some people use like the razor on their head with like little wheels on it.

312
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:53,100
Speaker 0: I don't do that.

313
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,266
Speaker 1: That's what Adam uses.

314
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:55,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks pretty good.

315
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:55,733
Speaker 1: Actually.

316
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not worth it.

317
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:00,139
Speaker 1: Yeah thing is I don't think I'll ever have to shave my head.

318
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,794
Speaker 1: Maybe if I get old enough to where it's actually start losing my hair for real.

319
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:08,171
Speaker 1: instead of just like my one venom spot I might just Steven Universe's dad it and go skull it.

320
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,859
Speaker 1: Okay, do whatever you want or if I have money Maybe by then I'll be able to get a Trump.

321
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:15,151
Speaker 1: Sure, I would I would do medical procedure to get my hair back.

322
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,299
Speaker 1: I think that's something I was out of time.

323
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,949
Speaker 1: Water bottles camelback or Nalgene.

324
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually have yeah, I guess it is camelback brand.

325
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,208
Speaker 0: It is the camelback podium, right?

326
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,051
Speaker 1: So that's the one.

327
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,316
Speaker 1: I have two of those for biking.

328
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,440
Speaker 0: It's got its insulated.

329
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:32,746
Speaker 0: It has a twisty so it keeps the water inside of it Even if it bounces around.

330
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,214
Speaker 1: and whatever it works like a squirt gun.

331
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,980
Speaker 0: if you want it to share Don't get some crappy ones, right?

332
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,426
Speaker 0: It's worth it to buy the better ones that have these better features because it's more comfortable to drink More sanitary the water's cold.

333
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:46,631
Speaker 0: There are two situations.

334
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:47,695
Speaker 1: situation one.

335
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,180
Speaker 1: I'm traveling like on planes.

336
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:54,842
Speaker 1: I will buy a shitty bottle of water at the airport and use that because I'm probably gonna lose at some point That's true.

337
00:20:55,103 --> 00:21:00,980
Speaker 1: So I only use my water bottle when I'm like sporting but seriously buy a really really good water bottle.

338
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,348
Speaker 1: It's totally worth it.

339
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,280
Speaker 1: Otherwise, please like drinking water.

340
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:04,942
Speaker 0: What the hell.

341
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:09,755
Speaker 1: and if you're biking water bottles are for like your baby commute get a camelback.

342
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,921
Speaker 1: it is like night and day Mm-hmm.

343
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:17,080
Speaker 1: In fact, actually I should bring my candleback camelback to the woods thing that you weren't gonna do that.

344
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:18,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't thinking about it till just now.

345
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:21,207
Speaker 0: The diamond industry is evil.

346
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:22,130
Speaker 0: Everyone knows this.

347
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,835
Speaker 0: if you don't know this where have you been living?

348
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:24,196
Speaker 0: under?

349
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:25,500
Speaker 0: a shiny rock?

350
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,354
Speaker 1: But how I it amazes me that there are people who don't know this.

351
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:32,866
Speaker 0: so if you don't know The people who mine diamonds.

352
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:37,319
Speaker 0: they're mining them in an evil fashion usually right with like slaves and child labor.

Speaker 0: There's so many of them.

357
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:52,249
Speaker 0: They just pile them up in a vault and release them from the vault very slowly to make artificial Scarcity to jack the price up.

358
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,760
Speaker 0: You should not pay a zillion dollars for a diamond.

359
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,056
Speaker 0: Some other things are actually rare but still why would you pay for any shiny rock no matter how rare?

360
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:01,260
Speaker 0: what is wrong with you?

361

392
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:57,980
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna shame anyone because of the shape their body happens to be in or comment on it or say anything.

399
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:14,640
Speaker 1: I won't pretend honestly that being around really obese people makes me feel really uncomfortable because I can't imagine being that way.

00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,500
Speaker 1: Wait, well, what if they do one of the spin-offs?

414
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,846
Speaker 1: Like what if they did settlers of Canaan.

415
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,212
Speaker 1: it would be like the birth of it if they did.

416
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,016
Speaker 0: cities and nights.

417
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:51,085
Speaker 1: Yeah Why Who even waited?

Speaker 0: I don't know.

420
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:54,560
Speaker 0: we can just end this one early and go to the next one.

421
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,346
Speaker 0: Has there ever been a show on?

422
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:57,711
Speaker 0: go the game guy?

423
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,694
Speaker 1: I didn't restart the timer.

424
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,360
Speaker 1: We saw that we're sticking to this timer.

425
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,044
Speaker 1: We're staying on this.

426
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:04,080
Speaker 0: No, the timer is just like the maximum we don't spend on a topic.

427
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,930
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean I'm not really talking about it for a whole.

428
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,895
Speaker 0: I'm staying on settlers.

429
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:12,218
Speaker 1: in general I don't like there to be movies about games because they're always bad.

430
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,300
Speaker 0: Though actually and now that I'm older if I thought hard enough I could probably find one exception.

431
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:25,199
Speaker 1: I'm kind of excited for the Forgotten Realms movies because I think they'll be better than Yeah, I feel like those go here we go.

436
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,660
Speaker 0: I think we've talked about it quite enough on this show.

437
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,940
Speaker 0: I mean, what else do we really need to say that we haven't said already?

438
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:39,824
Speaker 0: I mean we could.

439
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:45,467
Speaker 0: it's just chess only even more boring and more Hard and more serious.

440
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:50,848
Speaker 1: we I learned go from the go club at RIT Which was like the second best club on campus.

441
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:51,912
Speaker 1: Like those guys were great.

442
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,720
Speaker 1: Like I really like the go club.

443
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,339
Speaker 1: Oh, you're really well.

444
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,399
Speaker 1: They're cool people and I did a lot of teaching games and like the tiny grids and I just got hosed every time.

445
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:05,984
Speaker 1: it was Moderately fun, but I just lost my stomach for purely abstract games Like around.

446
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,309
Speaker 0: even the fact that it's abstract.

447
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,333
Speaker 1: It's just no that's it.

448
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:17,460
Speaker 1: It's I do not enjoy Purely abstract like perfect But oh, she's short and I'm kind of an expert at it at this point.

449
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,040
Speaker 1: Like I'm not gonna devote myself to a really abstract game.

450
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,820
Speaker 0: I would rather play teeny or anything that takes too much time to get to a reasonable level of proficiency is not good.

451
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,890
Speaker 0: Okay, the base is a question about the Boston Olympics.

452
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:30,914
Speaker 1: Well, we know the answer now.

453
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:32,118
Speaker 1: It's not happening.

454
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:34,468
Speaker 1: Well good Yeah, I did not want it to happen there.

455
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:37,100
Speaker 0: No, I mean the thing is I like the Olympic spirit.

456
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:41,305
Speaker 0: I like a lot of the sport most of the sports that in the Olympics not all of them But most of them right.

457
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:45,585
Speaker 0: I like to see who wins the Olympics especially like Olympic hockey Even though you know and stuff like that.

458
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:50,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but obviously the Olympic Committee is second only to FIFA in terms of corruption.

459
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:57,880
Speaker 0: It's it seems to be getting less corrupt, but it's still way fucking cool Like it's gonna be in both of the Olympics coming up in Brazil.

460
00:26:58,087 --> 00:27:05,320
Speaker 0: Yeah The actual like, you know Execution of the Olympics and management of it and etcetera is evil and awful and you don't want it anywhere near you.

461
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:12,782
Speaker 0: But I do want to watch the athletes compete and I'm all for the athletes Sponsors, I'm not.

462
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:17,517
Speaker 1: why doesn't the UN make an international Olympic city somewhere and that's the Olympics forever.

463
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,137
Speaker 0: Sure go That's the right way.

464
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:31,110
Speaker 1: Seriously, though the city of Boston like they revoked their bid because the Olympics were so unpopular there that they decided not to go after Cabs specifically a little uber lift whatever thing.

465
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:33,100
Speaker 1: Actually, I think we could do a whole show on this.

466
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,965
Speaker 0: We might be able to self-driving.

467
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 1: cars are going to fuck up everything more than you can possibly imagine.

468
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,833
Speaker 0: But basically specifically the whole uber lift uber evil.

469
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:45,420
Speaker 0: uber is basically evil there.

470
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,520
Speaker 0: It's a company the base.

471
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,801
Speaker 0: He said.

472
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:51,160
Speaker 0: let's ignore all the existing laws instead of a business and it's sort of what crunchyroll did like.

473
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,400
Speaker 0: Let's ignore copyright instead of a business and then became legit after only uber is no interest in becoming legit And you might think actually I think they do.

474
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:04,000
Speaker 1: I think uber's actual plan is to be a robot car cab service and not have any employees.

475
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,160
Speaker 0: Maybe they could do that eventually.

476
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:09,917
Speaker 0: You know, if you look at the text, there's a lot of regulations that go into cabs.

477
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:10,840
Speaker 0: It's why they're way they are.

478
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,120
Speaker 0: It's not just a scam and an evil monopoly.

479
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:18,196
Speaker 1: I'd say those regulations are corrupt, but guys use a cab in a city other than New York.

480
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:19,320
Speaker 1: Good guy, right?

481
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,407
Speaker 0: You need those regulations there.

482
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:22,491
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's like handicapped.

483
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,755
Speaker 0: People aren't getting picked up black.

484
00:28:23,795 --> 00:28:25,080
Speaker 0: People aren't getting picked up, right?

485
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,688
Speaker 0: It's like an uber doesn't give a shit about any.

486
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,000
Speaker 0: also who doesn't care for changes their price?

487
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,574
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I guess we got to do a whole show on that one.

488
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:31,916
Speaker 1: Maybe.

489
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:35,935

515
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,619
Speaker 1: Gardening I actually really want a garden but I live in New York and I don't own the roof.

516
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:42,919
Speaker 0: I could put plants in a pot on the roof and just afraid neighbors would eat them.

517
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,349
Speaker 0: Gardening is real simple.

518
00:29:44,671 --> 00:29:48,172
Speaker 0: get a plant put it in the dirt Don't forget to water it and it should do well.

519
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:49,740
Speaker 0: just make sure you put it in the right kind of dirt.

520
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,680
Speaker 1: Well, it's more complex.

521
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:56,017
Speaker 1: It doesn't know multiple things like rubs and things to make sure you got the right kind of dirt.

522
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,020
Speaker 0: watch out for bugs.

523
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,480
Speaker 1: Rabbits come and start eating like the flower tips.

524
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,186

Speaker 0: It's way fun.

529
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:11,778
Speaker 0: And if you got vegetables, they're way more delicious than you get at the grocery store.

530
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,040
Speaker 1: frankly, though We just don't have time for gardening like we have time for it.

531
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,716
Speaker 1: If I just had a place to put you know, you don't have time for real gardening.

532
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:18,360
Speaker 1: It takes a lot of work.

533
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,360
Speaker 1: There's a lot of stuff tomatoes and beak it and I've ever get just gonna grow like tomatoes zucchinis and stuff.

534
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't want anything big and real and awesome tomatoes for you.

535
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:30,182
Speaker 1: I can grow like some leeks or some Garlic.

Speaker 1: credit cards are on the list twice.

538
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:33,360
Speaker 1: I guess they are.

539
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,243
Speaker 0: Let's get that over it.

540
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:35,647
Speaker 0: go to the next one yogurt.

541
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,494
Speaker 0: So yogurt is delicious.

542
00:30:37,674 --> 00:30:39,380
Speaker 1: I don't actually like plain yogurt.

543
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:40,612
Speaker 1: I've never really liked yogurt.

544
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,460
Speaker 1: I like losses.

545
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:42,809
Speaker 0: I mean, I usually don't.

546
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:45,584
Speaker 0: you know plain yogurt is like edible But usually I always get.

547
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:51,790
Speaker 0: when I was young I got yogurt with fruit on the bottom and nowadays I get Greek yogurt with fruit On the side, it's you all got to mix the fruit in.

548
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,294
Speaker 0: it's got to be as real fruit as possible To really mix with the yogurt.

549
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,802
Speaker 0: Well, yeah Delicious.

550
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:01,353
Speaker 1: I just never really like yogurt that much except in things but frozen yogurt.

551
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:02,336
Speaker 1: Fuck that nonsense.

552
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:02,958
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

553
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:03,720
Speaker 1: Just get some custard.

554
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:05,107
Speaker 0: I mean custard tastes great.

555
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,132
Speaker 0: frozen yogurt.

556
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:07,237
Speaker 0: yogurt still tastes good.

557
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,051
Speaker 0: No, it does You think that?

558
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:13,184
Speaker 1: have some frozen custard again And then taste one.

559
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:17,577
Speaker 1: put even one amount of frozen yogurt on your tongue and your body will reject.

560
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:18,560
Speaker 0: it still tastes good.

561
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,636
Speaker 0: It doesn't taste as good as any of the other frozen delicious alternatives, but now Scott.

562
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:23,580
Speaker 1: so I don't like yogurt.

563
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:28,469
Speaker 1: But actually I really like Icelandic skyr the Siggy's yogurt.

564
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:29,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one yogurt.

565
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:32,160
Speaker 0: I tried to eat and it was too thick heavy and not good.

566
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the badass power yogurt.

567
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,634
Speaker 0: No, it's disgusting yogurt.

568
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:36,960
Speaker 1: political polls.

569
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:43,423
Speaker 1: So there's been a thing recently where and actually Nate Silver did a cool article on it Polling.

570
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,956
Speaker 0: anything he says has to say about it is almost

571
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:46,599
Speaker 1: certainly

572
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:46,860
Speaker 0: correct

573
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:59,883
Speaker 1: Yeah But basically like in recent elections people are like oh the polls are gonna skew like aren't polls being gonna be more inaccurate Because they can't reach young people who have cell phones that they're not allowed to call and don't have landlines and don't respond But young

574
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:02,179
Speaker 0: people don't vote so that cancels out

575
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:04,380
Speaker 1: Except young people are starting to vote more and more.

576
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:12,260
Speaker 1: But the answer is now you can't even poll adults like no one responds to political polls anymore except crazy nut jobs.

577
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:19,909
Speaker 1: So there's this in liar outlier situation where polling increasingly discards outliers But the outliers are actually the accurate ones.

578
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,200
Speaker 1: the poll that's correct is the one that is the outlier that everyone ignores.

579
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:33,960
Speaker 1: So polling is becoming increasingly unreliable and that's gonna really mess up the way American politics works because We can't imagine a politic that doesn't involve political polls, right?

580
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,760
Speaker 0: Well, maybe the Congress people have to start looking at their actual mail.

581
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:37,881
Speaker 0: Alright.

582
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:38,865
Speaker 0: fixed protocol.

583
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:39,307
Speaker 0: That's you.

584
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:39,990
Speaker 0: That's me.

585
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,163
Speaker 0: You want to do a show on this by some obscure thing No one cares about.

586
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:47,880
Speaker 1: so if you want to make some money guys like for real learn the fixed protocol.

587
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,952
Speaker 0: I mean, there's plenty of obscure technological specific things.

588
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:51,915
Speaker 0: You could learn to make money.

589
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:53,200
Speaker 0: You could learn kobalt and make money.

590
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,358
Speaker 1: No, actually that's not nearly as viable as it used to be.

591
00:32:57,161 --> 00:33:07,415
Speaker 1: Be surprised if you can administer a Linux system if you know how to use said and awk and bash and like some pearl Or Python scripting and you learn like baby's.

592
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:16,399
Speaker 1: first fixed protocol Companies like mine will hire you straight out of college and pay you like 80k like seriously It's just tag equals value.

593
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,166
Speaker 0: It's why don't you hire someone with a CS degree who hasn't learned fixed protocol but can do all the other things and teach them The fixed protocol in like a week.

594
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:36,894
Speaker 1: That's actually my strategy lately, but honestly Learn learning the fixed protocol is sort of like a nice test case for learning like the design of protocols in general Because you'll see some things it does and you'll learn a lot about other protocols like.

595
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:38,260
Speaker 1: I guess we couldn't on a whole show.

596
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:39,687
Speaker 1: Oh don't know could have.

597
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:40,652
Speaker 0: I didn't have anything to say.

598
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:42,280
Speaker 0: donuts are the deliciousness.

599
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 0: So I noticed I love apple fritter, which is sort of a donut sort of not I got to admit.

600
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:49,075
Speaker 0: So I like donuts that have a cream filling.

601
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:50,564
Speaker 0: I won't Donuts like.

602
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:55,386
Speaker 0: I like donuts with a glaze like Dunkin Donuts or not donuts In an emergency.

603
00:33:55,406 --> 00:34:01,265
Speaker 0: if I was starving landing in an airport in a you know rural place Oh wait, and I need a don't.

604
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:02,068
Speaker 1: I'll wait.

605
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,040
Speaker 0: It's basically a way to infuse yourself with sugar early in the morning.

606
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,725
Speaker 0: That's all I get.

607
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,659
Speaker 1: but I you know, it's gonna be a real donut.

608
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:15,311
Speaker 1: It's either got to be like a proper like cake donut like fried in oil or it's delicious Or it's got to be a cider.

609
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:21,635
Speaker 1: donuts at the farm Yeah But got a roll in cinnamon well-made yeast donut not a Krispy Kreme like.

610
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:25,172
Speaker 1: I'll never eat one of those things again For those days.

611
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:30,494
Speaker 0: Yeah those days I mean, you know There's some donuts you used to infuse sugar and some you use as a delicious baked good.

612
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:37,170
Speaker 1: regardless of figure intrusion except those Lard Lard is gonna do a whole show on donuts.

613
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:38,074
Speaker 0: No, I think we're done.

614
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:39,159
Speaker 0: I got a lot more to say.

615
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:40,145
Speaker 0: I got nothing else to say.

616
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:41,071
Speaker 0: kids bathroom toys.

617
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,679
Speaker 0: I had a lot of awesome bathroom.

618
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,317
Speaker 1: I had this thing that would hang over the side of the tub and it was like this three-story house thing With like a dock on the bottom.

619
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,830
Speaker 1: So we're like hang over the edge of the tub and be like house.

620
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 1: you put like little people walking around in them and there's A little boat that would float that you could like dock to the little dock.

621
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:03,060
Speaker 1: It was like a little house with a dock under it and that was like the best bathroom toy ever.

622
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,209
Speaker 0: I had a book called I think was about wet wheelie.

623
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,515
Speaker 1: I also had those books.

624
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:16,889
Speaker 0: in the waterproof book There was a penguin and you could move him from page to page to do the different scenes in the bathtub Whatever and I had a little plastic toy.

625
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,233
Speaker 0: That was a boat that would swim around.

626
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:20,020
Speaker 1: I also had the Lego boat.

627
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:20,905
Speaker 0: Yeah had that too.

628
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:21,489
Speaker 0: I had a phone.

629
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:22,395
Speaker 1: Well, which one did you have?

630
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:23,923
Speaker 1: Cuz I had the place But it was white.

631
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:27,137
Speaker 0: It was I think it was the same piece as the police boat, but was more like a.

632
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:34,974
Speaker 1: oh See, I also had the big red freighter that you could buy the optional motor for but my parents could have had this had the Spot for the motor also, but I didn't have the motor.

633
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaker 0: Yeah These foam trains just sort of stuck to the wall in the tub and you could rearrange them into different orders.

634
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,952
Speaker 0: Ah, all right Chinese American food.

635
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:44,780
Speaker 0: I mean, we're in New York City.

636
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,713
Speaker 0: We don't eat that as much anymore, even though there's a ton of it here.

637
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:55,260
Speaker 0: It's actually hard to find good American version of Chinese food because most of the place is just like tasteless, you know, sesame chicken or general.

638
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:03,530
Speaker 0: So I mean honestly, but I eat it once in a while still so it's interesting cuz I always forget But usually real Chinese food in America.

639
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:12,074
Speaker 1: if you don't live in like New York or like a very small No, if you want anything delivered to your house pizza is literally the only option.

640
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:18,060
Speaker 1: if you live in like a hip suburb Maybe you can also get Chinese American food delivered.

641
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:23,124
Speaker 1: So because those are the only two things we could get delivered in Beacon and Rochester.

642
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:25,420
Speaker 0: but the place in Beacon that was near us was really good.

643
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,980
Speaker 0: I was really good actually is better than any of the places that are within walking distance of me now.

644
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,611
Speaker 1: But now that I can get like Turkish food delivered.

645
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:33,800
Speaker 1: I really don't order Chinese food anymore.

646
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:36,700
Speaker 0: I'll get Chinese food like it just if I'm in the mood for it real hard.

647
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,137
Speaker 1: But then I'll get that like jujube vegan Thai fusion instead usually jujube trees.

648
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:45,294
Speaker 0: Yeah Mugging pickpocketing and other street crime.

649
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:50,160
Speaker 1: if you get pickpocketed Moron like it's really easy to not keep your wallet in your front pocket, Jesus Christ.

650
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:59,280
Speaker 0: Or if you have a back pocket and wear tight jeans or have a button have a bag that like closes and close it So someone have to like open it and go through a whole bunch of hassle to get in there.

651
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,143
Speaker 1: Have you ever been mugged?

652
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,712
Speaker 1: No, my mom got mugged like five or six times.

653
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:03,494
Speaker 1: We lived in Detroit.

654
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:04,457
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

655
00:37:04,478 --> 00:37:12,106
Speaker 0: Yeah If you get mugged if I if I got mugged, I assume I would probably just be like, alright, bro Have my money in credit cards.

656
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,773
Speaker 0: moron do whatever the fuck you want.

657
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,560
Speaker 0: It's really just cancel that shit.

658
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,347
Speaker 1: It is real easy to not get mugged.

659
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,580
Speaker 1: Just like have a little bit of situational awareness.

660
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:23,920
Speaker 0: Like I'm in a dark alley all alone is a shady character.

661
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:28,860
Speaker 1: Don't go down that alley or I'm walking down the street and there's a corner on a building.

662
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,920
Speaker 1: Maybe walk a little bit away from the corner and go around it instead of walking right by the corner.

663
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,871
Speaker 0: And I mean we're in New York City even at like 2 a.m.

664
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:37,794
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'll go home.

665
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:39,260
Speaker 0: There's people everywhere.

666
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:42,254
Speaker 0: I bike around like neighborhoods that people think are bad neighborhoods.

667
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:45,284
Speaker 0: No problem Because I'm a white.

668
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:51,689
Speaker 1: the singularity yeah, it's gonna happen but not the capital s1 that Kurzweil and all them talk about.

669
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,900
Speaker 0: yeah that guy I mean Kurzweil I guess he got famous somehow, but he's mostly a nut job.

670
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,315
Speaker 0: He believes that like eating vitamins will make him live forever.

671
00:37:58,356 --> 00:37:59,000
Speaker 0: another nonsense.

672
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:07,575
Speaker 0: So if you got to take anything he says with a whole bag of salt But the concept of this kind of thing like kind of is happening.

673
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:09,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the evangelical version better.

674
00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:11,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not that quite there yet though.

675
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,160
Speaker 1: We haven't just generated mom robots.

676
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:13,904
Speaker 0: It's mostly.

677
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:20,000
Speaker 0: it's a cool nerdy thing to talk about and it's I you know Even though I hope a lot of ghosts in the shell type things are within our lifetime.

678
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:21,851
Speaker 0: I think this one is well beyond our lifetime.

679
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,420
Speaker 0: read the last question by Asimov.

680
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:32,620
Speaker 1: Yeah but a lot of the aspects of this are Happening like the zeitgeist of people on the internet is actually like becoming its own force independent of the people.

681
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:34,782
Speaker 0: Yes, but it's not the singularity No, but it's.

682
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:39,400
Speaker 1: it's the singularity in terms of what that word should actually mean as opposed to Kurzweilian nonsense, right?

683
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,450
Speaker 1: So I feel like I do a whole show on this.

684
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,279
Speaker 0: - no, I got nothing else to say a lot to say.

685
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,489
Speaker 0: still Soldering.

686
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:51,200
Speaker 0: When I was in I learned how to solder in summer camp from an Australian dude.

687
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,349
Speaker 0: So that's why I say soldering right?

688
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,153
Speaker 1: It sounds rush.

689
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:57,693
Speaker 0: It sounds Irish Russian I don't know but Irish Russian.

690
00:38:57,914 --> 00:38:58,720
Speaker 0: he always said solder.

691
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:02,740
Speaker 0: So I say soldering even though I know soldering is the correct Eunice pronunciation.

692
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:12,813
Speaker 0: You take a hot iron Metal stick and you touch some metal bits and you melt them to make something stick to something else And at least once you accidentally jam that shit under your fingernail.

693
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:13,897
Speaker 0: babies first welding.

694
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:14,480
Speaker 0: It's fun.

695
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:16,269
Speaker 0: It's way easier than you think it is.

696
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,200
Speaker 0: You totally do it with some Arduino shit.

697
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,931
Speaker 1: It does require some skill though.

698
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:27,280
Speaker 1: And honestly when I was a kid I really wish I had one given up on having separate flux and just use the solder with the flux.

699
00:39:27,405 --> 00:39:28,865
Speaker 0: Yes use the solder with the flux in it.

700
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:31,115
Speaker 0: get the high quality iron that has the adjustable temperature.

701
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,480
Speaker 1: wait for the iron to heat all The way up and don't hold it on the circuit board too long.

702
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:39,419
Speaker 0: Little and a little sponge you need to clean it off is essential, but I haven't soldered anything in like 20 years.

703
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:42,940
Speaker 0: I have recently because I've you know, I bought some kits to put stuff together.

704
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,840
Speaker 0: Go if you that's a hobby you want to do.

705
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,840
Speaker 0: It's totally cheap and easy to get into kitchen technology fridges microwaves and other kitchen appliances.

706
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,760
Speaker 0: Alright, the rule is you know you because if you just get hooked on cooking, right?

707
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,213
Speaker 0: You're gonna buy a bunch of kitchen shit.

708
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:54,960
Speaker 0: You don't need right?

709
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,168
Speaker 0: So the rule is do something.

710
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:00,020
Speaker 0: you can do everything in the kitchen with a knife because it's a pros do right?

711
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,813
Speaker 1: Well and a stove right and a stove I think.

712
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:07,500
Speaker 1: it says though fridges microwave Oh, that's the examples are all big appliances not little shit.

713
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:16,079
Speaker 0: But I'm saying like if you find yourself say doing you know chopping a whole bunch like and you keep doing it day after day Then get the food processor

714
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:17,485
Speaker 1: But in terms of applying you

715
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,956
Speaker 0: find yourself smashing a ton of fucking garlic cuz you're like garlic in every meal.

716
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:28,266
Speaker 1: then by the garlic Press don't be or just buy pre-smashed garlic at that point or that Microwaves not that essential like.

717
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:33,365
Speaker 1: I don't really use our microwave Emily does but I don't because if you're gonna reheat shit Never use a microwave.

718
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:34,791
Speaker 1: It's almost always the worst option.

719
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:36,096
Speaker 0: I only use the microwave.

720
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,040
Speaker 0: I don't even use for popcorn.

721
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,783
Speaker 0: He's the air popper.

722
00:40:37,823 --> 00:40:40,673
Speaker 1: I use up fridges side-by-side is bullshit.

723
00:40:41,395 --> 00:40:43,945
Speaker 1: Never use a fridge side-by-side I don't really care.

724
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:44,367
Speaker 1: I do.

725
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:45,955
Speaker 1: I care a lot and in turn off shit.

726
00:40:46,980 --> 00:41:00,200
Speaker 0: Oh well Anger management so anger is like a legit feeling that you can have and there's some things that are worth getting angry over like if Someone's totally a dick to you or whatever, but I feel like feeling angry doesn't really accomplish anything.

727
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,706
Speaker 0: It just makes you feel worse.

728
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:13,200
Speaker 0: It makes the person who made you feel angry feel high and mighty and It really doesn't help you achieve any goal whatsoever unless your goal is to Get into a total rage and kick the shit out of somebody.

729
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:17,960
Speaker 0: So you should try to avoid feeling angry regardless of anything that happens in the world.

730
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,220
Speaker 0: And if you keep feeling angry a lot, you should try to do some anger management.

731
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,768
Speaker 1: I mean the answer is it's never worth it.

732
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:28,374
Speaker 0: I used to feel angry a lot in my youth And now I pretty much never feel legit angry anymore.

733
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:29,780
Speaker 1: I just feel sad instead.

734
00:41:30,023 --> 00:41:31,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I see this every day though.

735
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:44,020
Speaker 1: The real problem is people who can't control their anger and anger and lash out so like road rage people like they should never drive Again, pretty much or guys who like try to punch someone like on a bike like yeah, your bike should be taken away.

736
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,023
Speaker 1: You should probably be in jail.

737
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:46,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should get your shit together.

738
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,052
Speaker 0: It's not it's not cool.

739
00:41:48,895 --> 00:41:51,604
Speaker 1: the 2016 Republican Mr.

740
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:53,060
Speaker 0: Watching debates and I walked in the room.

741
00:41:53,082 --> 00:42:05,304
Speaker 1: Yeah so it's very interesting that the Republican Party is imploding so deeply right now and actually I'm missing the debate cuz it just started and Because you can't watch the debate legally online Unless you have cable.

742
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:10,460
Speaker 1: that is really telling as to how old person the Republican Party is.

743
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:15,360
Speaker 1: But I treat the primaries and the political season like every year.

744
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:24,174
Speaker 1: I follow politics the way most people follow sports like I have my favorite teams Like I follow Ted Cruz and what he's doing like I'd follow the Seahawks.

745
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:25,879
Speaker 1: who gives any shits I do.

746
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,282
Speaker 0: It's fun No one cares.

747
00:42:27,302 --> 00:42:28,303
Speaker 1: It's like Eagle in real life.

748
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:29,966
Speaker 0: So not Eagle in real life.

749
00:42:29,986 --> 00:42:32,630
Speaker 0: It is way more garbage than Eagle, but what's?

750
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,691
Speaker 0: That's like saying that boxing is like Dragon Ball.

751
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:37,213
Speaker 0: It's like no.

752
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,000
Speaker 0: Dragon Ball is 10 million times more awesome.

753
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,111
Speaker 0: The Republican primary is like Gundam.

754
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:41,574
Speaker 0: It's like no.

755
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,680
Speaker 0: Gundam is way more awesome.

756
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,840
Speaker 1: You took like all my time just bitching about politics.

757
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,794
Speaker 1: Politics politics are really interesting and I'm gonna watch the up.

758
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:51,023
Speaker 0: guaranteed income Yes, you should.

759
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:55,720
Speaker 0: probably everyone should have a set amount of money to make society more fair.

760
00:42:56,322 --> 00:43:01,620
Speaker 0: I mean imagine if you started a game of Monopoly and some people started with a million dollars and some people started with zero dollars.

761
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:02,700
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

762
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:04,325
Speaker 0: The same thing should be true in life.

763
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:09,140
Speaker 0: if you want things to be fair and just people should start with the same amount of money.

764
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:17,300
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's okay for some people to be rich and some people are stupid Maybe deserve to be poor or if they make bad decisions, but no one should be poor due to bad luck.

765
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:21,334
Speaker 0: We should give everyone some amount of money to start well, especially now.

766
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:23,798
Speaker 0: the problem that there's you already have money Then you don't need it.

767
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,509
Speaker 1: There is not enough work to do.

768
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,340
Speaker 1: that doesn't require skills that are dead.

769
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,742
Speaker 0: That's all.

770
00:43:27,762 --> 00:43:29,350
Speaker 0: that problem is only going to get worse.

771
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,239
Speaker 0: There are more people than there is work to do.

772
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:41,106
Speaker 0: Well, once again robot you need another way to just tribute the goods and food and things in our society Other than the system we have now Which is everyone needs a job to earn money.

773
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:46,607
Speaker 1: robot cars will eliminate the single largest Employing industry in the United States.

774
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:50,119
Speaker 1: like that ends the idea of employment as far as well.

775
00:43:51,064 --> 00:43:51,628
Speaker 1: The end.

776
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,199
Speaker 0: socks get good ones.

777
00:43:53,721 --> 00:44:01,020
Speaker 0: They're really important to be comfortable and once they sort of wear out and don't feel amazing on your feet anymore Throw them out and buy a whole bunch of new ones.

778
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,416
Speaker 1: What if I had to go back to my younger self?

779
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:05,079
Speaker 0: socks are cheap.

780
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,414
Speaker 1: yo And the rule the things I would tell me good ones are me are one.

781
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:11,240
Speaker 1: just throw away all those old socks.

782
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,244
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

783
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:23,055
Speaker 1: - instead of having a hundred pairs of shitty socks so you don't have to do laundry as often in college buy like Five pair of smart wool and just wash them like regularly.

784
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:24,480
Speaker 1: wash them in the sink if you have to.

785
00:44:25,881 --> 00:44:29,080
Speaker 1: Smart wool socks are the only socks worth wearing ever at this point.

786
