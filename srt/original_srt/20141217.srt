1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,427
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 17th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:10,788
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:14,198
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,888
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,919
Speaker 1: The delightful Cucumber Quest.

6
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:18,712
Speaker 1: Cucu.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,745
Speaker 1: It's a webcomic.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,893
Speaker 1: Cucu.

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:21,537
Speaker 1: Cucu.

10
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:21,799
Speaker 1: Cucu.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,748
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,965
Speaker 1: So, I kind of realized that I'm watching a lot of animation lately.

13
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,830
Speaker 1: Like, a lot.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,879
Speaker 1: But I'm not watching a lot of anime.

15
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,310
Speaker 1: I'm kind of off and on watching Yo-Yo Peddle.

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,590
Speaker 0: You can just watch Yo-Yo Peddle.

17
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:40,910
Speaker 0: Every Monday, around afternoon, the new episode's up.

19
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,069
Speaker 0: And then when you get home, Crunchyroll, you can watch it.

20
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,150
Speaker 1: But I was also watching the old Sailor Moon.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,189
Speaker 1: Because now it's getting to the good stuff.

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,029
Speaker 1: And I'm rewatching Nutenna for obvious reasons.

23
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,035
Speaker 0: I ran out of animes.

24
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,210
Speaker 0: I might have to go back on that Sailor Moon train.

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,065
Speaker 0: Back when the long hair, I was a non-normal girl.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that one, Scott, basically if you have been skipping Sailor Moon, did you get up to Queen Beryl, like, getting killed?

27
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:05,890
Speaker 1: Spoilers and all that?

28
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,230
Speaker 0: No, I didn't watch any episodes since long hair guy was hitting on normal girl.

29
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,929
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so I guess, yeah, Queen Beryl loses.

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,028
Speaker 0: You don't say?

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,910
Speaker 1: So, it's probably worth it to watch.

32
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,236
Speaker 1: I didn't see that coming at all.

33
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:18,682
Speaker 0: That's a total surprise.

34
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:19,526
Speaker 0: A bad guy loses.

35
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,330
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

36
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:28,009
Speaker 1: It is worth it to watch Sailor Moon up until, like, all the way up until Queen Beryl loses, the end of, like, the first real season.

37
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,870
Speaker 1: But if you, you can pretty much skip everything after that up until the first episode of S, if you really want to.

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,350
Speaker 0: What happens in that period that Skipple is island episode?

39
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,368
Speaker 1: So, first.

40
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,348
Speaker 0: I want to see some island action.

41
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,609
Speaker 1: First, I watched, like, the Alan and Anne part.

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,450
Speaker 1: I'd never even watched that in Japanese.

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,270
Speaker 1: Two aliens come down in a tree, and it's card captures.

44
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,526
Speaker 1: It's like a lame-o card capture Sakura for a while.

45
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,010
Speaker 1: You don't care.

46
00:01:53,251 --> 00:02:02,450
Speaker 1: Then, the, like, one of the noble families from the old Moon Kingdom, who are all evil and fucked up and are on the bad guys team, they come from, like, the Nega Moon and try to fuck shit up.

47
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,310
Speaker 0: The Nega Moon.

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, Prince Diamond and all that.

49
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,870
Speaker 0: So, this Princess Nega Moon?

50
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,570
Speaker 1: Nah, it's just, it's more Sailor Moon.

51
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,810
Speaker 1: Like, nothing really special happens.

52
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,230
Speaker 0: It's still Monster of the Week?

53
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,650
Speaker 0: There's just a different bad guy producing the Monsters of the Week?

54
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:16,570
Speaker 1: Yes, pretty much.

55
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,990
Speaker 1: Now, it gets into, like, the history and backstory a lot, which is cool.

56
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:27,170
Speaker 1: But otherwise, it's not, like, super different than the first bits of Sailor Moon, except the whole team's together the whole time.

57
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,910
Speaker 0: What about the circus part that's in that music video?

58
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,570
Speaker 1: That's way, way, way, way later.

59
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,450
Speaker 1: That's two seasons.

60
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:37,549
Speaker 1: So, after that R stuff is S. Start with it, just when S starts, just watch that.

61
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:45,270
Speaker 0: 'Cause that's when all the others... A completely different bad guy creates the Monsters of the Week, and that bad guy is better than the other one, somehow.

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,349
Speaker 1: Well, that bad guy's way better, 'cause it's a complicated bad guy.

63
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,690
Speaker 0: It's a bad guy who makes Monsters of the Week.

64
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,850
Speaker 0: What the fuck is the difference?

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,530
Speaker 1: So, you know, in the beginning Sailor Moon, it's like, new sailors come one by one.

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,030
Speaker 0: They get punished in the name of the moon, just like the ones that you think I should skip over.

67
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know how new sailors come one by one, and then, like, the team's, like, being built out?

68
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,969
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon R is, we already got the team, some amnesia, and we reformed the same team again, and then it's just, like, the team.

69
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:15,130
Speaker 1: S is all the awesome Sailor Scouts coming in one by one from the outside.

70
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,650
Speaker 0: So, different good guys fighting the Monster of the Week.

71
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,012
Speaker 0: Yes.

72
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,099
Speaker 1: And you know what?

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,630
Speaker 1: They're just way better sailors.

74
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,029
Speaker 1: Like, they're better at this shit.

75
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,499
Speaker 0: Their boat doesn't crash?

76
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,970
Speaker 0: They've been to the West Indies?

77
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,774
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

78
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:28,915
Speaker 1: Their boat... It's just, you know what it is?

79
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,110
Speaker 1: It's Horatio, and then, like, double Horatio, and then triple Horatio.

80
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,490
Speaker 1: Like, every sailor that comes after the first intersenshi is just better.

81
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,910
Speaker 1: But, so, I was also watching Sailor Moon Crystal.

82
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:45,969
Speaker 1: Because I wanted to review it.

83
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,537
Speaker 0: I don't know why you keep watching bad things.

84
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:50,150
Speaker 0: Have you watched every episode of Sailor Moon Crystal?

85
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,887
Speaker 1: No, I actually stopped, and I kind of want to talk about why.

86
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:55,450
Speaker 1: now, because there's...

87
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,374
Speaker 0: Have you watched more Yoah pedals?

88
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,239
Speaker 0: Or have you watched more...

89
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,550
Speaker 1: I've watched way more Yoah pedals than I've watched Crystals.

90
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,000
Speaker 1: So, here's the deal with Crystal.

91
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,550
Speaker 1: Crystal is bad.

92
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,037
Speaker 0: Don't say.

93
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,250
Speaker 0: It is poorly executed.

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,262
Speaker 0: We already discussed this.

95
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:09,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have.

96
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,369
Speaker 1: So, I was saying, "Oh, I'll watch it anyway to

97
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:13,530
Speaker 1: review.".

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,385
Speaker 1: Why?

99
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,769
Speaker 1: Just so I can review it.

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,070
Speaker 0: You've got to have something better to be watching.

101
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,290
Speaker 1: Plus, it's not that long.

102
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,204
Speaker 0: There's a new Mushishi season.

103
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:21,749
Speaker 0: Why not watch that?

104
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,770
Speaker 1: Because it moves through the story of Sailor Moon.

105
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:29,790
Speaker 1: Aside from the fact that it's technically poorly executed, it just moves through the manga Sailor Moon way fast.

106
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,029
Speaker 1: And that could be cool.

107
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:46,610
Speaker 1: The thing that is preventing me from ever watching this until maybe they finish it and it's on Blu-ray is that, you know how anime nowadays, when they make the show for TV, a lot of stuff is badly animated, and then they fix it in the Blu-ray release.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,099
Speaker 1: That's totally a kill-a-kill.

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,024
Speaker 1: Every anime does that.

110
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,450
Speaker 0: Even if they fixed it, wouldn't it still be bad?

111
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,650
Speaker 1: See, you'd say that, but here's the fucked up thing.

112
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:02,510
Speaker 1: I'm going to link to this article that shows just a really wide collection of all the changes.

113
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,288
Speaker 1: And it's not just that they're cleaning up the animation and fixing... They redid the whole show?

114
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,130
Speaker 1: Basically, yeah.

115
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,928
Speaker 0: Cell by cell?

116
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically, look at this shit.

117
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,010
Speaker 0: Why didn't they do that in the first place?

118
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the left is what was aired on TV and what was aired on Crunchyroll.

119
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,850
Speaker 1: See all those fucked up faces, all things we're complaining about?

120
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,757
Speaker 1: The right doesn't just redo it.

121
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,750
Speaker 1: The right changes the style to look like the original anime.

122
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,490
Speaker 0: The right is... Look at that one at the bottom there.

123
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:36,170
Speaker 0: The right is a greater improvement over the original than any other show I've seen in the TV vs Blu-ray thing.

124
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,830
Speaker 0: But it's still not incredible.

125
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,232
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

126
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,050
Speaker 1: it looks exactly like the original anime now?

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,770
Speaker 0: It's still not so good that it's going to be worth watching.

128
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:49,110
Speaker 1: Well, the primary problems with Sailor Moon Crystal was that technically it was very poorly executed.

129
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,569
Speaker 1: Even though the story is fine.

130
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,270
Speaker 0: Even if they make the design correct, the poses and whatnot are still going to be the same.

131
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,168
Speaker 1: No, they're redoing the poses too.

132
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,937
Speaker 1: They're redoing fucking everything.

133
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,385
Speaker 1: It's like it's being reanimated.

134
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,270
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous.

135
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:04,816
Speaker 0: It's a big difference.

136
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:07,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't deny that it's a humongous difference.

137
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,750
Speaker 0: Bigger than any difference I've ever seen in TV vs DVD.

138
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,950
Speaker 0: It's still not good enough to be watching.

139
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:22,430
Speaker 1: I think it'll be worth watching on the Blu-ray because Sailor Moon's main problem is that it moves so fucking slow and it goes on forever.

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,530
Speaker 0: But you've got nothing better to do.

141
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

142
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,057
Speaker 1: And you know what?

143
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:27,489
Speaker 1: If I'm going to watch The Slow Show, I'm watching L.O.G.H.

144
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,829
Speaker 0: I'm waiting till I'm an old man for that shit.

145
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,181
Speaker 0: I think Gerald...

146
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,230
Speaker 1: Gerald said it best.

147
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:33,910
Speaker 0: Delayed gratification.

148
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,850
Speaker 1: He said Legend of the Galactic Heroes is best watched alone.

149
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,630
Speaker 1: You can't watch that with someone else because you've just got to sit down and pay attention.

150
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:44,230
Speaker 0: You'll all be dead and then I'll need something to do while waiting to die.

151
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,228
Speaker 1: There is no way you're outliving me.

152
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,290
Speaker 0: There is many ways, like when you die skating next week.

153
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,470
Speaker 1: But independent of our divergent opinions on whether or not Sailor Moon Crystal on Blu-ray is going to be worth watching to review, here is my point.

154
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,625
Speaker 1: The fact that they released Sailor Moon Crystal to TV in Crunchyroll as it is.

155
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:10,690
Speaker 1: compared to what they're turning it into, I don't think they planned to clean it up this much because it's not just clean up.

156
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:18,490
Speaker 1: I think that they realized they fucked it up and the bad press was getting so bad that they actually are making a stylistic decision.

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,369
Speaker 0: No one in Japan is intelligent like that.

158
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,419
Speaker 1: No, explain why they did this.

159
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,604
Speaker 1: It's not intelligent.

160
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,630
Speaker 1: They already fucked up.

161
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,531
Speaker 1: I don't know.

162
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:31,750
Speaker 0: All I can say though is that of those eight panels you're looking at, the second one on the left, right?

163
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:32,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one?

164
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:32,798
Speaker 1: Yeah.

165
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, with the lazy eye?

166
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:34,778
Speaker 1: Yeah.

167
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,622
Speaker 0: While it's obviously so bad, but it's sort of like,

168
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:39,703
Speaker 0: "Hey.".

169
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,310
Speaker 1: Except that's not what she was saying at that scene.

170
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,595
Speaker 0: Obviously, but it's like,

171
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,237
Speaker 0: "Hey.".

172
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,350
Speaker 0: I kind of like that that exists.

173
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:51,217
Speaker 1: Yeah.

174
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,490
Speaker 1: Wait, you want bad still images from Sailor Moon?

175
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:02,550
Speaker 0: If it was the better one on the right to begin with, we might not have insulted the show to begin with, but we wouldn't have that amazing, "Hey," lazy eye frame to look at.

176
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,410
Speaker 1: The most stark one is the one at the bottom.

177
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,429
Speaker 0: The bottom one where there's no depth or face, or face is like a paper sheet.

178
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like skeleton face.

179
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,810
Speaker 0: It's like a paper sheet on a neck stick.

180
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,990
Speaker 1: But the fact that I think they originally intended to clean the show up, like every anime, like Kill La Kill did the same thing.

181
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,030
Speaker 1: And I think they have redirected to not just cleaning it up, but changing the style.

182
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,830
Speaker 0: Maybe someone who sucks got fired, and then they slave drove someone else for no money all night to fix it.

183
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,530
Speaker 0: But the moral is, if you care about the show at all- And that you're cracking that whip, you demanding quality animation.

184
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,898
Speaker 1: Do not watch this show on Crunchyroll.

185
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,222
Speaker 1: Do not watch it live.

186
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,366
Speaker 1: Do not watch it on TV.

187
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:42,690
Speaker 1: Fuck that business.

188
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:48,310
Speaker 1: If you're gonna watch it, there is literally no reason to not wait for and/or pirate the Blu-rays at this point.

189
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,369
Speaker 0: Or you could just not watch it at all.

190
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could say that about any piece of media.

191
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,949
Speaker 0: I could say that about any bad piece of media.

192
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,113
Speaker 1: It's not that bad.

193
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:03,809
Speaker 1: It's just poorly executed in a way that somehow- You wouldn't give any shits.

194
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,510
Speaker 0: No, not necessarily, because the fact that- There are like 20 better animes you could be watching.

195
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,850
Speaker 1: Name 20 anime that I haven't already seen that are recent, that are worth watching more so.

196
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,670
Speaker 0: I picked a number that was too big.

197
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,549
Speaker 0: Name five.

198
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,389
Speaker 0: Well, there's a new Mushishi show.

199
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,196
Speaker 1: Yeah.

200
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:21,684
Speaker 0: One.

201
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,790
Speaker 0: You haven't watched every episode of You Up, Have You?

202
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's two.

203
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:25,606
Speaker 0: Two.

204
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:26,430
Speaker 0: I can keep going.

205
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:26,655
Speaker 0: Two.

206
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,088
Speaker 0: There's a super deformed, uh, Hokuto.

207
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:30,470
Speaker 0: no Ken.

208
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,870
Speaker 1: Those always suck, unless you can show me evidence that this one doesn't suck.

209
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,708
Speaker 1: I don't trust it.

210
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:37,630
Speaker 1: Is it really, Scott?

211
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just got licensed by, uh- Yeah, is it really actually good?

212
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,050
Speaker 1: Is it the one we already watched?

213
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,150
Speaker 0: It's better than Sailor Moon Crystal.

214
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,430
Speaker 1: Is it the one where they work in the convenience store?

215
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:45,703
Speaker 1: Yes.

216
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,589
Speaker 1: Because that one kind of sucked.

217
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,070
Speaker 1: That one's good.

218
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,249
Speaker 1: No, you're still only named two.

219
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,159
Speaker 0: You haven't watched Space Brothers.

220
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,070
Speaker 0: There's a zillion episodes of that motherfucker.

221
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, so while- I haven't watched it either.

222
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's a wash.

223
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,430
Speaker 1: Because while arguably it is a better show- I don't have to have watched it.

224
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:04,490
Speaker 1: It's got the old Sailor Moon problem if there's a billion episodes.

225
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,469
Speaker 0: There's a billion episodes of, uh, fairy tales from Japan.

226
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

227
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:11,849
Speaker 1: I've watched almost all of them because that show's amazing.

228
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,830
Speaker 1: I watch them, like, every time I'm mopping and sweeping and, like, doing shit in the apartment.

229
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,230
Speaker 1: I also watch them while I'm dead in Counter-Strike.

230
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:27,110
Speaker 0: You should make a mod for Counter-Strike where when you're dead, it would switch to VLC and then switch back when you come back to life.

231
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,190
Speaker 0: And automatically pause and unpause?

232
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,048
Speaker 1: That would be an amazing thing to make.

233
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,848
Speaker 0: Alright, so make it.

234
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,770
Speaker 1: Or even better, just have it show you a random YouTube video every time you're dead.

235
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,120
Speaker 0: There's that some show the listeners keep telling us to watch.

236
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,610
Speaker 0: that looks like a perverted show and I need you to confirm- Bakemonogatari?

237
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,263
Speaker 0: No.

238
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,689
Speaker 1: Because that's the perverted one.

239
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,423
Speaker 0: Akame Ga Kill or something?

240
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:47,876
Speaker 1: I need you to confirm- Wait, who told us to watch that?

241
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:51,729
Speaker 1: Because I've read things that tell me that those people might be bad people.

242
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:58,210
Speaker 0: I did a Google image search and I'm pretty sure this show is garbage, harem, whatever, pervertedness.

243
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,349
Speaker 0: But people are saying we should watch it, so you go check it out first.

244
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:08,209
Speaker 1: Isn't this the show that people in the Animators Network Forum were, like, flipping out when people criticized it?

245
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,370
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about that because I've never been to the Animators Network Forum.

246
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,601
Speaker 1: I am going to use a term that I've been using.

247
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,210
Speaker 1: I've been saying this word a lot lately.

248
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:16,992
Speaker 1: Skep.

249
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,129
Speaker 1: I am skep about this show.

250
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,349
Speaker 0: You're too lazy to say skeptical?

251
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:27,630
Speaker 1: No, because skep implies this sort of, like, I am above this and I am skeptical of it.

252
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:27,972
Speaker 1: Ah.

253
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,748
Speaker 1: That's what skep means.

254
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,709
Speaker 0: Well, you still need to watch it to, uh, you know.

255
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:39,730
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, so if I go, wait, if I have to watch the show to review it, why don't I watch the Blu-ray Sailor Moon Crystal?

256
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,658
Speaker 0: Because you know everything is known by Sailor Moon.

257
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,164
Speaker 0: You need to go and do this for me.

258
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,390
Speaker 0: I don't care about Sailor Moon.

259
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,389
Speaker 0: I need information about this show.

260
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,730
Speaker 1: Scott, you would care a lot more about Sailor Moon if you knew about Sailor Moon.

261
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,763
Speaker 0: Also, uh, I can think of some old animes you haven't seen.

262
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,730
Speaker 0: Have you seen all of Pat LeVoir TV?

263
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:58,308
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

264
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:58,998
Speaker 0: You haven't.

265
00:11:59,202 --> 00:11:59,609
Speaker 0: There you go.

266
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,410
Speaker 1: Alright, so already you've had to deviate into old-ass anime.

267
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,929
Speaker 0: Scott, I thought you said you've seen all the anime.

268
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:06,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

269
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,230
Speaker 0: But apparently one of the greatest shows of all time you haven't seen.

270
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,297
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott, I'm going to cancel that out.

271
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:12,029
Speaker 1: Have you seen all of Kodocha?

272
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:13,889
Speaker 0: Uh, neither have you.

273
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:15,188
Speaker 1: I've seen more of it than you.

274
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:20,629
Speaker 1: All you've seen is half of that, like, movie compilation because you fell asleep during it.

275
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,268
Speaker 0: Listen, not everyone can watch anime at TYF.

276
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,290
Speaker 1: How much Project Aco have you seen?

277
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,930
Speaker 0: Uh, I saw all of it a zillion years ago.

278
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,630
Speaker 1: Have you actually seen all of it, Scott?

279
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,840
Speaker 0: It was on Syfy Channel.

280
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:31,990
Speaker 0: I remember nothing.

281
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,288
Speaker 1: Scott, not all of it.

282
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,070
Speaker 0: I was, like, who knows how old.

283
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,230
Speaker 1: Scott, there's way more Project Aco than was aired on the Syfy Channel.

284
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,769
Speaker 0: I saw everything that was on the Syfy Channel.

285
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,790
Speaker 1: So you saw, like, the first one, two episodes.

286
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,930
Speaker 0: And I remember nothing.

287
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,166
Speaker 1: Did you see the movie Battle Gray, Battle Blue?

288
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:47,630
Speaker 1: Well, the OAV.

289
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,370
Speaker 0: I didn't even know a thing like that existed.

290
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,218
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

291
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,129
Speaker 1: Well, alright.

292
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,530
Speaker 0: But I doubt that it is more important to watch than Battle Boy, the TV series.

293
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,370
Speaker 1: I'm betting that old Project Aco is way more important to watch than Agame Ga Kill.

294
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,603
Speaker 1: Which, funnily enough...

295
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,050
Speaker 0: I'm not defending Agame Ga Kill.

296
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,609
Speaker 0: When I typed Agame Ga Kill... I need you to see it so that I can know.

297
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,890
Speaker 1: It looks like a lot of people...

298
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,210
Speaker 0: Without suffering on my own.

299
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,530
Speaker 1: I tried to type Agame, and then Google was like Ga Kill and No Kill.

300
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,850
Speaker 1: So I think people don't actually know the title of this anime.

301
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,088
Speaker 0: I don't know what the difference is.

302
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,794
Speaker 1: It's about an assassin group, night raid, to encorrupt... What?

303
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:23,910
Speaker 1: What?

304
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,728
Speaker 0: Is it like noir?

305
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:34,490
Speaker 1: Serialization of Square Enix's Ga... The more I read about this, the less likely it is that this is good.

306
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,850
Speaker 0: I didn't think it was good to begin with.

307
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,250
Speaker 1: It might be a dark... It might be a perverted darker than black.

308
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,550
Speaker 1: This might be darker than black plus Bakemonogatari.

309
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,278
Speaker 1: Anyway... Anyway...

310
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,249
Speaker 0: In news!

311
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:54,989
Speaker 0: If you're in New York, because you're an awesome person and not somewhere else, as a totally lame-o geographical location, every other place on the entire face of the earth, this is a good week to be in New York.

312
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,670
Speaker 1: Well, it's always a good week to be in New York.

313
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:08,790
Speaker 0: An even better week to be in New York, because an even more awesome person than you is in New York, named Brian K. Vaughan, perhaps one of the greatest comic book writers alive and working at the time.

314
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,558
Speaker 1: What's he doing here?

315
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:10,569
Speaker 1: It's not New York Comic Con.

316
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,310
Speaker 0: He's just hanging out in town, and tomorrow, he's going to be at the Kinokuniya Bookstore.

317
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:15,719
Speaker 0: Huh?

318
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:17,787
Speaker 1: From...

319
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:18,850
Speaker 0: Which one?

320
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,949
Speaker 0: The one near Bryant Park.

321
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,390
Speaker 1: Okay.

322
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,811
Speaker 0: From 3 to 6.

323
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,887
Speaker 1: The one where we interviewed TM Revolution?

324
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:26,250
Speaker 1: That one.

325
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,089
Speaker 0: Yes, that one.

326
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, guys, we interviewed TM Revolution once.

327
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,570
Speaker 0: And the day after that, he's going to be in Midtown Comics downtown.

328
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,150
Speaker 0: So, it's like there isn't even a convention.

329
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,670
Speaker 0: But it's the only person you would need to see at a convention anyway.

330
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,070
Speaker 0: New York is living in New York.

331
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,729
Speaker 0: If there was a convention, he is the only person you would see.

332
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,910
Speaker 0: And anything you would buy at the convention, you can buy at either of these two stores.

333
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,730
Speaker 0: Living in New York is like being at a convention.

334
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,729
Speaker 0: You can see him twice.

335
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,810
Speaker 0: Go to Kinokuniya, go to Midtown.

336
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,000
Speaker 0: It won't even take you all day.

337
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,109
Speaker 0: You won't have to pay an entry fee.

338
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:02,269
Speaker 0: And yeah, dude wrote Saga, so... It's better than anyone else you're going to see in your town.

339
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,469
Speaker 0: And if you're in New York, go see him.

340
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,290
Speaker 0: I might try to see him tomorrow at Kinokuniya after work.

341
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,151
Speaker 0: He's going to be there from 3 to 6.

342
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,229
Speaker 0: So, I can leave work at 5 and just walk over there.

343
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:13,268
Speaker 0: It's really close.

344
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,629
Speaker 0: Maybe there won't be a huge line.

345
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:16,230
Speaker 0: Alright.

346
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,229
Speaker 0: Or maybe I'll just go home.

347
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,890
Speaker 1: So, I got a real quick Geek Byte here.

348
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,408
Speaker 1: So, a show that I just ignored for whatever reason for a long time.

349
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,009
Speaker 1: Enough people I trust told me to watch it.

350
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,810
Speaker 1: And one of them was like, I'm just putting on a... They pulled my trick of just put on an episode while they're hanging out.

351
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,188
Speaker 1: And then they'll watch it.

352
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,488
Speaker 1: So, they did that to me.

353
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,649
Speaker 1: And I watched an episode of Rick and Morty.

354
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:43,170
Speaker 1: And Rick and Morty is really, really, really good.

355
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,930
Speaker 1: And kind of like how I've recommended The Amazing World of Gumball.

356
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,250
Speaker 1: And Adventure Brothers, Archer, all those shows.

357
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,650
Speaker 1: Rick and Morty makes that vaunted list.

358
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:01,410
Speaker 1: Rick and Morty is basically... Imagine if Doctor Who was crossed with the Doc from Back to the Future.

359
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,730
Speaker 1: And was fucked up and kind of mean and possibly evil.

360
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,890
Speaker 1: And he was taking his grandson on Doctor Who style adventures through the universe.

361
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,870
Speaker 0: That doesn't make me want to watch that.

362
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you hate animation.

363
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,090
Speaker 1: You don't watch anything.

364
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,089
Speaker 1: So, I didn't even expect you.

365
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,270
Speaker 0: Why are you watching this instead of Mamoru Oshin created Battle of War the TV series?

366
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,570
Speaker 1: Rick and Morty is pretty fucking hilarious.

367
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,230
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

368
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,950
Speaker 1: It's also, it's got that thing going on kind of like Adventure Brothers did.

369
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,410
Speaker 0: Even robot police cops going out to get Chinese food?

370
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:36,909
Speaker 1: That isn't hilarious so much as like sense of good-natured camaraderie.

371
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:38,630
Speaker 0: Well, you see that episode.

372
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,470
Speaker 0: It's actually one of those fucked up weirdo episodes.

373
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:44,730
Speaker 0: Where everything's dark and spooky.

374
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,030
Speaker 1: Rick and Morty has that same kind of thing going on that like Venture Brothers does.

375
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,990
Speaker 1: Where it's funny, it's mean-spirited, it is dark humor.

376
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,170
Speaker 1: But yet, the characters are deep and interesting enough.

377
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,850
Speaker 1: The stories are interesting enough.

378
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:02,590
Speaker 1: The whole world and everything they're setting up around them is such that you actually like really get into these characters.

379
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,250
Speaker 1: They can kind of grow and build on itself and do really fun stuff.

380
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,270
Speaker 1: So, I'll talk about it more in depth at some point later.

381
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,310
Speaker 1: Season 2 was supposed to air in 2015.

382
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,229
Speaker 1: They're running out of time on that.

383
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,170
Speaker 1: But season 1 is great and the entire thing is just totally free.

384
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,989
Speaker 1: And you can just watch it on the Cartoon Network website like right now.

385
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,148
Speaker 1: So, watch Rick and Morty.

386
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,710
Speaker 0: After you watch every other show, especially the most important animation that was made.

387
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,089
Speaker 0: We've talked about so many animes right now and so many cartoons right now.

388
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:43,130
Speaker 0: We have neglected to mention the greatest animation that has been created in the past few months is South Park.

389
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,610
Speaker 1: South Park's been hitting it out of the park lately.

390
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,688
Speaker 0: I think it's been hitting it right on the park.

391
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:49,651
Speaker 1: Well, no.

392
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:51,507
Speaker 1: It's hitting it out of the park like a home run.

393
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,830
Speaker 0: It's North Park now?

394
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,289
Speaker 1: If you hit it on the park, that's at best an RBI.

395
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:57,829
Speaker 0: It's South Park.

396
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,826
Speaker 0: If it had it out of the park, it wouldn't be good.

397
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:04,529
Speaker 1: That was a stretch.

398
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:13,060
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

399
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,620
Speaker 1: So, we're going to be at Anime Boston and we're going to be at Zenkai Con doing our anime panels and all that stuff.

400
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:20,440
Speaker 0: Are we going to Zenkai Con?

401
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:20,858
Speaker 0: Yeah.

402
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,319
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe.

403
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,300
Speaker 1: Well, it's either Zenkai Con or Genericon.

404
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:26,738
Speaker 0: We can just not do either one.

405
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,460
Speaker 1: I really need the people.

406
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,179
Speaker 1: It's a toka kokan.

407
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,460
Speaker 1: We perform at Zenkai Con and in return, certain high quality people staff at Kinetic Con.

408
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,051
Speaker 0: Are they going to refuse to go to Kinetic Con?

409
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,300
Speaker 0: if we refuse to go to Zenkai Con?

410
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:39,807
Speaker 1: I don't know.

411
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,319
Speaker 1: Probably not.

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,429
Speaker 1: But also, you know what?

413
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:42,439
Speaker 0: Zenkai Con is kind of fun.

414
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,360
Speaker 0: Because Kinetic Con is actually, like, I would go to Kinetic Con if I wasn't working there.

415
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,440
Speaker 1: Kinetic Con is like one of... Kinetic Con...

417
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Speaker 0: Some but not all packs is Magfest.

418
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,879
Speaker 0: Even though I'm working there, I still kind of don't want to go to Zenkai.

419
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,960
Speaker 1: But one, I'll go to Zenkai Con because we can take the train directly there and back.

420
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:01,732
Speaker 1: And two...

421
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,000
Speaker 0: Alright, there was that train that went back to the inn.

422
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,680
Speaker 1: We don't really do a lot of anime cons anymore, but yeah, we have a lot of good anime content.

423
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:14,780
Speaker 1: So in that con, I'm going to do a new version of anime openers around the world because I found some shit.

424
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,980
Speaker 0: You did find some shit indeed.

425
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,380
Speaker 0: Yes.

426
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:18,405
Speaker 1: Good God.

427
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:21,520
Speaker 1: Lupin, Lupin, Lupin.

428
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:23,159
Speaker 1: That might be my favorite thing.

429
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:28,000
Speaker 1: So one of the parts of that panel is the Portuguese opener to Harlock.

430
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Speaker 1: And I learned from both a fan and Lou that that was based... Two separate people.

431
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,354
Speaker 1: I don't know if I call Lou a fan.

432
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:37,919
Speaker 1: He's more friends.

433
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,360
Speaker 0: I thought he's a fan of Harlock.

434
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,627
Speaker 1: No, I'm not a boss.

435
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,179
Speaker 1: The fan of us told me this.

436
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,838
Speaker 1: Lou also told me this.

437
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:51,020
Speaker 1: So that song was the way it was because the Harlock opener is like melodramatic old Japanese music.

438
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,351
Speaker 1: Harlock is a melodramatic show.

439
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:57,477
Speaker 1: The opener in Portuguese... I've seen a bunch of it, but...

440
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,560
Speaker 0: Why are you watching?

441
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:05,560
Speaker 1: The Portuguese opener is that melodrama dialed up to like a million.

442
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,280
Speaker 1: Like it's amazing.

443
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,260
Speaker 1: And the reason for that is because it's based on a style of music that's basically known only to Portugal.

444
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:15,182
Speaker 1: Fado.

445
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:27,799
Speaker 1: Fado, F-A-D-O, is essentially the music that came from wives wailing at the ocean in sorrow and melancholy for their husbands who are sailing the endless seas.

446
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, because their ships got blowed day up by England, Spain, France.

447
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,334
Speaker 1: Well, also just because sailing the endless seas in the 1500s and 1600s was a lot more...

448
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,618
Speaker 0: You also just sink.

449
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,300
Speaker 1: Mysterious and scary and amazing.

450
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,199
Speaker 0: There'd be dragons.

451
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:51,160
Speaker 1: So that music was why that opener was the way it was and probably why Harlock is so fucking popular in Portugal.

452
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,959
Speaker 1: This is a video of Emilia...

453
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
Speaker 0: The old ladies are big Harlock fans because he reminds them of their husbands that died at sea.

454
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:06,900
Speaker 1: So Emilia Rodriguez, I can't pronounce Portuguese at all, I'm not sure what that accent means, is basically the queen of Fado music.

455
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,980
Speaker 1: And this is video of her performing Fado music.

456
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,418
Speaker 1: The melancholy might melt you.

457
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,500
Speaker 0: So, one of the best, speaking of comics from before, right?

458
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:30,940
Speaker 0: While Brian K. Vaughan might be one of the best living writers of comics that are printed in on the shelf of the comic book store, one of the best makers of webcomics these days be Casey Green.

459
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,060
Speaker 1: Nah, Casey Green.

460
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,997
Speaker 0: But did you know, creator of such great comics as Gunshow and Anime Club, which is part of Gunshow and such, Gunshow be ending, yo.

461
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:42,180
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

462
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,500
Speaker 0: He's already uploaded the final Gunshows and they are displaying on a schedule, and by the end of this year, there will be no more Gunshows.

463
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,131
Speaker 0: Possibly ever.

464
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:52,819
Speaker 0: Likely ever.

465
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 1: You know, if you never read Gunshow, this is your trigger.

466
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,997
Speaker 1: You might as well start because you're just going to read it all the way to the end and not have to wait.

467
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,500
Speaker 0: However, do not fret.

468
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:08,060
Speaker 0: Casey Green is doing two other com- well, he's doing a lot of other things.

469
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:12,739
Speaker 0: He's done some regular show comic books and things like that.

470
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,460
Speaker 0: But he is doing two other webcomics right now.

471
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,340
Speaker 0: One of them is called Back, which seems to be a continuing story, beginning with some dude kicking his way out of a grave.

472
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,080
Speaker 1: That's already up my alley.

473
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,872
Speaker 0: So that, you can be found at backcomic.com, B-A-C-K-C-O-M-I-C.

474
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:37,900
Speaker 0: And then he's also doing Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, adapted by Casey Green.

475
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:42,940
Speaker 0: [laughter] And that is at Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio.

476
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,399
Speaker 1: I want to fix your nose.

477
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:44,961
Speaker 0: Dot.

478
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,733
Speaker 0: tumblr dot.

479
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:47,679
Speaker 0: tumblr dot com.

480
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:59,651
Speaker 0: So once you finish Gunshow at the end of this year, delete that from your comic rocket, which you should be using, and add these two things to your comic rocket, and you're now plus one comic.

481
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:01,180
Speaker 0: It's only a good thing in my book.

482
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:06,512
Speaker 1: In the meantime, we're going to be at PAX South performing bad games on Sunday in the Armadillo Theater.

483
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,300
Speaker 1: It's going to be awesome.

484
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,480
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we'll just be there eating barbecue and making fun of the South.

485
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,049
Speaker 1: The book club book is Watership Down.

486
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,740
Speaker 1: It's about rabbits on a journey.

487
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,694
Speaker 1: It's a great book.

488
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,706
Speaker 0: Find us on the internet.

489
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,640
Speaker 0: We are everywhere on the internet that you are.

490
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,300
Speaker 0: If you are not on the internet enough, be on the internet more.

491
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,432
Speaker 1: And join the Geek Nights Forum.

492
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:23,760
Speaker 1: We pay a lot of money for that fucking thing.

493
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:32,739
Speaker 0: Close your eyes and imagine a room with many tables and nerds hanging out, doing many things, such as playing games with each other and chatting it up and hanging out and doing stuff.

494
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,427
Speaker 0: That is the internet.

495
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:36,380
Speaker 0: Why are you not in that room all the time?

496
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,365
Speaker 0: We are in this room.

497
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:39,235
Speaker 0: It has a big ass sign out the door.

498
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,079
Speaker 0: You can't miss it.

499
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,158
Speaker 0: Come in that room and then we'll lock you in.

500
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,578
Speaker 1: Also, we ban people from the room who have bad grammar and spelling or who make dumb arguments.

501
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,648
Speaker 0: There are no smelly bad guys in that room.

502
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:54,380
Speaker 0: Occasionally, we go *sniffing* in a dumb ass into the room and have fun with them, and then they walk their own ass out.

503
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, like when that Gomer Gator came in.

504
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,000
Speaker 1: Notice how he's gone.

505
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,630
Speaker 0: -He gone.

506
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,240
Speaker 1: -Yeah, he gone.

507
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:58,868
Speaker 0: -He gone.

508
00:23:58,888 --> 00:23:59,380
Speaker 0: -He sleep.

509
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:00,933
Speaker 1: Worldstar!

510
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,540
Speaker 1: I need a Worldstar gift to post every time we drive that guy out of the forum.

511
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,531
Speaker 0: -Well, go find him.

512
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,059
Speaker 1: -I will.

513
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:17,480
Speaker 1: So, speaking of webcomics that you should add to your Comic Rocket, if you haven't been reading Cucumber Quest or QQ, as the cool kids call it, that's what we're about to talk about.

514
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,618
Speaker 0: So, Cucumber Quest is a webcomic made by a very awesome person named GG DG.

515
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,180
Speaker 1: Who you should follow on Twitter.

516
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,178
Speaker 0: The best name ever.

517
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,259
Speaker 1: 'Cause, one, she tweets awesome art.

518
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Speaker 1: Two, her Twitter is hilarious, and it's exactly 50% as crazy as Natasha Allegri's Twitter.

519
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,895
Speaker 0: I followed Natasha Allegri for two days and I couldn't handle it.

520
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:40,660
Speaker 0: It was too strong.

521
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,303
Speaker 1: You know what?

522
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,580
Speaker 1: Following her on Twitter is like just mainlining internet.

523
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,743
Speaker 0: Yeah.

524
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:45,386
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

525
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,160
Speaker 0: So, Q, I always knew this existed, but I didn't read it.

526
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,218
Speaker 0: 'cause it was so far along I didn't have time to catch up.

527
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,957
Speaker 1: -I read it, like, religiously.

528
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:52,220
Speaker 1: -Right.

529
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:55,280
Speaker 0: Rin was reading it religiously on the webcomic version.

530
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,719
Speaker 0: So, what I did instead is she has kickstarters for every volume, and she just finished kickstarting volume three, and I kickstarted one and two and received one and two, but never read them.

531
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:09,660
Speaker 0: And volume three's on its way, and I'm probably just gonna kickstart it and read it in volumes.

532
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,860
Speaker 0: 'Cause each volume, it's sort of like, it's one of those segmented stories with, you know, bosses on an adventure.

533
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:23,560
Speaker 0: So, each volume is like one segment, so it's really easy to read that way, and a lot more comfortable and fast than reading the webcomic going next, next, next.

534
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,423
Speaker 1: -Though at the same time...

535
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:28,940
Speaker 0: -And I'm sure one day the printed volumes will catch up to the webcomic, and then I can switch over.

536
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,054
Speaker 1: The reason I enjoyed reading it as a webcomic primarily was that because I was already pretty much caught up the whole time...

537
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,699
Speaker 0: Where was it when you started reading it?

538
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:39,749
Speaker 1: I was reading it from near the beginning.

539
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,236
Speaker 1: Like, we hadn't gotten too far...

540
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,401
Speaker 0: -Yeah.

541
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:43,895
Speaker 0: I did not discover it early enough.

542
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:44,360
Speaker 0: -Yeah.

543
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:50,556
Speaker 0: But when I did see it many years ago, you know, I saw the arts, and I was like, "Oh, my God, this comic is...".

544
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:55,860
Speaker 0: I mean, regardless of anything else I know about, I saw, like, pictures of it, and I knew it was incredible.

545
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:57,839
Speaker 0: I just didn't read it because...

546
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:05,380
Speaker 1: So, my enjoyment of reading it on the web was that because I only got one page at a time, I would spend a lot more time appreciating the art of the page.

547
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,879
Speaker 0: I spent quite a lot of time appreciating...

548
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,952
Speaker 1: -'Cause the thing... I mean, things to appreciate...

549
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:09,760
Speaker 0: -Any page with crabs on it.

550
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,060
Speaker 1: The colors and framing, it has this kind of watercolor-y, awesome, washed-out...

551
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,015
Speaker 0: -There aren't a lot of webcomics that look like this.

552
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:15,680
Speaker 0: -Exactly.

553
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,427
Speaker 1: The character's super cute.

554
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,980
Speaker 1: She puts a lot of attention into their hair and outfits.

555
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:29,948
Speaker 0: If you look at some of the extras in the back of the printed volumes, she shows, like, the development of, like, the character design for, like, Princess Nautilus over the years, and it's like,

556
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:30,294
Speaker 0: "Whoa!".

557
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,079
Speaker 0: And you can just see, like, her drawing skill getting better, and the design getting better, and everything getting better, and it's, oh, my gosh.

558
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Speaker 1: So, it's a story about a rabbit named Cucumber who's trying to go to wizard school, and his stupid dad makes him go save the world.

559
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,526
Speaker 1: -Yep.

560
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:46,138
Speaker 1: -And he doesn't want to.

561
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,298
Speaker 0: This is somewhere in between, right, like, Bone and...

562
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,428
Speaker 1: -Yeah, a little bit of Bone.

563
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:53,840
Speaker 0: -And Adventure Time, right?

564
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,938
Speaker 1: That's a really good way to put it, actually.

565
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:07,080
Speaker 0: It's like, Bone has some comedies, you know, but it's sort of, like, a more serious adventure, even though it has comedies, and Adventure Time is also serious and has comedies.

566
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Speaker 0: But it's mostly, "Eh..." Right, and this is, like, right in the middle of those two.

567
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,159
Speaker 0: Like, you take Adventure Time, and you tone it down with some Bone, and you add some cuteness to the Adventure Time side.

568
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,355
Speaker 1: Yep, like, Cucumber Quest is very self-aware, and it does a little bit of that, like, trope deconstruction, like, "Oh, the great hero has to

569
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:26,599
Speaker 1: come.".

570
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,651
Speaker 1: "Well, this has happened, what, 99 times before?

571
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:29,536
Speaker 1: That seems

572
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:29,958
Speaker 1: stupid.".

573
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,155
Speaker 1: "Oh, and all the characters recognize this.

574
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:32,296
Speaker 1: Mmm.".

575
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it doesn't rely on that as the only reason you care about it.

576
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, the greatness of Cucumber Quest is really just that.

577
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,900
Speaker 0: most of the characters are just awesome.

578
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

579
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:49,060
Speaker 1: Scott, on three, one, two, three, what is your favorite character?

580
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,939
Speaker 0: Anyone that's a crab.

581
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:51,818
Speaker 1: Just the crab bros?

582
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,308
Speaker 0: Well, okay, so here's the problem.

583
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,476
Speaker 0: How do I choose, right?

584
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,035
Speaker 0: At first, they come out with these crab mafias, and I'm like, "Crab mafia is the

585
00:27:59,056 --> 00:27:59,239
Speaker 0: best."

586
00:27:59,301 --> 00:27:59,855
Speaker 0: Crab bros.

587
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:08,534
Speaker 0: And then, this crab bro, which is one crab who wears sunglasses, who's, like, deal with it, "I'm crab bro, but I'm the nicest, awesomest dude, but I'm a

588
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:08,839
Speaker 0: bro.".

589
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:18,496
Speaker 0: And then, they got Bubblebeard, the giant crab pirate king, who runs a tropical resort because he's done pirating, and it's like, "How can it be better than

590
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:18,739
Speaker 0: that?".

591
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,639
Speaker 0: Well, crab bro is about equal to that.

592
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:23,379
Speaker 0: And pretty much anyone that's a crab is the best.

593
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,555
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'm just a fan of, like, peridot.

594
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:27,940
Speaker 1: Peridot is also awesome.

595
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,140
Speaker 1: More like peridont.

596
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, peridot is, like, so awesome.

597
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,140
Speaker 1: She reminds me of the witch girl from the old Game Boy Legend of Zelda.

598
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ages and seasons.

599
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,480
Speaker 0: The only thing wrong with peridot is that she is not a crab.

600
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:48,220
Speaker 0: That is the only thing that keeps her from being tier one is that she does not have two big red claws and a beard made of bubbles.

601
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,299
Speaker 1: I also really like Kyuko's little sister.

602
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's okay.

603
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:54,419
Speaker 0: She's good.

604
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,487
Speaker 1: Well, partly because she's got that very much, like, "Fuck it, I got a sword.

605
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,537
Speaker 1: Let's just fucking do this.

606
00:28:58,597 --> 00:28:58,799
Speaker 1: What's

607
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:58,920
Speaker 1: wrong?".

608
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:13,380
Speaker 0: There are a lot of, like, the main characters from Attack on Titan, right, where the dude is sort of, like, you know, the plot dude, and then the badass, well, Attack on Titan is not actually his sister, but, you know, sort of, like, the sister character.

609
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,500
Speaker 0: The person in that slot is the badass, awesome, sword, stabby, killy person.

610
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,825
Speaker 1: Yep, but what's funny, too, is that- Mikasa, right?

611
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,720
Speaker 0: Mikasa and Eren.

612
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,239
Speaker 1: I was reading this, and then, like, relatively recently, I got into the amazing world of Gumball.

613
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:32,260
Speaker 1: In Gumball, the little sister, Anaïs, is a rabbit girl, and her and Almond are extremely similar.

614
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:33,552
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

615
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,100
Speaker 1: Which is just kind of interesting.

616
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:39,800
Speaker 1: I also really like Cucumber's Dad, because you know he's up to something.

617
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:45,878
Speaker 0: Well, it's like Cucumber's Dad started out as, like, his first time I saw him, I was like, "This guy

618
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:46,180
Speaker 0: sucks.".

619
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,520
Speaker 0: I still don't like him that much, but he's definitely doing something, because he's hanging in that- he's not stupid.

620
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:01,780
Speaker 0: You can tell he's not dumb, and he's hanging out in that prison cell, even though it's locked, and he obviously spied on the bad guys once already.

621
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:05,020
Speaker 0: At the minimum, he's staying there on purpose to spy on the bad guys.

622
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,533
Speaker 0: If not more than that.

623
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:07,340
Speaker 0: Right?

624
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:07,818
Speaker 1: Yup.

625
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,039
Speaker 0: And, like, why didn't- he could've messed up those balls, but he chose not to.

626
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,628
Speaker 0: But he knew the deal.

627
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:13,689
Speaker 0: So...

628
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:24,539
Speaker 1: Well, this- it's interesting, because if you read the story, it's pretty much the story of the heroes around their adventure, and all the adults around them know what the deal is and won't tell them.

629
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
Speaker 0: Well, the friggin' Oracle, she can go suck a dick.

630
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's the worst.

631
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:29,220
Speaker 1: She's mean.

632
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,640
Speaker 1: Well, you know, obviously there's some big plot around that.

633
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,853
Speaker 0: Hey, Auril, why don't you do it yourself?

634
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,039
Speaker 0: Don't tell me how to do my job.

635
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:36,576
Speaker 1: Yup.

636
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:37,599
Speaker 0: It's like, what?

637
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,319
Speaker 1: But I like how Nightmare Knight is one of my favorite kinds of villains, because obviously, he's bad.

638
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:44,076
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

639
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:54,819
Speaker 0: And even if he is bad for, like, good reasons- It's like, you haven't seen him personally do anything bad, but it's like, he brought back all the masters and told them to do bad stuff, so he's bad.

640
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:07,780
Speaker 1: But he has that sort of, like, bad, sad characteristic of great villains, because obviously he's- Yeah, he's more like a Doctor Doom or a Magneto than just a blow up the world crazy bad guy.

641
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,880
Speaker 1: So you're way behind, but there's a lot of really great interactions between him and other characters along the way.

642
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:20,450
Speaker 0: Well, I got to a part where, towards the end of volume two, the three dumb characters- Oh, those guys.

643
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:21,660
Speaker 0: I hate those guys.

644
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,020
Speaker 0: Well, Bacon's good, but the other two are not so good.

645
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,976
Speaker 1: Bacon's got one star in every attribute.

646
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:26,460
Speaker 1: He's the worst.

647
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the lead of those guys was trying to get kissy kissy on the French princess- Oh, yeah, Nightmare Knight's like- A Nightmare Knight's like, "Yeah, cut that shit out.

648
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,074
Speaker 0: I'm a Nightmare Knight.

649
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:35,697
Speaker 0: Do what I

650
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:36,019
Speaker 0: say.".

651
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,800
Speaker 1: So there is a continuing relationship between him and Parfait.

652
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,659
Speaker 1: that's just really, really fun.

653
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,252
Speaker 0: Oh, I hope that they get it on and kick a carrot at- What's his name?

654
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:47,620
Speaker 0: Carrot?

655
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,086
Speaker 1: Carrot's not bad.

656
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:52,300
Speaker 1: He's just really, really earnest.

657
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,859
Speaker 0: Listen, Parfait and Nightmare Knight would be way better than- Oh, Parfait and Nightmare Knight's a pretty good ship.

658
00:31:57,141 --> 00:32:00,256
Speaker 0: Right, but forget Carrot and Parfait, the canon one.

659
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:01,160
Speaker 0: Fuck that relationship.

660
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,040
Speaker 1: I like Queen Cordelia, too, because the sort of initial "baddie" is basically a lot like Queen Beryl in Sailor Moon.

661
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,840
Speaker 1: You said- I really- I loved interviews- She's better than Queen Beryl.

662
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,739
Speaker 1: But in terms of- you don't know Queen Beryl's full story, so I can't really spoil anything, but she's- I don't give a shit.

663
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,340
Speaker 1: She's obviously trying to play two sides of a coin and failing at it.

664
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:24,303
Speaker 0: But it's like.

665
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:30,979
Speaker 0: she's also bad, but she's not stupid bad, and she's not crazy bad.

666
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,640
Speaker 0: She's just, you know, sort of, you know, naughty.

667
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,039
Speaker 1: That's not how I would describe it, but I see.

668
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,119
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's one of those Queen Beryl's trying to-.

669
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,054
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not going to spoil Sailor Moon.

670
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:43,900
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that later.

671
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,560
Speaker 0: Actually, I think that- who's the guy who made the boat that exploded or whatever?

672
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:49,978
Speaker 1: Oh, that guy!

673
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,740
Speaker 0: He's actually the baddest, right?

674
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,760
Speaker 0: In terms of, like, attitude and personality, he is the most evil, I think.

675
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:57,438
Speaker 0: I don't know.

676
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,465
Speaker 0: I do like that.

677
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:03,136
Speaker 1: he's all technology-y, but other than that- I don't know if it's just the face or what, but whenever I see him, he's no good.

678
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,478
Speaker 1: I think, just without any question, my brain is like, "Is that George

679
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:07,839
Speaker 1: Rohek?"

680
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:08,669
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "No, it's

681
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:08,912
Speaker 1: not.".

682
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, so short plot summary, right?

683
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,460
Speaker 0: He wants- the kid, Cucumber, wants to go to wizard school, the best wizard school in the land.

684
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:18,660
Speaker 0: He's going to go tomorrow.

685
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Speaker 0: But then, suddenly, that's when the bad guys decide to resurrect the great evil, and his dad is like, "Well, you have to be the chosen one because it runs in our family, so go get the sword and do it.

686
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,029
Speaker 0: Go on the adventure.

687
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:30,575
Speaker 0: Go do it

688
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:30,818
Speaker 0: now.".

689
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:34,679
Speaker 0: He's basically ordered to go on the adventure, even though his sister's probably really the hero.

690
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,068
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,419
Speaker 0: But he has to do it anyway.

692
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:45,297
Speaker 0: So he starts going on the adventure, and the adventure is basically get the dream sword, magic sword, secret of mana sword, master sword.

693
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:56,840
Speaker 0: And then beat all eight robot masters, I mean, regular masters of evil, starting with the spla- you know, there's one in each kingdom, so you have to go to all the- The disaster masters!

694
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:19,998
Speaker 0: Right, you have to go to every kingdom in the whole world, meet all the characters, meet all the princesses and people that live in every place, create an awesome adventuring party, collect the items on the quest of magic, learn things and grow up and become awesome and beat these masters, and then come back to the central kingdom and beat the final bad guy, and then everything will be revealed at the end, all the secrets and the webcomic will end at the end.

695
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,056
Speaker 1: Yep, so RPG world, RPG plot.

696
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:34,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it doesn't really matter, the plot, it's all about- because it's such a straightforward plot, it's all about the details of each situation and what the characters are doing.

697
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,759
Speaker 1: And I guess that's where it really shines.

698
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,879
Speaker 0: And of course, what the final deal is.

699
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:52,795
Speaker 0: Why is this- we've seen this cliche story a zillion times before, but here the characters are openly recognizing that there has been a pattern that's repeated a hundred times of- Well, 99 times.

700
00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:04,000
Speaker 0: Right, 99 times, summoning, and then temporarily banishing the nightmare knight, and it has to be at the end of this hundredth time that they're going to figure out the real deal.

701
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,238
Speaker 0: Well, it could go a fire emblem route, like it could go a route of, like, is the story- Well, they could, A, realize why it has to be this way and just do it the way it's always been done.

702
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:21,380
Speaker 0: B, see the way it's always been done and figure out some way around it, and what that way around it is then becomes important.

703
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,559
Speaker 0: Is the way around it- Don't banish him.

704
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,220
Speaker 1: Is it a Shinseke Iori sort of, like, come of age in a new world and understand it for what it is?

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,316
Speaker 1: You know, basically, is the end cucumber and everyone's saying, "Okay, we understand what the adults are all

706
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:34,639
Speaker 1: about."

707
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:36,500
Speaker 1: Or, mole breaker.

708
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,500
Speaker 0: It could banish him for real, permanently.

709
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:40,137
Speaker 0: Kill him.

710
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:42,553
Speaker 0: And then it's like, "Oh, the sister was actually the hero.

711
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:43,780
Speaker 0: You get to go to wizard school.

712
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,630
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't need to go to wizard school because you already became a wizard on this quest, so now you're in charge of wizard school.

713
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:50,274
Speaker 0: You're the new

714
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:50,777
Speaker 0: king.".

715
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,399
Speaker 0: You know, stuff like that can happen at the end.

716
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,739
Speaker 1: The other interesting thing is that the characters and just the story and the setting and things very commonly surprise me.

717
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,874
Speaker 1: Every time I think, "Okay, I see where this is

718
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:03,217
Speaker 1: going.".

719
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,519
Speaker 1: Nope, nope, something crazy happens.

720
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,480
Speaker 1: So, I don't know what else I can say.

721
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,445
Speaker 1: It's a webcomic.

722
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:11,013
Speaker 1: You can just read it for free.

723
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,320
Speaker 1: You don't need to buy anything.

724
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,424
Speaker 0: Well, you can.

725
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,500
Speaker 0: You should buy the books because the books have extra shit in them and they're Kickstarted.

726
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,290
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can get the old volumes.

727
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,459
Speaker 0: It can't be that hard to get them.

728
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:24,120
Speaker 0: But, if you get the old volumes, then you can start doing what I'm doing.

729
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,600
Speaker 0: Just Kickstart each volume as it comes out.

730
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,000
Speaker 1: You can do that.

731
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,980
Speaker 0: And then, if you pay more money than I'm paying, because I'm only paying the book level, if you pay more levels, you can get more stuff.

732
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,798
Speaker 1: But, I guess, put it this way.

733
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:37,680
Speaker 1: If you're not sold on this by our unabashed joy about just talking about it...

734
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,519
Speaker 0: You can read the webcomic for free to figure out.

735
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, go read the first bit.

736
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,719
Speaker 0: So, click on "Shop" and see if they're selling the books.

737
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,651
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see.

746
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,319
Speaker 0: How much are the volumes?
