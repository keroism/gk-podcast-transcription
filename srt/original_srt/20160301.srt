1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,500
Speaker 1: It's Super Tuesday, March 1st, 2016.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,661
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,226
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,894
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:22,010
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about Thebes, the reprint of Genocides von Theben.

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,589
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,450
Speaker 1: So remember how last week I was complaining about how I had to fly to Southern California for one meeting?

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,948
Speaker 1: Well, we're recording this show in advance because I'm in London right now.

9
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,870
Speaker 1: Literally for like one day of a convention, so I'll be back.

10
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,650
Speaker 0: Well, it's a convention and not a one-hour meeting.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is a convention.

12
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:44,570
Speaker 1: It's like a whole day convention.

13
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:51,850
Speaker 1: And I had to have the days before and after the convention free to be able to go to meetings.

14
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:55,430
Speaker 1: I don't know if we'll have any meetings lined up, so I might just be fucking around in London.

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,670
Speaker 1: So if any of you are in London...

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,525
Speaker 0: Just don't line up meetings.

17
00:00:58,565 --> 00:00:58,749
Speaker 0: Oops.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,970
Speaker 1: If any of you... Well, I'd like to line up a few meetings because if those meetings turn into money, I can take some of that money.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,029
Speaker 1: But if any of you are in London...

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,164
Speaker 0: You get commissions on the...

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,030
Speaker 1: I can, depending.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,270
Speaker 1: Actually, as for a commission, I've usually stood up our whole Australian business.

23
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,510
Speaker 1: In fact, I get to go to Australia again in May, probably, and then I'm probably going to make him pay for me to go to PAX Australia.

24
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:18,879
Speaker 0: That's not in May.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,570
Speaker 0: It's in October.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,128
Speaker 1: I'm getting two Australia trips this year.

27
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:22,716
Speaker 1: At least.

28
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:30,825
Speaker 1: Anyway... So if any of you are in London and you're listening to this on Tuesday, I'm landing in London right about now, your time.

29
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:37,990
Speaker 1: And yeah, maybe we can hang out, especially on, like, Wednesday during the day.

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,829
Speaker 1: I'll meet you in a pub and drink a beer and such.

31
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,330
Speaker 1: So, gaming news.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:52,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the biggest, you know, deal right now, I guess, and really the only gaming news recently... Is that Street Fighter V came out.

33
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:52,368
Speaker 0: Woo!

34
00:01:52,891 --> 00:02:01,785
Speaker 1: No, it's interesting because... I don't know if it... I remember a time when, like, if I tweeted about things that weren't anime, like, certain people would be like, "Ugh, why are you talking about this other

35
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,107
Speaker 1: shit?".

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,250
Speaker 1: You know, just in, like, Anna Twitter and R-General.

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,650
Speaker 1: But now, like, everyone in my Twitter feed always talks about the same thing, or at least a lot of them do.

38
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,410
Speaker 1: So Street Fighter was the focus of, like, half my Twitter a few days ago.

39
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,830
Speaker 0: Right, so if you weren't paying attention, Street Fighter V came out.

40
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,390
Speaker 0: I've been seeing it at PAX for quite a while and other conventions and whatnot.

41
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,038
Speaker 0: So it's Street Fighter.

42
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,369
Speaker 0: If you know Street Fighter, this is it.

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,450
Speaker 0: It's just a new one with more characters, upgraded graphics, that sort of thing.

44
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:38,730
Speaker 0: One big change they did that I actually think is a positive change... Is they increased the buffer window and they sort of automatic... They did a bunch of stuff and basically all that you care about is that it makes it easier to do special moves.

45
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,730
Speaker 0: You can be less accurate and you will still execute your special move and your combo as if you had been very accurate with your... And precise with your button pressing.

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:57,050
Speaker 1: I do like that change because I don't think there are that many people in the world who will excel beyond that to the point that it matters.

47
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:05,130
Speaker 0: And Street Fighter IV pro players, you know, and really... I mean, not necessarily the top of the pros who might have been so good they didn't need to do this.

48
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:10,870
Speaker 0: But extremely good players would, like, double tap because Street Fighter IV required you to be so precise.

49
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,369
Speaker 0: They'd, like, hit it twice to make sure they got it.

50
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,710
Speaker 1: But I'm saying this will broaden the top tier a little bit and I think it will be a net positive for the game.

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,131
Speaker 0: Maybe.

52
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,050
Speaker 0: So the problem with Street Fighter V is that this release... Basically, they weren't done with the game and they put it out anyway.

53
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:31,390
Speaker 0: The only things really in this release are multiplayer, just play online, and they did improve the netcode.

54
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,410
Speaker 0: It's, like, the best fighting game netcode that's ever existed, as far as I know.

55
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:41,510
Speaker 0: There's a story mode, but the story mode isn't even the story mode you're used to in Street Fighter.

56
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,850
Speaker 0: They didn't even include that, which is, you know, you pick a character, you fight every single character until you beat the boss.

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,550
Speaker 1: You get a couple of cutscenes along the way.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,770
Speaker 0: Well, there's usually no cutscenes until the very end when you win, right?

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,490
Speaker 0: I mean, for at least in Street Fighter II, but this... Basically, story mode is, like, you fight, like, a few guys.

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,990
Speaker 0: It's, like, a really crappy story mode with, like, almost nothing in it.

61
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:02,869
Speaker 0: It's, like, garbage.

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,729
Speaker 0: And, like, there's no training.

63
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,850
Speaker 0: There's, like, nothing in the game.

64
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:11,290
Speaker 0: These didn't finish any of those things.

65
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,385
Speaker 0: They're, like, "Yeah, we'll patch it later.

66
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:13,928
Speaker 0: We'll patch it

67
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:14,150
Speaker 0: later.".

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,269
Speaker 0: It's, like, why did you release it undone like this?

69
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:25,370
Speaker 1: They released it undone for the fighting game community, like, the pro players and the people who care about fighting games and shorten it to FG and all that.

70
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,303
Speaker 0: But that's not a large number of people.

71
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,350
Speaker 0: You're gonna sell it to them.

72
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,690
Speaker 0: And, meanwhile, it's, like, no one's gonna go back and, like, re-review the game and update the review once you make the updates.

73
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:34,487
Speaker 1: I wonder...

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:41,110
Speaker 0: It's a bad... It's not good in its current state, and it's gonna have a reputation for being bad forever because the initial release is bad.

75
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,510
Speaker 1: I don't know if that, like, should be much of a concern.

76
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,209
Speaker 0: And it's gonna be very, very hard now for non-pro players to become pro because usually...

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that training mode in Street Fighter IV was so fucking useful.

78
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,590
Speaker 0: It wasn't useful, but it's better than nothing, right?

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,207
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

80
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:09,530
Speaker 0: Even if, you know, you have a game where it's really hard, so it's, you know, like Street Fighter IV, let's say, at least the game is complete from the get-go so everyone can start at the beginning.

81
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:13,850
Speaker 0: Even though some people might have a head start from previous Street Fighters, but pretend it's a brand new fighting game, right?

82
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,950
Speaker 0: That doesn't have a legacy.

83
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,170
Speaker 0: Everyone can start learning from the same, you know, level at the same time.

84
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,450
Speaker 0: This is a game where, at release, only pros can play it.

85
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,290
Speaker 0: It's only playable by pros.

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,470
Speaker 0: So now you gave all the pros a head start.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:38,629
Speaker 0: All the pros are already learning Street Fighter V. The people who might possibly become pros of Street Fighter V, you know, the kid who's just now become old enough to play a fighting game and understand it?

88
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:43,410
Speaker 0: And will practice enough in his life or her life to become a Street Fighter master.

89
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,899
Speaker 0: They can't play this because it's the floor.

90
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,850
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the ceiling.

91
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,780
Speaker 0: We're talking about the floor to even play.

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,429
Speaker 0: the game is too high.

93
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,149
Speaker 1: Well, they could just play Street Fighter IV, raise themselves, and then play V.

94
00:05:57,151 --> 00:06:00,950
Speaker 0: It's, I mean, I think the transition is, like, it's pretty significantly different.

95
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,970
Speaker 0: I mean, it's, yeah, you could do that, but I don't know.

96
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,210
Speaker 1: I mean, how do you think the pros do it?

97
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,350
Speaker 1: They had to do that transition.

98
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:12,610
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, Street Fighter V has got a lot of issues right now, and it's making a big fuss in the fighting game community.

99
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,090
Speaker 0: The fighting game community loves to talk big.

100
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,909
Speaker 0: You know, this is the thing I've taken out of this, you know, hubbub that's happened around the release of this game, right?

101
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:29,050
Speaker 0: Is the fighting game community likes to talk big about how such a good community it is, except for, you know, right?

102
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,650
Speaker 0: And all the positive aspects of the fighting community, which many of them do exist, right?

103
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:36,350
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of negative aspects in the fighting game community.

104
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,449
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, there are.

105
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:47,430
Speaker 0: But they have, you know, many people in the fighting game community, or fighting communities, have, you know, pointed that out as also being bad and that they don't like it, right?

106
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,527
Speaker 0: However, you know, we're talking about, like, behavior and harassment and such, right?

107
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,150
Speaker 0: That sort of thing.

108
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,990
Speaker 1: I think fighting games might be, of all the game sub-genres, I think fighting games probably actually have the worst culture.

109
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:10,482
Speaker 0: Maybe, but the one thing I realized is that, you know, even though, you know, we can put a lot of blame on the people who make fighting games for making them hard to learn, and we've discussed this in the past, right?

110
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:11,530
Speaker 0: Where, like, everything's a secret.

111
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,129
Speaker 0: You know, go listen to, like, when we talked about Street Fighter IV years ago.

112
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Counter-Strike doesn't have any way for you to, like, double shoot if you time it just right.

113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,890
Speaker 0: But the fighting game community, if you want to talk big about how great you are, make some tutorials that actually teach people how to play your fucking games.

114
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,491
Speaker 0: 'Cause you know what?

115
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:28,674
Speaker 0: I went online looking.

116
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:35,390
Speaker 0: Can I even find a fan-made tutorial that teaches the basics of Street Fighter?

117
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,188
Speaker 1: Now, you might already be saying, "But Scott, the manual tells me to do a Hadoken, I go down, down and right, right, and I hit

118
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:42,609
Speaker 1: punch.".

119
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:43,279
Speaker 0: Sure.

120
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,710
Speaker 1: That's what-- Tells me all the secret moves.

121
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,290
Speaker 0: And that's what almost all the tutorials will tell you, is to press down, down, right, right, and then punch, right?

122
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,273
Speaker 0: And it shows you these four icons.

123
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,957
Speaker 0: That doesn't teach you jack shit.

124
00:07:55,017 --> 00:08:04,010
Speaker 0: Can I press down, then move the joystick to the middle, then to the down, right, then back to the middle, then to the right, then back to the middle, then press a punch button?

125
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,293
Speaker 0: Fuck no, you can't.

126
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,058
Speaker 0: You can't do that shit, right?

127
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,910
Speaker 0: Okay, I have to push down, then I swing it to the right in an arc.

128
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,809
Speaker 1: Alright, now that's fine.

129
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,452
Speaker 0: That's fine.

130
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,338
Speaker 0: How fast do I have to swing it in an arc?

131
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,064
Speaker 0: Can I swing it slowly through that arc?

132
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,770
Speaker 0: Like, tick, tick, tick.

133
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,760
Speaker 0: Or do I have to go, tick, tick, tick?

134
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,687
Speaker 0: How fast do I have to do it, exactly?

135
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:23,068
Speaker 0: How fast?

136
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,572
Speaker 1: Maybe it doesn't even matter, but the problem is, even if all that stuff is sort of-- When exactly do I press the punch button?

137
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,599
Speaker 0: Do I press the punch button at the same time as the stick reaches the right hand position?

138
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,482
Speaker 0: Do I push it after it reaches the right hand position?

139
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,326
Speaker 0: How long do I have to wait before?

140
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,029
Speaker 0: Which punch button can I push?

141
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:39,710
Speaker 0: Right?

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,215
Speaker 0: No one teaches you any of that shit.

143
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:48,265
Speaker 0: I actually found one tutorial where the guy actually did show you--his joystick was like a little tiny thing.

144
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:50,810
Speaker 0: You can actually see the joystick in the bottom right corner.

145
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,737
Speaker 0: And while he wasn't showing it well, he was at least showing it.

146
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,730
Speaker 0: And he did teach how to do the Hadouken better than I've seen anyone teach it.

147
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,570
Speaker 0: He then went on to the Shoryuken and didn't teach jack shit.

148
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,392
Speaker 0: Right?

149
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:07,081
Speaker 0: He's just like-- He's just like, "Yeah, Shoryuken, same as Hadouken.

150
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,469
Speaker 0: It's right, then down, then down

151
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:08,690
Speaker 0: forward.".

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,750
Speaker 1: Fighting games could be designed differently to where that minutia wouldn't matter.

153
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,390
Speaker 1: But the fact is, with Street Fighter specifically, that minutia, like that frame timing, is the entire game.

154
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,615
Speaker 0: I don't even know the answer to this question, right?

155
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:26,910
Speaker 0: And I've been playing Street Fighter since it was only Street Fighter II in the arcade, not even Championship Edition, right?

156
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,710
Speaker 0: If you want to do a Shoryuken, you have to go right, then down, then down forward, then punch, right?

157
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:37,144
Speaker 0: I know that you can press punch pretty much very soon after you press down forward.

158
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:37,685
Speaker 0: I know that.

159
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,630
Speaker 0: I was just asking it rhetorically before, right?

160
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,071
Speaker 1: Yeah.

161
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,510
Speaker 1: I mean, I can do it reliably.

162
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,183
Speaker 0: I can do it mostly reliably, right?

163
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,309
Speaker 0: But here's the question I don't know.

164
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:54,850
Speaker 0: So you press right, then when you're moving the stick from the right position to the down position, are you allowed to pass through the down right position on your way there?

165
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,889
Speaker 1: I don't think I do.

166
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,324
Speaker 0: Are you allowed to pass through, because I mean, the joystick only has like three ways to go, right?

167
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,170
Speaker 0: It can go to the neutral position and then down.

168
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,740
Speaker 0: It can go to the down right position and then to the down position, or you can sort of sneak between the two at like an angle, right?

169
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:18,510
Speaker 0: If it's a square box joystick hole, you can sort of go at an angle from right to down, just sort of sneak between neutral and down right.

170
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,429
Speaker 1: I think I bring it back and then I go down and then I swing it.

171
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,670
Speaker 0: Right.

172
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,274
Speaker 0: But it's like, are you allowed?

173
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:31,049
Speaker 0: I mean, like, even if I experiment with those three, which I have done for a considerable amount of time, sometimes a Shoryuken comes out and sometimes it doesn't.

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,130
Speaker 0: And I can't really prove conclusively which of those three paths you're allowed to take.

175
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,170
Speaker 0: Now, again, you can make a fighting game.

176
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,990
Speaker 0: And nobody, not one tutorial on the internet will tell me a definitive answer.

177
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,710
Speaker 1: Now, these things could be addressed by game design.

178
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:58,670
Speaker 0: If I tell them how to do a Shoryuken or teach one of my friends who's never played a fighting game in their lives, but happens to be a smart person who's a nerd, how to do a Shoryuken, what the fuck do I tell them?

179
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,230
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is, as a kid, Scott, even without any of that, I was able to do all those moves most of the time reliably.

180
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,441
Speaker 0: But I got to do them 100% of the time.

181
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:25,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem I'm getting at is that because the games rely on that really fiddliness to be the competitive scene above even, like, Baby's first level, it makes it to where the community has a vested interest in not making it all super clear because it adds this artificial barrier to entry that makes their skills that much more special.

182
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:30,670
Speaker 0: I'm going to talk about even one more example just because this bothers me so much, right?

183
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,479
Speaker 0: So M. Bison is my guy, right?

184
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,770
Speaker 0: Well, dictator, because he's not M. Bison in other countries.

185
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,670
Speaker 1: Psycho crusher, psycho crusher, psycho crusher.

186
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,236
Speaker 0: So I know how to do a charge move.

187
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,610
Speaker 0: I hold back for a little while and then I press forward and then punch, right?

188
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,590
Speaker 0: Should I do my psycho crusher and my scissor kick?

189
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,916
Speaker 0: I can't even do the jumping on.

190
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:47,450
Speaker 0: I can do these moves relatively reliably, right?

191
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,767
Speaker 0: Here's something I don't actually know, right?

192
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,010
Speaker 0: So you have to charge down, which means you have to hold the stick down for, you know, I assume it's like two seconds.

193
00:11:56,731 --> 00:12:01,445
Speaker 0: I usually just sort of feel it, but I'm pretty sure it's two seconds on the clock in the game, right?

194
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,250
Speaker 0: The clock in the middle of the screen there.

195
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:04,874
Speaker 0: So here's a question.

196
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:09,590
Speaker 0: If I jump in the air and while I'm in the air, you know, just in a regular jump, I tap up.

197
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:15,510
Speaker 0: If I tap up and then immediately hold down, but I'm still in this jumping animation, I haven't hit the ground yet, right?

198
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,929
Speaker 0: And maybe I hold, you know, I go from, I go up then down right away, like really quick.

199
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,410
Speaker 0: So I'm holding down even though I'm only in the up motion of the jump.

200
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:28,030
Speaker 0: By the time I hit the ground, I've already held the stick down for like a second and a half.

201
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,150
Speaker 0: So I was about to say, I think I immediately press up and kick to do the head stomp right out of that.

202
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:37,330
Speaker 0: Or did the charging not count because I wasn't on the ground?

203
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,290
Speaker 1: I was about to say, I think it counts, but I realized here's a panel you could do.

204
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,770
Speaker 1: I don't want to run it because we don't even know anyone qualified to do it.

205
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:53,270
Speaker 1: So what you do is you have a panel of street fighter champion guys, like 10 of them, and you ask them questions like that.

206
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:58,650
Speaker 1: And they have to write their answer on a whiteboard, match game style, and then they all reveal.

207
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:06,970
Speaker 1: And then we have the super pro who's running the panel do the motion and see what happens in a very defined manner, maybe tool assisted.

208
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,890
Speaker 1: So it would be very interesting to see a panel of 10 street fighter champions if they agree on the answers to all those kinds of questions.

209
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,910
Speaker 1: Because I suspect...

210
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,460
Speaker 0: Right, and it's like, okay, so I'm going to do this hago crusher.

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,970
Speaker 0: You hold back for two seconds, then forward and punch, right?

212
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:28,389
Speaker 0: What if I hold back and up and you do a back away jump and I'm still holding, I'm back, but I'm also holding back up, right?

213
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,238
Speaker 0: And then I sort of transition into holding back as I go towards the ground.

214
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:36,147
Speaker 0: Can I unleash the psycho crusher when I land from the backwards jump?

215
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:37,530
Speaker 0: Am I allowed to do that?

216
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:49,110
Speaker 1: Now, this is all in sort of stark light to the experience we had at Magfest because I played a bunch of the Fist of the North Star fighting game, which I mentioned this and Darryl Surratt pointed out that the game actually has infinite combos.

217
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:49,790
Speaker 1: Nice.

218
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:50,769
Speaker 1: Like it's completely broken.

219
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,750
Speaker 1: But none of us had ever played it before.

220
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:55,067
Speaker 1: Nope.

221
00:13:55,371 --> 00:14:00,330
Speaker 1: And most of the people at the con had maybe played it at the previous Magfest at best.

222
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:05,323
Speaker 0: So... I didn't see, I'm sure someone at the con was pro at it.

223
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,990
Speaker 0: I didn't see any such person.

224
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:14,770
Speaker 1: So when I played it with our friends and I played it a bunch and I played it with just strangers, like I did the old like arcade pickup game stuff, it was real fun.

225
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:23,010
Speaker 0: Fighting games are hella fun if everyone is at the same skill level, which is why pros at fighting games have hella fun because the people they're fighting against are also pros.

226
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:32,910
Speaker 1: But I guess the difference is with a lot of other games, like especially a lot of board games, but also a lot of like competitive video games, you sort of, once you hit the level of master, there usually isn't a pro circuit.

227
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,950
Speaker 1: So then you and your friends all just give up on the game.

228
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,490
Speaker 0: There's no magical drop pro circuit.

229
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, you move on to a different game.

230
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,110
Speaker 1: But with fighting games, you pretty much get into that tier and live that life forever.

231
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,606
Speaker 0: So the news is Street Fighter V is out, pros only.

232
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:47,130
Speaker 0: What's your news?

233
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:56,670
Speaker 1: I don't think it affects their sales at all, and I think that Street Fighter basically caters to and relies on the fighting game community and doesn't give a shit about the casual anymore.

234
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,610
Speaker 0: Also, it's even more pervy than the previous Street Fighter, yet still not in Dead or Alive territory.

235
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,675
Speaker 1: Yeah.

236
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,530
Speaker 0: Also, I was reminded that- But there's like a new character who's bus just hanging out.

237
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,817
Speaker 1: You wanna talk about story modes?

238
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,430
Speaker 1: Bushido Blade 2 had one hell of a story mode.

239
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,910
Speaker 0: Alright, do your news.

240
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,638
Speaker 1: So, let me go back here to my link.

241
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,862
Speaker 1: Got a bunch of links about this.

242
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:17,490
Speaker 1: Fire Emblem Fates got released in the US.

243
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:19,430
Speaker 0: Is that a 3DS Fire Emblem?

244
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:19,765
Speaker 0: Yes.

245
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:20,361
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

246
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:27,090
Speaker 0: One of our friends- Considering that I was never able to finish any of the GBA or DS Fire Emblems, I am not going to buy or play this one.

247
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,630
Speaker 1: I'm not going to either because I'm done with Fire Emblem games.

248
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:30,610
Speaker 0: I'm also done.

249
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,010
Speaker 1: I played the most recent one before this on the 3DS all the way through.

250
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,648
Speaker 1: And I gotta admit, they're not that good as games.

251
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:47,270
Speaker 0: I mean, when my Pegasus, who's way far away from everyone, just gets like one-shotted and then I have to restart the whole game.

252
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,854
Speaker 0: Well, because the games are puzzles.

253
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:55,350
Speaker 1: They're very much- it's a puzzle, grind through it, or learn the magic sauce, or learn the perfect way.

254
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,849
Speaker 1: It's not the kind of game it looks like it is.

255
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, do the mission, figure out what it is, and do it again after you reset your system so you know what's coming.

256
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:07,410
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the game came out in Japan, and it didn't come out of the US until some months later.

257
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:14,990
Speaker 1: So fan-subbing groups fucking went apeshit trying to translate this game before Nintendo released it.

258
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:19,270
Speaker 1: And the reason they did this is because they were afraid of Nintendo censorship.

259
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,550
Speaker 1: Now, what they mean by censorship is that Nintendo of America removed one scene from the game that was pretty much just straight-up homophobic.

260
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,310
Speaker 1: They covered up one bikini shot of, I'm pretty sure, an underage character.

261
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:35,010
Speaker 0: Japan, why you do these things in the first place?

262
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,970
Speaker 1: They removed a game where you can use your finger to pet your characters.

263
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,664
Speaker 0: I never saw any of these things in a previous Fire Emblem.

264
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:43,690
Speaker 0: What happened?

265
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,254
Speaker 0: It's like they made it worse.

266
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,279
Speaker 0: It was just a regular old fantasy thing.

267
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:51,590
Speaker 0: I didn't know any of this stuff was in any Fire Emblem I've ever seen.

268
00:16:51,650 --> 00:17:03,550
Speaker 1: The most egregious sin that Nintendo of America apparently committed on this game is they did a real translation and localization instead of a weeaboo exact word minakama translation.

269
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:09,930
Speaker 1: So welcome, video game people, to the world of animo weeaboo bullshit.

270
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 1: Welcome to the fan-subbers of America.

271
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,270
Speaker 1: This shit is amazing, what people are mad about.

272
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:23,550
Speaker 1: They're mad that instead of doing a word-for-word literal terrible translation, they actually localized the game and made it funny.

273
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,673
Speaker 1: Because you know what?

274
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,415
Speaker 1: Fire Emblem games?

275
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,762
Speaker 1: Not really well known for their writing.

276
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,850
Speaker 1: In fact, the writing kind of shit.

277
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:34,930
Speaker 0: Go listen to the interview we did with Oda King and you'll hear everything you need to know about this topic.

278
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:36,737
Speaker 0: That was so many years ago.

279
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,062
Speaker 0: We lived in Beacon then.

280
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,090
Speaker 0: It was more than a zillion years ago.

281
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:54,700
Speaker 1: So basically the game came out and all the fan-subber people made the same arguments that the anime weeaboo fan-subber people make about how, "Well, if you're not going to release the thing in its pure form, then I'm not going to buy it.

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,888
Speaker 1: Good luck selling it on our market, you pieces of shit, with your fake

283
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:58,530
Speaker 1: translations.".

284
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,421
Speaker 1: And they were like, "I'm boycotting the game.

285
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,486
Speaker 1: I'm going to play my pirated

286
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:01,949
Speaker 1: copy.".

287
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:08,410
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell, this game outsold any Fire Emblem game ever in North America already.

288
00:18:09,252 --> 00:18:10,896
Speaker 0: Well, it's not like they print that many copies.

289
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:16,930
Speaker 0: So usually, I was really big into Nintendo portable games for a long time.

290
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,516
Speaker 0: And I still kind of am.

291
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,010
Speaker 0: It's just they haven't released the kind that I want to play recently.

292
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,630
Speaker 0: But it's like when they were the big thing, GBA, DS, from Game Boy Color to DS, I was getting all the hot games.

293
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,557
Speaker 0: Like all the Phoenix Rites and all that, right?

294
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:35,650
Speaker 0: And those games, those really hot games that they wouldn't print a lot of copies.

295
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,875
Speaker 0: So they would be hard to get.

296
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:40,650
Speaker 0: You'd have to get them unreleased, pre-order them from Amazon or somewhere.

297
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,209
Speaker 0: And then they'd be out of print and they'd be worth a lot of money.

298
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,690
Speaker 0: So this is just another one of those where it comes out and you got to get it because there aren't that many copies.

299
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,702
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I saw another headline, "The ass Nintendo doesn't want you to

300
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:54,224
Speaker 1: see.".

301
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:55,750
Speaker 1: Cool it, kids.

302
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,309
Speaker 0: The ass that they shouldn't have had in Japan probably to begin with.

303
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you really care that much, I mean, this is the speech I would give to the weebs.

304
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,996
Speaker 1: But I guess now weebs are infiltrating gaming.

305
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,430
Speaker 1: If you care that much about a pure translation, maybe you should learn Japanese.

306
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:25,469
Speaker 0: I was about to say, this is yet another example of Scott's peeve, which is, "Oh look, there's a person who is doing a large amount of labor, so much labor, to avoid learning

307
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:25,930
Speaker 0: something.".

308
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,290
Speaker 0: It would be less work to learn Japanese than to simply, you know, than to translate this game.

309
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:40,630
Speaker 0: But because people hate learning so much, they would rather do the extra labor of translating this whole fucking thing than just learning a new language.

310
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:44,450
Speaker 0: Which, while not easy, is easier than translating this game.

311
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,502
Speaker 1: The fan translation, as far as I can tell, is terrible.

312
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:50,769
Speaker 1: It has, like, no life.

313
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,750
Speaker 0: Do we have even one example of comparing the real translation to the fan translation?

314
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,130
Speaker 1: I have a few, but they're not really illustrative enough of the point.

315
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,769
Speaker 1: But apparently there's one scene where two assassins have this really, sort of, typical animu discussion about, "I'm such a

316
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:05,110
Speaker 1: badass.".

317
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,639
Speaker 1: "No, I'm such a

318
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:05,965
Speaker 1: badass.".

319
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,284
Speaker 0: "I didn't show my full

320
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:07,628
Speaker 0: power.".

321
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,457
Speaker 1: And it's kind of this conversation here.

322
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,430
Speaker 1: So the localizers took it as a joke.

323
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:22,910
Speaker 1: And for that one conversation, because it's these two badass, loner, serial killer assassins, it just had them have this long conversation that's "dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot

324
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,050
Speaker 1: dot.".

325
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,009
Speaker 0: It sounds like they didn't want to translate it and just put "dot dot dot

326
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,110
Speaker 0: dot.".

327
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I read the conversation.

328
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,510
Speaker 1: There's not much going on in there.

329
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,030
Speaker 0: I mean, it would be funny if it was a GoGo 13 reference.

330
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:39,650
Speaker 1: But all the examples I can find are basically just the Nintendo America translation is, it reads like something someone would say in a movie.

331
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:48,668
Speaker 1: And the fan translation is, "Here's a bunch of Japanese verbs and nouns translated directly so they don't make a lot of sense in the order that they're not

332
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:49,069
Speaker 1: presented.".

333
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,910
Speaker 0: Nakama sword zone.

334
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:51,304
Speaker 0: Yeah.

335
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:53,070
Speaker 1: Okay.

336
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,673
Speaker 1: In the moment, we're going to be at PAX East performing on Sunday at, I believe, 3 or 3.30 p.m.

337
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:04,034
Speaker 1: Atari Game Design.

338
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:12,035
Speaker 1: We did this at PAX South, and people lined up way in advance.

339
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,760
Speaker 1: The room was completely filled.

340
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,260
Speaker 1: I think it's one of our best new panels.

341
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,420
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that good a panel, but it's what they accepted.

342
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:26,400
Speaker 1: People really liked it, even though I would rather be doing design and game rules, because I feel like that'll actually have more impact on games that I play down the road.

343
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:31,440
Speaker 1: But we've got video of that one from PAX South, so I'll probably get the video of that up this weekend.

344
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,769
Speaker 1: Otherwise, other conventions are coming up.

345
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,740
Speaker 1: Mocha's coming up, so remember to come to New York and go to that.

346
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,520
Speaker 1: Emily will have a table at Mocha, so stay tuned for that business.

347
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:42,139
Speaker 0: Okay.

348
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,060
Speaker 1: And I guess it's time to talk about a game, because we played a bunch of games.

349
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Speaker 0: What about Things of the Day?

350
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,440
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you want to do Things of the Day?

351
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:48,813
Speaker 1: Yeah.

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,778
Speaker 1: We'll do those next now.

353
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,039
Speaker 0: So, this is not related to gaming in any way, unless you want to talk about some Sesame Street games, like I had one for the NES.

354
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:57,580
Speaker 0: that was okay.

355
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,699
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of creepy.

356
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,800
Speaker 0: But yeah, so here's a recipe for a baked good known as Cookie Monster Bark.

357
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:09,360
Speaker 0: It is basically one big sheet cookie that looks like Cookie Monster.

358
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,359
Speaker 1: Oh, that kind of bark.

359
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:17,520
Speaker 0: Because you put blue frosting on it, and then you put Candy Googly's eyes on it, and then you put, you know, cookies in it.

360
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,060
Speaker 0: And it looks like Cookie Monster, and then you break it up into pieces of bark, and then you eat it.

361
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,640
Speaker 0: So, I'm going to bake this this weekend, and Rym's going to leave town, and then I'm going to eat it when he's not here.

362
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,351
Speaker 1: Ah, Emily steals some for me.

363
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,198
Speaker 1: Oh no.

364
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,944
Speaker 1: So, my Thing of the Day.

365
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:36,920
Speaker 1: So, remember way back, we did that bad games lecture at a bunch of PAXes, and we did it all over the place.

366
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:43,480
Speaker 1: This is a fun lecture to do, but there's one section of it where we basically shit all over racewalking for being bullshit.

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,739
Speaker 0: Racewalking is bullshit.

368
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,020
Speaker 0: Yep.

369
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:53,020
Speaker 1: So, I pulled that part out and put it as his own YouTube video, and basically, I pretty regularly see the comments people write on it.

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,874
Speaker 1: Like, "Stop embarrassing

371
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:55,299
Speaker 1: yourself!".

372
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,420
Speaker 1: Racewalkers really butter about this video, because if you search for racewalking on YouTube, on the front page, two of the videos are people talking about how stupid racewalking is.

373
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,028
Speaker 1: Us, and that SciShow.

374
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:08,917
Speaker 1: that's like, "Yeah, everyone

375
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:09,259
Speaker 1: cheats.".

376
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:22,200
Speaker 1: So, I was reminded, because this keeps coming up, and I wanted to give a video to someone who was complaining about us, and it was that old, old, old Thing of the Day we did in like 2006.

377
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,349
Speaker 1: Samurai are coming.

378
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,740
Speaker 1: Will he run?

379
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,178
Speaker 0: I don't remember this.

380
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,652
Speaker 1: It was your Thing of the Day.

381
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,540
Speaker 1: You don't remember anything.

382
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,380
Speaker 0: That's why it was so good.

383
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,280
Speaker 1: So, I found the old episode.

384
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,267
Speaker 0: You can't even beat my Things of the Day.

385
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,120
Speaker 0: You gotta take my own Thing of the Day from the past and bring it back.

386
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,225
Speaker 1: It might have been my Thing of the Day.

387
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,899
Speaker 1: I don't actually remember, but I can go check, but I found the episode.

388
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,140
Speaker 0: That was back in the days when I would use Japanese television for all my Things of the Day.

389
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,380
Speaker 1: And of course, the link was super broken, because every Thing of the Day link is broken.

390
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,767
Speaker 1: So, it actually took me a while to find this again, but here it is.

391
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:57,780
Speaker 1: This is a video, and because I put so much work into finding it again, I want you to all see it.

392
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:07,119
Speaker 1: This is a professional Olympic race walker who apparently does not actually know much about Japan, because he's not American.

393
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:11,140
Speaker 1: I think he's Italian or something, but basically he does not know much about Japan.

394
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,220
Speaker 1: So, this is, even by Japanese prank standards, pretty elaborate.

395
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:27,300
Speaker 1: They put fake news on TVs in all the restaurants, in his hotel, everywhere he was, talking about how there's been a samurai uprising.

396
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:32,393
Speaker 1: So, he's had this background of news commentators and video.

397
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:34,720
Speaker 1: All these people being murdered by samurai.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,531
Speaker 1: There's a big samurai uprising all over Japan.

399
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:38,636
Speaker 1: Will the emperor fall?

400
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,420
Speaker 1: All this nonsense.

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,080
Speaker 1: And it was on the news for him constantly.

402
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:44,539
Speaker 0: What year was this?

403
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,724
Speaker 1: Like, recently.

404
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:46,872
Speaker 1: Early 2000s.

405
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:51,374
Speaker 0: If you saw that on the news, I think it was a fake news.

406
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,360
Speaker 0: I wouldn't think it was real news.

407
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,905
Speaker 1: Well, it was all in the background.

408
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:58,200
Speaker 1: It'd be like normal news, normal news, and then there'd be this one thing just planted in the news.

409
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:01,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no way a smart person believes that.

410
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,500
Speaker 1: So, we didn't think about it too much, I assume.

411
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:10,780
Speaker 1: But then the event was, they ostensibly had flown him out to Japan to try to beat a race walking world record in an empty stadium.

412
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,520
Speaker 0: Was this guy a race walking record holder?

413
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,039
Speaker 1: He is a professional race walker of some kind.

414
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:18,660
Speaker 1: And they had him doing his race walking.

415
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,680
Speaker 1: And then they had a bunch of people dressed up as samurai bust in and they had a bunch of blood squibs and everything.

416
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,940
Speaker 1: So, as he's running by, there's this kind of commotion.

417
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Speaker 1: And he sees this guy dressed up as samurai yelling at some cops and things.

418
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,100
Speaker 1: And then the samurai murder these dudes and he's still race walking.

419
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,032
Speaker 1: And then the samurai go, "Oh,

420
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:37,456
Speaker 1: oh!".

421
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:37,960
Speaker 1: and they point.

422
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:40,019
Speaker 1: And then they start running after him.

423
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:47,840
Speaker 1: And the whole point of this is a bunch of people watching this on monitors betting on whether or not he will run or walk away.

424
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,798
Speaker 1: Will he race walk away or will he give up and run?

425
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,140
Speaker 0: It pretty much comes down to if he believes it's fake, he's just going to keep doing his race walk.

426
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Speaker 1: But then they come after him.

427
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,380
Speaker 0: If he doesn't believe it's fake, he's just going to run because he doesn't care about the race walk anymore.

428
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,719
Speaker 1: So, when they come after him, he starts to race walk a little bit.

429
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,059
Speaker 1: And then, spoilers, he runs.

430
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,059
Speaker 0: I mean, technically he was running the whole time.

431
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:08,594
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

432
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:13,355
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

433
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:13,800
Speaker 1: Theben.

434
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's a game.

435
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,700
Speaker 0: And I did a little bit of research on this game.

436
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,234
Speaker 0: So, it was printed a long time ago.

437
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 0: What year?

438
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,760
Speaker 0: That's a long time ago.

439
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:24,837
Speaker 1: The box art looks like it's an early 90s game, though.

440
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,039
Speaker 1: I mean, look at that box.

441
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like an even older game.

442
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,740
Speaker 0: But the game was called Gensites von Theben.

443
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,260
Speaker 0: Does gensites mean archaeologists or something like that?

444
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,671
Speaker 1: Archaeological sites?

445
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,219
Speaker 1: I don't know.

446
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

447
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,920
Speaker 0: And archaeological von Peterprins.

448
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:37,490
Speaker 0: Right.

449
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

450
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:39,939
Speaker 1: For two to four spieler.

451
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,636
Speaker 0: So, the game was reprinted in a much better version.

452
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:44,099
Speaker 0: in what year?

453
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,703
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry.

454
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:46,951
Speaker 1: For ages 10 and up.

455
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,360
Speaker 1: I'm trying to read those old German rules.

456
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't care about that.

457
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,671
Speaker 1: It was reprinted in 2007 as just Thebes.

458
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 0: So, I think it's hard to get and out of print, maybe.

459
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,536
Speaker 0: But, maybe it's not hard to get.

460
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:56,900
Speaker 0: I don't know.

461
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,676
Speaker 0: But, we had a friend had a copy.

462
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 0: We played it a bunch.

463
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,440
Speaker 0: It's a game I had seen around before at conventions and in game libraries.

464
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,060
Speaker 0: And never had actually played.

465
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,429
Speaker 0: So, we played it.

466
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,140
Speaker 0: We played it like two or three times.

467
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,860
Speaker 1: Well, Scott played it and then he comes over to me later because I was doing something else.

468
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,294
Speaker 1: He's like, "Oh my god, we're going to play this digging

469
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:13,537
Speaker 1: game.".

470
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,965
Speaker 1: And he kept bringing it up.

471
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:17,940
Speaker 1: And then, like the next day, I played the digging game and we dug.

472
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,280
Speaker 0: So, the thing about this game is that it's just so thematically good, right?

473
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,706
Speaker 0: The theme of the game is this.

474
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,220
Speaker 0: You are an archaeologist, like Indiana Jones style.

475
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, fake archaeologist.

476
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:29,740
Speaker 0: Except without the traps and the golden monkeys and shit.

477
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,275
Speaker 1: The little dudes you move around have Indiana Jones.

478
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,180
Speaker 1: They're just Indiana Jones.

479
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:33,461
Speaker 1: Right.

480
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:39,460
Speaker 0: So, you start in yerp and you're going around yerp researching things, right?

481
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:40,960
Speaker 1: And chasing down rumors.

482
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,775
Speaker 0: Right, or you're hiring diggers or getting graduate students to follow you around.

483
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Speaker 1: Maybe you're buying a blimp to keep on hand or you buy a car, which apparently is super awesome.

484
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, which we didn't think was awesome.

485
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:55,960
Speaker 1: You didn't think was awesome.

486
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,540
Speaker 0: Well, I was told it was not awesome.

487
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll talk about this later, but we started the game and Scott's like,

488
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:00,220
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

489
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,079
Speaker 1: I trusted someone.

490
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,990
Speaker 1: The car comes up and Scott's like, "Oh, the car

491
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:03,473
Speaker 1: sucks.".

492
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,519
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Well...".

493
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,640
Speaker 0: I was told the car sucked, but apparently that was not the case.

494
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,019
Speaker 1: The car would probably be pretty great if I bought it in the beginning of the game and then a car appears.

495
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,760
Speaker 1: And, of course, our friend buys it right away.

496
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,136
Speaker 0: I was also told the shovel was awesome, so I got a bunch of shovels right away.

497
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:16,840
Speaker 0: Not that awesome.

498
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, the shovel was awesome, but you know what?

499
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:19,778
Speaker 1: I only got two shovels.

500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,980
Speaker 0: I got three and it still wasn't awesome enough.

501
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,319
Speaker 0: Anyway, so here's how the game works.

502
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:27,106
Speaker 0: You spend time.

503
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,560
Speaker 0: The game, depending on how many players you have, is two or three years long.

504
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:35,920
Speaker 0: And everything you do takes time, so you move along the edge of the board whenever you do anything.

505
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,840
Speaker 1: Like where the victory point track is on regular German games.

506
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,700
Speaker 1: Instead, that's just time, so I do a thing.

507
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,840
Speaker 0: There's 52 weeks in the year, so you move.

508
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:52,537
Speaker 0: If you do something that takes six weeks, it's like moving from Moscow to London and then doing some research could take you one week per space.

509
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,272
Speaker 0: you have to move, which could be three spaces or four spaces.

510
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:56,520
Speaker 0: Moscow to London is pretty far.

511
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:00,776
Speaker 0: And then you spend time learning about Mesopotamia.

512
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:01,780
Speaker 0: That takes three more weeks.

513
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
Speaker 1: So like a card would be on a place.

514
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,920
Speaker 0: So you move your guy seven spaces because it took seven weeks.

515
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:14,020
Speaker 1: So some cards, like if you do a bunch of research in Moscow, even after you move to Moscow, you'll spend like six weeks doing the research.

516
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,620
Speaker 1: But if you just find some schmuck with a room around the street, it only takes like one more week.

517
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,820
Speaker 1: And you go until you run out of time.

518
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,020
Speaker 0: So whoever's turn it is is the person who has currently spent the least number of weeks.

519
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,560
Speaker 0: So if you've spent the least amount of time, you spend a little bit of time.

520
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,760
Speaker 0: And if you pass someone, they now spend a little bit of time.

521
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,800
Speaker 0: And everyone does a move whenever they're currently the person who's done the least stuff.

522
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,860
Speaker 1: So whoever's furthest back always takes their turn.

523
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Speaker 0: So sometimes you can do stuff twice in a row.

524
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 0: If you do a little bit and then a little bit and a little bit and everyone else has already done a whole ton of crap, then you can actually do a bunch of different things while everyone else is waiting for you.

525
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,720
Speaker 1: Now that in and of itself is a novel mechanic.

526
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,885
Speaker 0: It's so thematic.

527
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,400
Speaker 0: It's like you're spending time going around doing stuff.

528
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,539
Speaker 0: And everyone has the same amount of time to do stuff as everyone else.

529
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,120
Speaker 0: Because you can't end the game by going over or under.

530
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,860
Speaker 0: You end the game going exactly two or three years of stuff doing.

531
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,580
Speaker 1: But also as a mechanic, it is very novel because it provides a lot of...

532
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,480
Speaker 0: It solves the turn order problem.

533
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,360
Speaker 1: It provides a lot of opportunities for a clever game designer using a mechanic like this.

534
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,197
Speaker 0: It's something like, "Oh, you got to be the first player and I'm sitting to your

535
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:20,499
Speaker 0: left.".

536
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,439
Speaker 0: And none of that happens.

537
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,940
Speaker 1: To design a very well-balanced or self-balancing game.

538
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 1: Because sure, the shovel's awesome.

539
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,420
Speaker 1: Shovel takes a lot of time.

540
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,059
Speaker 1: So you could do like a big crazy move on your turn.

541
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,940
Speaker 1: But it might take a ton of weeks.

542
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:37,480
Speaker 1: And then everyone else takes like three or four turns before you get to go again.

543
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:37,942
Speaker 0: Right.

544
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,447
Speaker 0: Now the other thing you do is you can go down below out of... You can leave Europe.

545
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:42,980
Speaker 0: You can go to... Well, Greece is still in Europe.

546
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,380
Speaker 0: But you can go to Greece, Crete, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Palestine.

547
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,479
Speaker 0: Is there somewhere else to go?

548
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:49,000
Speaker 1: I forget.

549
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:49,561
Speaker 0: Right.

550
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:50,568
Speaker 0: Rome is part of Europe.

551
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:52,380
Speaker 0: It's not part of the archaeology dig places.

552
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,280
Speaker 0: And you just go there the same way you go around Europe.

553
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,539
Speaker 0: But when you get there, there's only one thing to do.

554
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:57,840
Speaker 0: And that is start digging.

555
00:30:58,623 --> 00:30:59,696
Speaker 1: Now the digging mechanic is...

556
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,019
Speaker 0: The best.

557
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:04,620
Speaker 1: Now it's the best, but at the same time it does make the game a little random.

558
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,719
Speaker 0: It makes the game a lot random.

559
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,860
Speaker 1: But it makes it thematically really fun.

560
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:08,982
Speaker 0: Right.

561
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,280
Speaker 0: This game is all about theme.

562
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,620
Speaker 0: It's not about being a strong competitive game.

563
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,399
Speaker 1: I've already come up with some pretty strong strategies, though.

564
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,220
Speaker 0: I mean, there's strong strategies, but in the end it's the mercy of the desert, right?

565
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:20,680
Speaker 0: So let's say you go to Egypt.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,287
Speaker 0: And you've studied Egypt a lot.

567
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:24,640
Speaker 0: You've studied four Egypts, right?

568
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,820
Speaker 0: There's this little awesome wheel you use and you spin the wheel.

569
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,115
Speaker 0: And the wheel says, "Oh, you've studied four

570
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:30,598
Speaker 0: Egypts.".

571
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,160
Speaker 0: Well, if you dig in Egypt for eight weeks, you get to dig this much dirt in Egypt.

572
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,380
Speaker 0: And the more you know about Egypt or the more time you spend, the more you get to dig.

573
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,460
Speaker 1: So the bag that you dig from for each site, each site has its own bag.

574
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,468
Speaker 0: You literally dig.

575
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,660
Speaker 0: There's an Egypt bag.

576
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,918
Speaker 0: And you reach your hand in there and pull out a number of tiles equal to how many you're allowed to dig, right?

577
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,420
Speaker 0: And you're digging through that bag.

578
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,640
Speaker 0: And in the bag, it starts the game with half treasure and half dirt.

579
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,240
Speaker 0: Any treasure you get is treasure you get.

580
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,619
Speaker 0: And it's worth victory points.

581
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,016
Speaker 0: Any dirt you get is dirt.

582
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:13,139
Speaker 0: Now what makes the game amazing is that when you're done digging the Egypt bag, you take all the treasures and you keep them.

583
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,379
Speaker 0: You know, you might want to uphold an exhibition or who knows what you're going to do with them.

584
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,414
Speaker 0: But all the dirt goes back in.

585
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:20,520
Speaker 0: You fill in the holes.

586
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,720
Speaker 0: And the next person who comes and digs in Egypt, it fucking sucks, right?

587
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,339
Speaker 0: Because there is way more dirt than treasure in there now.

588
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:32,320
Speaker 0: So they need to dig even better than you, Doug, to have a chance of getting anything.

589
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,638
Speaker 1: I once dug 12 tiles from a bag that had a reasonable amount of treasure in it and dug 12 dirt.

590
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 0: I've also saw some people dig like six tiles out of a bag that was mostly dirt and get like five treasures.

591
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,960
Speaker 0: So it's like there's so much drama when digging.

592
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,640
Speaker 0: But it's just like the drama of doing real archaeology where you go to a site and you start digging.

593
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,808
Speaker 0: It's like, are we going to find anything?

594
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,319
Speaker 0: We don't fucking know.

595
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,198
Speaker 0: And then if you do find something like, "Oh my God, it's a prize amphora completely

596
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:00,740
Speaker 0: intact.".

597
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,539
Speaker 0: Or, "Oh my God, it's a whole sarcophagus that's plated in gold leaf, only

598
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 0: shit.".

599
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:12,360
Speaker 1: So even further to really drive the theme home, it's got all these other little elements, like it has a sheet that tells you what all the treasures are.

600
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're all real treasures and they have names and stuff.

601
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:20,739
Speaker 1: There's no bearing on the game, but yet we would read like, "Oh, you just found a blah and a blah and the ancient menorah of blah blah

602
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:20,980
Speaker 1: blah.".

603
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:26,120
Speaker 0: Now that's the thing about the game is that the theme of it is so good, but the mechanics are only okay.

604
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,820
Speaker 1: Well, I would say the digging mechanic is what makes you say the mechanics are okay.

605
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,380
Speaker 1: Because the rest of the game, I would like to make a more deterministic game that uses the same front half.

606
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Speaker 1: Everything but the digging.

607
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Speaker 0: It's not just the digging that's random, it's also the cards that are random.

608
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,000
Speaker 1: Well, it's a third in taxes randomness or a web of power randomness.

609
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,180
Speaker 0: So let's say I go to London and I spend a turn researching Egypt, right?

610
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:54,374
Speaker 0: And then it goes around and I spent a lot of time doing that.

611
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:55,500
Speaker 0: Everyone else does a bunch of stuff.

612
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,900
Speaker 0: It's finally my turn again, right?

613
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:59,048
Speaker 0: Now there's four cards available.

614
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,200
Speaker 0: The only thing you can do in Europe is do one of those four cards, pretty much.

615
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,020
Speaker 0: And I look at those four cards and they're all in Moscow.

616
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,733
Speaker 0: And even though I might want to do one of them, I'm in London.

617
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,120
Speaker 0: I just happen to be in London now.

618
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,340
Speaker 1: So suck it up, spend some weeks and go over there.

619
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,998
Speaker 0: So I end up having to spend a bunch of weeks.

620
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,320
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, so now I spend a bunch of weeks to go to Moscow to do this card.

621
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,657
Speaker 0: Then the card that gets flipped over next is, I don't know, Paris.

622
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:32,976
Speaker 0: Rims already in Paris and it's his turn now and that card only, you know, so he just picks up that card for a lot less weeks than it would have cost me.

623
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:42,340
Speaker 0: because, and that ends up, it doesn't seem that big a deal, but if it keeps and it might, you know, over time, the whole course of the game, it should even out between the players.

624
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,540
Speaker 1: It is also mitigated heavily by the fact that if you find a good card, it pushes you way up on the time track.

625
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:54,120
Speaker 1: So whoever fell behind will probably get to do a couple turns in a row and reveal more cards.

626
00:34:54,641 --> 00:34:57,757
Speaker 0: No, that's what I'm saying is if a good card spawns on you, right?

627
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,640
Speaker 0: Not only do you get that card without having to spend a lot of time, but now it's your turn again.

628
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,940
Speaker 0: You can get to do a lot more stuff in a lot less time if the cards turn up your way.

629
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,460
Speaker 1: Well, that's the danger of taking cards and going ahead.

630
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:14,319
Speaker 1: If you take good cards and go ahead, you basically give everyone else way more card opportunities.

631
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,740
Speaker 0: But you might have no choice depending on what cards are available on your turn.

632
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,060
Speaker 0: So it's not just the digging that's random, it's which cards are there on your turn.

633
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:25,019
Speaker 0: that is also almost as random as the tiles, but not quite as random.

634
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,952
Speaker 1: Moving will only take like one, two or three weeks.

635
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:28,100
Speaker 1: Good cards take six.

636
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,380
Speaker 1: I think it's close to being very optimally balanced.

637
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,360
Speaker 0: It's close, but it's not so perfect, right?

638
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,420
Speaker 1: I was watching you make very poor decisions throughout that game.

639
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,380
Speaker 0: No, I was doing fine.

640
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:45,660
Speaker 0: I mean, so yes, there is decisions to be made that matter a lot, but it's like a half luck, half skill game.

641
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,720
Speaker 1: I think the digging adds 80% of the luck to the game.

642
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:51,100
Speaker 1: The luck of the card getting.

643
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,780
Speaker 0: I'm just saying the luck of the card getting is not nearly as big as the digging luck.

644
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,846
Speaker 1: I would go beyond that.

645
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:56,874
Speaker 1: I would say that it's minor.

646
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,140
Speaker 0: I'm saying it is not huge, it is not major, but it is large enough to be significant.

647
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,791
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even say it's that significant.

648
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,120
Speaker 1: I would say it's barely significant.

649
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,560
Speaker 0: I'd say it is significant.

650
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,820
Speaker 1: I think it's a bigger deal in Thurn in taxes and Web of Power.

651
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,193
Speaker 0: It is a bigger deal in those, but it is still a deal.

652
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:16,036
Speaker 0: It's a deal.

653
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:16,960
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal?

654
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,473
Speaker 1: Yes, technically you are correct.

655
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,060
Speaker 1: It is a deal.

656
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,564
Speaker 0: It's a deal, right?

657
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:27,320
Speaker 0: So you could lose a game because bad tiles in your turn, but I also think we were playing four player games, right?

658
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,318
Speaker 0: We've only had two years.

659
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:35,518
Speaker 0: If you're playing with less players, which it gives you the third year, and also not only more time to do stuff with that third year, right?

660
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,240
Speaker 0: But also more chances at the cards because less competition.

661
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:43,620
Speaker 0: Also, that it becomes much less, they won't be a deal in less players.

662
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:51,500
Speaker 1: Interesting thing, we played, this was like the magfest of playing more old style classic German games.

663
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Speaker 1: What I've noticed is that five players or six players is what everyone is shooting for these days because people have bigger groups.

664
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:05,400
Speaker 1: But, most of the best German games I can think of and most games that have stood the test of time are four player games.

665
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,420
Speaker 0: We played this with four or five players.

666
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,589
Speaker 0: No, we played it with four.

667
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:09,379
Speaker 1: It only takes up to four.

668
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:14,719
Speaker 1: Most of the games we played at this magfest take four max.

669
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,726
Speaker 0: I think this is best with two or three.

670
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:20,700
Speaker 0: I think four stresses the resources of the game too much.

671
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,120
Speaker 0: And it makes the digging much more punishing because now you've got the same amount of competition for the same amount of treasure.

672
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,434
Speaker 0: They don't put in more treasures and more dirt in more player game.

673
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:31,600
Speaker 0: It's the same bag, right?

674
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,528
Speaker 1: Because this game is a race, it is not highly political.

675
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:43,340
Speaker 1: so it does not fall into the three player game trap where a three player game is actually a two player game plus a safety monkey.

676
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,560
Speaker 1: So, yes, I agree this game is probably a lot better with three player.

677
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,603
Speaker 0: Just because it will be more fun.

678
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:53,560
Speaker 0: More people will get a chance to go in the bag and get treasures even though the scores will be higher.

679
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,045
Speaker 0: You'll get to do more stuff.

680
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,957
Speaker 0: It will just be more enjoyable with more players.

681
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:58,379
Speaker 0: Less players.

682
00:37:58,981 --> 00:38:04,600
Speaker 1: It's kind of like how Bonanza is real fun with six and seven but it's also kind of broken.

683
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,280
Speaker 1: Bonanza with five is ideal and perfect and one of my favorite games.

684
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,988
Speaker 0: I think this game is ideal with three.

685
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:13,100
Speaker 0: Even two I think this game can be really good.

686
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,953
Speaker 1: Two would be real interesting.

687
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:16,959
Speaker 0: I haven't played it with two.

688
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,513
Speaker 0: I think three is the ideal but I still think two is good.

689
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:20,780
Speaker 0: I would prefer two to the four.

690
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,180
Speaker 1: Board Game Geek says best with three to four which is interesting.

691
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:27,839
Speaker 0: I wonder if there's any special rules for the two because we didn't actually play the two.

692
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:30,940
Speaker 0: But the three I think is the sweet spot.

693
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a big difference between three and four player.

694
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:35,060
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say best with three to four.

695
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think best with three and then four is kind of like it's playable but it's not as good as the three.

696
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,720
Speaker 1: But if you're especially an aspiring game designer, you should play this game for nothing else than to see a game that so perfectly matches theme.

697
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mechanic theme meshing here is so perfect.

698
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,440
Speaker 1: Here's another example.

699
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,800
Speaker 0: There are so few games that line it up so well.

700
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,207
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of other parts.

701
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:56,594
Speaker 1: We didn't obviously tell you the whole rules.

702
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,700
Speaker 0: Like when you play Puerto Rico and you choose Craftsman, do you really feel like you're crafting?

703
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,430
Speaker 0: No, but when you choose to dig and spend six weeks digging in Egypt.

704
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,880
Speaker 0: in this game, you feel like you're spending six weeks digging in Egypt.

705
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,000
Speaker 0: And when you go around Europe researching, you feel like you're traveling around Europe researching.

706
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:15,560
Speaker 1: But there's also these exhibitions.

707
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:22,580
Speaker 1: So you'll be digging in Egypt and suddenly you see, oh, there's an exposition going on in London right now.

708
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:36,599
Speaker 1: And if you've got the stuff to be able to exhibit there to loan to their museum, you've got to get your ass back to London, be there before anyone else who also has the right goods, lend your stuff to the museum and you have to spend three weeks at the exposition.

709
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:38,457
Speaker 0: The expo.

710
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,551
Speaker 0: Yes, expo.

711
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,220
Speaker 1: Because I'm doing expeditions.

712
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,034
Speaker 0: I think it's actually just exhibit in a museum.

713
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:44,799
Speaker 0: It's not an expo.

714
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,620
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's all kinds of side things that you can do that are kind of interesting and fun to get more victory points.

715
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:52,319
Speaker 1: And they're all so tight with the theme.

716
00:39:53,081 --> 00:40:02,740
Speaker 1: But also the mechanic of you spend time going around a board is a very interesting self-tuning mechanic that you could use.

717
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:04,960
Speaker 1: It's a lot of old German games had stuff like that.

718
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:14,760
Speaker 1: I recall I started playing a bunch of them again, where even if the game wasn't like super prescriptively designed for balance, they'll have these mechanics where anyone gets too far ahead.

719
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,959
Speaker 1: It's not like a traditional rubber band that just sort of pulls you up.

720
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:23,292
Speaker 1: But it's more like the more powerful strategies have an intrinsic game cost.

721
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:28,040
Speaker 1: that sort of causes them to balance out very nicely, even if you didn't think about it too closely.

722
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,920
Speaker 0: I think what makes this game such a good thing, if you can find a copy, buy it.

723
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:41,660
Speaker 0: Because on the one hand, it is a competitive game, though it's not super perfect, amazing competitive, like I say, a netrunner or something like that.

724
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:50,300
Speaker 0: But it's competitive enough that someone who likes to play games to win can play this game and think a lot about strategies and make interesting decisions and have a good time.

725
00:40:51,101 --> 00:41:03,680
Speaker 0: But also because the theme and the mechanic match so well and the fun are reaching in the bag, that person who usually was only willing to play Cards Against Humanity or maybe Camel Up, Camel Cup, something like that.

726
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:05,419
Speaker 1: It's canonically Camel Up.

727
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:18,339
Speaker 0: Someone who's usually only playing the easier, more luck-based, not skilled, not hardcore games like Camel Up, you can get them to play this game because it's so fun to go in the bag and do the things.

728
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,000
Speaker 0: And then you can use this to get both of those people to play the game together and have a good time without that conflict that usually happens.

729
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,660
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of games in that sweet spot.

730
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,980
Speaker 1: You'll see a neat design pattern.

731
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:39,860
Speaker 1: There's a lot of games where you can take some number of things, and if you're clever, you can make a combo of the exact values of them.

732
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,243
Speaker 1: Like Power Grid is an example.

733
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:49,539
Speaker 1: Power Grid is a game where you can spend exactly all of your money if you're very clever a lot of the time, and it's a huge advantage if you did so.

734
00:41:49,800 --> 00:42:04,875
Speaker 1: If you set the stage for that play to happen later, this game does that in the sense that if you fall way behind in time, you might be able to look at the board and come up with a combo where you get to take two or three turns, and then you land directly on top of someone.

735
00:42:04,996 --> 00:42:05,620
Speaker 1: Exactly.

736
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 1: If you land on top of someone on the time thing, top is last place, so you get to take yet another turn.

737
00:42:13,402 --> 00:42:15,229
Speaker 1: I feel like a heuristic to know who's doing.

738
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:24,300
Speaker 1: well is who landed on top of another player the most, because that is the person who's doing the Power Grid thing of spending exactly all of their money more than once in the game.

739
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,044
Speaker 0: Right, so think about it.

740
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:28,480
Speaker 0: You're sitting there looking at the board, and you see a card you really want, right?

741
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:35,048
Speaker 0: And there's three cards you don't really want so much, so you go and you're in Europe, you're not ready to dig anything yet, so you just go and get the card you really want.

742
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,720
Speaker 0: You move two spaces and take it for five turns.

743
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,260
Speaker 0: Now it's not your turn anymore, but you didn't pay attention.

744
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,599
Speaker 0: One of those cards you didn't want was on the spot you spawned and only cost one week to pick up.

745
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:47,502
Speaker 1: Even though

746
00:42:47,643 --> 00:43:01,460
Speaker 0: it wasn't a great card that you really wanted, you could have gotten that card basically for free, but because you weren't paying attention, you didn't get it, and you just let it sit there, and it's like you could have had two cards, instead you only got one card because you weren't being careful.

747
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:16,440
Speaker 1: So that is sort of almost a common design pattern, irrespective of the mechanic that causes it, of does the game have a mechanism to reward the player for being exact about something that's difficult to predict or difficult to calculate?

748
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:19,179
Speaker 1: Power Grid does it, and this game does it.

749
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:27,490
Speaker 1: And I wanted to add a new thing to the way we review board games, because on one of the panels I was on, that Scott was not on at MagFest, super smart guy.

750
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:30,300
Speaker 1: Luke Peterschmidt at Fundo11 said something really interesting.

751
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:44,489
Speaker 1: Most tabletop games, like commercial ones, not necessarily the weirdo German ones we play, but in general, they pretty much assume that the game's got three to five plays tops, and that people really won't play it.

752
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,420
Speaker 1: much beyond that, except maybe bringing it out.

753
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,080
Speaker 1: Games that get past that three plays barrier are real close to being classics for all time.

754
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:07,160
Speaker 1: If you're talking about games above a certain level of complexity, but below a certain other arbitrary, there's a lot more, I'm taking this quote kind of out of context, I think this game has four to five more plays by me before I'm done with it.

755
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:23,080
Speaker 0: I think the number of plays this game has is entirely dependent on how many friends you have, because you might get tired of digging in that bag, and it might lose its excitement a bit, but if you bring some new people in, it can refresh in the excitement, because reaching in that bag is just so awesome.

756
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:30,140
Speaker 1: So thus, the way I would put that is, this game has three to five plays from a purely intellectual, "I'm a gamer playing this game" perspective.

757
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,220
Speaker 0: And any new person is going to want to play it at least two to three times.

758
00:44:33,461 --> 00:44:35,246
Speaker 1: But it has unlimited play.

759
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:41,919
Speaker 1: for me, as Scott was alluding to, in that if I'm with some people who have never played this game, and I own this game, I'll just bust it out.

760
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,719
Speaker 0: You're not going to bust it out with two people who've played it before and one who hasn't?

761
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:47,040
Speaker 0: Nope.

762
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,899
Speaker 0: But one who has played it before and two or three who haven't, yes, you're going to bust it out, because they're going to have so much fun going in the bag.

763
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,600
Speaker 1: Definitely.

764
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,813
Speaker 0: And digging into Egypt and finding nothing.

765
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:56,760
Speaker 0: Dirt, dirt, dirt.

766
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,595
Speaker 0: And everyone's chanting when you go in the bag, all the other players are like, "Dirt!

767
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:01,198
Speaker 0: Dirt!

768
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:01,700
Speaker 0: Dirt!".

769
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,328
Speaker 1: And at one point, Scott took the bag.

770
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,760
Speaker 1: I was about to dig into and put a curse on it.

771
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,059
Speaker 1: And sure enough, I drew like nine fucking dirt.

772
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:09,204
Speaker 0: Curses!

773
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:11,416
Speaker 0: King Tut, he got you!

774
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:12,080
Speaker 0: King Tut!

775
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:26,160
Speaker 1: So we're going to try to do that in all of our reviews from now on, of really talk about how many plays this game has got in it, because I feel like that's one thing, that's a metric that we could have used a lot more, we could have used that very effectively in our older game reviews.

776
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:34,772
Speaker 1: I'm trying to go back and think about some of those games, because then, a couple of years down the road, we can go back and say, "Hey, how many times did we play that game?

777
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:39,980
Speaker 1: Was it really five players, or was there some high-end strategy we didn't think about?

778
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:41,147
Speaker 1: Did we play it

779
00:45:41,187 --> 00:45:41,490
Speaker 1: more?".

780
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,953
Speaker 1: Because T&E right now is one of the... T&E and Puerto Rico still have Infinity.

781
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:46,780
Speaker 1: I'll play those right now.

782
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,580
Speaker 0: But there's also games that could have a lot of plays and we just don't for whatever reason.

783
00:45:54,202 --> 00:45:56,313
Speaker 0: We could play Lost Cities just whenever.

784
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,418
Speaker 0: We just don't.

785
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,079
Speaker 1: If we go to Anime Boston, we're going to be playing a lot of Lost Cities, I think.

786
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:02,018
Speaker 0: Good idea.

787
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that Mushroom game, and we're going to bring all the two-player games.

788
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:05,718
Speaker 0: Netrunner.

789
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

790
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:18,560
Speaker 1: And kind of a total aside, but we played some Blast from the past that we'll talk about later, so I have this old... I don't even know if we ever reviewed it on Geek Nights, because I think I bought it before Geek Nights.

791
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:19,136
Speaker 0: I think we did.

792
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:20,919
Speaker 1: But Lachita.

793
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,800
Speaker 0: It was a Beacon game.

794
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,872
Speaker 1: And Scott read the rules again, and I read them again, and then... That game's got some stuff going on.

795
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:27,859
Speaker 1: I think it needs a second look.

796
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:28,522
Speaker 0: Yeah.

797
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,960
Speaker 0: I think it did an episode on it.

798
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:43,220
Speaker 1: Scott did not play, but there are two games that are kind of famous in our circle, because they're both games that we played a reasonable number of times back in college, but Scott and I are mutually, independently undefeated at both of them.

799
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:48,520
Speaker 1: I am undefeated at Pizarro, and Scott is undefeated at Web of Power, despite many plays.

800
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,853
Speaker 1: Someone brought Web of Power.

801
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:51,720
Speaker 1: I don't know how it got him.

802
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,940
Speaker 0: I've never seen a copy of Pizarro since college.

803
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:54,423
Speaker 0: I know.

804
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,720
Speaker 1: So I played a game of Web of Power.

805
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,720
Speaker 1: I won by so much, it wasn't even... It was laughable.

806
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:08,960
Speaker 1: They were babies fumbling in the dark in terms of their strategy, despite having played it a bunch relatively recently.

807
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,800
Speaker 0: All I remember from that... I don't remember how to play.

808
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,317
Speaker 0: I just remember, "Just connect all your guys in a big, long network, and then at the end of the game, put the cylinders out in the best

809
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:17,660
Speaker 0: spots.".

810
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,320
Speaker 1: So Scott, I hadn't played the game in a long time.

811
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,927
Speaker 0: What did you do?

812
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:20,940
Speaker 0: Did you do what I just said?

813
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:25,230
Speaker 1: I looked at the board, and I had my usual gut feeling of, "Here's how I'm going to win this

814
00:47:25,271 --> 00:47:25,534
Speaker 1: game.".

815
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,800
Speaker 1: But then I stepped back, and I thought long and hard about what you did when you were undefeated.

816
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:32,819
Speaker 0: How do you remember from back then?

817
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,260
Speaker 1: I remember things, apparently.

818
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:38,219
Speaker 0: All I remember is, "Make a big network of houses, and then put the cylinders

819
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,299
Speaker 0: out.".

820
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,120
Speaker 1: So I focused on the network of houses to the exclusion of the things that my heuristics were screaming at me to do.

821
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,740
Speaker 0: That's also what I did when I played it.

822
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,420
Speaker 0: I made the biggest network of houses I possibly could.

823
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:53,500
Speaker 1: I won real hard, real early.

824
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,920
Speaker 0: I want to know what happens in the game when multiple people are all trying to make the biggest network of houses they possibly can.

825
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,519
Speaker 1: So the question is, if we get a hold of this game again, will you play it with me?

826
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,099
Speaker 1: Because you are legit undefeated at this game, and you played it more than once.

827
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,660
Speaker 0: The game I forget how to play, other than I remember making a network of houses.

828
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's most of the game.

829
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:15,140
Speaker 1: It's actually a very simple and really quick game.

830
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,138
Speaker 1: If I ever see it for cheap, I'm going to get it, because I kind of liked it.

831
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,820
Speaker 1: Alright, we're done.

832
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,640
Speaker 0: This game is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

833
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,760
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

834
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:55,110
Speaker 1: The Patrons this week, in order of the amount of money they annoy Scott with, are Nicholas Brandau, Rebecca Dunn, John R. Knobs II, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koops, Jess, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroos, you expected the next name to be yours, but it was me, Dio, Clinton Walton, MyStady.com, Phil Ulrich, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silverhot, Can't Melt Steel Beams, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Nox, Flame Darkfire, I've Thought Carefully and I'm Still Going to Pay, Daniel Redman, Chris Hadad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

835
00:49:55,851 --> 00:50:00,330
Speaker 1: At least someone has figured out that one of my favorite jokes in the world is the Can't Melt Steel Beams thing.

836
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,630
Speaker 1: So you know, you all know where it comes from.

837
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:13,603
Speaker 1: It's that completely fake and stupid, loose change, whatever, 9/11 was a conspiracy thing, but I first encountered it as a joke long ago when someone made this image.

838
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:17,302
Speaker 1: that was just like, what my eight-year-old cousin thinks.

839
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:31,669
Speaker 1: all the Pokemon are called, and it shows Pikachu, and it's like Yellow Cat, and it's just like, it's kind of funny, and it's going on, and they increasingly make less and less and less sense as you go through this image, and then eventually it's just like Jet Fuel, Can't Melt Steel, for whatever reason.

840
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:41,370
Speaker 1: I found this way funnier than I probably should have, and I've just found that one particular joke really, really, really funny every time I encounter it forever.

841
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:51,869
Speaker 1: So, I don't know, maybe my brain's broken, but I just find it really funny, and in fact, that joke is the whole reason I made that Ozymandias Twitter account that a lot of you are following now.

842
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:59,050
Speaker 1: But anyway, I should keep this brief, because as you all know, I'm actually in London right now, and the episode's basically recorded well in advance.

843
00:50:59,492 --> 00:51:17,370
Speaker 1: We will resume the normal Geek Night stuff starting next week, and I think it's either 3 or 3.30 p.m As I said, we do have with that panel Atari Game Design at PAX East, and while we're probably going to have video of the PAX South version of it up before PAX East even happens, we do it differently every time.

844
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:22,050
Speaker 1: This is a panel we can actually get a lot of mileage out of, because we can just keep doing different Atari games.

845
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:30,450
Speaker 1: So, we're basically going to do Outlaw for the first 20-ish minutes of this panel every time we run it, at least until we've milked that cow for all it's worth.

846
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:33,230
Speaker 1: But all the other games, we're going to jump around.

847
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,821
Speaker 1: We might not talk about combat.

848
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,910
Speaker 1: We might talk about other games.

849
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:44,190
Speaker 1: I've been experimenting with maybe some paddle games, maybe some games on the Intellivision to kind of really push it over the line.

850
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:52,590
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it'll probably be worth your while to see the panel, even though Scott doesn't seem to think the panel's that good, despite the fact that people lined up literally hours to see it.

851
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,989
Speaker 1: They completely filled the not-small panel room at PAX.

852
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,330
Speaker 1: Also, Scott does not listen to these things at the end, so I can pretty much do whatever I want here.

853
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:14,970
Speaker 1: And now, thus, I leave you with... It's kind of an oldie and a classic, but I'm pretty sure you're going to laugh when you remember what this is, and if you've never heard it before, well, my hat is off to you guys at Dorkly for making this possible.

854
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,010
Speaker 0: Don't deny your fursona, brother.

855
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,349
Speaker 0: There is a sexy raccoon living inside you.

856
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:21,726
Speaker 1: Let him out.

857
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,789
Speaker 1: I don't have a fursona, my God.

858
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:31,429
Speaker 0: I was once like you, trying to quell the sexy wolf-fox howling in my soul.

859
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,729
Speaker 1: Let him out so you can feel whole.

860
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,430
Speaker 1: Listen to Goomba.

861
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,849
Speaker 1: That name has no meaning to me.

862
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:40,070
Speaker 0: I am Snowtail, Arctic Foxwolf.

863
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,650
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Snowtail, but I'm not a furry.

864
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,109
Speaker 1: I'm not down to yiff.

865
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,030
Speaker 1: I wear a tanuki suit so I cannot fly and I cannot turn to stone.

866
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,386
Speaker 0: So, you wear it to get hard?

867
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:51,930
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

868
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,529
Speaker 1: Wait, no, not like that.

869
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,629
Speaker 1: Greetings, Snowtail.

870
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:00,566
Speaker 0: It is I, a pond-hopper, a sexy frog-man, and a...

871
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:01,456
Speaker 1: Luigi?

872
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:02,867
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

873
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,709
Speaker 1: Mario, I can explain.

874
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:08,210
Speaker 1: Please don't tell Mama.
