Speaker 0: tonight We're still talking about Ore Monogatari my love story.

5
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,340
Speaker 0: I guess just my story.

6
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,314
Speaker 0: We don't know enough Japanese to really understand.

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,731
Speaker 0: I guess it's implied that part.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,244
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,640
Speaker 0: So this past weekend a lot of our for, you know, we only really go to one anime con.

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,193
Speaker 0: Well, yeah really one anime con.

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,060
Speaker 0: we go to anime Boston.

12
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,854
Speaker 1: We went to anime next to once many many years ago, and that was it.

13
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:42,140
Speaker 1: You know, it was worth going.

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,610
Speaker 0: That's where we saw rent our own sorry in Taro there.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,674
Speaker 1: You know, it was a good time.

16
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:47,020
Speaker 0: We went with like katsu.

17
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went with katsu for the most part.

18
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:51,096
Speaker 1: It's like we saw rent our.

19
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:57,044
Speaker 1: we walked around the dealers room And then we were like, oh, there's really nothing else for it was a you know You know what that was.

20
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,715
Speaker 1: you can go back and listen to the geek nights.

21
00:00:58,755 --> 00:00:59,520
Speaker 1: or we talked about it.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,802
Speaker 1: You know what?

23
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:02,094
Speaker 0: It was that was the last time I went to an anime con.

24
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,140
Speaker 1: Didn't we do a panel there?

25
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,548
Speaker 0: No, no where we weren't guests like.

26
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,057
Speaker 0: we just went to an anime con right for fun.

27
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:09,602
Speaker 0: We don't do that We haven't done.

28
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,547
Speaker 0: this is the last time.

29
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,380
Speaker 1: so anime next is still going and it's pretty good anime con.

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,066
Speaker 1: It's never been really awful.

31
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:15,347
Speaker 0: Yep.

32
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:16,471
Speaker 0: I hear why worried.

33
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:18,880
Speaker 0: I heard that the panel rooms are pretty small.

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,968
Speaker 1: I don't think it really concentrates on panels too much.

35
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a typical anime con, but it gets it done.

36
00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:28,360
Speaker 0: So all our friends were there this past weekend, so I got to see that Twitter stream, but you know, we were doing other stuff.

37
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:30,389
Speaker 0: but now There's some news.

38
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,419
Speaker 0: I didn't know until.

39
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:37,656
Speaker 1: Anime next is making a change that might lure me back into their foal for 2016.

40
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,000
Speaker 0: You can pre-register now.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,363
Speaker 1: Good job.

42
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:41,951
Speaker 1: All right, you're already doing a good job.

43
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,419
Speaker 0: if you pre-register in the next week.

44
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,077
Speaker 0: This week it's 40 bucks for a weekend pass.

45
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:47,620
Speaker 1: That's cheap.

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,934
Speaker 0: But the news is that anime next 2016 is in Atlantic City.

47
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:53,616
Speaker 1: It's moving.

48
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,659
Speaker 1: It was in North Jersey.

49
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:03,096
Speaker 1: now It's going further away from where I live Closer to the beach and it's a summer con or at least late spring con.

50
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:04,140
Speaker 1: It's in June.

51
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:11,921
Speaker 0: If anime next we're in Atlantic City last weekend I would have been there and I would have spent about a third of my time at the con and the rest just at the Beach.

52
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:15,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Atlantic City for people don't know used to be a big fucking deal now.

53
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:21,208
Speaker 1: Or you could fly easily to Vegas now It's not as much of a deal and it's sort of.

54
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:30,220
Speaker 1: a lot of the hotels and casinos are closing and it's bad times in Atlantic City, but that I guess means the Convention Center space is cheaper to rent because no one wants to be in there.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,692
Speaker 0: Now we kept thinking which means anime cons can move on in.

56
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,100
Speaker 0: There's a big Convention Center actually in a Wildwood.

57
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,571
Speaker 1: It's not as big as the Atlantic City.

58
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,880
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but big enough.

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,527
Speaker 1: We were thinking enough for a small con.

60
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,311
Speaker 1: by no by no.

61
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,380
Speaker 1: by is definitely big enough for a small con.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,343
Speaker 0: But here's the big difference.

63
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,209
Speaker 0: You need a car to get to Wildwood.

64
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,700
Speaker 0: You can take trains from New York to get to Atlantic City.

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,849
Speaker 0: That's true, uh, I think I'm gonna.

66
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,795
Speaker 0: we'll submit some panels for anime next 2016.

67
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:55,216
Speaker 0: Maybe we will.

68
00:02:55,316 --> 00:03:05,436
Speaker 0: I'm Kind of feeling this because imagine if anime Boston was the same as it was this year except every second We were bored in between like all our fun stuff.

69
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,040
Speaker 1: go to the beach.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were just laying on the beach and cosplays on the beach.

71
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, my photos on the beach that guy who was dressed up as beach episode.

72
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,519
Speaker 1: or if they're smart outdoor anime screening on the beach.

73
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:18,727
Speaker 1: If they're smart get on that.

74
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:25,130
Speaker 1: yep, so, uh, yeah, oh but and when you need to stop to eat Atlantic City eats I mean, there's still good restaurants there.

75
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,055
Speaker 1: There's still casinos there.

76
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,080
Speaker 1: casinos have restaurants.

77
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:37,220
Speaker 1: In fact, those places plenty of fucking hotels cuz that means some of them are closed, but this casinos this hotels Yeah, so I and most of the kids can't go to the casinos.

78
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,103
Speaker 1: It's not we might.

79
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:42,960
Speaker 0: we might double the number of anime cons we perform at every year starting next year.

80
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:47,216
Speaker 1: Maybe good, you know, but Otakon Vegas, I don't know what did.

81
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,300
Speaker 1: was that just as successful?

82
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,329
Speaker 1: I think the difference is that Vegas there's no beach.

83
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would.

84
00:03:51,696 --> 00:04:02,091
Speaker 0: just the desert is if If I fly to this I'll spend some time in the con like doing our panels and like walk around the dealers room once rock on the artist alley ones Maybe like see a couple of panels.

85
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,520
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I'm gonna be on the beach.

86
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,651
Speaker 0: I'll even take a couple extra days off and just stay on the beach.

87
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:06,777
Speaker 0: It's a bathing suit.

88
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,930
Speaker 0: Yeah But Vegas I would pretty much just.

89
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,336
Speaker 0: all all you do in Vegas is eat food and go to shows.

90
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:17,629
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, not that I mind that but anyway good job.

91
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,019
Speaker 0: So next I can take a train dad to Atlantic City.

92
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't take a train to Vegas.

93
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:23,709
Speaker 0: that's worth taking.

94
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,136
Speaker 1: All right, so in my news, this isn't really.

95
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,988
Speaker 1: this is sort of news I guess but today.

96
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,460
Speaker 1: well not today actually today.

97
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,106
Speaker 1: But today we're recording.

98
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,611
Speaker 0: this rim is in London.

99
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:40,755
Speaker 1: right now as you're listening to this is in London But as we're recording this is Monday, June 15th, even though this is the 17th episode.

100
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,120
Speaker 0: You've broken the illusion.

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,526
Speaker 1: I know I don't like illusions.

102
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,248
Speaker 1: I don't like lying.

103
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:55,231
Speaker 1: So on Monday, June 15th, it was is was the 30th anniversary of Studio Ghibli which is crazy because I'm older than that.

104
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,440
Speaker 1: I was three years old when they founded that studio.

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,866
Speaker 1: That's 30 years old now.

106
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty significant.

107
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,840
Speaker 0: Do you remember a time before?

108
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,420
Speaker 0: Studio Ghibli existed.

109
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,454
Speaker 1: I was three but Pepperidge Farm is much older than me.

110
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,759
Speaker 1: So it remembers.

111
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:19,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about all the animes the Studio Ghibli is made and now are they stopping or not?

112
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:26,380
Speaker 1: We don't even know But that was the you know, you could almost say like, ah, that was the life of Studio Ghibli.

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,949
Speaker 1: There's an important time since this.

114
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,899
Speaker 1: really I don't know if there's much to link to for this.

115
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:39,380
Speaker 1: I think there was on the 25th anniversary Which I guess is a more round significant number than 30. in some ways they had like a anniversary concert.

116
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,680
Speaker 1: So you can just pretend that that's the 30th anniversary concert.

117
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:49,777
Speaker 1: Nah, I think it's on YouTube maybe or something if I remember because I remember watching it once maybe a few years ago Probably five years ago.

118
00:05:50,462 --> 00:06:04,203
Speaker 0: so in other news if you think that the war on people like being afraid of comic books was one a long time ago when the Comics Code kind of disappeared and Like people are more modern and civil There's comic book.

119
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,034
Speaker 1: You clearly don't read the comic legal defense funds.

120
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:10,886
Speaker 0: We'd like to remind you that Terrible people are still out there.

121
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:11,288
Speaker 0: Yes.

122
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,420
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna explain this and they do this pretty much in a daily basis.

123
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,340
Speaker 1: Yeah basically You have extra money that you don't need.

124
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:30,096
Speaker 1: Consider giving it to the comic book legal defense fund because when someone comes to put you in jail Because you happen to have a hentai manga which oh by the way that has happened The conflict legal defense fund are the lawyers that will come and keep you out of jail.

125
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:38,138
Speaker 0: They have done this Yes, so basically this story however is extra special because of the complainant in this case All right.

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:47,509
Speaker 0: So a school the teacher for study had some required reading and because the class Was about this sort of thing.

127
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,939
Speaker 0: They had to read comic book class.

128
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:54,556
Speaker 0: I'm trying to look for the name goes Michelle assigned as reading in class before.

129
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:55,199
Speaker 1: so it was.

130
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,528
Speaker 1: They assigned the movie for watching.

131
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:02,049
Speaker 0: so it was an English class and they had to read Persepolis fun home.

132
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:04,040
Speaker 0: why the last man Sandman?

133
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,812
Speaker 1: So basically a bunch of like eyebrow comics that are mostly on my shelf.

134
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,320
Speaker 0: a student and her parents.

135
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:15,300
Speaker 1: I think all but one of those is on my shelf and the reason Sandman isn't because I read someone else's copy.

136
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:28,654
Speaker 0: Yep, so a student and her parents complained to the school and are Extremely unhappy that their child has to read pornography In her English class, I'd like to point out their child is 20.

137
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,718
Speaker 0: This is a college.

138
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:30,702
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay.

139
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,015
Speaker 1: So first of all, none of those are pornography not even close.

140
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:35,340
Speaker 0: There's a better quote.

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,932
Speaker 1: They do all contain our rated material, especially Sandman.

142
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:45,140
Speaker 0: if you can't deal with our rated material You don't deserve you should not even be in college and it's definitely a probe.

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,611
Speaker 1: All of those are definitely 100% age-appropriate highbrow and educational.

144
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:58,039
Speaker 1: those are like lit like junior senior high school appropriate I mean sure, but they're there of high literary merit and worthy of any college course.

145
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:05,928
Speaker 0: She was quote apparently aware that the specific focus of the class was graphic novels But she told the newspaper that quote.

146
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,220
Speaker 0: I expected Batman and Robin not pornography.

147
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,439
Speaker 1: Okay, first of all, have you read any fucking Batman and Robin?

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,620
Speaker 1: Because you know if you see some like DC cheesecake characters going on in there you want to see some Catwoman action.

149
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:28,778
Speaker 1: You're going to be rather upset And you don't know what pornography is because that's way more pornography than any of those things.

150
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,203
Speaker 1: now granted It's not.

151
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,090
Speaker 1: I'm saying I'm not saying Batman is pornography.

152
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,460
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's closer to it than Sandman.

153
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,126
Speaker 0: So reading between the lines here.

154
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:51,554
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure this girl and her family I'll bet she was homeschooled or something and I'm sort of like ultra-christian Probably and I think there's some helicopter mom going on probably all rolled in together Definitely.

155
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:55,364
Speaker 0: Yeah so I Don't know what else to say.

156
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,080
Speaker 0: this article speaks for itself and it would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

157
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you care about comic books at all the CVLDF is something you should pay attention to.

158
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:17,877
Speaker 1: They're pretty much at like every comic-con you ever go to and they're usually like selling sign shit that authors Donated to that they could sell for lots of money to you know, and they're also just accepting donations.

159
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:29,352
Speaker 1: So you should do that Yeah, or one day when you get arrested for having a comic book for having pornography Batman and Robin right you'll be wishing the CVLDF was there.

160
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:34,130
Speaker 1: and when they ain't because you didn't give them five bucks You know, don't complain to me.

161
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,436
Speaker 1: I told you five dollars.

162
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:40,043
Speaker 1: I told you Also, you can get like cool stickers and they have lots of cool stuff They like.

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:40,386
Speaker 1: every year.

164
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:44,049
Speaker 0: they put out freedom comics Yeah, and their logo and everything is just great to like.

165
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:44,992
Speaker 0: they're just a great.

166
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,920
Speaker 1: or they put a nice sticker on your laptop.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,252
Speaker 0: It's like look people listen to Monday gig nights.

168
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,619
Speaker 0: They're really big into the EFF.

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,198
Speaker 0: If you listen to Wednesday gig nights, these are this is your EFF, right?

170
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,155
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

171
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:04,767
Speaker 0: so, you know anime Boston doesn't have its rave dance.

172
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:08,601
Speaker 0: It's gone forever basically, and I just think that was nothing but a positive thing

173
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:09,545
Speaker 1: not a problem for me,

174
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:22,429
Speaker 0: so if anime cons specifically Continue to persist in this idea that they need to have an anime rave that they call a dance for legal reasons Why can't it at least be like this video?

175
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,537
Speaker 1: So this is our actual rave.

176
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,884
Speaker 1: I think in Japan a while ago.

177
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:32,323
Speaker 1: I don't know how long ago But 2015 electro X.

178
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:32,705
Speaker 0: I guess.

179
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:37,865
Speaker 1: I guess it was recent But there was a vine of this and also a YouTube video of it spreading around.

180
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:45,844
Speaker 1: they're playing a pretty recent you know trance hit song called ping-pong and There's a bunch of pikachu's dancing.

181
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:46,910
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

182
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,135
Speaker 0: This is what every.

183
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:55,130
Speaker 0: this is what anime con dances should look sound and feel like like actual raves and not pretend kid raves.

184
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:01,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like a lot of the kids who go to anime counter raves though Would just pee their pants if they went to an adult rave.

185
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:05,450
Speaker 1: Yeah You don't have any how many like half the people there on X or whatever.

186
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:06,294
Speaker 1: It's so crazy

187
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:25,529
Speaker 0: to me though because when we went to anime cons like in the early 2000s the dances was basically like they'd be playing sort of dancy remixes of just like anime openers and people would just be kind of Poorly dancing to them and everyone was having fun And then it increasingly smelled worse and worse and worse as the years went on.

188
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,770
Speaker 1: So this dude he made is really nothing special to this.

189
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:38,321
Speaker 1: It's not really the greatest thing of the day, but he made the bicycle from Akira, which is not Akira's bicycle It's Kaneda's bicycle Motorcycle not bicycle.

190
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:47,119
Speaker 1: Yeah He made it out of Lego which I'm sure has been done before But he did it to a greater extent than anyone has done before.

191
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,889
Speaker 1: it is more accurate more detailed more functional more music in his YouTube video.

192
00:11:54,712 --> 00:12:07,623
Speaker 1: So if the bicycle motorcycle from Akira made out of Lego and actually rolling around with remote control Interests you here is a YouTube video of the best of that You're probably gonna see.

193
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:11,510
Speaker 1: or you know I mean if someone tops this guy who even really cares at that point.

194
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,800
Speaker 0: There you go in the moment.

195
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,870
Speaker 0: The book club book is the wheel of time.

196
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:22,330
Speaker 0: We've somehow spent our whole lives having not read it a very popular and prominent nerdy book series.

197
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,379
Speaker 1: We have not read any books from it ever.

198
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,581
Speaker 1: Let's read the first one so that we can call ourselves Leonard's yep, and we're going to the talk about it when we finish it.

199
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,487
Speaker 1: nerd cred plus plus good or bad.

200
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:35,970

201
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:44,055

Speaker 0: so We're watching a pretty new anime and is from a current season.

217
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,916
Speaker 0: It's not like it's still.

218
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:07,474
Speaker 1: I found out about the show when we put together our panel for anime Boston And what do we say about it?

219
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,283
Speaker 0: We said in judge anime by its cover.

220
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:18,070
Speaker 0: We reviewed it based on one screenshot Yep, and a paragraph of text and I had a positive expectation based upon those things.

221
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:22,569
Speaker 0: So now we watched enough of it to confirm three episodes.

222
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,897
Speaker 0: I've watched more than that.

223
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,145
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm gonna watch more than that when I get home.

224
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,290
Speaker 1: That's all you need to know.

225
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,615
Speaker 0: I'm gonna watch all of it.

226
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:31,443
Speaker 0: In fact episode 12 like just went up.

227
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:32,206
Speaker 1: a good thing.

228
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,110
Speaker 1: I pay for crunchyroll.

229
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,276
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, it's on crunchyroll.

230
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:40,150
Speaker 0: by the way, I was sold on this just from the picture of the protag.

231
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:44,245
Speaker 1: Sold on this from the picture and also believe it or not, right?

232
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,470
Speaker 1: I was sold on it from the picture.

233
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:55,524
Speaker 1: I was gonna watch it at some point But it got pushed up in the queue because of all places I saw on places like boing boing Things like this getting posted outside the anime community.

234
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:56,810
Speaker 1: There was interest in this show.

235
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,310
Speaker 0: Oh some some internet people that I follow that many of you don't follow.

236
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:05,950
Speaker 0: They've been tweeting a lot of really fucked up fan art and internet about this show.

237
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:13,950
Speaker 1: So it's called or a Monogatari and we already sort of discussed the name and the opener of the show But as far as I know already is like mine or me or whatever.

238
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, Monogatari is story or a side story or you know.

239
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:26,275
Speaker 1: That's always used for like in the in the titles of things pretty often like Shin Megami something something Monogatari And it's sort of like the side story.

240
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:29,425
Speaker 1: So this is basically my story as far as I know.

241
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:34,464
Speaker 1: in my limited Japanese language knowledge I don't know why the translated title suddenly has the word love in it.

242
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:35,970
Speaker 0: The love must be implied.

243
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, we would ask Emily and bring her on the show, but she's not home.

244
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,170
Speaker 1: She's not home that so we don't know.

245
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,028
Speaker 1: But that's kind of weird.

246
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,607
Speaker 1: But I guess it's fine because if it's just my story you wouldn't have any idea what the show is about.

247
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:48,589
Speaker 1: by saying love story You know, it's a romance and you know what it is.

248
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:55,733
Speaker 0: This show is not our favorite kind of anime because our favorite kind of anime is ghost in the show, of course But it's a good.

249
00:15:55,814 --> 00:16:02,100
Speaker 0: it's a good kind of anime that we like because I mean you guys like we watched a lot of Nana Like a lot of it.

250
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,670
Speaker 0: We really like here is Greenwood.

251
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:08,329
Speaker 0: We like really kind of show Joey fun stuff, but they have to have something going on.

252
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,575
Speaker 1: Yeah Too many of them are just the typical.

253
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,738
Speaker 1: what you expect?

254
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:22,170
Speaker 1: kind of thing either their way perverted or their way fantasy Fulfillment or you know, there's something wrong with a lot of romance shows out there and mangas.

255
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty rare that you come across one.

256
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:33,694
Speaker 1: That is both a there's nothing wrong with it in terms of being horrible or scary or freaky or whatever and B it is not just Stereotypical.

257
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,130
Speaker 1: follow the usual expected plot line.

258
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,073
Speaker 1: So it's boring.

259
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:42,430
Speaker 0: and this show is that because basically to sell it to you before we even talk about what it really is about.

260
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:49,370
Speaker 0: It has a typical like these people should date but there are misunderstandings and they don't date.

261
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:54,610
Speaker 1: So it's not love Hina where they go the whole season without getting together.

262
00:16:56,191 --> 00:17:03,161
Speaker 0: Basically that plot gets resolved Immediately and then the show just keeps going.

263
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:03,562
Speaker 0: Yep.

264
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:04,325
Speaker 1: Yep.

265
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:04,486
Speaker 1: Yep.

266
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:08,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, so good Takeo is just a monster.

267
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,595
Speaker 1: He's not actually a monster But he is a huge dude like.

268
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,770
Speaker 1: he's way tall and way strong and he will fuck you up like gigantic.

269
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:22,310
Speaker 1: If he was a boxer, he would be a super heavyweight if he was only a freshman in high school.

270
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,554
Speaker 0: He was in silver spoon.

271
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,039
Speaker 0: He's bigger than those cows.

272
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,190
Speaker 1: Like he is a gigantic powerful ogre of a man Plus because anime or manga they can draw him really really big.

273
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, his best friend is this super hot boshonen guy that all the girls love.

274
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:44,134
Speaker 0: He's a cool dude, and there's this tiny adorable girl who has a crush on him Inexplicably.

275
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:44,596
Speaker 1: Yep.

276
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:48,050
Speaker 1: So cuz he saved her and now she noticed him and he's a good dude.

277
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,490
Speaker 0: So he spent his whole life having girls ignore him and go after his friend.

278
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,549
Speaker 0: His friend wants nothing to do with these vapid girls always going after him.

279
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,736
Speaker 1: But there's an interesting reason why.

280
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:04,789
Speaker 0: yeah stuff very interesting reason why and this girl also Obviously has some secrets and like there's stuff.

00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,627
Speaker 1: She's into the main character and she's legit adorable.

283
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:21,746
Speaker 1: Yep in the opener There's you know, but it's not like she's not weird and she's a little weird but not no, no But she's not weird in a sort of like, you know, lowly con kind of way.

289
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:52,030
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, there's no scary creepy stuff going on whatsoever.

290
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,182
Speaker 0: But I mean the way the show kind of goes.

291
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:58,630
Speaker 0: cuz you know in the first three episodes I'll spoil a little bit they they're dating by the end of that.

292
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:05,270
Speaker 0: So the show kind of sets you up like the the misunderstanding of he's the big guys like, oh, he's so dumb.

293
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,815
Speaker 0: There's no way she likes me.

294
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,623
Speaker 1: She obviously likes my hot be showed in friend.

295
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,750
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna cheerlead them.

296
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,757
Speaker 0: I've resigned myself to my fate as an ogre.

297
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,547
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make their relationship happen.

298
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:17,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it, right?

299
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,970
Speaker 1: So there's this fairy tale of the ogre and good anime like utana always have a fairy tale as they're backing, right?

300
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:31,988
Speaker 1: So this has the fairy tale of the red ogre in the blue ogre Which is a metaphor for the story of the show and that's a pretty good fable right there.

301
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:32,710
Speaker 1: I like that fable.

302
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:39,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it keeps coming up especially in episode 4 with the fire Have to get to episode 4 tonight.

303
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:53,377
Speaker 0: So yeah It gets to the point where like it gets just to that Bianca Tomahome like insufferable point of oh my god you tours So-dumb and then the show just kind of looks you in the eye and says no no No, that's not what the show is about.

304
00:19:54,121 --> 00:20:00,966
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell this show is about Horrible disaster happens every episode but this big dude can save the day.

305
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:01,970
Speaker 0: Yes, he's huge.

306
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:05,359
Speaker 0: He makes a project a co save in episode 4.

307
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,495
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean it's like this.

308
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:17,870
Speaker 1: it's like even though it's primarily about this romance and relationship and these characters Right because it's about this big dude they could bring in this extra action aspect, right?

309
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,776
Speaker 1: And I think that's really why the show is appealing is that it's got Sutton for everybody no matter what you are No matter what you into what you're looking for.

310
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:30,130
Speaker 1: It's in this show somewhere even though it's primarily a romance show, right?

311
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,555
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it's multi-dimensional like one thing.

312
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:35,694
Speaker 1: maybe a perverted guy who likes moe stuff and I just said this doesn't have it But it's like.

313
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,170
Speaker 1: well the girls still cute, right?

314
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,150
Speaker 1: You'll still be into her cakes and shit.

315
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,190
Speaker 0: But like you like that camaraderie kind of show after the initial setup it kind of zooms out.

316
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:46,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, the big guy has a whole bunch of other friends and they're all totally in the show.

317
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,217
Speaker 0: and the girl Yeah, she has her own set of friends.

318
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,250
Speaker 0: in the fourth episode the plots like well, I guess we're dating now.

319
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,549
Speaker 0: Alright, you should meet a bunch of my friends.

320
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,165
Speaker 1: Yep And like all these characters got all kinds of school action.

321
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:07,260
Speaker 1: if you're into school action If you're maybe the kind of girl who likes to watch free or the kind of guy who likes to watch free or whatever you Are and you like to watch free cuz there's hot guys in it.

322
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,880
Speaker 1: There's hot guys in this showing guys Showing guys way awesome.

323
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,666
Speaker 1: You could be into him.

00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:13,150
Speaker 0: I like him.

325
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,093
Speaker 0: I'll also be into.

326

Speaker 1: you could be in if you're into yaoi's you could.

327
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,550
Speaker 1: there's a bromance between the main guy and the shonen.

328
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:19,575
Speaker 1: You know, there is.

329
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,283
Speaker 1: yeah, so you could be into that too.

330
00:21:21,303 --> 00:21:22,630
Speaker 1: You could get some shipping going on.

331
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:22,951
Speaker 0: You know what?

332
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,413
Speaker 0: There isn't.

333
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,120
Speaker 0: there is not cyber brain hacking.

334
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:25,762
Speaker 0: Sure.

335
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:27,208
Speaker 1: That's the one thing the show is lacking.

336
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:27,449
Speaker 1: There's.

337
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,695
Speaker 1: no It's got a touch of coma.

338
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:38,210
Speaker 1: has baking, you know, like baking the way that you know That one piece has pirates or the way that your pedal has bicycles, right?

339
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:44,195
Speaker 1: So you could be into the baking aspect like I am like, oh, these are the other Patisserie something.

340
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:52,698
Speaker 1: so when she makes that cake Salé, yeah, right exactly You know, this show has something going on But the mainly kind of anime.

341
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,607
Speaker 0: the reason this show is getting attention.

342
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,290
Speaker 0: one is madhouse.

343
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,664
Speaker 1: So dog car is so good at making anime.

344
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:00,012
Speaker 0: Yep, you do It's just.

345
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:06,674
Speaker 0: it's a show and we say this a lot about good shows where you look at it and you think okay I see where this is getting.

346
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:11,890
Speaker 0: as soon as you say that it turns 90 degrees and you can't predict where it's going.

347
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:13,554
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean episode 2.

348
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:16,104
Speaker 1: I was like how much longer is this guy gonna be dumb?

349
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:17,188
Speaker 1: and then he stopped being dumb.

350
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,449
Speaker 1: if he would Has kept being dumb to the end of episode 3 I would have been done with the show.

351
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, but because they got together it's like well, this is a real show.

352
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,844
Speaker 0: now the way they get together I'm not even gonna spoil it is great.

353
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:38,789
Speaker 1: So good Souda, there's the because he's so big right you can add in like these amazing animations and visual He's always like the steam coming out of his nose, right?

354
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:50,142
Speaker 1: It's like they're always utilizing like, you know The character isn't in the environment to do sort of like actual like powerful animation Even though it's just you know, like the show - you know

355
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,790
Speaker 0: what it reminds me of a lot actually is here is Greenwood

356
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:57,526
Speaker 1: A little bit like the comedy plus the something for everyone plus the romance.

357
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:03,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus the school Yeah, and the like zoomed out cast of characters cast of morons.

358
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,390
Speaker 0: You gotta have the cast of morons.

359
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,170
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean or is that sir has that to the extreme?

360
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,582
Speaker 1: And I definitely think it is the same genre as the here's as the here's Greenwood and there aren't often things in that very specific Category.

361
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:19,944
