1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,889
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 27th 2016.

2
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:18,220
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight timepieces.

3
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,457
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:28,717
Speaker 0: You know we haven't really complained about the weather in a while because they got to the point where we don't.

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:37,000
Speaker 0: we complain about the weather every day because we see in summer we're usually like oh, it's great and We're biking to work or at least biking around in the winter.

6
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:43,805
Speaker 0: And there's that middle area where it's too cold to bike even though it's still bike season And then we veg about it.

7
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,557
Speaker 0: I gotta tell you today is the shittiest day.

8
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:49,224
Speaker 0: We've had yet It's not snowing.

9
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd rather it be snowing though.

10
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,280
Speaker 0: This is just like that rainy miserable.

11
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:56,920
Speaker 0: I do not like rain because rain means I can't bike.

12
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, thunderstorms good.

13
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:00,068
Speaker 0: summer thunderstorm is good.

14
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,111
Speaker 0: winter thunderstorm is good.

15
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,976
Speaker 0: fall thunderstorm is just miserable.

16
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:04,700
Speaker 0: spring thunderstorm is also miserable.

17
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,640
Speaker 1: Stay inside.

18
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:09,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it's good that her raining is fun.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,240
Speaker 0: I guess it's good that I want to go outside, but I guess just the weather.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,900
Speaker 1: I don't want to go outside when it's 50 degrees out.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,494
Speaker 1: I want it to be 90 degrees and degrees is fine if it's not raining.

22
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:19,197
Speaker 0: That's bike weather.

23
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:21,086
Speaker 0: It's really cold You're I don't know.

24
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:23,320
Speaker 0: What's how you've gotten so old so quickly.

25
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:24,983
Speaker 1: It's really cold.

26
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:26,187
Speaker 0: Okay.

27
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,571
Speaker 1: Hey your head and see how cold you are.

28
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,120
Speaker 0: so now I'm here for a reason.

29
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,720
Speaker 0: So uh because I was in Australia.

30
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:35,709
Speaker 1: This is now I think someplace where it's warm now.

31
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:40,550
Speaker 0: actually it was spring it was getting warm But it was 87 one day.

32
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,620
Speaker 0: so we went swimming and you know what I mean.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,220
Speaker 1: But the thing is during that period when you were in Australia It was there was an unusually warm period in New York for a few days.

34
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,960
Speaker 0: I know I'm a little bit salty about that.

35
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:55,271
Speaker 0: Oh, it's kind of like remember we went to the first pack sauce And it was kind of cold and rainy the whole time.

36
00:01:55,411 --> 00:02:02,715
Speaker 0: there was one warm day like when the first day We're like wow Melvin's pretty great even in the kind of endo winter and then the next day.

37
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:09,679
Speaker 0: It was like no fuck you Remember that last day of packs like everyone every attendee was huddled around those heaters.

38
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:15,459
Speaker 1: yeah, like standing like trying to play games on top of me, but I mean we were close to Antarctica than we've ever been ever.

39
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:25,480
Speaker 1: and You think no matter what time of year it is it should be cold When you're that close to Antarctica, but no surprisingly warm considering it was winter there, and we were close to Antarctica.

40
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:32,692
Speaker 1: So like it's early spring it makes me wonder like if I go to the place in Antarctica That's closest to like the south of Australia.

41
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,960
Speaker 1: Is that like a warmish, Antarctica?

42
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:41,144
Speaker 1: Is it like only probably slightly below freezing there and not the negative a zillion, and I guess think of it this way we were.

43
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:46,509
Speaker 0: you know we're standing by Bondi Beach and Think about how cold the water is in.

44
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,620
Speaker 0: like Wildwood in the middle of summer.

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,609
Speaker 0: It's still like a shock when you get into it.

46
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,720
Speaker 0: You kind of just like err and deal with it.

47
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,905
Speaker 1: It's not actually see.

48
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,880
Speaker 1: that thing is that water isn't actually that cold if you put a thermometer in it.

49
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:05,688
Speaker 1: It's just that you're so hot you feel it relatively In the warm water it feels like it's burning.

50
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,960
Speaker 0: so actually no I had so until a couple years ago.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,944
Speaker 0: I never thought to do this.

52
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:18,159
Speaker 0: like we just pick around like we go to Wildwood randomly and just go swimming Randomly, and I wouldn't even know like if the water is gonna be good or whatever till we got in it.

53
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:24,619
Speaker 0: but I started actually looking at charts and knowing how warm water is gonna be and Realize that number didn't mean anything to me.

54
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:31,617
Speaker 0: And then I did a bunch of more reading to figure out what temperatures of beach water feel good or bad And like what the lines are.

55
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:39,422
Speaker 0: now I kind of know and I'll say this the water in New Jersey in early summer is cold as Fuck.

56
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,411
Speaker 0: it is colder than the spring.

57
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,460
Speaker 0: the early spring not colder than space.

58
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,693
Speaker 0: It's colder than the early spring water in Sydney.

59
00:03:48,753 --> 00:04:02,559
Speaker 0: early spring water in Sydney was like Warmer than you would expect New Jersey water except at the very end of summer, so it was good times, but the thing I did while we were there is once again, I rented a car and drove around a whole bunch.

60
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:18,776
Speaker 0: and because I don't drive that often in the US anymore and Actually a lot of the times I've driven long distances in the last couple years have been in Australia It didn't feel as weird as it's felt in the past.

61
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,826
Speaker 0: in fact It felt kind of normal.

62
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,599
Speaker 0: and the only thing I couldn't do is parallel park.

63
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,715
Speaker 0: I don't know if I could I might have been able to but why even try?

64
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:37,710
Speaker 0: yeah We were in this little town, and we you know we're driving in and Emily's like wow You just drove like it was nothing and I was like yeah I'm getting used to it though she was startled by.

65
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:47,304
Speaker 0: she'd never encountered one of those European style roundabouts before And she was doing the thing that you were doing when we remember we drove down to Phillip Island where I was like Yell.

66
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:56,240
Speaker 0: if it looks like I'm going into the wrong lane Or if a car's coming or something you know in case I miss something like I start to turn the wrong way on the freeway So that's all working fine.

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:05,744
Speaker 0: but then we come to this roundabout and I just turned left into it, and there's a car fucking coming from like this other way because it's a roundabout and Emily's like And I'm just like.

68
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,912
Speaker 0: you've never been to a roundabout before have you mm-hmm?

69
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:25,960
Speaker 0: so uh but anyway after having done this When I came back to the States, and I was walking in New York the next day I Kind of looked at the street And I saw cars and it looked super fucking weird to have the drivers on the left side.

70
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:30,275
Speaker 0: My brain just had locked driving in as be on the wrong side.

71
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:44,638
Speaker 0: because I think Every time I've driven so much in Australia lately like over the last couple years and whenever I'm driving in Australia I'm doing the Seinfeld thing of thinking don't die don't die and concentrating really hard the entire time I think I messed my brain up.

72
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:50,310
Speaker 0: So I think I want to make sure a few weeks go by before I drive again in the US or I might just go the wrong way.

73
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:53,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's up?

74
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,940
Speaker 0: What's up in Scotland?

75
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,988
Speaker 0: Yesterday I went to oh yeah, we ate your bread.

76
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:58,469
Speaker 0: It was really good.

77
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,971
Speaker 1: Okay.

78
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,660
Speaker 1: It was that bread was over proofed and flat.

79
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what though it had a real good crust.

80
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:12,759
Speaker 1: yeah, well anyway, so Yesterday they had a city bike communities planning meeting.

81
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,565
Speaker 0: oh Did you go to?

82
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:14,706
Speaker 0: it?

83
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,978
Speaker 0: was that like community board like you're?

84
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:27,190
Speaker 1: no It wasn't a community board meeting right it was a meeting for our community board Area which I'm not sure if you're in or not.

85
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:33,160
Speaker 1: if you are you're on like the very southern edge of it Which is community board one don't think we are I'm sure either in one or two.

86
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,911
Speaker 0: I'm in one think I'm in two.

87
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:40,780
Speaker 1: I'm gonna double check anyway But it was at the beer garden, which is like two minutes from my house by walking.

88
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:49,399
Speaker 1: So I go to the beer garden and the way it worked was you waited and they had a bunch of tables and they put you at a table with some random people.

89
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:57,046
Speaker 1: and then you're looking at basically the New York City bike map and They give you the city bike presentation Which is like 20 minutes.

90
00:06:57,066 --> 00:07:08,427
Speaker 1: this guy talking to you and like with a book and he's the city bike employee And there's also a Department of Transportation employee And you listen to him tell you all about city bike and he talks about it Like you never heard of it before because

91
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,573
Speaker 0: I saw on Gothamist.

92
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:10,900
Speaker 0: They were like a story is getting it.

93
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,492
Speaker 1: Here's the map right and then they go.

94
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:14,114
Speaker 1: Okay.

95
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:15,340
Speaker 1: Now we're gonna do the exercise.

96
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,846
Speaker 0: Oh, look it literally I'm in one.

97
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,034
Speaker 0: it ends at Queensborough Plaza.

98
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:20,440
Speaker 1: So you could have come anyway could have come.

99
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,329
Speaker 0: I always thought I was into.

100
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:31,743
Speaker 1: I'm glad I know this now the same one I am anyway, so you then they flip over the other map and the other map has like this, you know outline around the Community board zone.

101
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:35,354
Speaker 1: they're like city bikes only going in this inside here end of story.

102
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:41,523
Speaker 1: and then they're like city bike has to go either on public property Property that has to.

103
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,973
Speaker 1: it has to be somewhere that's accessible 24/7.

104
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,760
Speaker 1: We can't put it in like a park that closes.

105
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:51,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and it could even be on private property, you know, as long as the person who owns it is chill.

106
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:52,459
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that, right?

107
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:00,876
Speaker 1: Yeah And then on the map there's a grid and they're like there's gonna be one dock Per square on the grid and they were like figure out where the dots you go.

108
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:14,900
Speaker 1: in the square There's little symbols that are either squares or triangles and a square means like it's gonna be on The road and a triangle means on the sidewalk or something like that of like the possible locations for a dock in that square Huh?

109
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:28,219
Speaker 1: and if you like one of the locations you put a little green thingy and if you don't like one of the locations you put a red thingy and then you have a piece of paper and you write down like the code for the spot you picked and Then an explanation like don't put it there.

110
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:37,318
Speaker 1: That's in the middle of a crazy seven-way intersection and people won't be able to get to the bike and if they do they'll just die Like I'm afraid to even walk over to where you'd put that little symbol.

111
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:41,460
Speaker 1: And then the other and then you put one in somewhere else and you're like put it here.

112
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:53,079
Speaker 1: That's a piece of road that no one drives on and you could totally just close it and cars wouldn't even know Because they don't drive there and you spend like 20 minutes putting little flaggies on the map, but then you go home.

113
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:54,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I saw the like.

114
00:08:54,928 --> 00:09:00,873
Speaker 0: I was reading the Gothamist article and they were just talking about how Everyone's really excited about the city bike and pretty much everyone.

115
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:04,539
Speaker 1: everyone who I sat with at my little table It's like six people I guess per table.

116
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:07,680
Speaker 1: Everyone I sat with was a pro bike person.

117
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,704
Speaker 0: The thing is what happened?

118
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:12,980
Speaker 1: there was not any no old people who were like and cars were there.

119
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,020
Speaker 0: They'll be at the community board meeting complaining as soon as they start seeing those city bike docks appear.

120
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:23,879
Speaker 1: They had their chance to come and put red flags like the city bike people and the dot people were like.

121
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,865
Speaker 1: Yay, look at all these green flags.

122
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,410
Speaker 1: Everyone's putting on all these things.

123
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:28,775
Speaker 1: It's like no red flags anywhere.

124
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:29,999
Speaker 1: We know it's like.

125
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,610
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, I guess yeah, that makes sense, right?

126
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,400
Speaker 1: Someone who's you know, pro city bike is gonna be going.

127
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,605
Speaker 1: Oh, you should put one here.

128
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,843
Speaker 1: You should put one there and someone who's all cars gonna be like don't put it here Don't you know?

129
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:42,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll put it here.

130
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,092
Speaker 1: That's in front of my apartment.

131
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:48,116
Speaker 1: I mean that video I saw was this old man They're not gonna be like, oh, yes, you should put one here.

132
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:53,420
Speaker 0: He was Screaming at the community board person like standing up just screaming.

133
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,099
Speaker 0: You could see spit flying out about how dangerous bikes are and how they shouldn't allow them in the city.

134
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:05,305
Speaker 1: Sure, cuz you know bikes kill so many people and Nobody Never been hit by car.

135
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:09,100
Speaker 0: the people who get hit by cars might actually die on their bike.

136
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,335
Speaker 0: So maybe it's the bikes fault.

137
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:16,200
Speaker 1: See the thing is in New York if you kill someone with a car you totally get away with it pretty much.

138
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,632
Speaker 1: So we should find those people who are in the cars.

139
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,860
Speaker 1: Yes, they're anti-bike and pro car.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,606
Speaker 1: We should just get a car and run them over.

141
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,935
Speaker 0: It should be easy because they have not illegal.

142
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:28,025
Speaker 1: They're so afraid It's not illegal.

143
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:28,952
Speaker 1: Nothing happens to you.

144
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:32,171
Speaker 1: If you hit someone with a car It's totally legal.

145
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,020
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned.

146
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,320
Speaker 0: They're so afraid of bikes because they think they'll get hit by and they must be bad at walking.

147
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,780
Speaker 0: It'd probably be real easy to have plausible deniability just to run them down.

148
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:44,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like oh he came out from between those two parked cars that I wouldn't be parking there.

149
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,478
Speaker 1: I would have seen him if it was a city bike dock.

150
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,428
Speaker 1: there You can see anyone standing next to one of those.

151
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:55,682
Speaker 1: but ah geeks not coming out from between two cars I mean, he's hiding big planning public murders since 2005.

152
00:10:55,682 --> 00:11:01,967
Speaker 1: I'm just saying if there's someone you don't like wait for them to take a trip to New York and then run them over You will probably get away with it.

153
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,239
Speaker 0: I'm gonna absolutely get us unless you're black.

154
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,724
Speaker 1: Well, not white.

155
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,490
Speaker 1: you can also another color.

156
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,800
Speaker 1: but the other thing is the police will investigate it.

157
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,314
Speaker 1: So if they see like, huh?

158
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,780
Speaker 1: This person who was hit is Scott and they have a strong connection to this person who hit them named rim.

159
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, what had?

160
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:24,149
Speaker 1: this doesn't seem like just a car ax.

161
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:28,020
Speaker 0: what's this radio show where they're talking about murdering people with cars?

162
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:31,187
Speaker 1: Right, they'll actually look into it.

163
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:36,900
Speaker 1: if it's like, you know someone you're related to which is why you need it marks But it looks like he was accelerating not breaking.

164
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,317
Speaker 1: Yeah You need like the.

165
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 1: you know The the hitman with no relation to the victim.

166
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:45,360
Speaker 0: What city would be more perfect for strangers on a train?

167
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,505
Speaker 0: You you set it up to where you see another biker on the train and you pass each other notes of who to run over With your bikes.

168
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,652
Speaker 1: you need a car person to do the murdering.

169
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:54,973
Speaker 0: No.

170
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess none of us have cars.

171
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,188
Speaker 1: You know what, you know we could do zip car.

172
00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:03,125
Speaker 1: No, we set up a Car share.

173
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,158
Speaker 1: know the uber of murder.

174
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:13,740
Speaker 1: Hire a literal uber and the uber guy gets a notice and either it's to bring someone somewhere deliver some food or run someone over.

175
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,527
Speaker 0: It's funny because it's uber.

176
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,419
Speaker 0: it's uber but for murder, but it's also literally uber.

177
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:24,094
Speaker 1: You go on your app you go to uber and you say this person lives around here.

178
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:24,777
Speaker 1: Here's a picture.

179
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:25,660
Speaker 1: hit them if you can.

180
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:30,277
Speaker 1: You'll get paid X dollars, you know escrow with the uber app.

181
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:34,617
Speaker 1: Yep So prove to me they're dead when I see the notice of.

182
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,524
Speaker 1: you know They're dead.

183
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:36,452
Speaker 1: then you'll get the money.

184
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:37,320
Speaker 0: in actual news.

185
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,772
Speaker 0: We do have to mourn something and this isn't technology.

186
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:43,708
Speaker 0: while it uses technology It is just a service as they think you can use.

187
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:51,380
Speaker 0: but if you live under a rock you might not realize that vine is Dying Twitter is dying and vine is the first piece of the Twitter that got killed.

188
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,999
Speaker 0: The thing is if Twitter made them no money Twitter has so many users and there's nothing else like it.

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,944
Speaker 0: You can't.

190
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:02,180
Speaker 0: it'd be really hard to make something like it unless you just made it exactly.

191
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:03,226
Speaker 1: I have an idea.

192
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:03,287
Speaker 1: if

193
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:04,816
Speaker 0: it gets low and I'll

194
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 1: tell you after the show

195
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,286
Speaker 0: Yeah If it gets low enough

196
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,094
Speaker 1: to kill the whole show if I talk about it

197
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:17,080
Speaker 0: if it gets low enough It would be entirely possible for some rich people to just buy it and run it at breakeven forever.

198
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,015
Speaker 1: You know if it gets low enough remember those guys who are running the meridian 59.

199
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,987
Speaker 0: Yeah The users all buy it.

200
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:24,670
Speaker 0: make it a co-op.

201
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,995
Speaker 1: we could do something like that's.

202
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:27,240
Speaker 0: I've been thinking about that a lot.

203
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:28,566
Speaker 1: I got a better idea.

204
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll save it for after the show.

205
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,600
Speaker 0: do a show on it on Monday.

206
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,252
Speaker 1: There's no reason to do a show on it.

207
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:33,917
Speaker 0: I don't know.

208
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:38,400
Speaker 0: people see We just did a short show on uber for murder, but it's uber.

209
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,891
Speaker 1: So I think that's all there was to say about that.

210
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,720
Speaker 0: but vine is dead.

211
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,094
Speaker 0: The moral is social networks can die kids.

212
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:55,830
Speaker 0: a lot of you're too young to remember palace Chad or aim or ICQ or all these things that are dead just because.

213
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,994
Speaker 1: well, there was there was.

214
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,900
Speaker 1: see the thing is people remember myspace.

215
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,354
Speaker 1: That's like the old one that you know died right the first one that got killed.

216
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:08,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you think oh why nobody Remembers the sort of in-between ones.

217
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:18,840
Speaker 1: the things of like the friend stir all the stirs how you Named company and the or cut and there was like a bunch of other ones that I don't remember because no one remembers them.

218
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,926
Speaker 1: I just remember they existed.

219
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:20,208
Speaker 1: there was a.

220
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:26,580
Speaker 0: but also it's real different because back then Not many people use social networks like not many people used internet.

221
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:38,320
Speaker 1: It's because in though the reason that all of those didn't work out is because people didn't have smartphones at that time Yep, but even then to the people who use like myspace like Twitter like that here without smartphones is just like what is it?

222
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,763
Speaker 1: It's nothing.

223
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,680
Speaker 0: Yep, you were they were technically savvy.

224
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: So if a network was shutting down they could move their shit and just kind of deal with it.

225
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,962
Speaker 0: It would suck.

226
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:48,451
Speaker 0: but like up myspace is dead live journals dead.

227
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,604
Speaker 0: I better move my shit somewhere, but now Everybody uses stuff.

228
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:56,616
Speaker 0: So like people who have made basically careers putting stuff on vine.

229
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:57,759
Speaker 0: I fucked.

230
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,607
Speaker 1: well They're gonna let you download your vines.

231
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:03,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you those people to have a way They're not just turning it off right away.

232
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,540
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, I guess you can download them all upload them YouTube.

233
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:12,580
Speaker 1: The thing is is people are like they try to sell things and if they can't sell them they shut them down.

234
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,723
Speaker 1: It's like dude like You could.

235
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:18,695
Speaker 1: just why not just open source or you can find someone in the community who will.

236
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:20,742
Speaker 0: I have been on the other side Of that.

237
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:22,490
Speaker 1: we'll just take it for free and run it.

238
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:24,480
Speaker 0: I have been on the other side of that.

239
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:27,966
Speaker 1: Give it away or sell it for like.

240
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:31,014
Speaker 0: I can't talk about the details of this.

241
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:36,800
Speaker 1: if you sell it for more than zero dollars No, like even one dollar you would be more than zero dollar.

242
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:37,202
Speaker 1: Nope

243
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:43,595
Speaker 0: the legal due diligence alone cost so much more than you expect that Open source and something can cost a lot more than just not

244
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:46,588
Speaker 1: even just open source Just like give it someone giving

245
00:15:46,628 --> 00:16:00,580
Speaker 0: it away even because if there is any Code or any art of any type that is licensed in any particular way Lawyers have to make sure that those are all transferable and reassignable and that costs a lot of money.

246
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,699
Speaker 1: It's just like make a trust to hold it.

247
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:05,519
Speaker 0: Even then you might not be able to transfer to that trust.

248
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:16,860
Speaker 0: It gets real complicated in a hurry and also if you're shutting it down You might be a dick and not want anyone else to get a competitive advantage based on all the hard work and money you lost.

249
00:16:17,342 --> 00:16:19,953
Speaker 0: That's usually not the real reason but I've heard that Express before.

250
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:23,506
Speaker 0: that's like I Tried real hard.

251
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,715
Speaker 1: I wrote this book and I don't want anyone that didn't sell.

252
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,080
Speaker 1: well, and I don't want anything to read it.

253
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,187
Speaker 1: I'm gonna burn every copy.

254
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:33,219
Speaker 0: Here's the example I can probably talk about because it's been so long.

255
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:41,940
Speaker 0: Cuz you know, I used to work at IBM and while I was not on like the legal side or the business side or anything like that We used OS 2 in my department.

256
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,960
Speaker 0: So I actually had like installers for continued releases of OS 2 after it was dead to the public.

257
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:53,699
Speaker 1: So there was some employee there who is still working on OS 2 as late as the 2000s like I was patching it.

258
00:16:54,221 --> 00:17:05,297
Speaker 0: I was someone who knew how to wrote write code and knew their way around the OS 2 code my Parting gift and could patch it the parting gift My department gave to me when I quit IBM and moved on to other things in like 2000.

259
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:05,880
Speaker 0: When did I quit?

260
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,663
Speaker 0: 2007.

261
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:08,346
Speaker 1: it was late 2000.

262
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:18,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, then they gave me the last Installer of the last build of OS 2 which had come out that year and they were that was the last one.

263
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, they actually were ending it.

264
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:23,541
Speaker 1: So the people who had wrote the patch for that Quit.

265
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:28,420
Speaker 0: so I have the install discs for the most up-to-date OS 2 you can get.

266
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:29,935
Speaker 1: What does it run on x86?

267
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:31,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

268
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:32,848
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of CDs.

269
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,120
Speaker 1: It has to run on a. I mean It.

270
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,252
Speaker 1: can it run on a modern PC that has EFI?

271
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,620
Speaker 0: you probably not.

272
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,366
Speaker 0: You'd have to do some stuff.

273
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:43,058
Speaker 1: You need a motherboard with a BIOS and like what?

274
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,744
Speaker 1: What does it even support?

275
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,171
Speaker 1: like what hardware do you need to run it?

276
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:48,220
Speaker 0: virtual box or DOS box?

277
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,793
Speaker 1: I guess you can run in virtual box.

278
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,419
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

279
00:17:50,660 --> 00:18:02,533
Speaker 0: but so I as much as I could actually campaigned and like got meetings with people even though I was just like a lowly dude and Like this department that I was in department like 68 DD.

280
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,480
Speaker 0: They don't even number departments that way anymore.

281
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:14,926
Speaker 0: but I advocated as much as I could at every level had access to for them to open source it or give it away like how you Weren't you were working in like a factory?

282
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:19,020
Speaker 1: What connection did you have to like the oh the oh the operating system writing?

283
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,747
Speaker 1: development group one.

284
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:36,892
Speaker 0: it's companies that are that big have formal protocols for everything you can imagine like if you have a if you have a grievance with the way the CEOs run in things there is a Byzantine process by which your grievance can get to that person's desk And I followed every one of the cuz.

285
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:37,999
Speaker 0: I had nothing to do like I was.

286
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,989
Speaker 1: So you read the employee handbook I did like.

287
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,898
Speaker 0: I went through everything I could do the one with the literal eyeball literal bumblebee.

288
00:18:50,564 --> 00:19:01,737
Speaker 0: The answers I got back basically came down to the Licensing of some of the libraries and some of the stuff and people who like companies that co-wrote code together.

289
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,964
Speaker 0: it would be Literally impossible.

290
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:05,768
Speaker 1: you have the CD.

291
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,897
Speaker 1: So why don't we just put I don't have the source code.

292
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:08,480
Speaker 0: I have the install.

293
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,983
Speaker 0: That's fine.

294
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:12,059
Speaker 1: We can just at least put it on bit torrent and no one would know where it came from.

295
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:18,019
Speaker 0: Let me wait long enough until this podcast episode has fallen into distant memory because I really don't want to get sued by IBM.

296
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:19,737
Speaker 1: How would they know it was you?

297
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:30,333
Speaker 1: Well, I know for a fact that some my old co-workers listen to the show Right, but I mean it would just be like oh on Pirate Bay you can get OS - where did that come from?

298
00:19:30,354 --> 00:19:31,580
Speaker 1: In fact, they come from anywhere.

299
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:36,399
Speaker 0: Oh except and then what believe me the people in that apartment probably still have that OS - running somewhere.

300
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:38,563
Speaker 0: Someone can't?

301
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,226
Speaker 0: someone?

302
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,660
Speaker 0: there are attendees of Connecticut who are children of people I worked with who come to Connecticut.

303
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:46,074
Speaker 1: We should try to get it running in a virtual box and stream that and sure.

304
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually that could be.

305
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,758
Speaker 0: That gives me an idea for some patreon content.

306
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,720
Speaker 1: Let's just play with OS - wow this thing sucks you can't do anything.

307
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, what apps what software can this?

308
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,915
Speaker 1: is there even for this?

309
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:58,698
Speaker 0: actually Scott?

310
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,768
Speaker 0: That's a whole idea for a YouTube channel.

311
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,275
Speaker 0: You just run old computers.

312
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:03,280
Speaker 0: There's a whole stream.

313
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,629
Speaker 1: It's just a big guy does that?

314
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the whole stream would be Can we actually entertain ourselves with this?

315
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,416
Speaker 0: Like we're not gonna explore how it works.

316
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,420
Speaker 1: You can entertain yourself.

317
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,971
Speaker 1: We can entertain yourselves for weeks of my apple 2gs.

318
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:18,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, the magic plus would be harder We would because I don't have enough equipment to make it go.

319
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:22,199
Speaker 0: god I used to entertain myself just by watching like Encarta encyclopedia videos.

320
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:24,166
Speaker 0: There were two seconds long.

321
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,640
Speaker 1: Encarta tiny is like you had a 640 by 480 screen and that was high-res.

322
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:42,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in a little box on that screen We're talking like 64 by 48 right with Encarta on the CD It's by four was like a 10 second clip at best from Star Wars and that was great.

323
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:47,600
Speaker 0: Yep So, uh in remembrance of vine, I'm just gonna link to this.

324
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,914
Speaker 1: It's a verge article that has basically a managed to an animated gif on a CD.

325
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:55,825
Speaker 1: Rob that took five minutes to load But an audio.

326
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:58,477
Speaker 0: this is just in memoriam to vine because I miss it.

327
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:07,820
Speaker 0: and My secondary thing of the day is my favorite vine of all time ever Hands-down the best vine ever in my opinion and that is my thing of the day.

328
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:16,960
Speaker 0: And I'm just saying that now because now it's time for Things of the day.

329
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,809
Speaker 1: How about that?

330
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:19,816
Speaker 0: So yeah, I worked out.

331
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:22,429
Speaker 1: you ever shred some paper and a paper shredder.

332
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:29,673
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah In fact, I brought a paper shredder to our IT and then I threw it away because I never needed it for anything And it was stupid.

333
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:33,090
Speaker 1: I actually have a file cabinet where I put all my important papers.

334
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, and but the thing is it got full and then I looked in there and I realized a lot of those papers not so important.

335
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:45,390
Speaker 0: You know the last time I thought to do that and some of them that are important I could just scan and get rid of row most of my papers away as I get him cuz I just don't give a fuck anymore.

336
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:54,570
Speaker 1: But I get no papers anymore, I'm like 99.9% of papers, I don't like I get no mail I just do everything digitally, but I went in there and I was like, is there anything in here?

337
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,214
Speaker 0: I can throw away.

338
00:21:55,234 --> 00:22:01,823
Speaker 0: and it was all like titles to cars I'd owned in the past and like my birth certificate.

339
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:04,250
Speaker 0: You all you need that my originals just in there.

340
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:07,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, so I got a shredder at Amazon.

341
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:08,099
Speaker 1: I started shredding stuff.

342
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,570
Speaker 1: and the way a shredder works You know it turns the paper the little bits if you get a bullshit one real old.

343
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,430
Speaker 0: Did you get the ones that get a strip shredder or a cross shredder, right?

344
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:16,950
Speaker 1: You know anyway.

345
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:27,657
Speaker 1: But the point is it has all these basically like metal discs that are really close to each other and have weird shapes on them and are really sharp and The paper gets caught in between them.

346
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,729
Speaker 1: and they're also like sort of like, you know at angles to each other.

347
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,810
Speaker 1: So a piece of paper gets caught in there and it can't escape.

348
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,485
Speaker 1: It just gets pulled through by the clever shape and the motor is strong enough.

349
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:45,130
Speaker 1: that paper is not escaping It's going through but it's also getting cut as it goes through and a bunch of bits come out and it's like, oh, alright.

350
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,849
Speaker 1: So what if you took that same idea of a shredder and you just went big?

351
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:59,570
Speaker 1: real big Way big and you just made those metal discs eat out of bigger metal and harder metal?

352
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:02,861
Speaker 1: You could shred just about anything and yes.

353
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,663
Speaker 1: Yes, you can.

354
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:05,590
Speaker 1: here is a shredder so big?

355
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,230
Speaker 1: They just put a car in it and the car gets shredded.

356
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:09,275
Speaker 0: I like how they put the.

357
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:12,650
Speaker 1: you might be thinking like, uh, you know a car being shredded, right?

358
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,010
Speaker 1: It's like the body of the car is like this really weak-ass metal.

359
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,565
Speaker 1: It's kind of thin, you know, once the engine block gets in there, it's gonna like get jammed.

360
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:23,432
Speaker 1: It's like no Like.

361
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,556
Speaker 0: I put it in feet first.

362
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:27,345
Speaker 0: So eventually the engine is like pushed out the front and then eaten.

363
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:35,030
Speaker 1: Yep spoilers It's you mean you don't need to knowing what happens does not ruin seeing it happen.

364
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:37,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no twist at the end the car doesn't just come out.

365
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:39,275
Speaker 0: I guess you're a reverse it.

366
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:40,941
Speaker 0: it would look like an awesome nanotech machine.

367
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,821
Speaker 1: that makes it actually be surprisingly bad at shredding paper Because a piece of paper would probably just make it through unscathed.

368
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,750
Speaker 1: Yep, or just slightly pressed.

369
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,256
Speaker 0: There's an extreme sport.

370
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:52,249
Speaker 0: you have two people and you dance on top of one of these things.

371
00:23:53,232 --> 00:24:00,990
Speaker 1: You have two people fight on top fight on top of this thing Two people get up on it you turn it on and they fight and if anyone survives they win.

372
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:17,289
Speaker 0: So My actual thing of the day because a vine is not enough to be a thing of the day is Just this little video and you might recognize our friend Neil Cisarega in it And it's just really short and cute and Scott and I both found it independently and watch it a while ago and laughed at it.

373
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,821
Speaker 0: It's titled simply friend or foe.

374
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:31,155
Speaker 0: I Got this But anyway in the meta moment the book club book is Rebecca I'm gonna read it real soon.

375
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,887
Speaker 0: I'm almost done with that shattered sword book about the Battle of Midway.

376
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:34,329
Speaker 0: That's good.

377
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,190
Speaker 1: I guess I will continue reading it tonight because I only read like a few chapters and then stuff.

378
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:47,844
Speaker 0: So remember I was talking yesterday about the last show we did about private Amari in Tony's number four Plane and we kept forgetting about him.

379
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:51,255
Speaker 0: So You responded to this.

380
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:52,439
Speaker 1: I talked about this at length.

381
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:59,866
Speaker 1: I don't know the words you just said were basically just Who flew the the scouting plane out?

382
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:04,563
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the what you just said did not bring that to mind.

383
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:15,613
Speaker 0: so I'm further in the book and there's a point where like the battles way progressed and like way later on and like I have to carriers are sunk and all this nonsense is going on and The author is like.

384
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,518
Speaker 0: so, you know cruiser whatever.

385
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,282
Speaker 0: Tony was instructed to send out its scouts to try to whatever Tony number four took off.

386
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:28,209
Speaker 0: and then parentheses It's like presumably still with our hapless private Atari.

387
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:32,963
Speaker 0: So I still don't know if he survived but I'm pretty sure he did.

388
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:34,450
Speaker 0: I really want to find out.

389
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:36,919
Speaker 1: Oh, you think he got back fueled and took off again?

390
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,364
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're not sure.

391
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:39,950
Speaker 1: but the plane the same.

392
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:40,755
Speaker 0: He went out again.

393
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,870
Speaker 1: the same plane went out again, but they don't know who took off.

394
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,626
Speaker 1: Yeah in it the second time, but he got back.

395
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:48,689
Speaker 1: Yep So he got back and the plane fueled and re and took off again.

396
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:51,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, he may not have been the pilot on the second launch.

397
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:57,050
Speaker 0: apparently He fucked up a bunch again on the second flight too, so he might not have been that good.

398
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:00,890
Speaker 1: So, I mean whoever was on the second flight possibly not him fucked up.

399
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,745
Speaker 0: So maybe the plane wasn't him or someone else gave a report back.

400
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:08,310
Speaker 0: They were like, yeah I cited five American cruisers and five American aircraft carriers.

401
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:11,130
Speaker 0: I point out there were not five American aircraft carriers in that ocean.

402
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,196
Speaker 1: we're that five American have cares in the world.

403
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:22,080
Speaker 0: at that time if you count the one that was sinking but hadn't sunk yet and The one that was in Europe at the time I didn't know that any of them had ever sunk ever.

404
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:24,530
Speaker 0: We lost a bunch of aircraft carriers.

405
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,535
Speaker 0: All right.

406
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:28,350
Speaker 0: Do you know how much you know about World War two in the Pacific?

407
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,473
Speaker 1: There were boat wars.

408
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:31,476
Speaker 0: We won.

409
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,142
Speaker 0: Rough history.

410
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:35,510
Speaker 0: Can you name any battles from the Pacific war?

411
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:36,695
Speaker 1: Midway.

412
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:37,140
Speaker 0: All right.

413
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,030
Speaker 0: That's the one I'm talking about.

414
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,981
Speaker 0: Yorktown got fucked up in that battle and so did the entire Carrier task force of the Japanese Kido Butai.

415
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:45,644
Speaker 0: Okay.

416
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:46,990
Speaker 0: Those are the people who attack Pearl Harbor.

417
00:26:48,429 --> 00:27:08,364
Speaker 1: I Mean as far as wars go, you know, I've always considered the details of individual battles to be material only need or Worth knowing for war nerds and military fanboys who are basically the same thing, but Scott I'm not a war nerd.

418
00:27:08,605 --> 00:27:10,748
Speaker 1: I am in fact anti-war nerd.

419
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:11,994
Speaker 0: I guess there's some.

420
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:26,310
Speaker 0: there's some utility in my mind to the broad strokes of history and understanding what happened and occasionally zooming very far in to wars and non-wars just to get a sense of the actual complexity of real life in different areas in history.

421
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,050
Speaker 1: Like that material is best used for making excellent movies.

422
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:35,023
Speaker 0: I think you can make a really for example any comic book about.

423
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:40,145
Speaker 1: well, they're like they're like 20 movies I just thought of that are pretty much just zoom in on war.

424
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:43,259
Speaker 1: Yeah Does boot does boots?

425
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,609
Speaker 1: a real good movie probably the best one of those?

426
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,882
Speaker 0: Or the books like all quiet on the Western Front though.

427
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,790
Speaker 1: That was bridge over River.

428
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, also zoom in on war Hogan's heroes.

429
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:57,664
Speaker 1: No Also, that's not a movie.

430
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:04,019
Speaker 0: I know But this is different because it's very Technical and detailed about things you wouldn't think about.

431
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:10,841
Speaker 0: like the dude is researching like based on all these ships logs The this account of the battle is actually provably bullshit.

432
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:13,348
Speaker 0: And here's our best reconstruction of what actually happened in this moment.

433
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,814
Speaker 0: deliberately Yeah, so anyway What else we got?

434
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:22,510
Speaker 1: we're gonna be at gamer X East spelled the G a y em er X?

435
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,477
Speaker 0: Yep, as in and for a good reason.

436
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:28,250
Speaker 0: Yes, it is an LGBT focused and friendly gaming convention.

437
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:29,718
Speaker 1: It's just a gaming con.

438
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:31,690
Speaker 1: It just happens to be fabulous.

439
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:40,742
Speaker 1: Everyone's welcome much more fabulous than facts, which is not unfabulous But significantly less so than gamer X.

440
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:42,067
Speaker 0: gamer X is pretty awesome.

441
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:42,790
Speaker 0: They have multiple events.

442
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,350
Speaker 0: This is the first one in New York and we're gonna be there doing a panel and otherwise We're just gonna be playing games cuz it's gonna be awesome.

443
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:52,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean why not go play game if there's a gaming convention in Manhattan?

444
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,150
Speaker 1: in Manhattan 40 bucks right fucking there for two days.

445
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,525
Speaker 1: Why would I not go there and play games?

446
00:28:58,747 --> 00:29:03,750
Speaker 0: Yeah So, uh, we're also gonna be a magfest which is coming up in January.

447
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,962
Speaker 1: There's a gaming convention in DC for four days non-stop.

448
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,790
Speaker 1: Why would I not go there and play packs?

449
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:16,130
Speaker 0: Prime the biggest packs at least the best packs shuts down at midnight.

450
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,217
Speaker 0: Magfest does not shut down.

451
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:22,772
Speaker 1: Magfest is the only convention that is so fabulous as to have 4 a.m Dig dug.

452
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:28,150
Speaker 0: Magfest is the only convention in recorded history where you think to yourself, you know what?

453
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,070
Speaker 0: I'll stay up till 3 30 in the morning and then I'll go play DDR when it's not crowded.

454
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:42,524
Speaker 0: So the thing is you find that the DDR machines are more crowded at 3 30 a.m Than they were at 11 p.m See even though magfest is four days the Thursday.

455
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,490
Speaker 1: It doesn't really get rolling yet, right?

456
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:48,425
Speaker 1: So think early Thursday isn't a day you could technically do stuff like.

457
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:49,530
Speaker 1: games aren't even set up yet.

458
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:56,416
Speaker 1: It's only good if you go straight into tabletop or just tabletop and then Sunday people get the hell out Right away in the morning.

459
00:29:56,436 --> 00:30:00,790
Speaker 1: like you can still play games on that Sunday afternoon, but not really tearing shit down.

460
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:04,677
Speaker 1: You basically got to either leave When you add up all those hours.

461
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:18,290
Speaker 1: since it's 24/7 the Thursday night that Friday night the Saturday night that are in a hundred percent full-on mode It's actually longer than it would a four-day con would be if it was only, you know, if it shut down.

462
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:27,996
Speaker 1: No, no I think our real trouble is that we always leave as more total active hours Even though the early Thursday in late Sunday hours The convention is technically open.

463
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:31,710
Speaker 1: if you subtract those you still have more total active hours.

464
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:44,030
Speaker 0: If we had left later or earlier on Sunday every year, we'd always be better off We leave with but because if you stay later or until the next day Like you can just go into the arcade and it's pretty empty like late on Sunday before they shut it down.

465
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:48,990
Speaker 0: You can do a whole bunch of stuff But if you check out and you're trying to catch a train or a bus, you've got too much momentum.

466
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:59,330
Speaker 0: You can't actually like go and you get home way late And then you have to wake up the next day and go to work and if you leave super early You're leaving the con but that arcade still rocking and you feel kind of bad about it.

467
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, there isn't a good time to leave.

468
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,210
Speaker 1: magfest on Sunday.

469
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,187
Speaker 1: There's like this very short window I think like basically stay eat lunch and leave or stay leave and eat lunch at wherever you're going.

470
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,556
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know.

471
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:14,361
Speaker 0: So otherwise Subscribe to my youtube channel and Scott's YouTube channel.

472
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:15,988
Speaker 0: We're both doing a ton of stuff.

473
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:18,955
Speaker 1: I videoed Baking with Scott.

474
00:31:19,055 --> 00:31:23,315
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna be a bad video, but I guess I have to edit it because otherwise Why did I video it?

475
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,542
Speaker 0: You know what you should get for that editing?

476
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:25,930
Speaker 0: What are these video editing knobs?

477
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:27,282
Speaker 1: I don't need the knob.

478
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,436
Speaker 0: Yeah What did you start editing?

479
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:30,743
Speaker 0: a lot of video.

480
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:32,110
Speaker 0: that knob is indispensable.

481
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,981
Speaker 1: I think I'll be fine with my mouse if you want that knob.

482
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:39,561
Speaker 0: if you if you decide I don't want knob I'll buy it for you with the patreon money.

483
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:40,365
Speaker 1: I don't need enough.

484
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:41,209
Speaker 0: It's free.

485
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:45,070
Speaker 1: Why don't you buy me some hockey tickets with the patreon money?

486
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,274
Speaker 0: I'm I buy.

487
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:48,303
Speaker 0: I'll pay you with regular money for the hockey ticket.

488
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:49,710
Speaker 0: I'm taking from here for Tuesday.

489
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,950
Speaker 1: Fine, but you know if you just gave me the money then we could just go to all the games free effectively.

490
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:59,750
Speaker 0: I'm not wasting our patreon money on things that don't turn into stuff for geek nights.

491
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,373
Speaker 1: I could talk.

492
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,765
Speaker 1: we could start doing episodes of geek nights on hockey.

493
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:03,650
Speaker 0: We kids do that.

494
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,021
Speaker 0: Anyway, we could probably do a live stream podcast.

495
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:06,744
Speaker 1: You can make a hole.

496
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:07,930
Speaker 1: they could make a New York Rangers.

497
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:10,000
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are New York Rangers fan podcasts.

498
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,170
Speaker 1: We can make another one get season tickets.

499
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,279
Speaker 1: We've got every fucking home game and do a show on each one.

500
00:32:14,842 --> 00:32:16,710
Speaker 0: Ah, that's actually not a terrible idea.

501
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:17,735
Speaker 0: You mean Emily too?

502
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,690
Speaker 0: Cuz Emily actually has gone way beyond me and hockey knowledge.

503
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,970
Speaker 0: She pays way more attention to players that I don't care about and then later on she's like, yeah, look how he developed.

504
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,761
Speaker 0: I'm like what we just traded for him.

505
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,605
Speaker 0: How did you know who he was?

506
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:31,970
Speaker 0: He played for like the Sabres.

507
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:33,664
Speaker 1: I just read Rangers read it.

508
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:38,040
Speaker 1: So I know yeah That's that's the that's the amount of knowledge.

509
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,025
Speaker 1: I'm willing to put into it.

510
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:40,150
Speaker 0: Yeah effort.

511
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,446
Speaker 0: So timepieces, I got watches.

512
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:46,170
Speaker 0: I used to wear.

513
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:50,670
Speaker 0: So not only did I wear a watch I wore a watch all the time.

514
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:54,210
Speaker 0: They're like elementary school all the way up through the end of middle school.

515
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,633
Speaker 0: I wore a watch like every single day no matter what I Replace them over time.

516
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:05,050
Speaker 0: I'd get fancier watches or less fancy watches always analog except one brief period right a digital watch.

517
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,816
Speaker 0: I realized that they all kind of suck.

518
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:08,060
Speaker 0: back then I went back to analog.

519
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:20,459
Speaker 1: so I learned how to tell time The same way that everyone on earth should learn how to tell time which is with the official Mickey Mouse watch Where one of the hands has a little circle on it.

520
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:25,170
Speaker 1: that goes, you know, and it's got the red wristband Yes, Mickey's arms going around.

521
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:35,690
Speaker 0: I learned with a Care Bears alarm clock that was so loud when the alarm went off that My parents had to disable the alarm to prevent damage.

522
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:39,350
Speaker 1: My alarm clocks are just boring digital ones with red numbers or whatever.

523
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:46,310
Speaker 1: But at one point my mom bought from the JC penny catalog the Super Mario alarm clock.

524
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:50,510
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I had the two bells on the top and our hands went around.

525
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:57,734
Speaker 1: so we go to the JC penny pickup counter to get it cuz that's how it was in the days before Amazon and It was just broken.

526
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:59,842
Speaker 1: like you we opened it and it didn't work.

527
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:01,970
Speaker 1: So he said hey, it doesn't work get another one.

528
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:09,610
Speaker 1: So we had to go home and then they called us and we're like, okay We got another one and we went back and that one was also just broken and it wasn't like a little bit broken.

529
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,286
Speaker 1: It was like it just didn't go like it wasn't like.

530
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,330
Speaker 1: oh, we forgot the batteries.

531
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:19,370
Speaker 1: It was like no like the hands aren't even on the thing and it's like it's like somebody just smashed it.

532
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:25,297
Speaker 1: Basically batteries batteries mine was actually a wind-up, but it's like yeah It just we couldn't get a working one.

533
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:25,819
Speaker 1: So he gave up.

534
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,389
Speaker 1: so I never had a mario alarm clock.

535
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:33,237
Speaker 0: So throughout most of my life up until the end of middle school Especially in middle school.

536
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:43,514
Speaker 0: I was actually kind of I was not obsessed But I always wanted to know exactly what time it was and I would use that knowledge for a very specific Effect throughout my life.

537
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:54,510
Speaker 0: Like I was extremely punctual and I mean, I've always been punctual, but it didn't need watches to do that No, but like I would try to be like I would literally try to show up like at a class the second the bell rang.

538
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,437
Speaker 0: No, I didn't like the exact second.

539
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,521
Speaker 1: I just I just be.

540
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:00,130
Speaker 1: you know, I just don't want to be late, right?

541
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,454
Speaker 1: As long I don't care if I'm early.

542
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,562
Speaker 1: thing is a lot of times in life.

543
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:04,324
Speaker 1: I'm too early.

544
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:05,910
Speaker 0: No usually be in high school.

545
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:06,716
Speaker 0: I shifted to that.

546
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,570
Speaker 0: I started showing up to things like an hour early.

547
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:14,890
Speaker 1: The reason I'm so early to a lot of things is because I finished doing one thing and the next thing is coming up.

548
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,577
Speaker 1: This happens a lot that something's after work.

549
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:19,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get out of work at 5 and I have a thing.

550
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:19,812
Speaker 1: It's at 630.

551
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:21,081
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do?

552
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:22,430
Speaker 0: sit in the Starbucks doing nothing?

553
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:31,670
Speaker 1: So it's like okay I go and I eat dinner and I you know I take my time with it and then I go to the place and what else we have to do and then I'm early.

554
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:34,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the reason I'm super early to things.

555
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,260
Speaker 1: but I mean if I'm just going to something, you know I show up still slightly early because I don't want to be late ever.

556
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:46,689
Speaker 0: but there's a big difference between now and when I Was in middle school because now I have an infinite entertainment device in my pocket at all times.

557
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:50,362
Speaker 0: Middle school, I mean you had bupkis.

558
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:56,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a gameboy But one I couldn't bring that to school like they wouldn't let you and even if I did the batteries don't last that long.

559
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,716
Speaker 1: A lot of Pokemon in high school.

560
00:35:57,736 --> 00:35:58,922
Speaker 1: I don't know your problem was.

561
00:35:59,083 --> 00:35:59,665
Speaker 0: well middle school.

562
00:35:59,685 --> 00:36:00,449
Speaker 0: They wouldn't let us bring him.

563
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,738
Speaker 1: Pokemon didn't exist when I was in middle school.

564
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:07,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it was a different time You understand so I hope so.

565
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:13,848
Speaker 0: I wanted to maximize my fun time in life so I wanted to never be early or late to anything ever.

566
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:23,629
Speaker 0: and I there was a trick I would pull once per class per so I guess per quarter per year throughout all of middle school of

567
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,612
Speaker 1: Stand up

568
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:31,390
Speaker 0: and start walking toward the door while class is still going and just as the teachers like where are you the bell rings?

569
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,566
Speaker 0: Just as I walk out the door.

570
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:37,670
Speaker 0: That was like my move because it was like for middle school kids.

571
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:43,631
Speaker 0: That's like a mic drop and the only way I was able to do this was I I had always made try to watch with The second

572
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:43,893
Speaker 1: hand

573
00:36:44,294 --> 00:37:02,093
Speaker 0: and what I would do is at the beginning every month when I came into class I would pause my watch at the exact time The bell was like the bell would ring officially and I would with the second hand on the 12 And I would start it right when the bell rang because the bells were digitally controlled in the school and were basically a hundred percent Consistent.

574
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:02,635
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

575
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:09,280
Speaker 0: So my watch wasn't 100% tied to the school Which as I recall was three minutes ahead of real time.

576
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,745
Speaker 1: So you're talking about punctuality.

577
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:12,350
Speaker 1: You're not talking about the actual watches.

578
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,073
Speaker 0: Oh the watch.

579
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:13,996
Speaker 0: I had to have a second hander.

580
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:14,678
Speaker 0: that wouldn't have worked.

581
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:17,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean those are specifics of watches, right?

582
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,900
Speaker 0: So that's the only reason I wore the fucking watch.

583
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:21,127
Speaker 1: It was a big deal, right?

584
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:36,729
Speaker 1: I don't know if people people are old enough to remember this But like it was a big deal when Timex came into existence Yeah, like I don't know how it might have been an older company But like specifically the Iron Man watch was like this hot trend for like a long period in like I guess the 90s.

585
00:37:37,732 --> 00:37:43,358
Speaker 1: It was like a big deal this Iron Man watch and there was just something about it Like it was super waterproof.

586
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,610
Speaker 1: And if you look at it today, it's kind of ugly.

587
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:49,690
Speaker 1: And of these two big buttons on the front.

588
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:57,090
Speaker 1: So it did like all these functions like stop while I had a built-in stopwatch Right and a built, you know built in all kinds of extra stuff.

589
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:09,128
Speaker 1: Mostly it was just the stopwatch was built in to also your wristwatch, which I remember this is It wasn't really a common thing before then right you had like expensive Casio calculator watch and that was about it.

590
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,630
Speaker 1: Yep Indigo technology the indigo was also a big deal.

591
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,566
Speaker 1: I think it was the first watch or the backlight right like you could.

592
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:20,042
Speaker 1: it was it, you know Even though it was a LCD screen.

593
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:26,790
Speaker 1: It wasn't the black with the red numbers It was the white with the black and you could even though usually you couldn't see those in the dark.

594
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:34,070
Speaker 1: But here you finally have a blacklight on it Which didn't exist until then as far as I know now part of that I had one of those indigo Iron Man watches.

595
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,819
Speaker 1: I think I had two or three of them and I just kept losing them because it's Uncomfortable to wear a watch.

596
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:51,021
Speaker 1: it is annoying for at least for me Yeah, but no matter how fancy a nice watch band or how well sized it is or anything like that It's even even this pebble watch or haven't lost.

597
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,230
Speaker 1: It's still uncomfortable to wear it.

598
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:58,930
Speaker 1: It's worth dealing with that slight very slight discomfort to not have to take my phone out of my pocket.

599
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:06,647
Speaker 0: So in those days before cell phones if you wanted to be not late to things You pretty much had to wear a watch because there was no other way to know what time it was.

600
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:10,541
Speaker 0: in most places Like in the mall, there's a clock somewhere.

601
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like one clock in the mall somewhere.

602
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, like every classroom had one clock on the wall.

603
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:15,962
Speaker 1: Also at the clock store they had them.

604
00:39:16,244 --> 00:39:17,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were.

605
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:21,850
Speaker 0: they were wrong though They'd always just be like pointed up left and up right maybe almost always.

606
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,383
Speaker 0: They're never actually running on time.

607
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:24,170
Speaker 0: in the clock store.

608
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:34,237
Speaker 0: I mean before cell phones you had to have a watch to know what time it was and knowing what time it was was real important because if Like you didn't show up on time Your friends couldn't call you.

609
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:41,704
Speaker 0: it's not like there was any way to find out what happened to you until the next day like everything Was fucked so precise timekeeping everyone had to have a watch like.

610
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:49,810
Speaker 0: I remember specifically a couple times we were like at senior point and Like with a bunch of friends and I'd be like, yeah, so let's all ride rides or whatever.

611
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,621
Speaker 0: We'll split up and let's meet at 1130 and get lunch.

612
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:58,335
Speaker 0: And then we noticed that one of our friends didn't have a watch and we were like if you don't show up We're not fucking waiting for you.

613
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,144
Speaker 0: And of course, they didn't show up.

614
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,915
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Didn't know that it was 1130.

615
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:04,539
Speaker 0: I mean, what do you?

616
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,341
Speaker 0: how would you know?

617
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,370
Speaker 0: The clocks are not that common in society anymore?

618
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:17,730
Speaker 1: I mean, well cuz you know watches, you know historically speaking right going back to like sundials You couldn't even move them and then they were like clockwork which you couldn't move those either.

619
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,940
Speaker 1: But they were big and central.

620
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,698
Speaker 1: see wherever you were in town You could look up and hopefully see one.

621
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:46,670
Speaker 1: but it's like what a water clock It's like, you know fancy, you know watches were like pocket watches like a luxurious expensive item for much of history and to some extent still carry that legacy of you know being a special expensive thing like not everyone like Watches weren't democratized or everyone could get them until you know why like the middle of the 20th century, maybe

622
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:49,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna posit a date cuz I'm not really sure.

623
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in digital watches definitely didn't exist then right?

624
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:57,894
Speaker 0: It's like Yeah, so in high school I Sort of shifted cuz one.

625
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:03,923
Speaker 0: my watches would get beaten the shit out of because I wore them all the time no matter what and they'd like bang into stuff and get scratched.

626
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:14,373
Speaker 0: I keep replacing them and I also decided in high school suddenly like in the middle of ninth grade I didn't actually want to know what time it was all the time Cuz.

627
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:18,126
Speaker 0: I didn't want to have that like moment that I remember I'd be sitting in class.

628
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:29,005
Speaker 0: I'm bored I just want to leave and I look down and I know that there's three minutes and 28 seconds before this class ends and that's That clock just starts going slower and slower and slower.

629
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:32,910
Speaker 1: You know a clock is the same as a pot of water, right?

630
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,709
Speaker 1: You know you look at it the slower it boils.

631
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:48,711
Speaker 0: So I started wearing pocket watches in high school because I still needed to know what time it was Because you still you know, we're nerdy but you still had not evicted all of your trilby wearing This.

632
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:49,694
Speaker 0: actually it wasn't.

633
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:52,142
Speaker 0: so I didn't wear my pocket watch out.

634
00:41:52,202 --> 00:41:53,386
Speaker 0: It was actually I ended up.

635
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:58,210
Speaker 0: I had a chain pocket watch I'd wear with like suits, which I still have and I still wear those but only with suits.

636
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:01,704
Speaker 0: But I didn't wear a chain pocket watch on my jeans.

637
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:03,110
Speaker 0: I just got a watch.

638
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:12,950
Speaker 1: I just want to remind people that the rim that I met Yeah, the first time in my life was a person who is a wearing a cowboy wearing a silly hat.

639
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,996
Speaker 1: How boy boots a trench duster?

640
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,882
Speaker 0: a trench coat was a duster.

641
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,590
Speaker 1: He basically looked like grit from advanced war.

642
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:25,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a silly mustache full-on Brigadier General mustache right out of World War one.

643
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:30,309
Speaker 0: Alright, that is the the person who my school picture was me holding a sword, right?

644
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,744
Speaker 1: If you saw this person today a base as gamer game in all over him.

645
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,310
Speaker 0: I said no, there's a big difference.

646
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:42,735
Speaker 0: I was not fat sure Nor was I greasy.

647
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:47,069
Speaker 1: I mean, there's also a fat greasy guy out there who's saying I did not wear the trilby.

648
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,779
Speaker 0: But here's the thing with the pocket watch.

649
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,862
Speaker 0: what I did.

650
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:57,319
Speaker 0: because even in middle school like in high school I was like, well really I don't really pocket watch chain with jeans.

651
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:00,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I got a pocket watch key fob.

652
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:02,655
Speaker 0: Then I could.

653
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:04,125
Speaker 0: so it was on my keys to my car.

654
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:04,809
Speaker 0: cuz I had a car.

655
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,577
Speaker 0: cuz Driver's license is 16.

656
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:08,763
Speaker 0: So that was my pocket watch.

657
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,249
Speaker 0: so I can always know what time it was.

658
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,154
Speaker 0: Cuz I had a watch on me But I didn't.

659
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:19,019
Speaker 0: I had to actively do a thing to like pull it out of my pocket open it up to look at it To see that time.

660
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:23,548
Speaker 0: so I didn't have the watch Constantly reminding me how slow my life was moving.

661
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,690
Speaker 0: Cuz back then again no smartphone.

662
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,459
Speaker 0: So I'd get bored like it's.

663
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,550
Speaker 0: it's kind of funny that there was a time in my life When boredom was a possibility.

664
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:38,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you like gotta go to the doctor with your parents and the Gameboy batteries run out What are you gonna do?

665
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:42,185
Speaker 0: You're gonna flip through Reader's Digest, but that's horrible.

666
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:43,429
Speaker 0: Then you're gonna sit there.

667
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:49,970
Speaker 1: All the Dodgers and dentists I went to when I was a kid were like, you know pediatric dentists and pediatric doctors.

668
00:43:50,653 --> 00:43:51,136
Speaker 0: Oh, so they had that.

669
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:52,222
Speaker 0: what's that kid magazine?

670
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:53,449
Speaker 1: No highlights.

671
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:55,700
Speaker 1: Yeah I had a description of highlights, but I'm talking about.

672
00:43:55,801 --> 00:44:02,648
Speaker 1: even when I was older like middle school In the waiting rooms were like fucking Genesis things that had like five games in them.

673
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:09,168
Speaker 1: Whoa You know at the orthodontist you would grant there was a stack of Gameboys and you would grab one.

674
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:15,358
Speaker 1: you when you went to go Sit down and you just play Metroid 2 while they worked on your teeth, man I didn't have any of that.

675
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:21,150
Speaker 1: it cost more money to do Rich but I mean everyone in town went to it.

676
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,572
Speaker 1: But it was.

677
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,569
Speaker 1: you know, it was still a mostly white suburb less white than yours, but still mostly no.

678
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:28,318
Speaker 0: But I guess that was the choice I made with timepieces of.

679
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:32,901
Speaker 0: I needed to be able to look at the time But I didn't want to have to look at the time.

680
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:37,566
Speaker 0: and with a watch if you wear a watch You're gonna keep looking at it whether you want to or not.

681
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:41,389
Speaker 0: It's just gonna happen Mmm, so that was why I used a pocket watch for a long time.

682
00:44:42,231 --> 00:44:47,170
Speaker 1: So the thing with watches is like for a long period of time like I lost those time X's, right?

683
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,160
Speaker 1: I just gave up on watches and I didn't care anymore.

684
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,256
Speaker 1: and then I got phones and I'm like, oh just look at the phone I don't need I don't need a watch.

685
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was anti watch for that for this long day.

686
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,077
Speaker 0: I got a cell phone.

687
00:44:56,178 --> 00:45:00,990
Speaker 0: I literally threw away the only watch I still owned other than my pocket watches that I only wear with suits.

688
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,333
Speaker 1: I was so like.

689
00:45:02,374 --> 00:45:08,590
Speaker 1: I still respected like watchmaking and clockmaking as a as a nerdy and valuable thing.

690
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:09,979
Speaker 1: Right, you know.

691
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:17,150
Speaker 1: but in terms of like, you know This is like a watch culture of like people collecting watches and people like I have a really expensive watch.

692
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,574
Speaker 1: Look how awesome I am gold.

693
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,179
Speaker 0: why I was at a.

694
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,183
Speaker 1: look at my Rolex.

695
00:45:21,223 --> 00:45:25,135
Speaker 1: Look at my Tag Heuer watch, you know Status.

699
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:40,530
Speaker 0: and I watched two old two older white guys and a younger white guy and the younger white guy

700
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:41,853
Speaker 1: No watch measuring content was

701
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:47,950
Speaker 0: talking some shit like like sort of poking fun at the older white guys because their company wasn't doing so well and

702
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:49,534
Speaker 1: Basically,

703
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:52,770
Speaker 0: yeah, like they're talking to each other and having this like kind of

704
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,455

00:45:54,496 --> 00:45:55,099
Speaker 0: well, is it?

706
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:56,487
Speaker 0: that's kind of the conversation.

707
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,893
Speaker 0: they were happy Wow what asshole.

708
00:45:57,973 --> 00:46:07,089
Speaker 0: and then the one white dude who is being had the shade being thrown at him who was who'd kind of Instigated it because he had started by saying like hey, we were thinking about buying you guys

709
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:07,972
Speaker 1: Mmm,

710
00:46:08,513 --> 00:46:16,513
Speaker 0: so dude literally like pulls up his hand looks his watch and says this watch cost $80,000.

711
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:19,030
Speaker 0: Said those words All right.

712
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:27,930
Speaker 0: And then the other guy pulls up his watch and he and he's like this is a and he said like some name of a designer And they literally had a watch measuring contest and I was laughing.

713
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:31,447
Speaker 1: I literally he's basically one guy was like, you know, my company goes out of business.

714
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:35,390
Speaker 1: I'm still rich I don't give a fuck and the other guys like I'm even richer.

715
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:49,824
Speaker 0: So I've got to the point now where I appreciate The craft of making watches but anyone I ever meet who is wearing a non smart watch That is not a cheap watch.

716
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,650
Speaker 0: I Kind it's like a reverse status symbol.

717
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:58,170
Speaker 0: Like when I see it, I kind of assume by default that they're kind of a douchey upper-middle-class Richie person, right?

718
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:58,513
Speaker 1: It's like.

719
00:46:58,734 --> 00:46:59,298
Speaker 1: it's so weird.

720
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,689
Speaker 1: It's like just like watch means douche.

721
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:03,080
Speaker 1: Watches went from being right.

722
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:08,119
Speaker 1: this thing that only certain people could have To a thing that's like a practical thing.

723
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:11,950
Speaker 1: everyone can tell time like the Iron Man watch times, right?

724
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,984
Speaker 1: But still it was always a status symbol even then Rolex Rolex, right?

725
00:47:15,145 --> 00:47:20,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now It's like to the point where there's so many watches like you're.

726
00:47:20,264 --> 00:47:22,496
Speaker 1: you're if you have a watch Like.

727
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:26,049
Speaker 1: it says so much about you Right, which watch you have?

728
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:33,053
Speaker 1: You know to the point at which like there's specific like there's so many models of watch and somehow they keep making all of them There's a watch.

729
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:38,410
Speaker 1: I read this really fascinating story this particular Casio watch that terrorists used to make bombs.

730
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,921
Speaker 0: I know the exact article you're talking about.

731
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,150
Speaker 1: you can just buy this watch for like 10 bucks on Amazon.

732
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:51,662
Speaker 1: It's like you can have it but it's like, you know They will look it like if you have the watch you could be Suspected of being a terrorist because those are the people have that watch.

733
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,410
Speaker 1: but like there's a picture of Obama wearing this one.

734
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:54,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

735
00:47:54,757 --> 00:48:00,910
Speaker 1: and it's like kind of want to buy that watch now Even though it's just a boring old Casio digital watch that tells time and doesn't do anything else.

736
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,108
Speaker 0: Well, then you're buying a piece of jewelry.

737
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like 10 bucks.

738
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:05,860
Speaker 0: It's not even yeah, but it's still jewelry.

739
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,434
Speaker 0: jewelry is just an outward expression of your inner proteins But it's like.

740
00:48:09,494 --> 00:48:11,065
Speaker 1: I looked at it and it's like I don't need that.

741
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:11,830
Speaker 1: I have a smart watch.

742
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,031
Speaker 1: What's?

743
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,559
Speaker 1: why even why even waste the $10 to get one?

744
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,706
Speaker 1: just you know, just because it's kind of cool.

745
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:17,750
Speaker 1: and then it's like.

746
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:20,800
Speaker 1: Oh, there's also like the Casio calculator watch.

747
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,065
Speaker 1: It's like that's so nerdy.

748
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:25,298
Speaker 1: That's like the nerd status symbols Like you could just get one of those right?

749
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:25,941
Speaker 1: No problem.

750
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,890
Speaker 1: But like I don't need that either.

751
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:28,231
Speaker 1: You know what?

752
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:34,749
Speaker 1: The real status symbol was in fifth grade the kid who had the watch that had Legend of Zelda on it.

753
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:36,656
Speaker 1: I could play legend.

754
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,550
Speaker 1: really really really really really crappy Legend of Zelda like.

755
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,549
Speaker 0: These were like the bad versions of tiger LCD games.

756
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:52,244
Speaker 1: It was a tiger LCD game that was so small it would go on your wrist and like I'd Like we would like at recess like he would.

757
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:53,130
Speaker 1: you know, I want to see.

758
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,643
Speaker 0: I want to see a GDQ speed runs of tiger LCD games.

759
00:48:58,944 --> 00:48:59,625

767
00:49:13,145 --> 00:49:14,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got a look at the room.

768
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,114

769
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:15,557
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there's.

Speaker 1: We had that's beatable.

772
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:19,014
Speaker 0: There's got to be one.

773
00:49:19,035 --> 00:49:20,581
Speaker 0: the whole interesting.

774
00:49:20,822 --> 00:49:25,163
Speaker 1: they could do it during awful games done quick Maybe but yeah, you can beat some of them for sure.

775
00:49:25,183 --> 00:49:26,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much.

776
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,386
Speaker 1: Just do the same thing over and over again till it's over man.

777
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,524
Speaker 0: I remember that was a status symbol.

778
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:34,360
Speaker 1: as a sonic one You can beat dad like bosses those watches and also the tiger else.

779
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,049
Speaker 0: these in general were status symbols among the dumb kids and Everyone else like had an NES at home and knew better.

780
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:45,170
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I mean we had NES at home, but how you couldn't have any us at school?

781
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we didn't play Zelda at his desk.

782
00:49:48,712 --> 00:49:50,317
Speaker 0: I wasn't stupid.

783
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:52,063
Speaker 0: I saw those things like wow, that's not.

784
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,250
Speaker 0: I'd rather play those little plastic things.

785
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,414
Speaker 0: We have the steel ball bearings.

786
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:56,256
Speaker 0: You shoot them around.

787
00:49:56,277 --> 00:49:57,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

788
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,745
Speaker 1: Well, you're at school.

789
00:49:58,825 --> 00:49:59,748
Speaker 1: So I'll take it.

790
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:02,642
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that's why I have my watch.

791
00:50:02,863 --> 00:50:08,148
Speaker 0: so I could show up to class Exactly when the bell rang to not waste even a second of my life.

792
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:15,410
Speaker 0: So in high school when I started here in the pocket watch what I started doing Unrelatedly is cuz you know, I don't want to be late to things.

793
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:24,650
Speaker 0: I started showing up to stuff like an hour early and like I just go into the place and just fall asleep And then people would kind of wake me up naturally when they showed up to do the thing.

794
00:50:25,214 --> 00:50:27,430
Speaker 0: So I sort of got this reputation like in high school.

795
00:50:27,932 --> 00:50:39,930
Speaker 0: like that we'd have a band trip or like a tournament or something and People would show up at the school like up like ten minutes for the things gonna start like get this shit together And they'd reliably find me like in the back room asleep on top of a bunch of drawers.

796
00:50:40,293 --> 00:50:44,541
Speaker 1: Didn't you just leave where you were before An hour later and show up on time

797
00:50:44,621 --> 00:50:52,725
Speaker 0: because it was always between the other thing I was doing just like we have now in New York Like it wasn't enough time to go home and play

798
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:53,910
Speaker 1: it wasn't like you were at home.

799
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,136
Speaker 0: No, it was like I'm out doing something.

800
00:50:56,717 --> 00:50:57,379
Speaker 0: that thing ends.

801
00:50:57,419 --> 00:51:01,390
Speaker 0: There's two hours before the thing at the school starts it.

802
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:04,148
Speaker 0: What am I gonna do for an hour at home?

803
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,371
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

804
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:06,737
Speaker 0: That's not enough time to play any video.

805
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,124
Speaker 1: That's a general problem in life.

806
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:13,750
Speaker 1: Not a watch specific problem Yeah, so so actual why you know, not just watches.

807
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,595
Speaker 1: Let's talk about like the you know clocks.

808
00:51:16,257 --> 00:51:20,588
Speaker 0: my favorite wall clock we ever had was that momo wall clock that we bought.

809
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:21,190
Speaker 0: it broke.

810
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:23,054
Speaker 1: Yeah finally You could replace that.

811
00:51:23,135 --> 00:51:30,045
Speaker 1: the thing is with that is I went online and I looked at Amazon and I could get Replacement clock mechanisms for like a dollar right a ton.

812
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:31,270
Speaker 1: They need a sack of them, right?

813
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,936
Speaker 1: They're so cheap and it would have fit.

814
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:46,498
Speaker 1: the problem is the the mechanism has a stick coming out that spins Right and the more hands you have on the watch the clock you need a longer stick and the longer The hands on the clock are.

815
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:47,802
Speaker 1: you need a longer stick.

816
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:49,467
Speaker 1: that cuz it's harder to turn.

817
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:50,310
Speaker 1: a long thing, right?

818
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,052
Speaker 1: It's a lever right?

819
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:55,045
Speaker 1: You know, you need a stronger clock mechanism to turn bigger hands.

820
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:03,430
Speaker 1: I Could not find a clock medicine mechanism that had the us, you know an axle that matched the one that was in the clock.

821
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,945
Speaker 1: I found the same mechanism, but I couldn't find the same axle so I couldn't replace the mechanism.

822
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:17,263
Speaker 0: So I just bought a different clock Yeah from the Muji store I used to be a big fan of like those weird artistic like.

823
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:21,490
Speaker 0: it is technically a wall clock and shows time But also is a cool mechanism of some kind.

824
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, see those things like.

825
00:52:22,715 --> 00:52:25,949
Speaker 1: it's cool to look at them like binary clocks and stuff like that.

826
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:31,818
Speaker 1: But if I can't glance at it and know what time it is in a fraction of a second It's not a good clock.

827
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:32,320
Speaker 1: So fuck it.

828
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,130
Speaker 1: I'm not actually gonna buy it or put it in my apartment.

829
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:39,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, and once it once my last cool wall clock died I just haven't ever replaced a wall clock my alarm clock.

830
00:52:40,064 --> 00:52:40,587
Speaker 1: Do you want to try?

831
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,350
Speaker 1: you want the momma clog?

832
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,195
Speaker 1: You can go for it.

833
00:52:42,216 --> 00:52:43,385
Speaker 0: I was thinking about giving it Emily's dad.

834
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:43,969
Speaker 0: He might fix it.

835
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:47,570
Speaker 1: I mean, it's so easy to fix if you could just find the exact same mechanism.

836
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:52,630
Speaker 1: But you could just swap it like it even pops out like you don't even need to glue or screw or anything.

837
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:59,790
Speaker 0: It's so simple, but so my alarm clock in the bedroom, which I don't even use anymore because smartphones replaced alarm clocks, too.

838
00:53:01,248 --> 00:53:04,579
Speaker 0: I Have the same one I had since fifth grade.

839
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:05,581
Speaker 0: Wow, it's white.

840
00:53:06,223 --> 00:53:08,910
Speaker 0: It's got red LCD in it and that's it.

841
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:14,190
Speaker 1: It's just I had a clear one with a red LCD in it, and I don't know if it broke or not.

842
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,985
Speaker 1: I think I replaced it with a generic Radio Shack one at some point.

843
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:18,010
Speaker 1: I think I used that in college.

844
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:19,708
Speaker 0: So I have a crazy story about then.

845
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:30,910
Speaker 1: nowadays what I would happen is I don't think that one ever broke but there was a The like a kit where you could you know solder together your own clock with this cool tube the ice tube.

846
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't think they make that kit anymore, but I'd made that kit and because I made it myself it's a little flaky it's at the time it tells a little slow and Sometimes it fritzes out if you push the buttons on it too fast.

847
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,387
Speaker 1: that but it still works and tells time.

848
00:53:45,427 --> 00:53:46,210
Speaker 1: it looks really cool.

849
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:51,901
Speaker 1: So that's what I have next to my bed even though I hardly I. basically it's like why have it there?

850
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:57,750
Speaker 1: because I've got my iPad and my iPhone and my All right there, and I use the alarm in my iPad.

851
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,818
Speaker 1: I don't use the alarm the only time I ever.

852
00:53:59,858 --> 00:54:08,910
Speaker 1: the reason it's right there is because I can Open my eyes and see the time and close my eyes that having to like reach and shake something or anything like that.

853
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:14,327
Speaker 0: So I use mine whenever there is a you have to wake up situation as opposed to day-to-day.

854
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:17,715
Speaker 1: if I have to wake up I'll just set the alarm on my iPhone and my iPad.

855
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:18,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'll do.

856
00:54:18,617 --> 00:54:21,989
Speaker 0: I'll do phone and That thing also.

857
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,498
Speaker 0: I will use that thing for like 20 years.

858
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,602
Speaker 0: It's invincible.

859
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:27,773
Speaker 1: I'll also stop using if I really need to wake up.

860
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:28,916
Speaker 1: I'll change my alarm.

861
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,020
Speaker 1: noise to caramel dancing.

862
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:32,545
Speaker 0: That's the key to this day.

863
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:36,860
Speaker 0: the sound that that white alarm clock makes the deep deep deep haunts my dreams.

864
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:37,364
Speaker 0: That's all.

865
00:54:37,586 --> 00:54:39,299
Speaker 0: that sound never means good things.

866
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,830
Speaker 0: It means get up.

867
00:54:42,272 --> 00:54:44,240
Speaker 0: It's 4/30 time to get up for eighth grade.

868
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:46,465
Speaker 1: Why did you get up at 4/30?

869
00:54:46,465 --> 00:54:51,730
Speaker 0: because I had to leave because I had to be at the school at 6 Because that's when jazz band was cuz.

870
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,876
Speaker 0: jazz band started before school.

871
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,460
Speaker 1: Oh It took you an hour and a half to get this.

872
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:58,765
Speaker 0: So I actually I had.

873
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:01,415
Speaker 0: so I had to leave the house at 540 in the morning.

874
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:04,152
Speaker 1: But you don't to wake up a fourth or you can wake up.

875
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:05,220
Speaker 0: it like takes me in my life.

876
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,413
Speaker 0: It takes me about an hour to get going in the morning.

877
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:11,760
Speaker 0: when I wake up I tie it's an hour between when the alarm goes off and when I'm out the door.

878
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:14,818
Speaker 1: I would get up in like 15 minutes and put my clothes on and go.

879
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:15,220
Speaker 1: I got long.

880
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:25,166
Speaker 0: I got a hairy and a mess with even now anyway, but uh In terms of other timepieces the part the only problem because I don't have any wall clocks anywhere It'll probably never have one again.

881
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:28,000
Speaker 0: I like bare walls actually or very simple accent.

882
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:29,480
Speaker 1: I need to have a wall clock.

883
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:32,019
Speaker 1: I need to basically be able to look and see what time it is.

884
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:35,857
Speaker 1: And if I'm like, even if I'm using my HD PC, the time is in the corner.

885
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:38,369
Speaker 1: It's so small You can't see that from the cat a widget on your desktop.

886
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:40,338
Speaker 1: No, I just look to the right boop.

887
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,102
Speaker 1: There it is.

888
00:55:41,363 --> 00:55:50,080
Speaker 0: So from the from the the couch in the living room I can see the microwaves clock the ovens clock, which is separate.

889
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:56,531
Speaker 1: My oven my apartment is in such a way that the ovens clock is like Yeah blocked by this little tiny half wall bit.

890
00:55:56,712 --> 00:55:58,780
Speaker 0: that tiny wall is there I can picture in my head.

891
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see if I'm in the kitchen.

892
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:05,333
Speaker 0: I use that right though Most people who come over can't see it from there because they can't see.

893
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,082
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell I don't think to look There.

894
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:09,905
Speaker 0: yeah, I think the look there but I live here so I'm gonna used to that.

895
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:16,093
Speaker 0: and there's also a clock on the rice cooker and I think that's all the clocks other than also every computer monitor.

896
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:19,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I get two monitors here It's on the bottom right of both monitors.

897
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,427
Speaker 0: so I just see clocks all the time.

898
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:28,020
Speaker 1: the kind of clock that people don't think about these days because they used to be the Most important and are now or not as important are the public clocks, right?

899
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, you used to like used to be back in the day.

900
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:33,220
Speaker 1: Like you think about your car has a clock in it right in the dashboard.

901
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:36,390
Speaker 1: That didn't used to have most cars we had.

902
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,680
Speaker 1: I think one of them had an analog clock in it.

903
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:41,407
Speaker 1: Most cars we had didn't have a clock.

904
00:56:41,507 --> 00:56:44,638
Speaker 0: until you know much later every car I owned at a clock in it.

905
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:46,334
Speaker 0: every car I can remember had a clock in it.

906
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:48,486
Speaker 1: Not every good.

907
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,035
Speaker 1: I've had car a lot of cars.

908
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:55,680
Speaker 0: in the early part The great station wagon with the eight-track player might not have had a clock.

909
00:56:55,822 --> 00:57:03,729
Speaker 1: I can't picture it in my head But that's why when you drove down the road all the banks had the time and temperature on their sign Because the bank had enough money to do that.

910
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:05,014
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know other places didn't.

911
00:57:05,476 --> 00:57:08,379
Speaker 0: what I'm amazed by This happened to me actually two days ago.

912
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,700
Speaker 1: That's why you go to the train station this big amazing clocks there because it used to be back in the day.

913
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:20,739
Speaker 1: you'd go to the train station and That was the only clock anyone had there except maybe the train conductors had like pocket watches and that was it.

914
00:57:21,262 --> 00:57:22,831
Speaker 0: So I've run into this a lot lately.

915
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:28,060
Speaker 0: Like I've noticed it but Strangers on the street asking me or other people what time it is.

916
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,873
Speaker 0: I've noticed that with increasing frequency over the last few years.

917
00:57:32,893 --> 00:57:36,780
Speaker 1: There was a scam that I read about I don't know if it was true could miss one of those urban legends.

918
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:41,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that somebody would ask you what time it was to get you to take out your phone and then grab your phone and run.

919
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:47,940
Speaker 1: That's a really good scam Right because it's like you might be walking down the road and you don't have your phone out so they can't snatch it.

920
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,302
Speaker 1: So they go.

921
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:50,295
Speaker 1: hey, man, you know, what time is it?

922
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:53,466
Speaker 1: So not only you're Standing still now, right?

923
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:54,249
Speaker 1: You're not walking.

924
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:56,517
Speaker 1: you're walking with your phone and they cut.

925
00:57:56,537 --> 00:57:57,420
Speaker 1: they try to follow you.

926
00:57:57,481 --> 00:57:58,540
Speaker 1: It's like some more obvious, right?

927
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,704
Speaker 1: It's like you're stopped.

928
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:05,992
Speaker 1: you take your phone out and you're looking at the phone and not at them And they grab the phone and run and you have to.

929
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:06,355
Speaker 1: you have.

930
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:07,764
Speaker 1: they already ran it They're already running.

931
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,697
Speaker 1: you, you know, they got a head start on you.

932
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:13,072
Speaker 1: What I saw survey, I don't know if that's ever actually happened.

933
00:58:13,132 --> 00:58:14,820
Speaker 0: I saw a video a while ago.

934
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,093
Speaker 0: I just remembered very clearly.

935
00:58:16,113 --> 00:58:16,740
Speaker 0: It's a short video.

936
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,913
Speaker 0: It looks like it's from a surveillance camera and it's in like.

937
00:58:19,994 --> 00:58:22,585
Speaker 0: it's like I might be in Japan I'm not a hundred percent sure.

938
00:58:22,906 --> 00:58:41,056
Speaker 0: but basically you see like a really crowded train station all these people walking around and then one person just walks up to another person who's looking at their phone and taps him on the shoulder and they turn around and he Reaches out and like gingerly while making eye candidate takes his phone out of his hand like takes the stranger's phone out of his hand and then just turns around and walks off into the crowd.

939
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:43,005
Speaker 0: and then the guys like Wait, what?

940
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:45,799
Speaker 0: I think he tries to react but the guys lost in the crowd and it's over.

941
00:58:46,442 --> 00:58:48,300
Speaker 0: He's got his phone and I feel like that would work.

942
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:54,460
Speaker 1: Take pockets have skills and the thing is, you know, if you see that you see like pickpockets like do magic.

943
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:56,520
Speaker 1: You know, they do it for like entertainment purposes.

944
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,276
Speaker 1: It's like if they wanted to they could just totally loot everybody.

945
00:58:59,296 --> 00:58:59,719
Speaker 0: Maybe they do.

946
00:59:00,783 --> 00:59:02,440
Speaker 0: 20s are missing from every other wallet there.

947
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,089
Speaker 1: I mean You know some people have enough money.

948
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:07,800
Speaker 1: like if you if you like I have a bunch of ones in my bag.

949
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,513
Speaker 1: If you took some I wouldn't.

950
00:59:09,573 --> 00:59:10,420
Speaker 1: I don't how many are in there.

951
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:18,480
Speaker 0: Right, I guess depends how much money you have to the more money you have the less you notice small amounts of money.

952
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,380
Speaker 1: What happens to me is like when I go and get money?

953
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:31,020
Speaker 1: I know how much I have and then like I'll buy something like I'll buy say something that's like five bucks with my 20 And I'll buy something else is five bucks of the 20 but the change increasingly unreliably gets.

954
00:59:32,905 --> 00:59:33,693
Speaker 1: I don't match money.

955
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:34,319
Speaker 1: I have any more.

956
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:38,631
Speaker 1: So if you stole five dollars from me I wouldn't notice because I didn't know how much.

957
00:59:38,671 --> 00:59:41,964
Speaker 1: I was not constantly counting how much there is At all times.

958
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:49,834
Speaker 0: but it is just weird that I've noticed a lot of people asking me what time it is on the street in The subway and this people have these people holding smartphones asking for directions.

959
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,339
Speaker 0: that happened to me yesterday.

960
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:59,120
Speaker 0: Literally dude outside of Queensborough Plaza is walking looking at a smartphone and he's like, hey, can anyone tell me where?

961
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:05,177
Speaker 0: Saying some like Institute or something, but he's looking at he's holding his smartphone and looking at it.

962
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:10,418
Speaker 0: How How do these people I guess that's what the where the undecided voters are.

963
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:19,580
Speaker 0: So, uh, the only other the only change in timepieces is that I started wearing watches again because of smart watches.

964
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:23,160
Speaker 0: And the only reason is I didn't actually care about the time thing.

965
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,320
Speaker 0: I cared about all the other features of smartphones.

966
01:00:25,942 --> 01:00:31,740
Speaker 0: But since the screens on all the time anyway, and it might as well show me the time might as well.

967
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:41,040
Speaker 0: but it's funny how I really think of my smartwatch as Primarily notifications and the time on it is just this like minor side effect.

968
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,720
Speaker 0: It's like the fact that there's a clock in the bottom right of my monitor.

969
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:47,537
Speaker 1: I actually look at the thing I look at the most is the date.

970
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:51,090
Speaker 1: Yep And also that I have the temperature on mine.

971
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,158
Speaker 1: So I look at it before like I go outside.

972
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:54,940
Speaker 0: Yep That's pretty much how I use mine.

973
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:58,540
Speaker 1: I use the time on it a lot less because I get my time from other places.

974
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:04,360
Speaker 1: But the up thing I'll be sitting on the couch and wearing a watch and I look at the the analog clock on the wall.

975
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:19,740
Speaker 0: so the only significant change to the timekeeping timepiece aspect of my smartwatch is that Because it is basically just another screen for my smartphone It always shows the right time even when I land after a long flight into a different time zone.

976
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:27,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean back in the day, you know They had a time of clocks But even people didn't have access to them and you could buy ones that like synchronize with radio.

977
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:30,939
Speaker 1: You still can dude, you know, those are expensive and not worth it.

978
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,923
Speaker 0: When was the last time?

979
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:37,320
Speaker 0: in a modern action movie peep a bunch of characters synchronize their clocks for the heist, right?

980
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,065
Speaker 1: It's like, you know Used to be like clock.

981
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:43,336
Speaker 1: every everyone's watch was off whether it was digital or analog.

982
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:48,695
Speaker 1: It was off by a little bit It was slow or fast and every once in a while Like you'd have to adjust it by like a minute or two.

983
01:01:48,735 --> 01:01:49,842
Speaker 1: how anal you were I'm

984
01:01:49,882 --> 01:02:04,695
Speaker 0: not even joking whenever we went to Cedar Point or an amusement park But if you see your point was the way we went to we would literally all might mean all my friends would get off the bus When we got to the park and then we'd all stand in a circle and synchronize our watches before we dispersed Like that was a real

985
01:02:04,776 --> 01:02:05,039
Speaker 1: thing.

986
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:11,140
Speaker 1: Like you could think you're on time and actually be five minutes late because your watch is five minutes different than someone else's watch.

987
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:13,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, you kids will never experience this.

988
01:02:13,853 --> 01:02:21,260
Speaker 0: No You will never Literally get a group of friends in a circle and synchronize your watches before never show up somewhere and people be like why are you?

989
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,084
Speaker 1: Ten minutes late?

990
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:24,620
Speaker 1: and this is like this happened to me in my life back in the day.

991
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,415
Speaker 1: Like yeah, why are you ten minutes late?

992
01:02:26,455 --> 01:02:26,980
Speaker 1: I'm on time.

993
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,725
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

994
01:02:27,765 --> 01:02:30,140
Speaker 1: And they look at their watch and it's just we don't know who's right.

995
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:32,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need some other like, you know, you didn't.

996
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,677
Speaker 1: you couldn't go to time gov and settle it.
