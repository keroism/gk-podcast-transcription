00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:19,747
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 28th 2010 and this is geek nights Tonight with our special guest international juggler entertainer extraordinaire and geek nights forum.

2
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:20,590
Speaker 0: I'd Luke Burrage.

3
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,168
Speaker 0: We discussed the nature of spiritual experiences.

4
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,128
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:45,240
Speaker 0: So before we begin to preface this slightly we recorded about two and a half almost three hours worth of conversation while Luke was actually in New York and We decided to cut that up into a number of episodes that we'll be bringing out every now and then as we have time.

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,688
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what else I can say.

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,040
Speaker 0: Enjoy and look forward to the next episode.

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,960
Speaker 0: I think the end of this one will give you a pretty good idea of where we're going as the topics progress.

9
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:00,592
Speaker 0: So how do we define spirituality?

10
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:01,720
Speaker 0: What does that word actually mean?

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,721
Speaker 1: I'm not.

12
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,293
Speaker 1: when I when I wanted to talk about this I wasn't talking about spirituality as such.

13
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:17,088
Speaker 1: I'm talking more about the Experiences that you can have in a spiritual environment that you interpret as a spiritual experience like but from an atheist point of view We all know that those experiences are actually.

14
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,393
Speaker 1: well, here's the thing.

15
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:22,767
Speaker 1: people atheists say that Spirituality is incorrect.

16
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:29,640
Speaker 1: It's wrong and therefore they skip over all of the other things about it call it Incorrect and then suddenly say it's invalid.

17
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:30,684
Speaker 2: Well what I mean?

18
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:34,560
Speaker 2: what makes an experience spiritual as opposed to non-spiritual, right?

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:46,522
Speaker 2: If I go on a roller coaster and it feels really good and it makes my body emit chemicals and makes me feel certain Emotions and feelings and then I do something else and I get similar feelings You know what?

20
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:51,500
Speaker 2: Why in one case would I apply the word spiritual and another case not apply that word?

21
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,290
Speaker 2: It's really a meaningless a meaningless label.

22
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,060
Speaker 1: This is purely to do with context.

23
00:01:57,221 --> 00:02:04,120
Speaker 1: I would say it's purely to do with context because like let me just tell you a bit about my story I was brought up in a Christian family and we were going to church like all the time.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,880
Speaker 1: I went to church like three times a week four times a week and another head church three times exactly.

25
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,771
Speaker 0: I had church every day in Catholic school.

26
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:11,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

27
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,120
Speaker 1: So it's that kind of thing.

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,285
Speaker 1: So if you interpret an experience that you have and people are saying oh when you feel this That's God touching you.

29
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,433
Speaker 1: when you think this this is God giving you an idea.

30
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:27,960
Speaker 1: when when you're like this it when it when there's Lots of music on and yeah, and you're singing and you feel a lot of you know, good stuff.

31
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,165
Speaker 1: You feel all these good vibes.

32
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:30,650
Speaker 1: That's God speaking to you.

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,453
Speaker 1: That's God touching you.

34
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:38,319
Speaker 1: you interpret that as yes that is spiritual even though it isn't even though you can get exactly the same experience from a rollercoaster.

35
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:39,644
Speaker 1: and You don't.

36
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,600
Speaker 1: you don't experience you don't interpret that.

37
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:57,385
Speaker 1: however If you woke up one morning and saw a fantastic like sunrise and it was the most beautiful thing you've ever seen if you're from a if you're like your life is from a Christian point of view or some kind of spiritual point of view if that's what you You know the lens that you're

38
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:57,766
Speaker 2: looking for.

39
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,980
Speaker 2: Is that where the sun rises and like sun sets and almost every Christian like book you see in the story?

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,320
Speaker 1: Exactly people then associate that as a gift from God as some kind of message from God or something like that.

41
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:24,409
Speaker 1: So what I'm saying is that for most people or most Christian organizations almost spiritual organizations They restrict your access to all of these other things which would otherwise cause you to have and peak Experiences or some kind of spiritual experience.

42
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:25,592
Speaker 0: I never thought of it that way.

43
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:32,276
Speaker 0: a lot of my experiences involve things that Christians Not Christians, but Catholics at least would not want me to have been doing.

44
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,140
Speaker 1: there's this whole thing.

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,109
Speaker 1: It's like so what are you gonna do this weekend?

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,646
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna get so drunk I can't stand up anymore.

47
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,214
Speaker 1: And then I'm gonna fall over bash my head.

48
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:41,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna see stars.

49
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,570
Speaker 1: I mean that could be.

50
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,357
Speaker 1: I mean not for me.

51
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,216
Speaker 1: There's a reason why people do that.

52
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:50,920
Speaker 0: an example I think every man has gone through the moment you realize what masturbation is and that you're in fact capable of it.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,751
Speaker 2: Well for him is the moment you realize the masturbation is maybe there.

54
00:03:53,831 --> 00:04:01,540
Speaker 2: everyone else is the moment you you know get with You know, whatever your preference I would assume that you masturbate first at least once exactly.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:11,160
Speaker 1: But I mean, that's the thing when you when you have that first awesome orgasm You're like that was amazing and then you spend your entire life trying to recreate that because it wouldn't be a first one anymore.

56
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:12,252
Speaker 1: But and it's the same thing.

57
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:17,120
Speaker 1: It's like with sex It's drugs is going to a rock concert and being standing at the front of having like a thousand.

58
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,839
Speaker 2: But the Christians have rock concerts with.

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,160
Speaker 1: However, they're Christian rock conference rock concert conferences concerts.

60
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:28,576
Speaker 1: So when you're there, it's sort of like we're gonna invite God into our lives and this is the thing.

61
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:33,060
Speaker 1: I led worship I played guitar at the front of in the front of churches and stuff like that.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,308
Speaker 1: you know leading worship playing music and I would leave to people in to these and Spiritual experiences, you know.

63
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,176
Speaker 1: so that we would talk about, you know, not talk about.

64
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:47,320
Speaker 1: we would sort of say, okay We're gonna do this We're gonna sing a song play a fast song get everyone sort of like jumping and clapping.

65
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,464
Speaker 1: Let's play another song.

66
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:52,900
Speaker 1: people would like dance and stuff like that and then you take it down and I played keyboards as well.

67
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,560
Speaker 1: So then I'd put on there like the synth sounds and it's all.

68
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,970
Speaker 1: Sing some slow songs everyone to close their eyes.

69
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,640
Speaker 1: the heartbeats would slow down again the pipe organ going.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,787
Speaker 1: Well, not so much pipe organ.

71
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,619
Speaker 1: That's sort of like the big sort of like church.

72
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:23,080
Speaker 0: Interesting study came out It was a long time ago, but there's been a lot of writing about it since but that you can use certain kinds of low-frequency sounds to instill Unnerving senses of awe wonder and fear in people and they won't realize where it's coming from.

73
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:26,457
Speaker 2: Oh, they can't even hear the sounds because they're below human hearing.

74
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:34,574
Speaker 2: the same way The dog whistle is a high frequency that a human can't hear You know, you can get a lower sound than a human can resonate literally in your bowels.

75
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:35,698
Speaker 1: I know there's no noise.

76
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,989
Speaker 1: It's like 14 her That's it.

77
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,487
Speaker 1: I think it's around about 14 or something hurts.

78
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:46,544
Speaker 1: and if you and also if they're you're in a room which has got a resonant Frequency to like that.

79
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:48,091
Speaker 1: You can't help but shit yourself.

80
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,300
Speaker 1: I think that's one of those those things.

81
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:56,540
Speaker 2: It depends also on the amplitude though, right it might be not powerful enough.

82
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:02,823
Speaker 1: It's one of those things that yeah, you really I mean, I'm not sure exactly how real this is But when you're.

83
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:03,888
Speaker 1: well, so I did.

84
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,757
Speaker 0: I did that was the plot of a South Park episode.

85
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:06,138
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

86
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,106
Speaker 2: Yes What I don't see that episode.

87
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,110
Speaker 2: What was it played?

88
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,515
Speaker 0: the brown note around the entire world.

89
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:11,880
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.

90
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:21,965
Speaker 0: Anyway, so well the reason I'm dubious in particular just to say because Mythbusters has not had an episode about it Season.

91
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I'm just making that up.

92
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:23,960
Speaker 1: It would be next season.

93
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:24,783
Speaker 1: No There was a science.

94
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:35,568
Speaker 1: there was a science show or like science experiment II kind of show in In the UK that did something like that, but I don't think that the one where they like blow up bathtubs It was.

95
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:36,355
Speaker 1: it was one of the.

96
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,147
Speaker 1: I Can't remember what it was called, but it was.

97
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,179
Speaker 1: it's got Richard Hammond presented it.

98
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:44,452
Speaker 2: They always use the word boffins - they never say scientist.

99
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:44,613
Speaker 1: Yeah.

100
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why.

101
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,380
Speaker 1: anyway to bring it back.

102
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,548
Speaker 0: I didn't know what that word meant for like three years.

103
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,713
Speaker 1: It means scientists.

104
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:51,620
Speaker 1: It's rainy people with glasses and bald heads.

105
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,206
Speaker 1: So bring it back to the.

106
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:57,120
Speaker 1: the church thing is that you know when you go through this like Christian rock concert.

107
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,569
Speaker 1: It's all about channeling God.

108
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,340
Speaker 1: It's all about channeling the Holy Spirit.

109
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,928
Speaker 1: It's all about this and that which is you know, which is a cool way to You know to approach it.

110
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:09,162
Speaker 1: However, I went to this Conference.

111
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:15,265
Speaker 1: I was gonna say atheist conference is the the amazing meeting in London last year and there was this.

112
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:22,407
Speaker 1: it was a really weird kind of sneering kind of view that they had of people who are Christians or anything like.

113
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,360
Speaker 1: that is like anyone who's a Christian is deluded.

114
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:33,474
Speaker 1: I agree that they are deluded at being an ex Christian myself, but also that they're stupid or Dumb in some way and that's not true.

115
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:40,952
Speaker 1: The reason why lots of Christians stay Christians is because they have Spiritual experiences which are real to them.

116
00:07:41,173 --> 00:08:10,840
Speaker 1: They're not real as in God doesn't really exist and therefore the spiritual experience actually means something in a spiritual way Like God is telling them something but the experience that they go through the the heightened you know heart rate and all of these are the things that you have when you have a Like a spiritual level spiritual type, you know peak experience that actually is fulfilling and is actually something which means something to people and It's and and they get it regularly from church.

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:21,460
Speaker 1: I you know, I worked for God TV and my job was to go around Christian conferences and you know Mix music that was being you know recorded for the TV and do sound technician stuff and I did that kind of stuff.

118
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:39,352
Speaker 1: so in one year, I went from conference to conference to conference and Saw lots of people, you know doing all kinds of stuff being slain in the spirit and talking in tongues and you know Raising their hands and all the weird kind of stuff that you see on like the Jesus camp, you know DVD No the movie whatever it was called Jesus can't be heard about that.

119
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:39,592
Speaker 0: Yep.

120
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,520
Speaker 2: I've said we saw a trailer for okay.

121
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:43,489
Speaker 1: So anyway, I started watching that.

122
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,940
Speaker 1: I couldn't watch it all the way through because that used to be my life.

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,767
Speaker 2: I didn't watch the trailer.

124
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,260
Speaker 1: I used to be that kid.

125
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,689
Speaker 1: I went to a Jesus camp in that way.

126
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,740
Speaker 1: and the thing is those experiences are real.

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,487
Speaker 1: they actually mean something to people.

128
00:08:55,587 --> 00:09:09,723
Speaker 1: and this is a thing that they see that all of these new atheists and all these people that Were at this conference that I went to the town London last year and all these different things that are going on They missed the fact that these experiences are Valuable to people.

129
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:10,325
Speaker 1: they're wrong.

130
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,171
Speaker 1: I mean the people who are experiencing them.

131
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,636
Speaker 1: are you know, they're?

132
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:14,298
Speaker 1: what am I trying to say?

133
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:14,639
Speaker 1: They're not.

134
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,746
Speaker 0: Well, they're definitely.

135
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:17,550
Speaker 2: I don't think anyone.

136
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:17,932
Speaker 2: you mean.

137
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:23,640
Speaker 0: I would say that if they are intelligent There are people who they're smart atheists and stupid atheists and they're smart Christians and stupid Christians.

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:39,460
Speaker 0: We can't say all X's are why but at the same time I believe someone who is intelligent Even if they're having these experiences must over the course of their lives either ignore things They see or build up this kind of debt of cognitive dissonance that eventually something has to give.

139
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, cognitive dissonance is pretty much the way Christians live their lives.

140
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,652
Speaker 2: I don't see, you know, I don't know.

141
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:57,000
Speaker 2: maybe the people at the time London were different But I mean most of the atheist writings I see even grumpy old Richard Dawkins Right, all the all his stuff and mostly Carl Sagan stuff is all about having spiritual.

142
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,834
Speaker 2: You know those levels of like looking at the sky and thinking I know look at that.

143
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:07,175
Speaker 2: There's so many stars out there There's more stars and they're like grain of sand grains of sand on the beach.

144
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 2: Holy shit It's like oh my god.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 2: And if you do if you go out there and you know that and you look at the sky You can have that, you know a very similar experience.

146
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:27,879
Speaker 0: That's why Carl Sagan or like Alan Watts resonated so much because they did take the I guess it's kind of the Framing these experiences saying look you can have these experiences or anything because those experiences are life.

147
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,004
Speaker 2: Yes I mean nobody's.

148
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:32,100
Speaker 2: I don't think anyone's saying that experiences like that aren't worthwhile.

149
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:35,340
Speaker 2: I think what they're saying is look here's someone who goes to church.

150
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,930
Speaker 2: They're getting these experiences regularly from church right and they like them.

151
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:39,913
Speaker 2: who wouldn't right?

152
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:42,140
Speaker 2: That's that's you know part of life, right?

153
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:48,540
Speaker 2: But yet if they're smart, they would know that those experiences could be had without church.

154
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,072
Speaker 2: So why would they continue to go to church?

155
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:51,695
Speaker 2: and would it?

156
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,600
Speaker 1: maybe this is the thing?

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,098
Speaker 2: Why would they continue to pay money to the church or whatever it is when they could just go and get it without?

158
00:10:57,138 --> 00:11:00,671
Speaker 1: this is The church is actually providing a service.

159
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,397
Speaker 1: You are going along there.

160
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:03,260
Speaker 1: You're following the rules.

161
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:04,673
Speaker 1: It's like it's like role-playing.

162
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:05,339
Speaker 1: It's like in it.

163
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,806
Speaker 1: It's like a game that they're playing.

164
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:09,757
Speaker 1: they're going along and there is sort of like certain games.

165
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:10,500
Speaker 1: Well, it's not games.

166
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,228
Speaker 1: You know if you go out to the front at the church and you're getting prayed for and the pastor is standing there and holding On to you and you know and praying for you.

167
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:24,180
Speaker 1: It's like you have to respond to it in some way Otherwise because the pastor or the minister will keep praying for you until he gets a response.

168
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,786
Speaker 1: So it's one of those things that it's sort of like.

169
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,723
Speaker 1: it's like a game that they play but they you know consciously or unconsciously They know.

170
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:30,567
Speaker 1: if they keep going to it.

171
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:31,733
Speaker 1: They're gonna get attention.

172
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,907
Speaker 1: They're gonna get like a whole Group of like.

173
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:42,980
Speaker 1: you've seen these televangelists and stuff Thousands of people all putting out their hands and praying for one person for that one person to be the center of attention.

174
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:50,989
Speaker 1: That's the only time that they've ever had a thousand people looking in their way all wishing them You know a fantastic experience all blessing them.

175
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:51,772
Speaker 2: go get some friends.

176
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,254
Speaker 2: It's free.

177
00:11:52,314 --> 00:11:53,619
Speaker 0: Maybe they don't realize they can't.

178
00:11:53,659 --> 00:12:00,017
Speaker 1: maybe Is that this kind of thing is never addressed by any of these new atheists.

179
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,567
Speaker 1: they do address Hey life is excellent.

180
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:06,209
Speaker 1: and Carl say, you know when I listen to that Symphony of Science song What was it called?

181
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,535
Speaker 1: You know the Yeah, the glorious dawn one You know and that is that sort of made me tear up the first time I heard that.

182
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:14,117
Speaker 1: and there was another.

183
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,680
Speaker 1: one of his songs that it may you know was also a. You know, we are all connected or whatever.

184
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,273
Speaker 1: That one was called.

185
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:19,580
Speaker 1: that was good.

186
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,819
Speaker 1: The rest of them sound all the same and they annoy me now.

187
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,468
Speaker 1: But you know when the first time you hear that.

188
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:26,040
Speaker 1: that affects me because I know what they're talking about.

189
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,977
Speaker 1: I know about astronomy and I know about science and I know about.

190
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,395
Speaker 1: you know that we are all star stuff and all that kind of stuff.

191
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:35,512
Speaker 1: and Richard Dawkins opens his God delusion with the things like.

192
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:38,443
Speaker 1: I lay on my back and I looked up at the stars and I thought It was wonderful.

193
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:47,810
Speaker 1: and he has this kind of rapturous experience thinking about Thinking about what we're trying to say You know evolution and all like all the science stuff that he does.

194
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,488
Speaker 1: he looks at it and finds it wondrous and gets that kind Of spiritual fulfillment out of it.

195
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,420
Speaker 1: However, it takes a lot to get to that point.

196
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,420
Speaker 1: It's very difficult to get to the point.

197
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,999
Speaker 1: It happens sometimes with me like for the first time I ever managed to.

198
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,164
Speaker 1: well I say it takes a lot.

199
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:07,520
Speaker 1: the first time I ever managed to juggle three balls for like 30 catches and then stop when I Wanted to rather than dropping them.

200
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:22,553
Speaker 1: That's still one of these peak experiences in my life and the next time I had that same level of experience from juggling That same like a comparable experience was when I managed to do 11 balls for the first time, you know and there was a lot of a gap in between that and that the 11 ball experiences.

201
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:28,880
Speaker 1: when I just got into a car crash flipped My van over going down the steepest road and he jumped out of the car and took all the balls out.

202
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,295
Speaker 1: I was waiting there and I was so frustrated.

203
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,020
Speaker 1: I was so hyped up.

204
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:40,014
Speaker 1: I was like, right I'm gonna do this and it was the first time I ever managed to do 11 balls Not the ambulance.

205
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:50,282
Speaker 1: I was waiting Anyway, I was waiting for the tow truck to come and take away my utterly smashed up vehicle and then waiting for someone to come And pick me up, you know, it was one of those bad things but it was.

206
00:13:50,443 --> 00:14:03,104
Speaker 1: it was this weird combination of a car accident smashing my car up and Then and Then doing this juggling feat and at the time maybe like six or seven other people in the world had ever done 11 balls And I was then one of them.

207
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:10,596
Speaker 1: so it's like a high-level thing and it affected my life in in a way Like like I didn't go back to university the next year.

208
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:11,520
Speaker 1: I mean it was one of those things.

209
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,520
Speaker 1: It's like I could have died then and yet I've had this experience and I need to move on with my life.

210
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,020
Speaker 1: It was a life-changing experience.

211
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:33,520
Speaker 1: It's difficult to have those kind of experiences and this is probably the main reason why I'm Why I turned away from being a Christian because you know the whole cognitive dissonance and the whole self-delusion stuff that helped me all Over all of like the scientific questions and and God and stuff for a long time.

212
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:38,980
Speaker 1: But it got to the point where I was like, okay, I believe Jesus exists or but might not have been God.

213
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,751
Speaker 1: It was good and you know, I'm not.

214
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,959
Speaker 1: I believe in evolution I believe the world is old, you know There's all these different questions that you sort out.

215
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:52,051
Speaker 1: But there was this whole thing in my head or not just in my head but in my body is like all these spiritual experience that I've had.

216
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:53,997
Speaker 1: they must be true at some level.

217
00:14:54,077 --> 00:15:26,497
Speaker 1: otherwise because what I Experienced was real and it was only when I had many other peak experiences outside of a religious context outside of a church context outside of a like classically spiritual context when I actually lost my faith completely and I could identify myself as an atheist or maybe a agnostic or but you know it took me a while to actually work out what it was, but I realized I didn't need the church anymore for the like the Spiritual peak experiences because I'd taken up surfing and that was good.

218
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:27,120
Speaker 1: I'd been juggling.

219
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,854
Speaker 1: I was performing for the first time to juggling.

220
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:33,334
Speaker 1: when you get like 200 people like giving you a standing ovation for a show that you're doing.

221
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,519
Speaker 1: that's a great feeling, you know.

222
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:44,360
Speaker 1: When you when you like, okay, like do a really high-level juggling trick for the first time It is like a rapturous experience to rival anything that I'd felt in church.

223
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:55,320
Speaker 1: However, I'd had a lot of experiences in church, you know, so it was difficult to sort of like go Ah, it isn't actually the church environment and isn't the Holy Spirit.

224
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:04,700
Speaker 1: But the thing is you need these kind of experiences elsewhere To have people who go to church regularly to not go to church anymore.

225
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:16,419
Speaker 1: That needs that need has to be fulfilled and it's not going to be fulfilled by looking at the stars And it's not going to be fulfilled by thinking about evolution and it's not going to be fulfilled In lots of other ways, you know.

226
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 0: So do we take a bunch of Christians and have drug-fueled raves that are mandatory attendance?

227
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,082
Speaker 1: I'm not.

228
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:26,273
Speaker 1: I think I'm not into the drugs as a spiritual experience.

229
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:28,280
Speaker 1: I have had a spiritual experience is taking drugs.

230
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,340
Speaker 1: I

231
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:42,638
Speaker 0: guess it's more because this raises a lot of interesting kind of Contrast between my own experiences and yours because I've you know Catholic school and I can safely say that there were never peak Experiences were involved with Catholic mass and the way the school and the church and everything.

232
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:51,599
Speaker 0: Yeah Was this terribly boring thing and I'd go to it and from even as a very young child I remember thinking this is all kind of silly and I just never quite got it.

233
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,329
Speaker 2: That's pretty much the same as me with Judaism.

234
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,260
Speaker 0: I had peak experiences outside of school.

235
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,360
Speaker 0: So I think a lot of it is just the context of when you have these first few experiences.

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:11,779
Speaker 0: I'll bet a lot of it is developmental and I think this speaks very very well as to why the modern church Movements are doing so well while Catholicism at least in the Western world is collapsing left and right.

237
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:15,200
Speaker 1: exactly This is what the whole mega church phenomenon is about.

238
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:20,119
Speaker 1: It's give people peak experiences and they will keep coming back week after week.

239
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:22,045
Speaker 1: They run these things like rock shows.

240
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:31,240
Speaker 1: they have you know all the lights going on and thumping music and they'll have a pastor who's really You know enthusiastic and charismatic and is leading people into like a frenzy.

241
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:32,864
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

242
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:33,628
Speaker 1: It really is.

243
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:39,831
Speaker 1: if you ever go to one of these things, it's a big show And and people get something out of it.

244
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,300
Speaker 1: and what what do the atheists have in return?

245
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:42,802
Speaker 1: I went to this.

246
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:45,480
Speaker 1: I say I went to this Tam London and I might be going again this year.

247
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,621
Speaker 1: It's in.

248
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:51,593
Speaker 1: it's in a few weeks time in October and I've just got a gig at the moment Which means I could probably end up in London the day beforehand.

249
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,939
Speaker 1: So I probably gonna go again this year.

250
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:59,045
Speaker 1: however, it was you know, lots of people sitting round and listening to conferences and it was.

251
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:09,703
Speaker 1: there was only one point in it where I thought this is even slightly comparable to the excitement of a quite average Church service.

252
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,951
Speaker 0: now here here is where I can make a point.

253
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,352
Speaker 0: Finally.

254
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,115
Speaker 0: I was thinking about this.

255
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:16,023
Speaker 0: so I get experiences like this.

256
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:23,324
Speaker 0: a lot of people get these very strong peak experiences from things like the penny arcade expo and the way they Rile up the crowd in this huge thousands of people.

257
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:35,388
Speaker 0: and I don't think it's fair to say that atheists don't have the same thing because I would argue that anything that Is not a religious event is by definition a neutral event Which therefore is an atheist event.

258
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:50,080
Speaker 0: So every single rock concert in the world I'd say it's a secular event rather than an atheist event because I I feel secularism and atheism are The same I would argue except that someone who's specifically a secularist is entertaining cognitive dissonance.

259
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:54,946
Speaker 2: hmm, maybe anyway, whatever your Semantic point was right.

260
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:57,152
Speaker 0: The thing is boy was that we get these peak like.

261
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,055
Speaker 1: yeah, that's what I'm saying.

262
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,560
Speaker 1: However, what?

263
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:08,760
Speaker 1: What can an atheist movement offer To Christian people to bring them away from Christians, which has got something to do with atheism.

264
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,285
Speaker 1: But you know, this is we think.

265
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:14,155
Speaker 1: maybe I saw what the thing that really impressed me was.

266
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:15,660
Speaker 1: it was a musician called Tim Minchin.

267
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,260
Speaker 1: He's from Australia, but I think he lives in the UK most of the year now, and he is just awesome.

268
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,731
Speaker 1: He was funnier than anybody else who appeared on that stage.

269
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,920
Speaker 1: He was a better musician than all of the other musicians.

270
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:33,560
Speaker 1: He actually set had a message which was more poignant and In a way more interesting than any other people and he was just an all-around better entertainer.

271
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,180
Speaker 1: It's a good job that I'm a better juggler than him.

272
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,617
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I think I'd feel inadequate in every single way because he also juggles.

273
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:43,073
Speaker 1: No, he doesn't juggle I'm saying now at all because I'm a better juggler than him.

274
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:54,389
Speaker 1: I can I still have My own worth because he is so because he and because he is so awesome in so many ways that I just feel Insignificant next to him.

275
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,895
Speaker 2: if that makes sense, maybe Because you said that you're a better juggler that implied that he had some amount of drug.

276
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:00,096
Speaker 1: No.

277
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:00,839
Speaker 1: No, it's because.

278
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,346
Speaker 1: well Maybe watch your secret skills.

279
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:02,809
Speaker 0: You don't know.

280
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:06,785
Speaker 1: I mean he could just bust out with like a seven 27 balls at home.

281
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:17,032
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is that that when I actually watched him I came in when he was doing a year when he was doing a like his sound Set up and he sang this song.

282
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:30,185
Speaker 1: and then he's like I'm gonna do it again But I'm gonna do it with the piano and he went did the same song again word for word But this time played along to the backing track on the piano and I must admit I had one of those fan moments that I Have only very very rarely But it was amazing.

283
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:33,807
Speaker 1: But then again, I go to a juggling convention, which isn't an atheist event But then there's.

284
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:37,711
Speaker 1: it's a very secular event Let me put it that way like there's nothing to do with spirituality there.

285
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:48,439
Speaker 1: and there was a few times when I saw people on stage In their theater shows and with their juggling which made me have that same kind of experience And I had a really good massage and I almost had a spiritual experience in there.

286
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,345
Speaker 1: But you understand that.

287
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:55,420
Speaker 1: but the thing is it's like what are you gonna do with the skeptics in the pub?

288
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,280
Speaker 1: It's you're getting together and there is fellowship there, which is a big thing And I think that's something that the like the new atheist movement is getting

289
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:13,080
Speaker 0: Part of it's that the new the so-called new atheist movement or the very kind of vocal act of atheist the people who get to The point where I'm going to run and have an atheist convention are not the majority and they're not the real atheist movement.

290
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:21,700
Speaker 0: I would argue that the primary real atheist movement is Kids growing up now who are entertained by the internet and entertained by other things who just don't even care at all about religion.

291
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:33,806
Speaker 2: It's because they're getting peak experiences basically constantly from the the infinite piles of entertainment media and Information, you know It's like just like you you watch.

292
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:38,420
Speaker 2: you can get like big experiences watching even little videos of TED Talks or YouTube's or whatever.

293
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,080
Speaker 2: Yeah, just because you know and the thing is is you were complaining that some of these like people at the amazing meeting were you?

294
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:46,667
Speaker 2: Calling like Christian stupid.

295
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:58,378
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is there are some ways to get experiences that would be sort of inaccessible to people who are stupid like if I watch a TED Talk I might be like Oh my god, that was amazing.

296
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:08,920
Speaker 2: But if somebody isn't as educated right or intelligent or whatever, you know, they might Watch it and just be like what you know some hick from the woods watching it.

297
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,347
Speaker 2: It's like what that word mean?

298
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:12,700
Speaker 2: He doesn't you know, he's not gonna get experience from it.

299
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,199
Speaker 2: So that's why you might get this or you know somebody.

300
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:21,540
Speaker 2: well You might not have had that much excitement at the amazing meeting and most of the things I enjoyed.

301
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:31,417
Speaker 2: No, no, I mean you might not have had such great, you know, like amazing, you know experiences at every ed Like just sitting there watching people talk, you know, someone else might have found what they were saying.

302
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:41,452
Speaker 0: Just so Fascinating, you know, but at the same time I think his point stands that for the kinds of people who go to like these Megachurches there are very few things that can offer that same sort of experience.

303
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:41,853
Speaker 0: football.

304
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:42,896
Speaker 1: Yeah football.

305
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:43,598
Speaker 1: Is it sports?

306
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:52,760
Speaker 0: I would say They can't offer the same sort of experience framed in this kind of bigger that like watching football you can get really into it.

307
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,715
Speaker 0: But you can't feel it as some sort of universe changing event.

308
00:22:57,277 --> 00:23:00,480
Speaker 2: unless you're crazy This is pretty universe changing.

309
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,360
Speaker 1: The thing is you have to be seriously into your football team for it to become like a life-changing experience.

310
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:11,780
Speaker 2: You know, I'm a fan, but I'm not like seriously into it, right?

311
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,540
Speaker 2: You don't see stuff hanging up my house, but you know, I'm a Giants fan, right?

312
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,060
Speaker 2: You know.

313
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:23,928
Speaker 2: But if you if I watch that video from Super Bowl 42, I can watch that a thousand times and it is good Every time.

314
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:25,538
Speaker 2: you know, it does not get old.

315
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,360
Speaker 0: Well consider this one of the piquest experiences of my life and it's funny.

316
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:37,100
Speaker 0: But this this very much like this moment is burned into my mind is when Scott and I had a bunch of reference went to RIT hockey game and it was like the important hockey game.

317
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:40,536
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the best and they were down by two and it was standing room only.

318
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:41,440
Speaker 0: We're like crunched in.

319
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,365
Speaker 0: We're not even in seats.

320
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,676
Speaker 0: We're kind of there semi illegally like just standing there.

321
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:45,480
Speaker 2: We're not illegal.

322
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,227
Speaker 0: We weren't actually sitting in seats.

323
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:48,753
Speaker 0: We should have been off in the standing area.

324
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:49,275
Speaker 2: That's fun.

325
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:50,520
Speaker 0: And all our friends leave.

326
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:57,187
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, it's over They've lost and we stuck out to the end and they won in this like crazy Goal with a few minutes left.

327
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:58,272
Speaker 2: So they were down by one.

328
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:02,654
Speaker 2: then with like two seconds left They scored to tie it up and then they scored in overtime.

329
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, and won it.

330
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,080
Speaker 0: It was such a peak experience.

331
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,923
Speaker 0: But Scott, what if you?

332
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:10,080
Speaker 0: what if someone takes that same level of experience or that same exact experience?

333
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:18,368
Speaker 0: but for whatever Trickery or belief or something are able to frame it in such a way to where that wasn't just a hockey game That's the world.

334
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:19,740
Speaker 0: That's your soul, right?

335
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,920
Speaker 2: They're basically, you know, as soon as the thing is it's okay to just have a hockey game, right?

336
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,324
Speaker 2: But for someone to try to come in with that extra bit Right is there?

337
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:37,817
Speaker 2: that person is actively trying to deceive you usually with the intent to give you For them to you know for to get you to give them money or to give them loyalty.

338
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:39,920
Speaker 0: Forget about their intent.

339
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,734
Speaker 0: The thing is they're offering more at face value.

340
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:46,739
Speaker 0: if I offer you a hundred bucks This other guy offers you a hundred bucks and a check for three thousand dollars.

341
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:57,300
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that whatever all these things is is true And I do think this is what the church has got something going for it because it is a repeatable experience.

342
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,388
Speaker 1: You go along to a to a hockey game.

343
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:02,820
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get that every time, you know, it's it's one of those standout.

344
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:05,643
Speaker 2: Yeah, we haven't had it ever again exactly Things.

345
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:11,808
Speaker 1: but you go to one of these Jesus camps you go to one of these ministry meetings you go to a prayer meeting And and and you go forward to pray.

346
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:15,719
Speaker 1: you're gonna have an experience or maybe not every single time But it's a good chance.

347
00:25:15,841 --> 00:25:20,390
Speaker 1: But then you don't want to do it too often because it's like self Regulating in a way that you don't want it to be.

348
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,479
Speaker 1: too often you can get burnt out and that kind of thing.

349
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:36,279
Speaker 1: but the My entire reason that I wanted to bring this up and why I want to talk to people about this is because this whole Dimension is missing from the whole kind of new atheist or atheistic movement or whatever you want to call it.

350
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:43,880
Speaker 1: It's the discussion of the spirit the very real spiritual experiences that people get from from churches is missing.

351
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:55,037
Speaker 1: It's like people don't know it and I think that people who haven't been Christian or haven't had these Christian experiences Don't know the power of them and why people why it makes people believe.

352
00:25:55,057 --> 00:26:15,012
Speaker 1: because for me It wasn't just a thing that I was going for and it wasn't that I didn't Not believe in science or all these other things except it's just that these experiences to me were very very real experiences and it was only until I had enough of them outside of church that I realized that they Only came from that and I don't think I'm that unintelligent.

353
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:17,480
Speaker 1: I don't think I wasn't very clever back then.

354
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:21,620
Speaker 1: It's just that the experiences were so real and and that's what it came to.

355
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:39,215
Speaker 1: I remember then sitting it with a with a friend of mine a juggler and we were you know Good friends were hanging out in his home and and I was talking about You know about and I said, well, I still believe in some in something spiritual because you know I have had these experiences and this was even like after.

356
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:50,560
Speaker 1: I must have been maybe 22 or 23 at the time and I was just holding on to the fact that there must be a Spiritual element out there because all of these other things I'd always associate them so much with spirituality and all these experiences.

357
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,846
Speaker 1: So there was something there.

358
00:26:52,147 --> 00:27:07,860
Speaker 1: I didn't know what I was feeling and he just said to me Luke It's just people make shit up they just make something up and then they and then they tell it to somebody else and the other person believes it and then they Tell somebody else and that's how everything begins He says it's like the same with you know, all these different stupid.

359
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:11,460
Speaker 1: You know spiritual things and ley lines and I can't remember these other things.

360
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:19,535
Speaker 1: But he came up with this whole list of things and this is a guy who you know Has been to the Glastonbury Festival all the time, you know, all these different things.

361
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:24,840
Speaker 1: He's sat in the stone circles He's experienced all these things, you know firsthand, but he's just like no, it's all bullshit.

362
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,780
Speaker 1: It's because he just it's all bullshit.

363
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:32,380
Speaker 1: Someone just made up attached some meaning to it and then other people believe them and he says that's how everything starts.

364
00:27:32,661 --> 00:27:36,392
Speaker 1: Somebody just make something up tell somebody else and that's where it all begins.

365
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:44,920
Speaker 1: and it was that moment, which I thought I'm an atheist You know because it really was that time when someone just really told me it's all made up the experiences are real.

366
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,180
Speaker 1: I mean he didn't actually say this but this is what I was saying my brain.

367
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,259
Speaker 1: So all the explanations for all these experiences are just made up.

368
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:56,580
Speaker 1: It's not about standing in the right spot and in the ley lines and then the Sun rises and you having a spiritual experience.

369
00:27:56,902 --> 00:28:07,510
Speaker 1: You're gonna have that spiritual experiences, but these rules around you it's like the lay like somebody actually had a spiritual experience here and then there and then in another place and then they drew lines between Them and said there must be something meaningful at this spot.

370
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,480
Speaker 1: and then they go there, you know, there's some.

371
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:10,842
Speaker 1: What's that?

372
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:11,665
Speaker 0: There's a gas leak.

373
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:21,001
Speaker 1: Well, no, they just I'm just saying they go there and of course, they're gonna have a. It's a preconditioned spiritual experience just waiting for them because of their exponent Expectation.

374
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:29,714
Speaker 1: but the expectation is based on made-up shit that other people have just made up and you believe it Yep, and I'll agree with you that it's very even intelligent.

375
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:30,860
Speaker 0: people are very prone to this.

376
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,791
Speaker 0: It's human nature because you find the pattern.

377
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,500
Speaker 0: when I was in middle school when I was in high school I mean, I'm an atheist now and I've never been a Christian.

378
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:45,478
Speaker 0: but when I was young I got to the point where I was convinced that I could tell the future with tarot cards because it always worked and I would tell people people's fortunes.

379
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:49,333
Speaker 0: and I actually People were afraid of me in high school and I would tell their fortunes.

380
00:28:49,393 --> 00:29:01,260
Speaker 0: and I wasn't until just before I got to went to college at RIT and I was Watching a documentary on cold reading and I'm sitting there and literally like I think the moment I saw that.

381
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,723
Speaker 2: Oh shit the thing Oh shit,

382
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:05,616
Speaker 0: and I sat down and I went through like the motions and you're

383
00:29:05,636 --> 00:29:07,328
Speaker 1: like, this is what I did And this is what I did.

384
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:08,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I sat down with one of my friends.

385
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:10,571
Speaker 0: I was like, I'm gonna tell your fortune as I was doing it.

386
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:13,067
Speaker 0: I realized I'm just telling him everything He told me last week.

387
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,680
Speaker 2: Oh my god This is why I saw that documentary and cold reading much earlier in life than you did.

388
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:27,680
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know and I think you know Luke your whole point is, you know The atheists aren't paying attention to the fact that these you know experiences exist or that they're important.

389
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:38,891
Speaker 2: I think part of it is because you know You are actually sort of in the minority like most of the atheist or non religious people that I know Are people who were never in the.

390
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:44,031
Speaker 2: you know, the kind of religion that has you know The rock concerts in the mega churches and all these sorts of things.

391
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:52,541
Speaker 2: most of the the non religious people I know Were Jews or or they or their their family was non religious or they did something, you know They're.

392
00:29:52,742 --> 00:30:02,550
Speaker 2: any religious life if there was you know, or if they had a pre atheist life was boring and was not, you know They weren't getting any experiences from any religious source.

393
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,480
Speaker 2: They were getting if they had any, you know, awesome experiences.

394
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:13,177
Speaker 2: They were always from something else, you know, I mean Judaism for me, you know for me and most of the other Jews I know is it's a cultural thing.

395
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:13,960
Speaker 2: It's a cultural thing.

396
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,160
Speaker 2: It's like being Irish, you know, it's like if you're Irish, that doesn't mean there's no religion implied.

397
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,580
Speaker 2: You know, there's Irish Catholics and Protestant Catholic.

398
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,997
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I mean there's Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics and always fighting.

399
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:29,269
Speaker 2: but Being Irish means that you wear green on st.

400
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,396
Speaker 2: Patrick's Day and you get drunk and it has not there's.

401
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:32,620
Speaker 2: no they don't associate any.

402
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,465
Speaker 2: You know, it's called st.

403
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:35,677
Speaker 2: Patrick's Day, but it doesn't have any meaning.

404
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:40,136
Speaker 2: Yeah And Judaism was always the same kind of thing, you know you eat.

405
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,173
Speaker 2: on this day We eat apples and honey.

406
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:50,260
Speaker 2: on this day we eat You know this kind of food and everyone gets together on these certain days of the year to have a party and you know It doesn't mean anything.

407
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:58,890
Speaker 2: They never tried to give us, you know in any of the the religious places we ever went to no one ever tried to give You know any kind of experience?

408
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,300
Speaker 1: No, but the thing is with the Jewish faith.

409
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,586
Speaker 1: Is it's like like you get these charismatic churches, you know Like these mega churches.

410
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:11,000
Speaker 1: they're going for that like the spiritual experience and they're going for the whole fellowship thing as well.

411
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,348
Speaker 1: They're going for the for the community thing.

412
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:16,179
Speaker 1: get together go on, you know and go out and have pizza.

413
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:19,995
Speaker 1: this night Doesn't like pancakes exactly and that's what I think.

414
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:35,360
Speaker 1: that's what the Jewish Religion or the Jewish culture is is so good at and that's why so many people really value their Jewish identities and their culture is because it's such a family thing It's such a community thing and they want to keep that part of it.

415
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:42,000
Speaker 2: The mistake the Jews made at least in the US right is they emphasize education a great deal, right?

416
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:48,400
Speaker 2: You know Judaism itself is about education, you know, they talk about studying the Torah, you know, you're supposed to study, right?

417
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,561
Speaker 2: And if you don't become a rabbi they you know You're.

418
00:31:51,702 --> 00:32:04,159
Speaker 2: they're gonna want you to study to be a doctor or study to be a lawyer or you know It's all about studying and education is very very highly valued Among, you know the generation of Jews before me and also my generation, you know.

419
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:12,400
Speaker 2: So by emphasizing someone to become educated they become They learn science and then they no longer again.

420
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,460
Speaker 1: This is another thing that all the religious people, you know.

421
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,720
Speaker 1: They're down on science and they're down all this kind of stuff there's.

422
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:22,119
Speaker 1: a reason is because when you are educated in that you do lose faith in things.

423
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:28,500
Speaker 1: and Like I say I when I was younger, I was really into dinosaurs and this is talk about coming into dinosaurs.

424
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,962
Speaker 2: Exactly.

425
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,659
Speaker 0: and for me, we're not worship dinosaurs if they came back and could talk.

426
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:35,193
Speaker 1: I'm just saying for me dinosaurs were very impressive.

427
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,360
Speaker 1: I knew the names of lots of them.

428
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,806
Speaker 1: I don't know the many now because they all change and things but I know right the point is In my head.

429
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:44,699
Speaker 1: I knew dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago.

430
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,827
Speaker 1: 64 65 million years ago.

431
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:48,534
Speaker 1: you ever take whatever millions.

432
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:55,920
Speaker 1: but also in my head There was this fact that the earth was very young like between 10 and 6,000 years old or something like that.

433
00:32:56,381 --> 00:33:30,225
Speaker 1: And I I was the kid in geography class who would get a hundred percent on all my exams with geography You know because I was actually quite clever and I knew about this because I lived in out outdoor kind of life and I knew how caves are made and things like that and I knew caves took millions of years to form as well or thousands, you know hundreds of thousands of years to form and yet still I Thought the world was only 10,000 years old, but I looking back now There's absolutely no way I can work out how I thought those two facts fitted together in my head and yet somehow They did.

434
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:44,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I can't explain it except for this massive massive like watching a segmentation in my brain where like reasoning and scientific stuff went in one direction and religious stuff went in the other and There was this very clear dividing line.

435
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:50,646
Speaker 1: and when in what situation I was in where Science would be in one side and Religion would be in the other side.

436
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:53,960
Speaker 2: My brain had sort of a similar but slightly different problem.

437
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,832
Speaker 2: Right is I would go to school and they would teach me history and then I would go to Hebrew school like Tuesday Thursday and Sunday And they would teach you like, you know Moses or whatever, right?

438
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:06,150
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I always try to think okay So when was Moses?

439
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,760
Speaker 2: and when was Alexander the Great?

440
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:10,580
Speaker 2: And the thing was is you know?

441
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:21,730
Speaker 2: This is also part of the reason people keep getting on me about my memory is that my school system actually did one thing That you know throughout my entire public schooling, you know I was in one town and they did.

442
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:33,181
Speaker 2: they actually did one good thing in my opinion Which is they always stayed away from rote memorization, right every single class I was ever in they were like listen Well, this is not about, you know rote memorizing things You know,

443
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,426
Speaker 1: you never learn how to remember

444
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:38,920
Speaker 2: anything would never ask they would never ask you like what year did X happen?

445
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,895
Speaker 0: Scott legitimately asked me in college at one point.

446
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:43,719
Speaker 0: This is at RIT.

447
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:49,420
Speaker 0: He thought that the Romans got the idea for swords and that sort of fighting from the Middle East like the Knights.

448
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:51,393
Speaker 2: You didn't know.

449
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:53,813
Speaker 2: It's like I didn't know.

450
00:34:54,739 --> 00:35:02,826
Speaker 0: If there was a physics test they would give you the equation Over that fact.

451
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,300
Speaker 2: right never have to memorize equations.

452
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,340
Speaker 2: It was all about the ability to solve problems to work things out for you.

453
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,982
Speaker 1: So why?

454
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:18,440
Speaker 2: I'm kind of good at computers and solving problems and those sorts of things, but I'm not good at Memorizing like X and numbers because they said they tried they tried to de-emphasize it.

455
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:25,954
Speaker 2: I think it is too heavily emphasized in most education systems But I think that there was also this problem of not having it at all.

456
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:29,422
Speaker 2: He which I have no Memorizing.

457
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:30,305
Speaker 2: which came first?

458
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:33,416
Speaker 0: Sparta and the whole 300 thing or Alexander the Great.

459
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,682
Speaker 1: Oh Greek.

460
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,132
Speaker 0: well, no, no, no was Macedonian.

461
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:44,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's Sparta was The Dorian.

462
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:47,294
Speaker 2: I'm gonna say the Sparta came first.

463
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:51,718
Speaker 2: All right Yeah, see that that's a hard one.

464
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,329
Speaker 1: I think most people wouldn't be able to know that.

465
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually this comes up with another topic that we might do.

466
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,256
Speaker 2: We could do on a different show Trojan horse and all that kind of shit.

467
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:02,505
Speaker 2: That's about that's The same time as Sparta.

468
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:05,314
Speaker 0: No, that's pre the archaic age of Greece.

469
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:05,635
Speaker 1: Yeah.

470
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:07,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's guys legendary times.

471
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,250
Speaker 2: So wait, so she was that real or was it not real?

472
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,792
Speaker 0: We're not sure.

473
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,524
Speaker 0: we know that there was a city somewhere called Troy.

474
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:22,212
Speaker 0: basically there were Greeks and they stuff happened and they're all mostly gone and Theoretically the Dorian's were kind of Greeks as we know.

475
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:26,476
Speaker 0: them moved into their area like the Sparta We know was founded on the site of.

476
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 2: I gotta get A book because this is getting too important.

477
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,936
Speaker 1: Okay, we could.

478
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:35,596
Speaker 1: I've got this great thing about Another atheist topic, but I think we've gone on quite a long time here.

479
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,079
Speaker 1: Maybe we should.
