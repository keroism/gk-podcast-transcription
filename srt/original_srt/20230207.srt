1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:19,680
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 7th, 2023, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights, tonight we're talking about, not dead games, but mostly dead games.

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,637
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:32,100
Speaker 1: So, uh, just a little while ago, Emily and I ended up, Emily saw this was happening and was just like, I'm gonna get tickets, and we just went, and it was pretty cool.

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:43,500
Speaker 1: But, uh, if you listen to Geek Nights, remember that in ancient, ancient times, we did listen to and talk a little bit about J-Rock, we even interviewed TM Revolution with the help of that guy, I forget his name.

5
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:53,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, back in the days, right, the earlier anime times, it's like, I still like J-Rock, right, but it's not like I listen to it on purpose that often.

6
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,786
Speaker 0: You know, but it's good.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,600
Speaker 0: We've been to a few J-Rock concerts in our day.

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Speaker 1: Well, I just tried, I mean, we saw Hyde at Otacon when they did the full stadium set, I just tried to Google for Geek Nights.

9
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,340
Speaker 0: Well, and then we saw it in the small place, too, right?

10
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:13,520
Speaker 1: I just Googled for Geek Nights TMR, and it was like, did you mean Geek Nights Rym?

11
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:26,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, we saw TMR at Otacon, and then at the bookstore, which I was at the Kinokuniya bookstore yesterday, they didn't have the fountain pen I wanted, so I didn't buy anything.

12
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:33,297
Speaker 1: I gotta see, there's probably some video out there somewhere of us, like, helping that guy ask questions and do that stuff, and... I don't know.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:02:03,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, so, we ended up seeing, there were originally only two iterations of this concert, then they expanded to three, and then they expanded to four, so once in LA, once in Tokyo, and then because it sold out so fast twice in New York City, so we went to the second night, The Last Rockstars is a supergroup that was formed suddenly late last year by Yoshiki, Hyde, Miyabi, and Sugizo, so...

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:10,479
Speaker 0: Right, so basically what happened was, you know, somebody involved in their, one of them, or someone involved in their business was like, "Hey, I need

15
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:10,740
Speaker 0: money.".

16
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, Miyabi's the leader, and it's very clear Miyabi is the stage, like, leader of the band.

17
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:20,538
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, alright, but maybe Miyabi was like, "Hey, listen, I need some

18
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:20,759
Speaker 0: money.".

19
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,960
Speaker 1: Wait, no, a fan said that, the Wikipedia says Yoshiki's the leader.

20
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,219
Speaker 0: Okay, but it doesn't matter.

21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:35,676
Speaker 0: Regardless, the point is, somebody was sitting around, this is what I'm guessing, right, which is an educated guess, was like, "Hey, pandemic times really hurt us, right?

22
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:36,878
Speaker 0: You know, we need

23
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:37,139
Speaker 0: money.".

24
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:43,051
Speaker 0: All these guys are real famous, but the people in their bands aren't as famous.

25
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:47,640
Speaker 0: You know, that happens in a lot of bands, right, where there's one person who's more famous than the other members.

26
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,500
Speaker 0: Sometimes you have a band where everyone's equal famous, or even if they're not equal famous, they're all famous enough on their own.

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,620
Speaker 1: You get the band where one person thinks they're more famous than everybody else, but they're not.

28
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:09,040
Speaker 0: Right, but there are several bands, many, where one person is significantly famous and the other people can be replaced and nobody would know except hardcore fans, right?

29
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:23,720
Speaker 0: And so, they're not quite in that category, right, I don't want to disrespect the other band members, right, because they are quite good, but these people are significantly more famous than the other members of their band, mostly.

30
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:36,720
Speaker 1: You know, I always think back to that moment in "That Thing You Do" where the band's having the, you know, pseudo Beatles problem, and there's just a random scene where, like, they don't have, I think, their bassist, maybe one of the guitar players anymore.

31
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:46,500
Speaker 1: So, they go to a studio session and the studio's like, "Oh, we got a guy, don't worry about it," and some random guy just plays and they're skeptical and then he's way better than any of them ever were at the guitar.

32
00:03:48,261 --> 00:04:00,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you're looking for someone who's just really good at, you know, music, right, and you don't care about, like, their star power, you're probably going to find someone better than someone who's in, right?

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,720
Speaker 1: If I needed people to play instruments, I would literally hire a bunch of house and studio musicians.

34
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,722
Speaker 0: I mean, you mentioned Beatles, right?

35
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:13,108
Speaker 0: There's that guy who's, like, you know, his whole life is like, "I could've been in the Beatles," right?

36
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:20,596
Speaker 0: He's, like, out there doing shit in the UK and he's on TV once in a blue moon, like, trying to, you know, be like, "I could've,".

37
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,519
Speaker 0: he's like, "Ah, Ringo, that guy took my

38
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,020
Speaker 0: job!".

39
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,844
Speaker 0: He's like, "It could've been

40
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:24,904
Speaker 0: me!"

41
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:25,365
Speaker 0: Right?

42
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:30,700
Speaker 0: But it's, like, first of all, Ringo's a better drummer than, you know, people who don't understand drumming understand.

43
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:31,726
Speaker 0: Like, "Really?

44
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:32,472
Speaker 0: Could it have been?

45
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:33,399
Speaker 0: Really?".

46
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:47,440
Speaker 0: And second of all, you know, Ringo has, you know, 10,000 billion star power and that guy is cranky old guy, so it's, like, there was no way that guy was going to conduct a train or anything like that, right?

47
00:04:47,880 --> 00:05:00,438
Speaker 0: So, but yeah, they said, "Hey, all these guys, you're all super mega famous, you haven't made money in a while because pandoodles and other problems, you know, someone, let's all get together and we'll just tour and do,".

48
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,120
Speaker 0: I don't even know what music, just do something.

49
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:03,520
Speaker 0: If all of you are together.

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Speaker 1: And they seem to be trying to, like, do a bunch of different kinds of songs and a bunch of duets and, like, they're really- I

51
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:21,759
Speaker 0: think they don't know, you know, it's no surprise that there's no creative direction, it's just, "Let's all get together and if we are all on stage at the same time and sell tickets, we'll make money, so let's figure all the rest out later, we can make it

52
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:22,200
Speaker 0: happen.".

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,663
Speaker 0: Right?

54
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,299
Speaker 0: We're musicians, we can do it.

55
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:41,799
Speaker 1: And I think it was the first concert I went to since the pandoodle began and it was actually, they did a long, full set, including the, "We won't come out to do the encore until you yell, but we also won't turn up the house lights at any point, so you'd better yell or we're not coming

56
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,039
Speaker 1: out.".

57
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've been to mostly, you know, I don't want to call them concerts, but, like, you go there and people play, you know, DJs play music.

58
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:53,294
Speaker 0: But it's not the club, it's at a concert venue, so I guess you call that a show?

59
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:54,157
Speaker 0: I don't know what you call that.

60
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,040
Speaker 0: This was, like, a packed- But we've- I've been to, I guess, a handful of pandoodle concerts.

61
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,360
Speaker 1: But what was really interesting is, it was at the Hammerstein Ballroom and that's a fine venue.

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,080
Speaker 0: I've been there one time.

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's okay venue.

64
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:21,760
Speaker 1: But, uh, because it was J-Rock, it attracts, like, you saw, we were walking toward the venue and we assumed there'll be, like, a line because, you know, nerds really got to get in to get the exclusive merch and, like, be at the very front and, like, flip out about it.

65
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't care, but I just ignore people who do that.

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were fine just being in the bag.

67
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:25,386
Speaker 1: We didn't care.

68
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,471
Speaker 1: We just wanted to go to the concert.

69
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:28,560
Speaker 1: So, uh, we see the line.

70
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:31,220
Speaker 0: It sounds the same in most areas of the room.

71
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,980
Speaker 1: I would say the line looked identical to the line at every single anime movie we've ever seen in the city.

72
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:45,580
Speaker 1: It looked like it might as well have been an anime con, but that line was the longest line I've ever stood in in a New York City street.

73
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,140
Speaker 1: It looks like, based on the detritus on the street and all the hand warmers, people had been lined up probably all day.

74
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,659
Speaker 0: Why would you, I don't know.

75
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Speaker 1: We got there, like, 20 minutes before doors opened and it took us an hour to get in just because it took that long for the line to get through security.

76
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:09,600
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, some, I don't know how long ago it was, months, weeks, I don't remember exactly, but it was cold, so it was either, I think it was December or January.

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,128
Speaker 1: Oh, this was so cold, I expected to be outside for maybe a half hour.

78
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:18,400
Speaker 1: I was 20 minutes away from Frostnip on my toes because I was just wearing, like, my running shoes.

79
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:24,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we had tickets to go see a concert, this girl, Beck Yeddon, alright?

80
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,872
Speaker 0: And the tickets only said on them, right, 7 o'clock.

81
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:31,780
Speaker 0: It didn't say anything else on it.

82
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,747
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's dangerous!

83
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,633
Speaker 1: Is that doors?

84
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:34,460
Speaker 1: Is that, like...

85
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,823
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

86
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:42,758
Speaker 0: But, you know, I got there and I'm like, alright, we went to, it was in the place near Union Square, right?

87
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:43,420
Speaker 0: I forget the name.

88
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,700
Speaker 0: It's not the best place, but it was fine.

89
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, but, you know, we're just eating and it was, oh, it was definitely during holiday times because I remember the holiday market was open.

90
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:03,840
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we went to the holiday market, you know, we're eating in the park, you know, got some pizza, you know, and then we go to try to get in the line, you know, go see what's doing.

91
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:08,232
Speaker 0: And the line is, like, wrapped around the entire block and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

92
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,860
Speaker 0: I'm like, it's almost 7, what's going on, right?

93
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Speaker 0: It's like, um, but yeah, we ended up waiting in the cold and if I would have known, I would have shown up later.

94
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,144
Speaker 1: Yup.

95
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,899
Speaker 0: Rather than wait in the cold.

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,061
Speaker 1: But it was a good time.

97
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,507
Speaker 1: I, uh, it's not like I forgot how much I like live music.

98
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:32,700
Speaker 1: It's more that no matter how much you think you like live music, when you're actually at a venue listening to live music, it's always better than you remember.

99
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,288
Speaker 0: Mm, depends.

100
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,340
Speaker 0: I've been to some...

101
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,659
Speaker 1: I mean, the band is bad or the roadies are bad.

102
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,008
Speaker 0: There is bad live music.

103
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,577
Speaker 0: That can happen.

104
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:40,080
Speaker 0: It's a thing.

105
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, let's assume the band is good because I will never forget the moment.

106
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:46,140
Speaker 1: This was, like, years before the pandemic.

107
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,020
Speaker 1: Emily and I went to Wildwood, like, by ourselves just for, like, a weekend for fun.

108
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:51,989
Speaker 1: And we got into town kind of late.

109
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,920
Speaker 1: You know, Wildwood, there's not a lot of restaurants open late.

110
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,300
Speaker 1: So, we're walking around and we hear down the street what sounds like some of the worst karaoke I've ever heard.

111
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:08,032
Speaker 1: And we're talking, like, "Well, that place is clearly open and probably has, like, a late night bar menu.

112
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:11,179
Speaker 1: We can suffer through the bad karaoke and get some

113
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:11,459
Speaker 1: food."

114
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,626
Speaker 1: And then we get there and that is not karaoke.

115
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:20,700
Speaker 1: That is not just a band, but a band that has their name on the marquee outside.

116
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:25,129
Speaker 0: There's that, um, is it still open?

117
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,940
Speaker 0: I guess it's still, yeah, I guess it's still a thing.

118
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:33,800
Speaker 0: One of the touristy things in Times Square in New York is Ellen's Stardust Diner or Eileen's.

119
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:34,295
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

120
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,223
Speaker 0: Ellen's Stardust Diner.

121
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:43,240
Speaker 0: It's basically a diner that has, you know, like, a 50s Greece style kind of show, right, while you're eating or whatever.

122
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,879
Speaker 1: Like the kind of thing you'd see in an amusement park.

123
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

124
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,909
Speaker 0: And it's, I think, I guess it's still there when I walked past it and I just checked.

125
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:55,000
Speaker 0: I don't, but I haven't seen, like, a line or anything at it recently when I, the Times I've walked past it.

126
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:59,640
Speaker 0: But they're, apparently, the internet says it's open, so I guess there are times when you can go to it.

127
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:07,520
Speaker 0: And I always remember my family was in New York City at one time and we were gonna eat there and we went in and we were seated, right?

128
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:15,980
Speaker 0: And we sat down and just, like, it was so loud and obnoxious in there, we stood up and left within, like, a minute.

129
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,396
Speaker 0: It was like we waited in a short line, we were seated, it was very crowded and loud, and then a minute later we're just like, "Let's not eat here.

130
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,197
Speaker 0: Let's get out of

131
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:25,458
Speaker 0: here.".

132
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:37,060
Speaker 1: So one of the last shows I saw before the pandoodle was, we randomly went with some family friends to Cafe Wa, which is, if you're in New York City, it is an infamous venue.

133
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,440
Speaker 1: They put on a great house show, but it's basically a house band playing a variety of random music.

134
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:54,600
Speaker 1: And they're all individually good musicians, but it is also a loud, raucous place and it is definitely not managed well as a venue, is what I'm gonna say.

135
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,720
Speaker 0: There's a lot of places that are not managed well as a venue, right?

136
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,300
Speaker 1: So yeah, that was a fun time.

137
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,600
Speaker 0: Those are the ones that make the noise complaints from the neighbors, right?

138
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:15,540
Speaker 1: I mean, I still remember the one time I went to an actually illegal venue that was in the basement of a random brownstone in Brooklyn where I needed to go outside to get some fresh air.

139
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:23,434
Speaker 1: And as me and Chase walk outside, there's a guy who clearly works for the venue who's telling anyone who walks out, "Yo, disperse.

140
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,099
Speaker 1: You cannot let the neighbors know there's a concert going on in

141
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:26,259
Speaker 1: here.".

142
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:39,898
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, there's like a hundred people loudly smoking outside of this random brownstone in Brooklyn at like 2 a.m So it's the kind of venue where you're sitting there and you're like, "Wow, if there's a fire, literally everyone in here is going to

143
00:11:39,938 --> 00:11:40,179
Speaker 1: die.".

144
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:42,999
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was fun.

145
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:44,907
Speaker 1: So a lot of news.

146
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:48,079
Speaker 1: So before we get into that, I want to start by giving a quick review.

147
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,439
Speaker 1: This is relevant to the main bit too.

148
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,298
Speaker 1: As you know, I still play DDR.

149
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:58,000
Speaker 1: I'm real good at DDR for being over 40.

150
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,820
Speaker 1: And I can't pass Max 300 anymore, but I can pass pretty much everything else.

151
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,367
Speaker 1: And I play DDR a lot.

152
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,640
Speaker 1: It's like one of my main exercises, especially in the winter.

153
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:08,218
Speaker 1: It's a lifestyle hobby for me.

154
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:16,760
Speaker 1: And one of my two remaining legit soft but serious good quality DDR pads died.

155
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,117
Speaker 1: The second one's dying.

156
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 0: Not repairable or reinforceable?

157
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:23,632
Speaker 1: One of them, irreparable.

158
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:24,480
Speaker 1: It is dead dead.

159
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,993
Speaker 1: The second one, dying.

160
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,500
Speaker 1: But I am doing heroic measures to keep it going.

161
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,555
Speaker 1: Because when I thought to myself, "Oh, one

162
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:33,917
Speaker 1: died."

163
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,060
Speaker 1: Let's one, stabilize the second one and try to extend its life.

164
00:12:38,121 --> 00:12:40,019
Speaker 1: And two, let's buy some new ones.

165
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,920
Speaker 1: There really aren't DDR pads to buy anymore.

166
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,640
Speaker 1: You're going to see bootleg of a bootleg of a bootleg on Amazon.

167
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,560
Speaker 1: Go on eBay and people are selling garbage-looking pads for a hundred bucks.

168
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,355
Speaker 0: Right, because the number of people out there in the world who are going to buy a DDR pad is so small.

169
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:05,899
Speaker 0: It's not worth it to do a production run.

170
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,620
Speaker 0: But I think, I was thinking about this.

171
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,920
Speaker 0: I was like, "You know, the mechanical keyboard people, they do their keycaps, whatever.

172
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,980
Speaker 0: And they'll do these pre-buy deals, a group buy, where people commit and commit their money.

173
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,634
Speaker 0: And then when enough people commit, then they get

174
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:24,399
Speaker 0: manufactured.".

175
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:35,017
Speaker 0: Even though there's a lot of people who are into mechanical keyboard keycaps, people who want that specific design is like, "How many

176
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:35,218
Speaker 0: people?".

177
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:51,559
Speaker 0: So I think somebody could, if they had the means to manufacture DDR pads, could get some sort of group buy and be like, "All right, we're not going to just make DDR pads all the time because no one's buying

178
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:51,720
Speaker 0: them.".

179
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,611
Speaker 0: But when 5,000 people want DDR pads, we will make 5,000 DDR pads all at once.

180
00:13:59,281 --> 00:13:59,502
Speaker 0: Right?

181
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:01,348
Speaker 0: And that'll be that.

182
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:05,560
Speaker 0: And I think that is a way that that sort of thing could be manufactured.

183
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,526
Speaker 1: So I looked around and I basically gave up.

184
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:13,600
Speaker 1: I do not think there are soft pads, even like thick foam, like high quality.

185
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,520
Speaker 0: No, because anyone who still cares about DDR doesn't want a soft pad.

186
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:28,880
Speaker 1: So I decided, you know what, instead of buying bootleg of a bootleg of a bootleg, let's just get the fucking Cobalt Flux that I wanted my whole life because I made a DDR pad at RIT.

187
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,499
Speaker 0: Do they even still exist?

188
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,919
Speaker 1: So they do, except I went to their website and one, it says they're sold out.

189
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,910
Speaker 1: They sell parts, but not the pads.

190
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:44,040
Speaker 1: And they have a warning out that says, "Currently, we do not have an estimate of when new Cobalt Flux pads will be available.

191
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:47,055
Speaker 1: If you're looking for a pad, go to Eltech.

192
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:47,617
Speaker 1: We can't help

193
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:47,758
Speaker 1: you.".

194
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Speaker 0: When's the last time this Cobalt Flux website was even updated?

195
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,240
Speaker 1: I don't know, but the prices...

196
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,149
Speaker 0: Like who runs that company?

197
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,480
Speaker 0: and do they still exist, right?

198
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,620
Speaker 1: So the website is up and they're still selling everything else they got, including replacement parts for Cobalt Fluxes, but they won't sell the pad itself.

199
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,540
Speaker 0: But if you buy one of those, if you put an order in, will you actually receive the order?

200
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,060
Speaker 1: It looks like it based on the digging, but I looked on eBay.

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,160
Speaker 1: A used Cobalt Flux pad goes for like more than what they list a new one for, so that ain't happening.

202
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,817
Speaker 1: So I go to this Eltech thing and it's 400 bucks.

203
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:31,300
Speaker 1: So I read reviews, I looked around, I think it is one of two options that remain.

204
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:38,420
Speaker 1: The only two options left, unless you're going to build your own, which I advise you not to, unless you know what you're doing.

205
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,673
Speaker 1: It is a difficult and challenging thing to do.

206
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:42,055
Speaker 1: well.

207
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,220
Speaker 1: Like you're going to struggle.

208
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:51,900
Speaker 1: So it's either buy the Eltech X-Pro 2 for 400 bucks, or just get a fucking arcade machine, like those are your two options.

209
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,099
Speaker 0: I'd say buy the whole arcade machine, they still make them.

210
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,219
Speaker 1: They do, and I got nowhere to put it, and I looked.

211
00:15:56,219 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 1: $14,000 plus industrial shipping, and the weight would be a problem for an apartment possibly.

212
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,740
Speaker 0: Well, move to Japan, might be cheaper.

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, or I could just buy a house in the suburbs, or we could all pool in and buy one to put in other Scott's house.

214
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:14,600
Speaker 0: But if you live in Japan, you wouldn't need the shipping.

215
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would, you still need industrial shipping, it's an arcade.

216
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 0: But not international industrial shipping.

217
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,097
Speaker 1: I don't think it'd be that much cheaper, the problem is not...

218
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,880
Speaker 0: They could put it on a small truck instead of on a boat or a plane.

219
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is still, this is not like, FedEx delivers your package.

220
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,799
Speaker 1: This is, industrial shipping is a whole fucking thing, but also...

221
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,460
Speaker 0: I'm sure it still costs more to do it from Japan to US than from Japan to Japan.

222
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,400
Speaker 1: So I don't have room for a real arcade machine.

223
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:50,160
Speaker 1: Also, real arcade machines can't easily be modded and increasingly have dangerous DRM, where if you run them outside of Japan and fuck up, they'll break themselves.

224
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:55,460
Speaker 0: Right, but there are people out there who are like, you know, figuring that out, that's the whole thing.

225
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna trust those people to bring those machines to future magfests.

226
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,240
Speaker 1: I live in a New York City apartment.

227
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,119
Speaker 0: Usually when they do that, the machines won't be plugged into the internet.

228
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,679
Speaker 0: You won't be able to register your high scores, or you know.

229
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:12,259
Speaker 1: So I just bought the Eltech pad, and I tried it out.

230
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,366
Speaker 1: And it's great.

231
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,980
Speaker 1: It is, if you want a DDR pad, this is it.

232
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,077
Speaker 1: And the only thing at all I could say negative about it...

233
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,407
Speaker 0: Is the $400 price?

234
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:35,320
Speaker 1: Which honestly, that seems like a deal considering what it costs to get just the pad from an old DDR arcade machine.

235
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,635
Speaker 1: It's worth $400 easily.

236
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:41,560
Speaker 1: I think I spent more than $400.

237
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,578
Speaker 0: You gotta play a lot of DDR.

238
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:51,900
Speaker 1: Which I do, but also I spent almost $400 on the parts to build my two orders of magnitude lower quality DDR pad.

239
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,899
Speaker 1: And that took me like a month to build.

240
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:01,820
Speaker 1: So my sole complaint is that it does not use ribbon switches like arcade machines do.

241
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:10,420
Speaker 1: It uses the two metal pads, like two metal sheets under the arrow, that when they touch each other set off a sensor method.

242
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,216
Speaker 1: Which is fine.

243
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,800
Speaker 0: And this is what, there's like springs separating them or something?

244
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're separated by stuff inside that I don't really want to try to describe.

245
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,940
Speaker 0: But I mean, over time, couldn't like be in permanent contact and then you need to like bend them or something?

246
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,980
Speaker 1: So according to all reviews, that really doesn't happen.

247
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,815
Speaker 1: And these are trivially repairable yourself.

248
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:28,700
Speaker 1: They're easily open.

249
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,593
Speaker 1: They give you all the documentation they need.

250
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:31,360
Speaker 1: They sell you parts.

251
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:32,579
Speaker 1: People make parts.

252
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,840
Speaker 1: But they have zero sensitivity problems.

253
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,180
Speaker 1: Like I can do the thing where you run in place on a single arrow at high speed and it doesn't fucking miss a beat.

254
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:42,899
Speaker 1: It's perfect.

255
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:52,160
Speaker 1: But it makes the slightest of sort of a like squelching settling noise that normal people wouldn't hear, but I definitely hear.

256
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,619
Speaker 1: That ribbon switches don't do.

257
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,778
Speaker 0: Normal people wouldn't hear it, but I hear it.

258
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,390
Speaker 1: As in, I think most people who play.

259
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,960
Speaker 1: DDR would not even think about that noise.

260
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:02,799
Speaker 1: It is so quiet.

261
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,379
Speaker 1: But I hear it and I just acknowledge that it's there.

262
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,480
Speaker 1: It is louder than a soft red octane style inch thick foam pad.

263
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:23,180
Speaker 1: But at the same time, unless you make a DDR pad yourself that uses ribbon switches or you do something crazy like laser sensors, it's not going to get quieter than this.

264
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:33,500
Speaker 1: This is the best damn DDR pad money can buy and I'm getting a second one because I'm a life styler and I do not want to be in a situation where there are no options for me.

265
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,719
Speaker 0: But how long will this thing last?

266
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:37,348
Speaker 1: I imagine forever.

267
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,019
Speaker 1: I think they will outlive me.

268
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,220
Speaker 0: Okay.

269
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident in that.

270
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,999
Speaker 0: It remains to be seen.

271
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Speaker 1: I mean, either this thing will outlive me or I'm going to be 70 and we're going to be doing geek nights and I'm going to do an episode where I am mad as shit that this thing stopped working.

272
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,448
Speaker 0: I'll be like, buy a DDR arcade machine already.

273
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,552
Speaker 0: Buy 20, buy 500th mix or whatever.

274
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:09,960
Speaker 1: So in the news, of course, the Nintendo Direct is coming tomorrow and we can all speculate about what they're going to say.

275
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,760
Speaker 0: If you're listening to this, I imagine most people it'll be like today that the Nintendo Direct already happened.

276
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,955
Speaker 1: There are 20 people who are listening to this right now live on YouTube.

277
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,360
Speaker 1: So those 20 people it's tomorrow.

278
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
Speaker 0: There's a Nintendo Direct tomorrow, everybody.

279
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,605
Speaker 1: Yep.

280
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:34,100
Speaker 1: There's no reason to speculate on what they're going to talk about because almost everyone who reports on what Nintendo is going to cover is lying or making educated guesses.

281
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the educated guesses are going to be right.

282
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:38,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see.

283
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,880
Speaker 1: They're going to say something about Breath of the Wild 2.

284
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,084
Speaker 0: They'll talk about their Mario movie.

285
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:45,660
Speaker 0: They'll talk about the Breath of the Wild 2 that's coming soon and then a whole bunch of stuff that nobody knows.

286
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,286
Speaker 1: Pretty sure.

287
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:47,318
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, you know what?

288
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:47,440
Speaker 0: Here.

289
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,420
Speaker 0: Except the developer.

290
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,324
Speaker 1: I'll play that game.

291
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:54,020
Speaker 1: They're going to finally announce a release date for Advance 4 as 1+2.

292
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,431
Speaker 0: They'll give us, uh, I'm just going to, you know, I'll put it out there, right?

293
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,097
Speaker 0: We'll just, we'll speak it into existence.

294
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:00,080
Speaker 0: F-Zero, let's go.

295
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:01,442
Speaker 1: Yep.

296
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:12,080
Speaker 1: I would not be shocked if there's some sort of Mario Kart announcement only because we just had in another Discord a long conversation about how SNL has never been funny.

297
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaker 1: Like, if you statistically analyze SNL, it has never been funny except for rare extreme exceptions.

298
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:29,097
Speaker 1: And right after that conversation, the next day, SNL released a digital short that was a trailer for a grimdark HBO reboot of Mario Kart.

299
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:30,960
Speaker 1: And the timing seems suspicious.

300
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,001
Speaker 0: I don't know.

301
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:34,428
Speaker 0: They just put, I mean, Mario Kart is still like their top game.

302
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:38,660
Speaker 0: I don't feel like they need to refresh it to get sales up because sales have been up the whole time.

303
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,924
Speaker 0: It's the number one selling game on the Switch.

304
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:49,440
Speaker 0: And they did just release, if you have Nintendo online with expansion pack, there's a DLC for Mario Kart that I think you can also buy individually.

305
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:53,808
Speaker 0: That gets you every track ever, like from every Mario Kart or whatever.

306
00:21:53,848 --> 00:22:00,380
Speaker 0: So it's like, yeah, they just upgraded the current Mario Kart rather than, I don't think they're going to make a new one so soon.

307
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:01,241
Speaker 1: Nah.

308
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,684
Speaker 1: I mean, I figure some announcement, I don't know what it could be.

309
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:14,340
Speaker 1: The one thing I know they won't do, Nintendo will never be capable of launching a for real esports presence of any kind, even though Mario Kart is such an obvious slam dunk.

310
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:21,795
Speaker 0: Well, I think the big, you know, the bigger news is that, you know, it's like, yeah, Nintendo has directs all the time.

311
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,619
Speaker 0: It's time for them to announce whatever.

312
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:24,060
Speaker 0: Right.

313
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,505
Speaker 0: But, you know, I guess if they announce something, it could be a big news.

314
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:37,460
Speaker 0: But as of now, the news that we know is that the Nintendo Switch is now officially the third best selling game console worldwide of all time.

315
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,680
Speaker 0: Right.

316
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:41,951
Speaker 0: So the number one most selling game consoles, the PS2 all of all time period.

317
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:42,212
Speaker 0: Right.

318
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:45,480
Speaker 0: Number two is the DS and number three is the switch.

319
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,107
Speaker 1: So that is actually amazing on it.

320
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:57,840
Speaker 1: Not unexpected, like tracks with everything you would think, but actually for real hitting that number is kind of a big deal.

321
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:01,064
Speaker 0: Yep.

322
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:06,191
Speaker 1: So number four is the PlayStation four and number five is the oh, no, sorry.

323
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:08,935
Speaker 1: Number four is the OG Game Boy.

324
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:12,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's number five is the PlayStation four.

325
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,045
Speaker 0: I think the Wii is up there too somewhere.

326
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:15,987
Speaker 0: Yeah.

327
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:22,100
Speaker 1: Nintendo is always asleep or just crushing it with actual sales, despite what any fanboys might say.

328
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:32,859
Speaker 0: But the other thing that I think is interesting about the Nintendo Switch that people aren't focusing on, right, is that the Nintendo Switch came out a long time ago.

329
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:33,500
Speaker 0: It's old.

330
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,546
Speaker 0: It came out in twenty seventeen March.

331
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:37,288
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:40,474
Speaker 0: So it is six years old basically right now.

333
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:40,955
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:42,960
Speaker 0: Twenty seventeen plus six is twenty twenty three.

335
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:59,840
Speaker 1: And there is basically I see people who are like buying switches who never had one that one of my coworkers literally now that I think about it right around Christmas was asking like, hey, so I'm buying like I'm buying all the nephews switches for Christmas.

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,362
Speaker 1: What games should I get them?

337
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:02,404
Speaker 0: Yep.

338
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:11,660
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like there are children who are, you know, who are too young for a switch, who then become old enough for one and then their parents get them one.

339
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:11,980
Speaker 0: Yep.

340
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:12,321
Speaker 0: Right.

341
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,724
Speaker 0: And it's like they still get a switch.

342
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,906
Speaker 1: There's also households.

343
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:20,873
Speaker 1: I've seen a common cause of buying yet another switch household as a switch.

344
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,736
Speaker 1: Parents are mostly playing it.

345
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:25,400
Speaker 1: Kid gets old enough, wants to play it a lot.

346
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,059
Speaker 1: Got to get a second switch because you're not you're not letting the kid play when you want to play the Spire Breath of the Wild two or whatever.

347
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:38,847
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it's like the switch is still selling, but under the normal right schedule.

348
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:39,408
Speaker 0: Right.

349
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:46,035
Speaker 0: What what came before the switch, a dark age, the Wii U or whatever.

350
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:46,555
Speaker 0: Right.

351
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:51,600
Speaker 0: The Wii U came out in twenty twelve.

352
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,683
Speaker 0: So that was five and late twenty twelve.

353
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:59,809
Speaker 0: So less than five years between Wii U and Switch.

354
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:00,650
Speaker 0: You know what I would say?

355
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,931
Speaker 1: I'm going to see our past.

356
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:08,299
Speaker 0: We are well past do well past already do a new Nintendo console, but there's.

357
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,540
Speaker 0: I don't think there's going to be one.

358
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,824
Speaker 0: I think the Switch is going to just last many, many years.

359
00:25:13,865 --> 00:25:15,286
Speaker 1: I'm going to back up even further.

360
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:16,027
Speaker 1: Let's zoom out.

361
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:28,620
Speaker 1: The idea that there is a cycle and cadence to consoles coming out is there was I think it is solely an artifact of the fact that consoles appeared from nothing in recent living memory.

362
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,723
Speaker 1: And that was just the early evolution.

363
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:35,470
Speaker 1: And that was not predictive of the future of consoles in any way.

364
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:42,160
Speaker 1: They kept releasing new consoles all the time back in the day because hardware changed over the course of even two fucking years in the 80s.

365
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Speaker 0: There were significant and major advancements that required, you know, that where you could put out something new that would blow the previous shit out of the water.

366
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,465
Speaker 1: I got sixty four fucking bits for you right here.

367
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:55,306
Speaker 1: I don't know where.

368
00:25:55,326 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 0: significant advancements, but now you look at a switch and it's like what technology that we have available today would allow someone to make something that is a big upgrade from a Nintendo switch.

369
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,805
Speaker 0: It's like they put an OLED screen in and released a slightly better one.

370
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,589
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you can't.

371
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,832
Speaker 0: it's like you can't make something better than that.

372
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:15,774
Speaker 0: That's significantly.

373
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:19,759
Speaker 0: it already has USB C or it's like, you know, what do you get?

374
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:23,312
Speaker 0: Other than nerds who say it should be 4K, 120 FPS, whatever.

375
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:23,874
Speaker 1: That's nonsense.

376
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,882
Speaker 0: That's nonsense.

377
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:28,145
Speaker 0: That will not improve.

378
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,331
Speaker 0: That won't sell more switches.

379
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,193
Speaker 0: It won't.

380
00:26:31,635 --> 00:26:33,640
Speaker 0: All it'll do is raise development costs.

381
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,477
Speaker 1: I mean, think it is a console that Breath of the Wild ran on like just natively and worked.

382
00:26:40,778 --> 00:26:41,360
Speaker 0: They could release.

383
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,399
Speaker 0: Well, the Pokemon game didn't run on it very well.

384
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:46,567
Speaker 1: But that part there's a lot of reasons for that.

385
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:48,773
Speaker 1: I think the Pokemon game is a little bit glitchy.

386
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:51,940
Speaker 0: They're game free, but upgrading the switch isn't going to fix that problem.

387
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:52,761
Speaker 1: Exactly.

388
00:26:52,841 --> 00:27:02,300
Speaker 1: But if they sold Breath of the Wild level games and just kept cranking games of that caliber out, this console generation could last another decade.

389
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,988
Speaker 1: Probably that that's a decade.

390
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:09,000
Speaker 0: But I think you got several more years of switch without any other new Nintendo console.

391
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,962
Speaker 0: You might see an upgrade.

392
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:18,180
Speaker 1: I'm saying more games with that level of graphical quality, that level of polish and that level of gameplay are perfectly feasible on a switch.

393
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

394
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:28,315
Speaker 0: Well, I think what is the question is, is there are certain games that Nintendo has done in the past, right, where they've done them like sort of like.

395
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:31,560
Speaker 0: they have series of games and they'll like be like one per console.

396
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:32,281
Speaker 0: Right.

397
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:40,940
Speaker 0: And then there are other times where they get a game and it's like hot and they'll like put out multiple iterations of it, you know, quickly.

398
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,129
Speaker 0: So like a good example might be like the Mario and Luigi.

399
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:45,309
Speaker 0: Right.

400
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:49,980
Speaker 0: They put out Mario Luigi Superstar Saga for GBA and they're like, oh, that's a hit.

401
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:58,660
Speaker 0: And they put out like a couple more of those GBA DS, whatever, like they sort of and then they're like, it got it didn't keep going.

402
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,321
Speaker 0: Right.

403
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,605
Speaker 0: So then they sort of stop those all together.

404
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:08,799
Speaker 0: It's like, whereas, you know, you look at something like Mario Maker, it's like, well, they put out a Mario Maker on the DS and the Wii.

405
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:09,943
Speaker 0: Right.

406
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:10,846
Speaker 0: Wii U, I think.

407
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:11,387
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

408
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:15,020
Speaker 0: And then they put a Mario Maker 2 on the Switch.

409
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:21,740
Speaker 0: It's like, well, if you don't have a new console, we're well past due for Mario Maker 3.

410
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:28,840
Speaker 0: But are you going to do a Mario Maker 3 or are you just going to let Mario Maker 2 just be there and be that's the Switch Mario Maker.

411
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:35,580
Speaker 0: We're just not going to make a Mario Maker 3 until whatever console comes next and however many years that takes.

412
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:50,420
Speaker 0: So, I mean, on the one hand, it's like it's good and that you're not going to sort of like, you know, put out too many games and then sort of burn people out on that series that you put out too many instances of.

413
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:58,760
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, people who are big fans of that series, right, have been waiting a real long time for another installment.

414
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:06,620
Speaker 0: And are they just going to have to wait a super even longer time because you won't put out a new installment without a new console?

415
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,260
Speaker 1: But also, remember, there's super fans who have exhausted Mario Maker 2's capabilities because they're ultra fans.

416
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,833
Speaker 1: Then there's regular people who just play it because it's great.

417
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:18,199
Speaker 0: Don't think about it.

418
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:29,558
Speaker 0: Will the Breath of the Wild 2, even if it's great, exhaust the like, you know, even if it's great, would a Breath of the Wild 3 do well or would it be just sort of like?

419
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:31,120
Speaker 0: that's enough of that, right?

420
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:37,900
Speaker 1: I mean, it's hard to say because right now, Breath of the Wild 2 is one of the best executed single player video games I have ever played.

421
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,440
Speaker 0: You mean one?

422
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:38,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, one.

423
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,440
Speaker 0: Breath of the Wild 2 doesn't exist yet.

424
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:41,057
Speaker 1: Two is not out yet.

425
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:42,298
Speaker 0: It's coming soon.

426
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:48,780
Speaker 1: If it is just more of the same, I'm pretty deeply here for that and I don't know when I run out of steam.

427
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Nintendo also, you know, doesn't like doing, you know, even when they have games in the same series, they don't like doing the exact same.

428
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,320
Speaker 0: They always gotta mix it up.

429
00:29:58,202 --> 00:29:58,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

430
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:01,114
Speaker 1: I mean, Zelda 1, Zelda 2, then Zelda 3.

431
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:02,460
Speaker 1: Three radically different games.

432
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,577
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

433
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:16,950
Speaker 1: Speaking of that Nintendo, this video just got uploaded like a couple weeks ago and it was pretty good.

434
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:27,730
Speaker 1: It is a 20 minute exploration of the lore of Wario, like where he came from, like how he was developed, like the whole deal with Wario.

435
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,164
Speaker 1: Which, one, is really well put together.

436
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:30,749
Speaker 1: It's a great video.

437
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:37,390
Speaker 1: Two, I learned some things I did not know, including some games I did not know existed because they were brief and Japan only.

438
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,775
Speaker 1: And three, uh, I don't know.

439
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:51,550
Speaker 1: I don't think many kids or even people listening to Geek Nights ever actually played the Super Mario Land games that evolved into Wario down the road.

440
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:52,929
Speaker 0: I played all those games.

441
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:53,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're old.

442
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:54,950
Speaker 1: I don't think most people have.

443
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,470
Speaker 0: I beat them all too.

444
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,490
Speaker 1: I would say Super Mario Land 2 on the Game Boy would hold up today unchanged.

445
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:00,523
Speaker 0: I've played it.

446
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:01,009
Speaker 0: It holds up.

447
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely.

448
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:05,520
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not as good as like Mario 3 or Mario World, right?

449
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,130
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know, it's better than, it's way better than Mario Land 1.

450
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,552
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

451
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:14,490
Speaker 1: Mario Land 1 feels like a pre-MMC NES game.

452
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, you know, anyway.

453
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,507
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

454
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:24,820
Speaker 0: So another game series that I think is very forgotten these days is Turrican.

455
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,170
Speaker 0: If you never played Turrican, Turrican is sort of like a shmup, sort of like a platformer.

456
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:35,483
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Contra, but like super, like even like ridiculous Contra, right?

457
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:38,150
Speaker 0: Like it's, it's wild, fast and dangerous Contra.

458
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,090
Speaker 1: The kind of game as a kid you'd rent and just like immediately lose, never get past the first level.

459
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,957
Speaker 0: You were probably playing, right?

460
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:48,530
Speaker 0: The version for like, you know, I think there was like a mega Turrican on Super Nintendo.

461
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,270
Speaker 1: Super Turrican I think is the one I played.

462
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,858
Speaker 0: Is it Super Turrican?

463
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,430
Speaker 0: Super Turrican, right?

464
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,650
Speaker 1: Yes, it was Super Turrican for SNES in 1993.

465
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,326
Speaker 0: But Turrican actually is a game from 1990 that was on like the Commodore 64.

466
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:05,310
Speaker 0: That was the original one.

467
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:11,826
Speaker 0: But the best rendition of the original Turrican was actually an Amiga game, right?

468
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,950
Speaker 0: Called Turrican 2.

469
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,107
Speaker 0: And that's like, that's like, that's the, that's like the Turrican, right?

470
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:18,629
Speaker 0: Is that one.

471
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,009
Speaker 0: But playing Turrican 2 in this day and age is difficult to do.

472
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:27,690
Speaker 0: You would need like an Amiga emulator or some shit and a ROM at least, right?

473
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:36,830
Speaker 0: So some people went about their business and they made, this is not an emulated ROM, right?

474
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:46,550
Speaker 0: They basically did a complete remake of the PC DOS version of Turrican 2 for the Amiga, right?

475
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:55,730
Speaker 0: It's like, I guess what that means is that the game, the original Amiga game was ported to PC DOS and they remade that game.

476
00:32:56,412 --> 00:33:02,110
Speaker 0: And they're not associated in any way with the people who made, you know, the original anyway.

477
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:08,390
Speaker 0: But you can get the game on itch and download it and play it for no money.

478
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,963
Speaker 0: And it just, you know, just, it just runs, right?

479
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,350
Speaker 0: It's not an emulator or anything.

480
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,908
Speaker 0: And you're good.

481
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:17,769
Speaker 1: Alright.

482
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:19,234
Speaker 0: Oh, no way.

483
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:21,087
Speaker 0: I figured out, I figured out what this is.

484
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,992
Speaker 0: Okay.

485
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,630
Speaker 0: I didn't, I didn't really understand it because I didn't actually try to run it.

486
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,810
Speaker 0: I just read about it and I didn't fully understand what was happening, right?

487
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:33,510
Speaker 0: It's even more amazing than what I understood.

488
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,337
Speaker 0: So it's Turrican 2.

489
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:40,030
Speaker 0: This game was originally released for PC DOS.

490
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,830
Speaker 0: I guess it might've worked on MS-DOS also anyway.

491
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,310
Speaker 0: This is a remake of that, right?

492
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,121
Speaker 0: The remake is for the Amiga.

493
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,470
Speaker 0: You have to run this remake on an Amiga.

494
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:57,769
Speaker 0: They made, they remade a DOS game as an Amiga game.

495
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,590
Speaker 1: That actually makes this even better.

496
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:05,549
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is they've made an Amiga game that is a remake of a DOS game.

497
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:13,210
Speaker 0: And so you would need in order to play this, an Amiga emulator, an FPGA or an Amiga.

498
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:19,969
Speaker 0: It's not for Windows, it's for Amiga, but it's a remake of a DOS game.

499
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:25,710
Speaker 0: The best way to play the PC version of Turrican 2 is on an Amiga.

500
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:33,290
Speaker 1: So before we get into the better moment, one listener actually asked and the answer is a laughable no.

501
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,150
Speaker 1: Could the Steam Deck overtake the Switch?

502
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,449
Speaker 0: Not a chance.

503
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,588
Speaker 1: Like zero, negative percent chance.

504
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,909
Speaker 0: So here's the thing about the Steam Deck, right?

505
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,870
Speaker 0: It's like there are people who really love the Steam Deck because the games, they're mostly PC gamers, right?

506
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:50,188
Speaker 0: And it's a way for them to play those games on the go.

507
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,530
Speaker 0: And they might not already have an iPad or something that lets you use Steam Link.

508
00:34:54,672 --> 00:34:56,289
Speaker 0: And that's a pain anyway if you're not home.

509
00:34:56,871 --> 00:35:01,270
Speaker 0: And I see the value there if those are your games and you want to play them on the go.

510
00:35:01,872 --> 00:35:04,629
Speaker 0: And you don't have some other devices that can play those games on the go.

511
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:07,690
Speaker 0: I see the value there for those people.

512
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,170
Speaker 0: But number one, I learned recently the Steam Deck is heavily subsidized by Valve, right?

513
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,010
Speaker 0: Which makes it a good deal to buy actually because you're getting way more than you're paying for.

514
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:20,110
Speaker 0: But it's not sustainable.

515
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:26,230
Speaker 0: And B, the sales numbers on the Steam Deck are horrifyingly low, right?

516
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,450
Speaker 0: It's like not low for the Steam Deck, but low compared to other consoles.

517
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,990
Speaker 0: Like this is like in PSP territory.

518
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,508
Speaker 0: This is not a, you know.

519
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:39,730
Speaker 0: And finally, there's no such thing as an exclusive game for the Steam Deck.

520
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:41,216
Speaker 0: No such thing.

521
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:42,550
Speaker 0: And there never will be such a thing.

522
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,330
Speaker 0: It's like, it runs PC games.

523
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,730
Speaker 1: It's also, literally, anyone who's not already a turbo nerd has never heard of it.

524
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,330
Speaker 0: Yes, it is not a thing.

525
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,470
Speaker 0: If you've heard of it, congratulations, you're a turbo nerd.

526
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:02,370
Speaker 1: Like you are already outside of the realm of what the vast majority of humans on Earth ever think about on a day to day basis.

527
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:03,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

528
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:09,250
Speaker 0: you're not gonna, you know, even if Valve does like a bunch of work to get Steam Decks on the shelf at like Target.

529
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,979
Speaker 0: It's like, why would they?

530
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,590
Speaker 0: Because those aren't gonna sell, right?

531
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,997
Speaker 0: People are gonna be like, what the hell?

532
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,710
Speaker 0: Someone might buy it for their kid by accident.

533
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,720
Speaker 0: That's what's gonna, right?

534
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:17,105
Speaker 0: It's like...

535
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,250
Speaker 1: And we got the Nintendo Direct prediction.

536
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:23,047
Speaker 1: F-Zero is going to have a crossover with 18XX.

537
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:25,708
Speaker 0: Okay, I hope so.

538
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:33,970
Speaker 0: I'll bet we'll own stocks in gravity maglev car racing companies.

539
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,452
Speaker 1: You know what?

540
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,468
Speaker 1: That one's more likely, I think, than ever getting a 4K switch.

541
00:36:40,811 --> 00:36:46,847
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, Geek Nights will be live on Thursday, March 23rd at 2.30pm Eastern Time in the Bumblebee Theater at PAX.

542
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:47,248
Speaker 1: East 2023 with.

543
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,410
Speaker 1: Can Competitive and Casual Coexist?

544
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:54,849
Speaker 1: If the name of a panel asks a question, the answer is probably no.

545
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:57,788
Speaker 1: Or at least no with an asterisk.

546
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,084
Speaker 0: There are yeses.

547
00:36:59,871 --> 00:37:00,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

548
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:04,950
Speaker 1: Mostly when I see panels, usually that question is a no or it's a trap.

549
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:06,230
Speaker 0: Anyway.

550
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll leave the unseen.

551
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,230
Speaker 1: The Book Club book will be doing it on Thursday this week.

552
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:11,880
Speaker 1: We both read it.

553
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,489
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

554
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,390
Speaker 1: I'm gonna announce the choices for Scott of the next two books.

555
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,350
Speaker 1: One of them's long and I'm still debating the second one and I'm curious which one you pick.

556
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:22,490
Speaker 0: Alright.

557
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,056
Speaker 0: I'm working on the website still.

558
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,224
Speaker 0: I did actually do a work on the website.

559
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:28,650
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna shit talk about the future.

560
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,170
Speaker 0: I'll talk about the present and the past, right?

561
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:37,010
Speaker 0: I'm working on basically converting the data from the current website to the new website, right?

562
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,770
Speaker 0: And I've converted all of the Book Club related data.

563
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:45,370
Speaker 0: So, we're gonna move on to the episode related data, which is the hardest part.

564
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,142
Speaker 0: I also did all the news related data.

565
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:50,570
Speaker 0: So, how about that?

566
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:51,469
Speaker 1: Not bad.

567
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:54,621
Speaker 1: And otherwise, you know, check out our forum.

568
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:56,390
Speaker 1: Follow us on places that you can find us.

569
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:03,650
Speaker 1: Type the word "geek knights" into a bar pretty much anywhere in your computer and it'll probably eventually take you to something that we made.

570
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:14,970
Speaker 1: So, I was thinking about this main bit quite a bit, mostly because I tried to buy a DDR pad and found that they were in short supply and panicked and that's a big part of why I bought that hard pad.

571
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,545
Speaker 0: I mean, we've talked about it, you know, several times already in the news and things of the day, right?

572
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,010
Speaker 0: You know, the Turrican and whatever.

573
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,882
Speaker 0: But, yeah, there's a lot of games out there in the world that are, you know, we talk about game preservation.

574
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:30,009
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, what do we do when these games aren't unplayable

575
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,510
Speaker 0: anymore?"

576
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:30,771
Speaker 0: Right?

577
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:35,810
Speaker 0: But, you know, and there's a lot of talk about the people who are doing the hard work of game preservation.

578
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:51,710
Speaker 0: But there are some people out there who they're not really in it for, like, the historical preservation aspect, but it's like they are players of a game and they are keeping that game, like, alive but barely somehow.

579
00:38:52,711 --> 00:39:09,110
Speaker 0: And there are actually a lot of instances of this around the world that I encounter a lot for some reason where there's a game that's not very popular, but out of the billions of people on Earth, there's still some handful of people that care about that game a lot.

580
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:15,941
Speaker 0: And someone out there is doing work to keep that game going, right?

581
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:21,670
Speaker 0: Maybe they're doing the extra work to get the game to, like, grow, but a lot of them are just, like, subsisting.

582
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:24,702
Speaker 0: And it's quite interesting, right?

583
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:32,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's so many different kinds of games and, like, every one of these is almost its own case study.

584
00:39:33,272 --> 00:39:40,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's not just video games, which are the first thing you're going to think of, but it's also, you know- All I can think of is, like, baseball.

585
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:48,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, there's that county fair that has, like, the husband-calling contest, right?

586
00:39:49,191 --> 00:40:02,534
Speaker 0: Or it's like there's some organization that runs that, and it's like, you know, it's probably a handful of old people somewhere who, like, organize it and get judges to get- Like, it takes work to make that happen.

587
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:06,142
Speaker 0: It doesn't just happen automatically, just because it's a tradition, right?

588
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,069
Speaker 0: Someone has to do it, and those people are doing it.

589
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:15,161
Speaker 0: So, examples of this that I've seen also go in the tabletop world, right?

590
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:18,690
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, when Netrunner- well, Android Netrunner died, right?

591
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:29,490
Speaker 0: These people, they brought up their Project Nisei, and they're keeping, you know, they're making cards, they're printing cards, they're, you know, trying to avoid any legal complications, which it seems they've done so far successfully.

592
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:34,539
Speaker 0: The game is nowhere near its prior popularity, right?

593
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,329
Speaker 0: But it's like, if you want to play it, they got you, right?

594
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:38,850
Speaker 0: It's covered.

595
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:50,410
Speaker 1: But it's interesting, because those situations, like the Android Netrunner kind of situation, I suspect, not always, but many times leads to an interesting distillation of the community.

596
00:40:50,650 --> 00:41:04,010
Speaker 1: Like, basically, all you've got left are either the people who are deeply invested in it as their sole game or as a lifestyle game, people who can't find that kind of game anywhere else, people who are super serious about playing it seriously or well.

597
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:13,570
Speaker 1: Like, you get a very almost different zoomed-in fan base compared to a more mass-market game or a game that still has commercial support outside of that kind of community.

598
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:19,626
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean, because even in that case, right, how hard is it to go to their website and click buy and buy some cards?

599
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,930
Speaker 0: Not hard at all, right?

600
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,457
Speaker 0: But even if you do that, okay, you got the cards, you got to get people to play with, right?

601
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:42,490
Speaker 0: It's like, well, it's like when the game was in the game stores and there were tournaments at the game stores, you know, that the game stores were running because the game stores were selling the product, it was a lot easier to get some, you know, to get people to come, right, to know about it, right?

602
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:53,760
Speaker 0: Now, the people who are doing the Project Nisei, some nerd might run some Project Nisei event at their local game store, but the local game store doesn't have Project Nisei stuff for sale, right?

603
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:56,845
Speaker 0: It's like you buy it from the website.

604
00:41:57,105 --> 00:42:04,860
Speaker 0: So that already makes it so difficult to get people in on this thing and to care about it and to invest their time in it and to get, right?

605
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,427
Speaker 0: And, you know, how regular and reliable are the releases, right?

606
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:15,440
Speaker 0: It's like in some ways more reliable because the company that, you know, Fantasy Flight was the Shambles.

607
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:24,294
Speaker 0: But in other senses, it's like they're not coming out with packs constantly, right?

608
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:28,040
Speaker 1: Which leads to a different kind of interaction and a different kind of community.

609
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:41,680
Speaker 1: I think it also leads to possibly catering to one very specific part of that community to the possible detriment of any other parts of that community that might have existed.

610
00:42:42,401 --> 00:42:45,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, it becomes basically, it's like, yes, we've kept it alive.

611
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:46,367
Speaker 0: It still exists.

612
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:47,730
Speaker 0: You can still play it.

613
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,651
Speaker 0: It's still going.

614
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:54,000
Speaker 0: But this is barrier to entry of like having to know about it.

615
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:56,880
Speaker 1: It's like- Well, like Advance Wars is a good example.

616
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:11,240
Speaker 0: So to play it, you still have to, you know, even though they've done a lot of work to keep the game up, it still takes more work as a player to do it, even though they've already done so much than it did when the game was alive.

617
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,621
Speaker 1: Yup.

618
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:17,632
Speaker 1: So like Advance Wars would be a decent example here, too, because that game, there haven't been Advance Wars in forever.

619
00:43:18,453 --> 00:43:22,220
Speaker 1: And also there is the new one that's coming out possibly soon.

620
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,673
Speaker 1: We'll find out tomorrow that was delayed, which is just a reboot of really old Advance Wars from a shockingly long time ago.

621
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,260
Speaker 1: But there was the single player like aspect of the game.

622
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,303
Speaker 1: There was the multiplayer aspect of the game.

623
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:45,540
Speaker 1: The community that's been keeping Advance Wars going only cares about multiplayer, only cares about extremely serious competitive Advance Wars.

624
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:58,689
Speaker 1: And if you go in there, imagine if I, the Advance Wars not, is literally one of the worst players because the meta and the kinds of maps they want to play and the way they like to play.

625
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:15,020
Speaker 1: this game has evolved so far beyond what could be even possible on the original actual releases with a custom platform they built just to support it that it's honestly almost unrecognizable to how Advance Wars multiplayer works in any original format.

626
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:19,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you're an Advance Wars fan who wasn't interested in multiplayer, right?

627
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,385
Speaker 1: You got nothing.

628
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:21,940
Speaker 1: There is nothing for you in this community.

629
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:30,020
Speaker 0: It's like you've probably already beaten every, and you care a lot about it, you've probably already beaten all of the Advance Wars and gotten S-rank at every single thing.

630
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:30,441
Speaker 0: Yup.

631
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,640
Speaker 0: And you've played all these games that are like Advance Wars.

632
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:45,234
Speaker 1: This community has got a meta where they play competitive, serious games in maps that utilize a glitch that causes units to teleport around with like null tiles.

633
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:46,816
Speaker 1: And that's like a whole category.

634
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:50,320
Speaker 1: Like that is how deep down the rabbit hole of nonsense this community has gone.

635
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,321
Speaker 0: Yup.

636
00:44:51,922 --> 00:45:00,495
Speaker 0: So it's like, yeah, they're keeping it alive, but it's like that's not, you know, they're keeping it alive for the people who care so hard about it to keep it alive.

637
00:45:00,515 --> 00:45:03,420
Speaker 0: They're not keeping it alive for everybody, right?

638
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,221
Speaker 0: Yup.

639
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:09,649
Speaker 0: Another good example is we always talk about Steel Battalion Guy because he saw them at PAX so many times.

640
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:17,060
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're still at PAX these days, but there was a game for the Xbox, the original Xbox, I don't know how many nerds remember it, called Steel Battalion.

641
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:29,037
Speaker 0: It was a mech piloting game, like MechWarrior, and the thing about this game was that there was a special controller for it that was like a big fancy dual joystick like whole thing, right?

642
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:30,980
Speaker 0: Go look it up on the internet, you'll see what it looks like.

643
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,886
Speaker 0: It's like a big arcade level interface with sticks and buttons and switches.

644
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:46,640
Speaker 0: And like when you played, you had to push these buttons to like start up the engines and, you know, flip like a switch to self-destruct, eject, all these different buttons everywhere, not just like a normal controller.

645
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:49,725
Speaker 0: You know, and it was pretty cool.

646
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:50,346
Speaker 0: It's fun.

647
00:45:51,488 --> 00:45:52,971
Speaker 0: But obviously, right?

648
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:56,097
Speaker 0: How many people bought that thing when it was new?

649
00:45:56,117 --> 00:45:57,280
Speaker 1: Not a lot of people.

650
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,400
Speaker 1: How many of that peripheral still exists even remotely workable in the year 2023?

651
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,528
Speaker 0: When it came out when we were in college, like we knew one or two people who got it and that was it.

652
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:10,575
Speaker 0: You know, those people who spent all their money on game and stuff, right?

653
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:12,118
Speaker 0: We all know those people.

654
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:13,100
Speaker 0: And that was it.

655
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,526
Speaker 0: And then there was a guy who got enough of them because you could play multiplayer, right?

656
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:19,127
Speaker 0: With a lot.

657
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:21,830
Speaker 0: You could make teams of like was eight on eight or something like that.

658
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:30,600
Speaker 0: Something I forget the exact numbers, but you could play a big team multiplayer with if you had enough controllers and enough Xboxes, right?

659
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,724
Speaker 0: But it's like the Xbox one is dead.

660
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:33,966
Speaker 0: This game is dead.

661
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:35,769
Speaker 0: You can't buy the controller anymore.

662
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:37,752
Speaker 0: It's like now think about the hurdles.

663
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:42,380
Speaker 0: One person collected enough equipment and did all the work to make this playable.

664
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:49,371
Speaker 0: But it's only accessible to people who go and find this person at an event where they set it up for you to play.

665
00:46:49,752 --> 00:46:51,875
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you can't do it at home, right?

666
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,960
Speaker 0: It's like a good luck copying what that guy did.

667
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,801
Speaker 0: Where are you going to find it?

668
00:46:55,921 --> 00:47:04,754
Speaker 1: You know, eight steel battalion control battle tech pods, DDR, like Guitar Hero, anything that had a special para para.

669
00:47:05,275 --> 00:47:08,700
Speaker 1: Good luck playing para para paradise at home in twenty twenty three.

670
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there you might be able to find like a controller for Guitar Hero is probably easier.

671
00:47:14,086 --> 00:47:15,629
Speaker 0: People are given those things away, right?

672
00:47:15,729 --> 00:47:24,160
Speaker 0: But it's like it's not easy to get games that need a special equipment, especially if it's a big arcade rare equipment.

673
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,611
Speaker 0: But it also means to play, at least to play in the way that they were originally intended.

674
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:31,840
Speaker 0: Like you can play them in like a you know, without that you could steal the time with the Xbox.

675
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,234
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of people play DDR just with their fingers on a keyboard because I guess that's a completely.

676
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:36,616
Speaker 0: that's.

677
00:47:36,656 --> 00:47:37,820
Speaker 0: I mean, that's a completely different game.

678
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that is a big part of the community.

679
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:43,538
Speaker 1: It looks like I I've been doing a lot of DDR reading lately.

680
00:47:43,658 --> 00:47:44,080
Speaker 1: Go to God.

681
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:53,034
Speaker 1: OK, well, but DDR like is dead at home because the last console release was in 2011 on the Wii.

682
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,138
Speaker 1: So there's really the only way anyone can play.

683
00:47:55,158 --> 00:47:56,680
Speaker 1: it is in the arcade with specialized equipment.

684
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:07,480
Speaker 1: Imagine if you are in that community, your community will over time only shrink because there is almost no way to bring new people into that community.

685
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:10,326
Speaker 0: You bring people in very slowly, right?

686
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:10,988
Speaker 0: But it's hard.

687
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:16,560
Speaker 1: You have to think about how can someone even practice the game or like spend the hour to learn how to play?

688
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:22,336
Speaker 1: Even when I played Steel Battalion, I had to sit down at that guy's set up and they don't like.

689
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:23,880
Speaker 1: they're not going to explain how everything works.

690
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,688
Speaker 1: You play like baby's first intro mission to be good at that game.

691
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,271
Speaker 1: You got to play it by yourself a bunch.

692
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:32,839
Speaker 1: Imagine trying to play TIE Fighter in 20 minutes knowing nothing about it.

693
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,689
Speaker 1: Imagine trying to play Star Wars Squadrons in 20 minutes knowing nothing about it.

694
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,212
Speaker 1: You sit down at a hot ass.

695
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:44,060
Speaker 1: You've got a laminated paper that tells you 50 different buttons.

696
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,681
Speaker 1: Good luck.

697
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:45,062
Speaker 1: Have fun.

698
00:48:45,082 --> 00:48:46,146
Speaker 1: You get to play for 20 minutes.

699
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:49,980
Speaker 1: That's your sole interaction with this game until next year at this convention.

700
00:48:51,442 --> 00:48:59,700
Speaker 0: I mean if you look, for example, I remember when on GDQ there were those people playing like the scariest extreme Tetris, right?

701
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:01,803
Speaker 0: Whatever it's called.

702
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:03,748
Speaker 0: The Terror Instinct, right?

703
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,793
Speaker 0: Tetris Masters series.

704
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:07,818
Speaker 0: And it's like those people who were like.

705
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:08,740
Speaker 0: that's their game?

706
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,091
Speaker 0: They have arcade boards that they use to play the game for real, right?

707
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:14,435
Speaker 0: Because that's the only one that counts.

708
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,320
Speaker 0: It doesn't count if you use some emulator, right?

709
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:24,160
Speaker 0: But people see that and they want to join, you know, they get the recognition that their community exists and their game exists.

710
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,224
Speaker 0: And they attract people to the game.

711
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:32,720
Speaker 0: And then people want to play it and there's at least an easier way to play it with like MAME or something, right?

712
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,883
Speaker 0: It's not the correct way.

713
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:40,439
Speaker 0: And then people who get serious about it will try to acquire an arcade board somehow, right?

714
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:44,746
Speaker 0: But there's only so many of them and there aren't new ones.

715
00:49:45,507 --> 00:49:52,340
Speaker 0: But someone might, you know, have played it and like fall out of it and not be that interested anymore and pass it on to someone who cares more.

716
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:59,594
Speaker 0: But there ends up sort of being like this hard cap on the number of like truly serious participants in the community.

717
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:02,820
Speaker 0: Because yeah, at some point there is no more boards.

718
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:07,433
Speaker 0: It's like there might be thousands of them out there, hundreds depending on what game it is.

719
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:10,000
Speaker 0: But at some point it's like that's it.

720
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:22,820
Speaker 0: Like if you somehow grew your community, there is not enough equipment out there for everyone in the community to play this game the way that, you know, the most correct best original way.

721
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:30,949
Speaker 1: Even harder are games like MMOs, games where the server is proprietary or inaccessible or unavailable.

722
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:39,940
Speaker 1: Those games die and the community of people who even have the capability to run like their own rogue instance after a game like that dies.

723
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:43,425
Speaker 1: It's so small, yet somehow they survive.

724
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:54,840
Speaker 1: The first graphical MMO in American history, in fact world history, it was released slightly before Meridian 59, was the one I played, Sierra Online's The Realm.

725
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:55,861
Speaker 1: And guess what?

726
00:50:57,163 --> 00:51:04,334
Speaker 1: Not only is it still running, fans bought this shit officially and have been running it for subscription fees.

727
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:06,176
Speaker 1: It is still up to this day.

728
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:10,020
Speaker 1: There was a hotfix on December 3rd, 2022.

729
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:16,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure that like the Meridian 59, we saw someone at PAX who was still keeping that alive somehow.

730
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:21,300
Speaker 0: I think Ultima Online, I think someone is keeping that alive somehow, right?

731
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,401
Speaker 0: Maybe.

732
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:32,700
Speaker 0: I'm not 100% sure on that one, but it's like there's people out there who are like, they somehow managed to get this server to run or made a fork or who knows what they did.

733
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,220
Speaker 1: I mean, these people bought it from Sierra like outright.

734
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:35,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

735
00:51:36,162 --> 00:51:37,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, people do that sort of thing.

736
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:46,440
Speaker 0: And they're like, the game is running, but even though the game is running, the number of people playing the game is so, so small, right?

737
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:53,553
Speaker 0: It's like if you were to log on to that Meridian 59 somehow or that Realm, it's like, are you going to see anybody?

738
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:57,460
Speaker 0: If you see one person, holy shit, a person, right?

739
00:51:57,821 --> 00:52:03,351
Speaker 0: Whereas like back in the day, it was like, you log into MMO and it's like people everywhere, people.

740
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:08,420
Speaker 0: It's like, that's, you know, so are you really playing the game when there's like no people there?

741
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 0: It's more like a single player game, right?

742
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't imagine there's more than a few hundred people in the Sierra, the Realm game.

743
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,480
Speaker 0: I'd be very curious to see like their daily login numbers.

744
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,620
Speaker 1: Right, their forum has like 12 posts like in the last few days.

745
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,145
Speaker 0: So I did see, I forget which game it was.

746
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:29,129
Speaker 0: It was one of those very old MMOs that's still alive.

747
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:38,580
Speaker 0: And very recently, somebody like saved up like a million, like a huge pile of like XP tickets.

748
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:43,310
Speaker 0: Like, and then spent them all on agility all at once.

749
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:47,620
Speaker 0: And it was like, it was like, you know, one of those funny deals.

750
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:48,142
Speaker 0: Right.

751
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,573
Speaker 0: But it was like some ancient looking MMO.

752
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:52,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forget which one.

753
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:06,057
Speaker 1: And then there are the games like tribes two that are only runnable via not a rare piece of hardware, but a dodgy exe file that kind of just makes its way around the internet.

754
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:07,058
Speaker 1: And you got to just trust it.

755
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,883
Speaker 0: There's a runescape runescape play.

756
00:53:12,284 --> 00:53:20,974
Speaker 0: So this person in runescape, which still exists, they for eight years, they were grinding eight years to get tickets.

757
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:25,540
Speaker 0: And then after eight years, they spent all the tickets on agility all at once.

758
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:39,980
Speaker 0: Ah, I mean, I guess as long as this person enjoyed themselves, uh, but it's like you look back on your life and it's like, remember those eight years of my life I spent on runescape grinding agility tickets for agility.

759
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:48,275
Speaker 1: I mean, I regret at least two thirds of the time I spent grinding the realm, which I only actually played for like four years.

760
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:50,599
Speaker 1: Like that wasn't that long a timeframe in my life.

761
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:54,551
Speaker 1: Kind of like how magic loom so large in my childhood.

762
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:55,977
Speaker 1: I look back, I've played 0.1% of magic.

763
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,586
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, but it's like, I just always have that, you know, look at my life.

764
00:54:01,767 --> 00:54:04,831
Speaker 0: I'm always like, you know, thinking about it from on high.

765
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:05,232
Speaker 0: Right.

766
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:09,338
Speaker 0: It's like you look at my whole timeline and it's like, all right, well, I can't control the past at all.

767
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:09,999
Speaker 0: It's already done.

768
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:10,660
Speaker 0: It's already written.

769
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,261
Speaker 0: Right.

770
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:17,607
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, how do I choose, you know, what do I want to spend the rest of my time on?

771
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:18,308
Speaker 0: Right.

772
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:25,015
Speaker 0: You know, is it that I want to spend, you know, an hour a day for the rest of my life on X?

773
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:27,457
Speaker 0: and that'll be, it's like, that's what I live for.

774
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:29,880
Speaker 0: I lived to grind that slot machine.

775
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:39,129
Speaker 1: Of course, then you get people, the people who commit to a lifestyle game that has staying power, like Counter-Strike 1.6 might be the best example of this ever.

776
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,051
Speaker 1: It never even got mostly dead.

777
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:44,695
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike 1, like the original Counter-Strike just never died.

778
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:50,160
Speaker 1: It just continued with hundreds of thousands of players into the year 2023.

779
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,325
Speaker 0: Well, that doesn't, nobody's like keeping it alive.

780
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:53,809
Speaker 0: Valve is keeping it still there.

781
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:54,812
Speaker 1: You can still just play.

782
00:54:54,852 --> 00:54:58,200
Speaker 1: But it also has such a huge player base, which is amazing.

783
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:03,248
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's, that's what happens when the original company doesn't dump it.

784
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:03,408
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:09,840
Speaker 1: But especially considering there are two other versions that came out after it that are objectively better that also are still played.

786
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:14,885
Speaker 1: I just can't get over that Counter-Strike 1.6 is still playable.

787
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:16,148
Speaker 1: In fact, there's that thing we just saw.

788
00:55:16,168 --> 00:55:17,390
Speaker 1: You can play it in a web browser.

789
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

790
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:22,240
Speaker 0: I mean, well, it's not legit, but of course it's not legit, but it works.

791
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:27,707
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think there's somebody out there whose job it is still to work on Counter-Strike 1.6.

792
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:28,568
Speaker 0: Like that's their job.

793
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,897
Speaker 0: There's a full-time employee at Valve somewhere, at least one, who's like a Counter-Strike 1.6 developer.

794
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:37,040
Speaker 0: And it's like, that's what they do.

795
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,162
Speaker 0: So several such people.

796
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:40,442
Speaker 0: So

797
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:55,880
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess if you, if you play a game that is deeply important to you, like to the point that you would consider it as some aspect of your identity or it's like, it's something like it's a lifestyle game, like me and DDR, like game I kind of want to play my whole life.

798
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,763
Speaker 1: And you see it starting to decline.

799
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:05,550
Speaker 1: You have to internalize the fact that with the exception of Counter-Strike 1.6, nothing lasts forever.

800
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:13,880
Speaker 1: And you have to either decide when and how to give up on that game, decide if and how you will try to keep it alive.

801
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:15,444
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a community.

802
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:21,680
Speaker 1: Maybe you could be the person who saves competitive AeroBiz supersonic before it dies completely.

803
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,290
Speaker 0: Before it never existed.

804
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,600
Speaker 1: Yep.

805
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:31,391
Speaker 1: Like you could be the one who keeps it going, but you should also, to Scott's point, think about, should you really?

806
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:38,542
Speaker 1: Do you want to be the person who is still spending 20 hours a week playing Counter-Strike 1.6 in the year 2053?

807
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:38,662
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:41,406
Speaker 0: It's not like a book, you know, sometimes it is sort of like a book, right?

809
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:43,009
Speaker 0: Something like an NES game.

810
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,532
Speaker 0: It's like the ROM exists.

811
00:56:44,592 --> 00:56:45,333
Speaker 0: We're good, right?

812
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:46,976
Speaker 0: It's like the game is out there.

813
00:56:46,996 --> 00:56:49,600
Speaker 0: It doesn't need people playing it to be alive.

814
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,257
Speaker 1: I can play any NES game that was ever released anytime I want by myself or with a friend on the TV.

815
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:56,380
Speaker 1: That's enough.

816
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:57,321
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:59,384
Speaker 0: Someone wrote some book, it got scanned.

818
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:00,887
Speaker 0: It's in a library somewhere.

819
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:01,928
Speaker 0: It's like, no one's read it.

820
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,511
Speaker 0: No one might read it for decades.

821
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:05,454
Speaker 0: No one might read it for the rest of human existence.

822
00:57:05,935 --> 00:57:07,017
Speaker 0: Does a tree fall in the woods?

823
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:07,738
Speaker 0: Does anyone hear it?

824
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:08,820
Speaker 0: But that book is still there.

825
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:21,346
Speaker 0: It's not about, you know, do we preserve them?

826
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:28,477
Speaker 0: It's like they've been preserved, but it's like they're, they're mostly dead, but they're not dead, dead.

827
00:57:28,497 --> 00:57:30,680
Speaker 0: It's like they're there, but good luck.

828
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:40,427
Speaker 1: And remember, we, the people alive today and over the next many decades are going to figure out how this works and how to interact with this question.

829
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:45,270
Speaker 1: Because video games, just as an example, are a brand new medium.

830
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,973
Speaker 1: They have existed for effectively zero time in the span of human history.

831
00:57:49,293 --> 00:57:53,356
Speaker 1: They're an utterly new form of entertainment and communication and interaction.

832
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:58,540
Speaker 1: And just like the console thing, we're still in like the earliest days of this stuff.

833
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:07,026
Speaker 0: I think the thing, you know, that I think recently has been like the biggest problem is in the mobile gaming area, right?

834
00:58:07,327 --> 00:58:16,435
Speaker 0: Is that people, there were a lot of mobile games starting around 2008 iPhone 3G times, you know, Android and also for flip phones, right?

835
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:21,078
Speaker 0: All those like little J2ME games going down, but Blackberry games.

836
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:22,780
Speaker 1: Nevermind Flash games.

837
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:44,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the iOS games in particular, it's like, you know, even if you could like, it's hard to get a device running an old version of iOS that has the old game installed that it's like, you know, and then even then it's like, okay, you got to get a working iPhone 4 running an old iOS that'll run this old game and the app store won't, you can't connect to the app store.

838
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:45,996
Speaker 0: You can't download that old game.

839
00:58:46,016 --> 00:58:47,097
Speaker 0: How are you going to get it?

840
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:51,980
Speaker 0: It's like there's, there's a lot of stuff that has been washed away there.

841
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,760
Speaker 1: Yup, like tears in rain.

842
00:59:28,684 --> 00:59:31,600
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

843
00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:04,287
Speaker 1: I simply leave you right now with something that I'm actually going to decide later because I'm going to eat dinner and play Blades in the Dark.
