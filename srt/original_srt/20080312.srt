Speaker 0: Amen, it's finally here despite my love of it.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,150
Speaker 0: I actually haven't seen past the first episode of avatar until now.

7
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:43,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw like a few minutes of it when I was walking around the house.

8
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:46,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like a Saturday morning kids show.

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,940
Speaker 0: Avatar is a really freakin good show especially Pretty much from the last two episodes of the first season.

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,403
Speaker 0: from what I hear all the way up to the end and ongoing is Just absolutely amazing.

11
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:58,787
Speaker 1: well I don't know.

12
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:04,870
Speaker 1: I can't really say other than I saw two minutes of it which isn't really enough got him walked through the room and went.

13
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:11,643
Speaker 1: That's not enough to pass any judgment on whether the show is actually good or not however.

14
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:19,447
Speaker 1: I can say I'm not too Excited or enthused to watch the show never excited or enthused about anything.

15
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:24,945
Speaker 1: there are other things I have you know to consume my entertainment time that I will choose.

16
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:36,729
Speaker 0: before I choose that well I'll say this it of all the things competing for my Eyeballs avatar pretty much is at the top now And I'm probably going to watch it to the exclusion of everything else until I've seen all of it.

17
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:39,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the exact opposite.

18
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:45,489
Speaker 1: right here I'm gonna be playing Smash Brothers, and I played some Smash Brothers and some DS games, and I'm gonna be reading some comics.

19
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,874
Speaker 0: man I'm rocking through Layton.

20
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:47,697
Speaker 1: Yeah.

21
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,660
Speaker 1: Yeah Layton's a good one.

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,566
Speaker 0: I'm too picker at short of a perfect score.

23
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:51,028
Speaker 0: so far.

24
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:52,212
Speaker 1: well We'll see.

25
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,015
Speaker 1: we'll see.

26
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:53,738
Speaker 0: I don't know.

27
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:55,303
Speaker 0: I haven't had any trouble so far.

28
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:56,167
Speaker 1: Yeah.

29
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, how far are you?

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,133
Speaker 0: I'm pushing a thousand.

31
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:02,107
Speaker 1: yeah see part of the thing is you know it's not so much.

32
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,370
Speaker 1: if you Really pay attention to every puzzle and try really hard to get a perfect score you will.

33
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:12,019
Speaker 1: But there comes a point where like your patience will run out And you just feel that you know.

34
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:18,234
Speaker 1: and also some of the puzzles They're worded poorly and us rules lawyer II types would be like oh fuck you I don't know.

35
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:19,849
Speaker 0: I haven't run into anything like that yet.

36
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,595
Speaker 1: I've run into.

37
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:24,179
Speaker 1: there are only like a small handful of them But they're there and they're annoying.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,643
Speaker 0: plus the thing is maybe it's just because as a kid I was in math Olympiad, but so far the vast majority of the question

39
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:31,566
Speaker 1: you've seen before

40
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:36,910
Speaker 0: are actually exactly From questions I answered to get my little trophy in fourth grade

41
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:40,736
Speaker 1: I would say about 10% of the puzzles in there I had seen before at some point in my

42
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,905
Speaker 0: life of all the math and geometry ones.

43
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,796
Speaker 0: I think I've seen all of them Mmm.

44
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:46,525
Speaker 1: I don't know.

45
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:56,350
Speaker 0: well I guess yeah like the you know have a pyramid of coins Flip it upside down by moving and of them or you've got a bunch of pictures the different sizes that aren't marked.

46
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,049
Speaker 0: How do you get certain amounts into certain pictures all those things?

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,630
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm hey Anything else going on not really?

48
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,998
Speaker 0: I'm just kind of waiting for you to do your news.

49
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,910
Speaker 0: slow talker quiet tired, dude.

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,015
Speaker 1: I'm actually sort of like.

51
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,832
Speaker 1: the reason I was being slow right there is because I was reading things while Talking.

52
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:15,650
Speaker 1: and how great hoping you would just keep yapping so I could finish reading.

53
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:16,338
Speaker 0: I got nothing to say.

54
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:17,409
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for you to do your crap.

55
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,861
Speaker 0: Oh news, so I can do my big news.

56
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:19,950
Speaker 1: Oh you think my news is crap.

57
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,473
Speaker 1: Oh, do you?

58
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,679
Speaker 0: I let's see what it is.

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,590
Speaker 1: Maybe I just won't tell it to you all right?

60
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,325
Speaker 1: No, actually I have to tell it to you or else the shows gonna be real boring real fast.

61
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,568
Speaker 1: so bone you like bone right.

62
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:35,442
Speaker 0: I Liked the first three quarters of bone, and I'll be honest.

63
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,907
Speaker 0: I thought the end was pretty shit.

64
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,370
Speaker 1: all things considered I think it was shit.

65
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:47,750
Speaker 0: I think the end was good But like the whole last third of it was just really kind of cliche and tired And it was obvious that he didn't wasn't quite sure where he was going with it.

66
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:54,812
Speaker 1: It seemed to me like definitely the parts that were planned were the earlier parts, but anyway regardless Bone.

67
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:58,549
Speaker 1: a while way back they tried to make an animated movie of it.

68
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,198
Speaker 0: How well that went.

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,978
Speaker 1: yeah, basically they tried and You know Jeff Smith fought with Nickelodeon, and it didn't happen.

70
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:09,802
Speaker 1: basically you know more details.

71
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:12,228
Speaker 1: whatever right they tried to make a bone movie.

72
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:17,583
Speaker 1: No good Well Warner Brothers has acquired the film rights.

73
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,890
Speaker 1: that doesn't mean they're gonna make one.

74
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,379
Speaker 1: it doesn't mean they're not gonna make one.

75
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,815
Speaker 1: it means they have the right to make one and We'll see what comes of that.

76
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:32,230
Speaker 1: there could be within a year or two some sort of bone movie in the movie theaters.

77
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:35,205
Speaker 0: It could be most likely if they just got the rights to it.

78
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:38,510
Speaker 0: within a year or two They'll announce a bone movie at best.

79
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:43,012
Speaker 1: Yeah There might be a live-action Bone.

80
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,757
Speaker 1: you could you know give you anything like.

81
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:45,980
Speaker 1: they haven't said anything yet.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,410
Speaker 0: live-action bone would not I don't know about that.

83
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:54,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right That's it's kind of like huh, but seeing is how you know.

84
00:04:54,807 --> 00:05:02,470
Speaker 1: the last time They tried to make a bone movie Jeff Smith you know with be not being happy with it was able to sort of stop put a gum in the works.

85
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,599
Speaker 1: I'm sure that if he wasn't happy with it.

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,969
Speaker 1: He would have the ability to put the gum in the works again.

87
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,610
Speaker 0: Well the problem is one thing Nickelodeon did not offer him that other people might is the bag of stop carrying money.

88
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:21,600
Speaker 0: There's always for anyone except possibly the creator of Watchmen There is a bag of shut up money.

89
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,878
Speaker 1: well the thing is is that You know the.

90
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,430
Speaker 1: he already has a whole bunch of money.

91
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,250
Speaker 1: I mean You know the color editions of bone that they sell in like the scholastic book catalog.

92
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:35,070
Speaker 1: Those sell like the crazy like millions and millions of copies.

93
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,994
Speaker 0: There is still money.

94
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:37,963
Speaker 1: doesn't really need more money.

95
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,670
Speaker 0: only Alan Moore is untouchable.

96
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:48,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right and luckily they tricked him, but yeah You know I usually hate like all this sort of preview news not really news.

97
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:59,289
Speaker 0: yet How much shit did you give me when I talked about how Peter Jackson is really interested in doing a Temeraire movie Yeah, and how I'm waiting every day for there to be more news on that.

98
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,560
Speaker 0: well Difference between look that up right now while you're talking.

99
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,900
Speaker 1: There's a difference between someone's interested in something It means like someone said something versus someone actually did something Which is acquiring rights and on the also.

100
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:17,858
Speaker 1: the only reason this is really newsworthy is because of the previous Failed bone movie attempt.

101
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,424
Speaker 1: if there was not a previous attempt.

102
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,810
Speaker 1: This would not be really newsworthy.

103
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:32,138
Speaker 0: Well Peter Jackson option the rights to the Temeraire movie uh-huh and that was my original news actually All righty, and there is no news since then At least according to Wikipedia.

104
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, well they might be waiting for more books to be written.

105
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:36,176
Speaker 0: I don't know.

106
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,487
Speaker 0: I really want a movie.

107
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:45,150
Speaker 1: so So all this news really translates to is you have like two years to read bone before so you can read it before the movie.

108
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:46,796
Speaker 0: I'd recommend you do that.

109
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:49,325
Speaker 0: if you don't know what bone is listen to our review.

110
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:52,903
Speaker 0: bone is a fantastic Comic and yet, it's two minutes ago.

111
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:53,708
Speaker 1: You're trashing it.

112
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:58,064
Speaker 0: no I was trashing the last third or so which is really.

113
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:04,521
Speaker 0: it's better than most comics And it's even better than most manga But it's really kind of cliche and tired at the end you

114
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:12,170
Speaker 1: ever you ever notice that it same thing happens with Death Note Where you know you'll have a body of work that is you know perhaps serialized perhaps not

115
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:13,093
Speaker 0: Death note.

116
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,204
Speaker 0: epitomize that to the point that I never bothered reading after.

117
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:17,730
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like a climax.

118
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,315
Speaker 1: You have some sort of collected.

119
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,401
Speaker 1: You know unified work of art.

120
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:27,137
Speaker 1: You know that spans many pages or many chapters right and Some of the chapters are so great.

121
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:30,870
Speaker 1: You know like amazingly great, and then some of these chapters.

122
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:34,390
Speaker 1: You know they might not be amazingly great, but they'll still be okay.

123
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:52,690
Speaker 1: But because they're together You're comparing that part to the previous part And you like you treat it like shit even though if it was only the okay part on its own you would treat it Okay, it's just because you have the added disappointment of you know the high expectations set by the earlier parts of the work.

124
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,202
Speaker 1: But it depends more negative feelings about the other part.

125
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,390
Speaker 0: after the cool thing happened in Death Note.

126
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:06,139
Speaker 1: What came after was not something I would have read and I might not have read it But I wouldn't have said it's terrible.

127
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,444
Speaker 1: I said it's okay.

128
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:08,710
Speaker 0: Yes, it's kind of normal.

129
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,370
Speaker 0: I didn't say that the third last third of bone was terrible either.

130
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,823
Speaker 0: I said it was tired and cliched which it very much was.

131
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,816
Speaker 1: yeah, but You know it's like people.

132
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:22,410
Speaker 1: you know if you look at the general opinion people have of you know the the parts of things.

133
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:23,400
Speaker 1: It I don't know.

134
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:24,269
Speaker 1: I see it happening.

135
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

136
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:30,010
Speaker 0: I have to death note would have been better off if it had ended shortly after the climax.

137
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:30,970
Speaker 1: I mean here also.

138
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:36,746
Speaker 1: You know I guess Star Wars might be like the ultimate example because episode one did really suck.

139
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:37,510
Speaker 0: see that's the thing.

140
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,745
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson always made this argument with us for the longest time.

141
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:48,001
Speaker 0: we bring him up a lot I've noticed, but we'd always trash Especially after the first two Star Wars movies that come out the new ones.

142
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:49,205
Speaker 0: ah those movies were crap.

143
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:50,128
Speaker 0: They're nothing.

144
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:55,766
Speaker 0: They're awful Ah, and I never even bothered watching either one of them again, but he always said no.

145
00:08:56,006 --> 00:09:00,250
Speaker 0: They're not actually worse You're just your expectations and your childhood nostalgia.

146
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:06,190
Speaker 0: You got to be a kid to see those movies, but one kids who saw those movies also didn't like that.

147
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,021
Speaker 1: Well, you know episode one was just terrible all around.

148
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,310
Speaker 0: episode one was an awful movie.

149
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, episode two was an okay-ish movie that had some bad parts.

150
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:20,930
Speaker 0: episode two was a movie I would watch like if I was sick in bed, and it was the only.

151
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:28,522
Speaker 1: That's the kind of movie you'd watch for free on TV when you're bored And you can't get up and then I work on my laptop and not care that there were commercials.

152
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:35,402
Speaker 1: right episode three was actually a slightly above average sort of Entertaining shallow romp kind of movie.

153
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:39,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know and Watch episode three.

154
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,710
Speaker 0: I could maybe watch it one more time in my life.

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't watch it repeatedly repeatedly forever like I watch the Empire Strikes Back right now.

156
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,870
Speaker 1: I can watch the Empire Strikes Back right now and put it on repeat until I die.

157
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:52,993
Speaker 0: I don't know.

158
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:58,530
Speaker 0: I might have to break it up with a new hope and possibly the Lord of the Rings.

159
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:06,949
Speaker 1: I could watch any move any of those movies in any combination on repeat until I die And I would pretty much not have a reason to get up.

160
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:08,460
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah.

161
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:17,561
Speaker 1: But I do think that episode three gets less praise that it possibly You know it deserves a little bit a tiny bit of praise.

162
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,640
Speaker 1: you know what I don't think it gets that tiny bit To four or five and six.

163
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:23,150
Speaker 0: I think it got all the praise it deserved.

164
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:30,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus we can't forget never forget the feeling you had because I know you all had this feeling.

165
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:39,970
Speaker 0: remember Way back when the news came out They're making more Star Wars and everyone in the world lost their shit including all of us everyone.

166
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:41,709
Speaker 0: This was gonna be the biggest thing ever.

167
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:46,969
Speaker 0: Remember how you felt sitting in that theater when Star Wars appeared on screen?

168
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,288
Speaker 0: episode one and that music started playing and that tech started scrolling.

169
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:54,390
Speaker 0: and Remember how you felt when you walked out of that theater.

170
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:02,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember that feeling Where no one wanted to admit out loud how absolutely shitty that movie was to anyone else.

171
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,529
Speaker 0: Everyone was kind of waiting for someone to say it.

172
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,097
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was some bad times.

173
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,603
Speaker 0: bone is not like that.

174
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:10,707
Speaker 0: the bone is good.

175
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:11,530
Speaker 0: Don't get us wrong.

176
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

177
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,078
Speaker 1: Let's do anyway.

178
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:16,106
Speaker 0: All right, so I got some real news here.

179
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,497
Speaker 0: This is that I don't know how many of you are aware.

180
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:23,599
Speaker 0: I'm sure every punk kid out there listening is aware This is one of those things that just doesn't.

181
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,365
Speaker 0: it's not in my demographic.

182
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:27,010
Speaker 0: It's not something that gets on my radar.

183
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,789
Speaker 0: So it's one of those things I know about but I don't care about.

184
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:48,710
Speaker 0: So to explain to those of you who might not be hip to the internet as a website called crunchyroll crunchyfrog crunchyroll Okay, and crunchyroll Basically, you can go there and watch fan subs straight up streaming in real time.

185
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:53,669
Speaker 0: Just click on and watch him and also anything licensed that no one happens to have complained about yet.

186
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:59,110
Speaker 0: No, and this is one of those semi shady dubious kind of deals.

187
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,744
Speaker 0: But they got a lot of anime in there and even good stuff.

188
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,190
Speaker 0: You want to see some Galaxy Express?

189
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,279
Speaker 0: You want to see anything?

190
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:14,883
Speaker 0: It's all in there Except for stuff that has been specifically demanded to be taken down But because of copyright law due to people having licenses to distribute in the u.s.

191
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:15,465
Speaker 0: Mmm.

192
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,930
Speaker 0: now this word gets interesting.

193
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,495
Speaker 0: Everyone kind of assumed.

194
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:18,796
Speaker 0: Yes.

195
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:21,545
Speaker 0: I like that'll eventually get shut down that that happens.

196
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,010
Speaker 0: There's no way that's legal.

197
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:38,143
Speaker 0: well You see crunchyroll Just got four million dollars in capital from a legitimate and well known Well-funded very very I can't say legitimate enough.

198
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,690
Speaker 0: It's a real venture capital firm Ben rock.

199
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,510
Speaker 1: Why can't we get venture capital?

200
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:48,530
Speaker 1: I mean, it seems like everyone in their mother even like really unprofessional not big people is getting venture capital.

201
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:49,760
Speaker 1: Why can't we get it?

202
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:51,070
Speaker 1: It should be so easy.

203
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,610
Speaker 1: Let's just quit our jobs get some and then write software and make podcasts.

204
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:02,268
Speaker 0: I'll tell you this out there if any of you know a venture capitalist There's a good investment right here.

205
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:12,290
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm telling you if you can pay for me and rim to not have to go to the city Every day all we will do is sit in our house and make things that are worth money.

206
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:24,158
Speaker 0: God, you know in forms of entertainment and software We can probably do four or five hours as long as we had a staff of like Podcasting radio television whatever every day.

207
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,336
Speaker 1: So anyone who knows like about business, which is the one thing we have No clue is what to do.

208
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,970
Speaker 1: We need a business person to business us The same way that Robert coup business penny arcade.

209
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,379
Speaker 0: There's the minor problem of.

210
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:45,028
Speaker 0: I have two competing desires in my life And these are two desires that have been fighting within me much like the forces fighting within.

211
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,061
Speaker 0: Dr Jekyll for all of my life.

212
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:53,086
Speaker 0: on one hand I am ambitious and I will really not stop short until everyone in the world knows my name.

213
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,513
Speaker 1: on the other hand you're lazy now.

214
00:13:54,573 --> 00:14:06,090
Speaker 0: on the other hand I Very much very much Understand and respect the decision of anyone who is able to make such a decision to live the life of the idle rich.

215
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:10,952
Speaker 0: Mmm idle rich is the way to go idle rich is high quality I think.

216
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:16,840
Speaker 0: in the end if I was idle rich though, I'd probably just podcast a lot maybe Casting from my yacht.

217
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:25,950
Speaker 0: I'd read a lot of softwares Anyway, so yeah four million dollars in legitimate not fake not laundered capital.

218
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:32,208
Speaker 0: Now this tells me something that either there are only really three possibilities here.

219
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:37,021
Speaker 0: one Four million dollars worth of money just got totally hoodwinked.

220
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,825
Speaker 1: That's quite possible

221
00:14:38,845 --> 00:15:08,008
Speaker 0: - The thing that I have been telling people who run anime clubs for the longest time The belief that I have had for pretty much as long as I've known about anime that pretty much Unless someone in the United States has the absolute legal right to distribute an anime There's almost nothing that can be done against you legally because the people in Japan the way international law and copyright law works It's really not worth it that I'm to sue you even if they can Mmm, which might be true or three?

222
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,130
Speaker 0: There's some other legal loophole where these venture capitalists realized that they can totally get away with it.

223
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,975
Speaker 1: Well, it really seems like this is just.

224
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:17,219
Speaker 1: I don't know why it's.

225
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,603
Speaker 1: are they investing in this site?

226
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:22,496
Speaker 1: because it's a popular video site And I think that that's they.

227
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:25,829
Speaker 1: think that that's like a you know, the hip new thing, you know to go along with.

228
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:29,517
Speaker 0: You know YouTube it's like Is they're going to have?

229
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:32,950
Speaker 0: they unveiled their first legal anime stream.

230
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,958
Speaker 1: So that's the plan they're going with.

231
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:40,313
Speaker 1: but the thing is they want to be the legal YouTube of anime sort of like that Hulu site.

232
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:40,916
Speaker 1: they came out today.

233
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:50,510
Speaker 0: It's a short flash animated series Entitled Eagle Talon the movie the Chancellor only lives twice in other words.

234
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,942
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought that was something like from Adult Swim or whatever.

235
00:15:54,364 --> 00:16:00,607
Speaker 0: Well, it eventually became that Apparently the short flash animation is the series that turned into that or something.

236
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:01,170
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

237
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,830
Speaker 0: I know that I'm just reading from anime news network.

238
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:12,070
Speaker 1: Okay but what it seems like because it seems like to me what the plan here is right is You start out by being a site with illegal shit, right?

239
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,260
Speaker 1: You get a bunch of visitors coming for the piracy stuff.

240
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,428
Speaker 1: you put out some original stuff next to it You get an audience for that.

241
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:30,170
Speaker 1: Then when people actually start to get on your case and get rid of the piracy stuff and you still got this audience for original Shit, and now you got money see while that's possible Which only your bait is illegal bait?

242
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,429
Speaker 1: It's not just sort of like if you go to the you're playing Zelda and you use that meat.

243
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,868
Speaker 0: It's not just venture capital.

244
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:43,150
Speaker 0: Venrock general partner David Simonov actually now sits on crunchyrolls board of directors.

245
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:49,550
Speaker 1: They have a board of directors for the sort of hackish Unprofessional looking crummy website that I could put together.

246
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,090
Speaker 0: I'm like a few days realize that if you get venture capital you pretty much have to put together a board of directors.

247
00:16:56,212 --> 00:17:00,246
Speaker 1: But I mean like I could make a website that does everything crunchyroll does.

248
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:04,109
Speaker 1: it would take a few days And the only thing I would need is money for all the servers to host it.

249
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,069
Speaker 0: And the only thing front and a copy of flash has to offer is that they already exist and they already have the market.

250
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,569
Speaker 0: No one's gonna go to your site because they already know about crunchyroll.

251
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,112
Speaker 1: I know.

252
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:18,401
Speaker 1: but the point is is like they didn't do much and that they didn't do anything I couldn't do and they got four million dollars.

253
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,089
Speaker 1: So why can't I get four million dollars?

254
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,811
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't.

255
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:21,897
Speaker 0: this was this news.

256
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,170
Speaker 0: wasn't Scott bitch about how he doesn't have any money?

257
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,440
Speaker 1: I just have yeah, what have enough money to work for myself.

258
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,104
Speaker 0: I don't care about you and your stupid.

259
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,070
Speaker 0: Eh, I want venture capital.

260
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,074
Speaker 0: Anyway, I want it.

261
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:38,990
Speaker 0: So the thing that this site has to offer is four million unique visitors and 50 million streams a month.

262
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:42,421
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because the piracy now the thing is they.

263
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,990
Speaker 0: they straight up just show fansubs.

264
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:53,289
Speaker 0: They say they're showing fansubs They just totally show whatever they can get and if anyone complains they just say oh, sorry and take it down.

265
00:17:54,293 --> 00:18:06,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even better I didn't even know this cuz I don't use this site but according to anime news network the way they make money is that you can get higher quality videos and Badges for your screen names.

266
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,490
Speaker 0: if you quote unquote donate money to them.

267
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:10,813
Speaker 1: Who?

268
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,710
Speaker 1: why would you pay money to have an icon appear next to your screen name?

269
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,510
Speaker 0: A lot of people will remember all the people who paid money to the natural selection developers to get that little shield.

270
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:19,849
Speaker 1: I never understood that.

271
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:29,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, beyond that they're actually now to make full-on money with his venture capital going to start putting video ads Into the full length episodes they offer.

272
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:42,809
Speaker 0: Oh, well people are gonna go right back to the fit torrents and they say they intend to work directly with quote a select number of Japanese firms unquote to acquire content legally, but the fact remains that they're just showing fansubs.

273
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,387
Speaker 0: and Here's what I really want to talk about.

274
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:51,726
Speaker 0: Funimation had some strong Bandai, but funimation's words are the are the best here.

275
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:58,310
Speaker 0: quote Funimation has been carefully monitoring the activities of crunchyroll.com for some time now.

276
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:07,722
Speaker 0: I point out if they've been monitoring and obviously everyone in the industry Probably in America and in Japan is fully aware of what crunchyroll is doing.

277
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:10,830
Speaker 0: yet crunchyroll has not been sued at all.

278
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:21,470
Speaker 0: I just want to note that yeah since 2006 Funimation has provided several letters notifying the site's operators of copyright infringement issues in connection with content that has been made available through the site.

279
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:27,606
Speaker 0: To date crunchyroll.com has complied with Funimation's demands to remove applicable content.

280
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:40,066
Speaker 0: now again All this says to me is that people in the u.s I only are able to go after these people if they have the license and No one is going after these people if no one in the u.s.

281
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:40,730
Speaker 0: Has the license.

282
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:52,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if they're got a fansub up there of some anime that you know It's maybe old or is maybe super brand new and no u.s Company has the rights to it then it just let they just let it go.

283
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,469
Speaker 1: the Japanese companies don't do anything about it.

284
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:04,181
Speaker 0: now it is a question of whether they they don't because they don't want to because it's not worth the effort because they can't because they Can't might be an option.

285
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:05,910
Speaker 0: that might actually be what's going on.

286
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:08,900
Speaker 0: But this is gonna get real interesting now.

287
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,278
Speaker 0: the rest of what Funimation said was basically, you know here Here's don't pirate.

288
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,084
Speaker 0: Please don't pirate.

289
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:13,850
Speaker 0: Please don't pirate.

290
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, here is something interesting I'm thinking of.

291
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:42,441
Speaker 1: right if the Japanese anime companies try cuz fansubbing is sort of like, you know Unique to anime and manga right and not so much anything else, you know What if like we took some DS games that were made in Japan and aren't don't have a US release Right, and we took those and we translated them and then distributed them for free all pirate Like would we get away with it?

292
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:43,789
Speaker 1: Like the fansubbers get away with it?

293
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,110
Speaker 0: You see the thing is I'm pretty sure it's covered under all the same rules.

294
00:20:47,512 --> 00:21:06,875
Speaker 0: I think the only difference there is that if the game Involved licensed properties like but there's the same thing with anime I guess like if I have the license to distribute everything I don't know involving Ichigo from bleach then the US company that has that right could possibly go after the fansubber For distributing.

295
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,002
Speaker 0: but then again, it gets tricky.

296
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:09,410
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly how it works.

297
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:19,667
Speaker 0: But I would believe that if this works with fansubs, it'll work with any Foreign copyright that does not have a legal distribution in the United States.

298
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:22,330
Speaker 1: Yeah It's gonna be interesting.

299
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:30,618
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically if crunchyroll doesn't get totally fucked and shut down because they could be a lawsuit just you know Sort of being prepared by lawyers takes time.

300
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,930
Speaker 1: It's not like you can just be like lawsuit right now like Phoenix, right?

301
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:39,309
Speaker 1: You got a you know You gotta have lawyers work on it and they create a case and then they finally go to court and say

302
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:48,210
Speaker 0: alright but if they don't get shut down and they don't take away all their fansub stuff and I find it interesting that fansubbers a lot of fansubbers seem to not like them.

303
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,269
Speaker 0: But at the same time what the hell can a fansubber do?

304
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,850
Speaker 0: I guess technically they have the right to their fansub, but I don't think any fan.

305
00:21:56,392 --> 00:22:02,310
Speaker 1: I don't think you're gonna be able to claim that you you would have the right the copyright to your subtitle track.

306
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:07,776
Speaker 1: Yes, I guess maybe that'd be a really tough case Even if you did.

307
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:15,128
Speaker 0: the problem there is that no fansubber has the money to sue these people even if they are right And also if a fansubber had the money to sue them.

308
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:21,890
Speaker 1: If fansubber had the money to sue someone with venture capital, they would have the money to license the show and release it.

309
00:22:22,613 --> 00:22:23,036
Speaker 0: You know what.

310
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:36,710
Speaker 0: when it comes to online distribution, I'll say this real quick I think the best way to deal with all this crap right now is to hire the fansubbers that don't suck and License for distribution digitally in the US via iTunes.

311
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:42,074
Speaker 0: All the anime as it comes out in Japan like two days after it comes out you should just know.

312
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:42,516
Speaker 1: I think the.

313
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 1: I think the really the only way to do it is to team up with Japan and Create animated TV shows that have appeal in both countries.

314
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,870
Speaker 1: I'm just talking about distribution.

315
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:56,798
Speaker 0: What are you always bringing up?

316
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:57,421
Speaker 0: the moe crap?

317
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,010
Speaker 0: I'm talking purely about distribution.

318
00:22:59,093 --> 00:22:59,590
Speaker 1: I'm okay.

319
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:13,223
Speaker 0: one of the biggest complaints that fansub people who watch fansubs and I Agree a little bit is that the shows we want to watch are the new shows because we've seen all the old shows and the New shows are coming out in Japan right now.

320
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:14,390
Speaker 0: by the time they get licensed.

321
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:19,850
Speaker 0: There's already newer shows coming out and a lot of people just want to watch the shows right now.

322
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:25,110
Speaker 0: So they watch Spice and Wolf fansubs and then they're not gonna buy the DVD when Spice and Wolf comes out on DVD?

323
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:25,552
Speaker 0: I don't know.

324
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:26,839
Speaker 0: whenever I don't know.

325
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:32,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even if it was on iTunes, you wouldn't buy it I might you then why don't you go buy the stuff that's on iTunes now?

326
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:38,930
Speaker 0: Let's remember then they could shut down all the fansubbers because they have legal distribution rights Yeah, but they can't get the rights because the Japanese companies.

327
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:50,740
Speaker 0: Yes, it all comes down to the Japanese companies not understanding that they're basically destroying their market in the US by being so afraid of Re-importation because their prices are way too high in Japan to begin with.

328
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:53,610
Speaker 1: and we're gonna have the same discussion over and over again.

329
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this whole crunchyroll thing is gonna be interesting.

330
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,410
Speaker 0: But once again, they totally haven't been sued and they're totally getting away with it.

331
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the best anyone has done has written a strongly worded letter that came to nothing.

332
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:13,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically what this comes down to is the story hasn't changed But crunchyroll has sort of thrown this interesting wrench in the works.

333
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:20,490
Speaker 1: I think that's going to basically like, you know, pull the sheet away and you know reveal the man behind the curtain.

334
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,507
Speaker 0: This is gonna be really awesome one way or the other I think.

335
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:31,640
Speaker 0: so Things of the day.

336
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,950
Speaker 0: This is a little old.

337
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:45,819
Speaker 0: It's from katsu khan but at katsu khan We brought among a lot of other people some of our own personal staff and one of our staffers is actually named katsu And katsu has done kendo panels of.

338
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:53,570
Speaker 0: I believe his most epic one was the one he ran at Otakon last year Which was if you've ever seen, you know, you know most anime con panels.

339
00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:08,701
Speaker 0: It's people like yelling and screaming like if you search YouTube for like anime match game You'll see a lot of videos of us running the anime match game at various cons and it's pretty much mumble mumble mumble mumble Pokemon and then the crowd just loses their goddamn shit.

340
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:11,630
Speaker 1: It's really kind of scary.

341
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,394
Speaker 0: But katsu, right?

342
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:20,113
Speaker 0: He just he does this panel and He didn't even use a microphone so he's talking kind of quietly for a very large room.

343
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:26,756
Speaker 0: the room was so silent You could cut the tension with a knife and everyone was on the edge of their seats.

344
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:30,279
Speaker 0: Just like wrapped with attention It was it was all they were all straining to hear.

345
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:33,738
Speaker 0: No, they were wrapped with attention because even when he was loud everyone was like.

346
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:47,508
Speaker 0: Of course it also helped that I filtered the questions so all the dumb crap people were asking didn't get up there and only the good questions like How is kendo different from real sword fighting?

347
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,718
Speaker 0: Mmm, but yeah katsu does these awesome things.

348
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:59,039
Speaker 0: and While he was staffing the video game room one of the other game katsu staffers was like yeah Blah blah blah swords and there there's some talking in it.

349
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:03,960
Speaker 0: There happened to be some objects made of foam stiff foam that resembled swords.

350
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:11,240
Speaker 0: So like people are want to do this person challenged katsu to a sword fight.

351
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:13,445
Speaker 1: Well, that's real smart.

352
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:17,480
Speaker 1: that's like if I went up to Mike Tyson and said hey you want a box everybody has a plan.

353
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:19,438
Speaker 1: Hey Kasparov wanna play chess?

354
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,759
Speaker 0: But hey rim and Scott you want a podcast.

355
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:34,369
Speaker 0: But Katsu was never one to back down from a challenge and I think we've told the story of when he completely owned those punk kids At Otakon a couple years ago.

356
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:38,572
Speaker 0: We have some pictures of that somewhere but this video was taken.

357
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:50,363
Speaker 0: and If you ever want to see the difference between someone who knows how to use a sword and someone who thinks they know how to Use a sword this I don't think he thinks he knows how to use this hard But he did.

358
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:56,960
Speaker 0: you can always tell the people that don't know how to use swords are Swinging them around and they always have some cool looking stance.

359
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:05,100
Speaker 0: and meanwhile katsu's just standing there and I As katsu explained to me whenever he played fights against someone who doesn't know what they're doing.

360
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:22,496
Speaker 0: It's like you're standing there and another person is dancing around in slow motion And you just have to pick where you want to poke them and when you want to poke them and it happens This is mostly epic for the last little duel because it looks whoa the guy finally blocked something.

361
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,738
Speaker 0: then you realize no Katsu sword is on the inside there.

362
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty hard to tell like exactly.

363
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:36,510
Speaker 1: It's not like the most obvious Demonstration of his incredible abilities and that's the thing about kendo.

364
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,459
Speaker 1: It's like unless you know what you're looking for.

365
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,342
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

366
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,030
Speaker 1: it's not like holy crap.

367
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,123
Speaker 1: He got bashed over the head knees on the ground or holy crap.

368
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:48,470
Speaker 1: There's a sword right through his guts You know, it's sort of like the sword pokes him somewhere.

369
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:55,670
Speaker 1: but it's like you look at the speed and the reach and You know the fact that the other guy was like, oh shit, he couldn't do anything about it.

370
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,415
Speaker 0: It's like guy standing there.

371
00:27:57,837 --> 00:28:00,344
Speaker 0: suddenly katsu was hit him with the sword and the guys like what?

372
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:01,147
Speaker 0: Yep.

373
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:02,270
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

374
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:07,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, but speaking of cons, this is kind of a lame segue, but I want to talk about this a little bit.

375
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:19,126
Speaker 0: I mentioned before that, you know that summer con seasons coming up and Let me tell you This year has been a bigger season of us doing crap at cons than we've had previously.

376
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:23,139
Speaker 0: and the content We're probably going to be running at the cons this summer.

377
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,106
Speaker 0: There's going to be a lot of it.

378
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:28,770
Speaker 0: suffice to say So, uh suffice suffice.

379
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:35,370
Speaker 0: So Connecticut where I'm working on that make a t-shirt that says suffice to say it looks like a Connecticut.

380
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:48,730
Speaker 0: We're gonna be running panels pretty much all day Saturday and we're we're working on getting uncle yo to do something awesome because we like uncle yo and Katsu might be running not only a kendo panel, but some kendo workshops.

381
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,450
Speaker 0: We're still working out the details of this but katsu might be running kendo workshops much of the time.

382
00:28:54,892 --> 00:29:03,244
Speaker 0: Oh man, and what we're working on this is by no means set in stone But Connecticut has a better gaming room than most gaming cons have a gaming con.

383
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:05,370
Speaker 1: That is for sure tabletop gaming room.

384
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,656
Speaker 1: We're not talking about the video game room.

385
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:10,593
Speaker 1: the video game room in all honesty at least last year was kind of a Most cons.

386
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:14,570
Speaker 0: gaming rooms are kind of a separate atzuka, especially compared to katsu khan, right?

387
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:23,419
Speaker 0: But no the tabletop gaming room at Connecticut top-tier top This is not like oh he's coming don't even think this.

388
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,909
Speaker 0: but I have mentioned to Luke Crane that Connecticut is a place He should run burning wheel stuff and all he said back was duly noted.

389
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:33,910
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, but you never know you never know.

390
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,433
Speaker 0: but even if he is not at a Connecticut someday in the future we are going to try to run some burning wheel demos at Connecticut.

391
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:45,335
Speaker 0: and we got this cool idea where some board gaming stuff, but it's anime night So I'm not gonna talk about that.

392
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,830
Speaker 0: But uh, our panel lineup is getting kind of long.

393
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,520
Speaker 0: That anime you should see did crazy.

394
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,330
Speaker 0: Well at katsu khan's we're gonna see the most generic panel.

395
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,156
Speaker 1: It's like this what anime you should watch.

396
00:29:56,557 --> 00:30:00,830
Speaker 1: It doesn't get more generic than that people and somehow that's a crazy popular panel.

397
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:13,520
Speaker 0: but yet when a full third of the people in the room had never seen cowboy bebop and When we get a standing ovation at the end for our history lesson, yeah, I think it went well completely non sequitur Misplaced history lesson.

398
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:19,270
Speaker 0: Well, but it worked Well, like it actually kind of like doing it in that panel instead of at the late show almost worked better.

399
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:25,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think that it just really had nothing to do with the panel But it works anyway, which proves people go to a panel.

400
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,370
Speaker 1: They're not looking for anything specific.

401
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,128
Speaker 1: They just want you to say anime anime anime.

402
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:36,049
Speaker 0: I don't think it was a non-sequitur at all because one of the ideas of that panel was that there's a lot of anime You'll never hear of and you've got to find this stuff and watch it.

403
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess actually you could shoehorn it in.

404
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:41,716
Speaker 0: the results of this are not public yet But I can say one thing.

405
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:50,961
Speaker 0: based on the surveys from katsu khan It seems like the biggest kind of panel people want at anime cons is Anime panels.

406
00:30:51,243 --> 00:31:01,295
Speaker 0: that might sound crazy but if you look at the schedule for any major con very few of the panels and workshops at anime conventions are Actually straight up about anime.

407
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:16,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think back and it's like you see panels like Megaman something cosplay something DDR something this video game series Do a cosplay ball join a ball join a doll something and those are all well and good.

408
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:19,659
Speaker 1: But it's people apparently want.

409
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,550
Speaker 1: at least people who fill out surveys want anime panels.

410
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:23,434
Speaker 0: I only that.

411
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,222
Speaker 0: but this was a generic panel.

412
00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,030
Speaker 0: and you know, you might balk a generic panel.

413
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,178
Speaker 0: But think about this.

414
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:35,605
Speaker 0: I bought a generic panel not anymore I don't at all because a lot of people talk to us afterward and said wow I never would have known about those shows.

415
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:37,454
Speaker 0: and Remember these.

416
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,342
Speaker 0: a lot of great shows are not talked about.

417
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:46,799
Speaker 0: a lot because all the hardcore anime fans Everyone's seen eska flown a everyone's seen cowboy bebop.

418
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,585
Speaker 0: I won't even deign to discuss it.

419
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:50,170
Speaker 0: Why would I do a panel about that?

420
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,367
Speaker 0: I have to do a panel about the new stuff for the obscure stuff that no one likes.

421
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,556
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean while you're new.

422
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:58,262
Speaker 0: All right, I like bleach.

423
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,104
Speaker 0: I'm watching my bleach.

424
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:00,690
Speaker 0: Oh man, check out one piece.

425
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,539
Speaker 0: It's the same kind of show.

426
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:01,882
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

427
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:02,529
Speaker 0: I really like that.

428
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:10,603
Speaker 0: How the hell are they gonna find out about cowboy bebop unless someone says all right kid You want to see the good stuff cowboy bebop eska Ava?

429
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:11,547
Speaker 0: You never heard of these shows.

430
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:12,029
Speaker 0: check them out.

431
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,990
Speaker 0: So panels like this are important and we're gonna try to run this at Pretty much every time we go to this year and then phase it out because you got to move on.

432
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,080
Speaker 0: But I think this panel is gonna do a lot.

433
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,604
Speaker 0: All right how to run an anime club We do forever gonna go through every single panel.

434
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:27,946
Speaker 1: We run.

435
00:32:27,966 --> 00:32:28,670
Speaker 0: I want to talk.

436
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,040
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a new kind of panel.

437
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,310
Speaker 0: know your creators.

438
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:38,469
Speaker 0: we're gonna try to talk about the directors and the character designers and the composers and the people that a lot of anime fans don't pay attention to.

439
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:41,810
Speaker 0: That they probably should because then it's real easy to find shows you like.

440
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,959
Speaker 1: That's a panel that I think definitely has to be run.

441
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,530
Speaker 0: I definitely I think that panels gonna go over really well.

442
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:50,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know all our anime match game crab katsu's kendo stuff.

443
00:32:50,447 --> 00:33:00,476
Speaker 0: We got a Suffice to say you got to think of something better to say than suffice to say watch out for us at Kinetic on Otakon anime next.

444
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,261
Speaker 1: are we doing anime next?

445
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:02,341
Speaker 1: Mmm.

446
00:33:02,922 --> 00:33:03,624
Speaker 0: I'm working on it.

447
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:05,930
Speaker 1: You're making all like these tentative announcements here.

448
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:07,763
Speaker 1: I'm not too comfortable with that.

449
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:10,170
Speaker 0: I Their tentative announcements.

450
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:11,816
Speaker 0: We're working on doing stuff.

451
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,670
Speaker 1: as long as you make it clear that you know, this is all maybes.

452
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:16,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we have the official announcement.

453
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:21,966
Speaker 0: once we have the official announcement But I'm definitely trying to do stuff at Kinetic on Saturday and Sunday.

454
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:22,930
Speaker 0: anime next.

455
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,865
Speaker 0: I really only want to do Saturday unless they make me a guest or something.

456
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:26,870
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna stay all weekend.

457
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:35,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Otakon, you know, we've all we have done stuff at Otakon every year every single Otakon since 2002.

458
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,469
Speaker 0: I doubt we are not going to be doing stuff at Otakon this year.

459
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:40,441
Speaker 1: That is is highly doubtful.

460
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:45,500
Speaker 0: and actually I can say this We're already planning next katsu kon game.

461
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,554
Speaker 0: katsu is already working on how to arrange the room For the next katsu kon.

462
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:54,706
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, seriously katsu kon my favorite kon to be staff at at least.

463
00:33:55,147 --> 00:34:00,274
Speaker 1: All right, so Tezuka God Synonymous, yes.

464
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:19,210
Speaker 1: Yes, I think so if you need further proof more obvious evidence Even to the complete layperson on the godlike omnipotent Omniscient qualities of the man that was Osamu Tezuka, but perhaps he you know lives on in some supernatural form.

465
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,155
Speaker 1: Here's an animation.

466
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:25,230
Speaker 1: You should watch this animation is actually taken off of YouTube and then put right back on YouTube.

467
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:29,097
Speaker 1: So if the link doesn't work Search free on it for you.

468
00:34:29,157 --> 00:34:30,965
Speaker 1: search YouTube for and you might find it.

469
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:39,370
Speaker 1: It's called Jumping and by Osamu Tezuka, it's a 1984 animation short film that won some awards.

470
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:49,050
Speaker 1: I think it's some you know film festivals or whatever and all it is is basically It's a bouncing ball of some sort, but you don't see the ball.

471
00:34:49,512 --> 00:34:53,070
Speaker 1: The camera is sort of from the view of the ball.

472
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,458
Speaker 1: so it's as if you were a ball bouncing.

473
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:09,610
Speaker 1: and you're bouncing around this world looking at stuff and It's the way this is made in 1984 and look at the kind of animation He was able to produce even in the shitty low-resolution YouTube.

474
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:19,985
Speaker 1: It comes across so obviously and it's so great because every time the ball comes down to the ground There's like another surprise there waiting for you and oh, oh, it's so beautiful.

475
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,490
Speaker 1: Oh my god, you gotta watch this.

476
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:26,355
Speaker 0: Yeah Pretty much you should watch everything Osamu Tezuka's ever animated.

477
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:32,538
Speaker 1: if anything has the name Osamu Tezuka on it and you haven't watched it or read it You should probably do that.

478
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,150
Speaker 0: Some of it's not exactly amazing.

479
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:42,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't really need to read like ambassador magma, but at the same time it's kind of important.

480
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:46,529
Speaker 0: I mean It's like when you read like there's a great author and you read their great works.

481
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:51,030
Speaker 0: You also read they're not so great works to get a lot of perspective on them as artists.

482
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:54,941
Speaker 1: It's like watching really old bad like Mickey Mouse cartoons.

483
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:57,228
Speaker 1: they were not all great even though many of them were.

484
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:00,565
Speaker 0: yeah But I'll admit I'm not terribly entertained by Steamboat Willie.

485
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:06,859
Speaker 1: Oh Of course I love the one with the musical skeletons even better.

486
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:09,548
Speaker 0: ah the musicals we watched that recently didn't we?

487
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:10,210
Speaker 1: I don't know.

488
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:11,796
Speaker 1: We can watch it again.

489
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:16,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway before we get into the main main bit here There's a little bit of housekeeping.

490
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:25,622
Speaker 0: Scott after our wonderful relationship with our friends at vertical incorporated vertical Inc We got some stuff to give away and we're having a contest here.

491
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're actually gonna do real contest.

492
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,436
Speaker 1: We have a real prize.

493
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,444
Speaker 1: We're actually gonna deliver the real prize.

494
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:32,990
Speaker 1: There's no deadline for the contest.

495
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically here's how that how it.

496
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:35,037
Speaker 1: what's going on.

497
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,570
Speaker 1: We have the three volumes of the goo and saga manga.

498
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:41,910
Speaker 1: It is a side story to the goo and saga series of novels.

499
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:45,530
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into it, you know that much because I talked about it last week.

500
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:46,834
Speaker 1: You know, you can go find out.

501
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,239
Speaker 1: but basically the contest works.

502
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:53,086
Speaker 1: the prize all three volumes of the manga That's the entire manga from beginning to end.

503
00:36:54,172 --> 00:37:04,822
Speaker 1: In order to get them you must email us an essay at least five paragraphs in length with zero Errors as far as punctuation grammar and spelling the end.

504
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:07,950
Speaker 1: you have to do it properly.

505
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:10,170
Speaker 1: Do you have any other rules besides that?

506
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:21,143
Speaker 1: The subject of the essay must be something along the lines of why you deserve the manga or why we should give the manga to You or why you should be the one to win the contest and not anyone else.

507
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:24,789
Speaker 0: and you know, you might say well What's the deadline of your contest and pretty much?

508
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:31,850
Speaker 0: We're gonna end it as soon as or near about when we either get enough injuries or an entry is so good.

509
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:33,298
Speaker 0: We've already got an entry.

510
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:33,901
Speaker 0: that's pretty good.

511
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:34,807
Speaker 0: So you better get on this.

512
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:47,706
Speaker 1: Yeah Pretty much the idea is that all the contests you've run in the past people don't follow the rules so much and Pretty much we end up with no valid entries and just pisses us off.

513
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,861
Speaker 1: So Odds are that anyone who submits to this contest.

514
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:54,170
Speaker 1: I mean, we've already gotten some invalid entries.

515
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:58,546
Speaker 1: I mean, come on, even though we talked about how you shouldn't send it an invalid entry.

516
00:37:58,586 --> 00:37:59,148
Speaker 1: We got some.

517
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:02,321
Speaker 0: however I'll say this the one valid entry that we have.

518
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,670
Speaker 1: I still have to check to see that one's valid.

519
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:08,122
Speaker 0: It looks valid from looks valid at a cursory glance.

520
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:10,350
Speaker 0: It also includes some very important things.

521
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:17,530
Speaker 0: I see the phrase non masturbatory activity, which definitely is always a plus whenever oh, I see bondage fairies.

522
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:24,930
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so the other thing is that I learned a lesson from one of these submissions so far to the contest.

523
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:31,090
Speaker 1: Is that someone sent us their submission as an attachment to their email in the form of a doc X file?

524
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:34,551
Speaker 1: Which is I guess in Microsoft Word 2007.

525
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:40,690
Speaker 0: I couldn't open that on any computer that I own including my work computer or my Windows Vista computer.

526
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're Linux people here.

527
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,370
Speaker 1: We can't open that shit.

528
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:51,620
Speaker 1: you need to send us either just put your essay in your email directly or Send us a file format that we can read like I don't know a text

529
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,104
Speaker 0: file an open format

530
00:38:53,144 --> 00:39:03,864
Speaker 1: an RTF file an open document Format file an HTML file something like that something that anyone can open, you know If it can be open with open office, then you can send it to us.

531
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,070
Speaker 1: That's pretty much how it works.

532
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:07,296
Speaker 1: All right there.

533
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:08,484
Speaker 1: any other rules to the contest?

534
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:09,349
Speaker 0: actually, you know what?

535
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got nothing.

536
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:11,978
Speaker 1: Okay.

537
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,329
Speaker 1: So yeah, try to enter the contest.

538
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,300
Speaker 1: Maybe you'll win if your entry is valid.

539
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,910
Speaker 1: your odds of winning are crazily high.

540
00:39:20,352 --> 00:39:23,250
Speaker 1: They're like a million times better than your odds of winning the lottery.

541
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:30,770
Speaker 0: Well so far your odds are pretty much 50% as long as you meet the rules and don't suck because we only have one valid entry.

542
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:37,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, come on free manga people free manga free pretty good manga from people who have never failed to bring us amazing manga.

543
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:38,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, can't go wrong.

544
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:43,899
Speaker 0: Anyway, luckily you might have noticed we kind of Terried a bit and getting to the main bit.

545
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:48,300
Speaker 0: that's because there's not a lot to say about this But mostly because there's not so much of it yet.

546
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:50,690
Speaker 0: something must be said Scott.

547
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:54,502
Speaker 0: What is the title of the comic we're reviewing tonight?

548
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:56,830
Speaker 1: Well, you know rim he's not a fan of the underwear perverts.

549
00:39:57,331 --> 00:40:04,590
Speaker 0: I'll say this I there are two depictions of underwear perverts not counting anything by Alan Moore that I've actually enjoyed.

550
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,581
Speaker 0: Also not counting when I was a kid watching the x-men cartoon.

551
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,644
Speaker 1: x-men cartoon cuz.

552
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:10,069
Speaker 0: that's special and I really like that.

553
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:12,296
Speaker 1: Didn't you like those x-men movies that I don't like?

554
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:13,400
Speaker 0: not really.

555
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,984
Speaker 0: No, that's that's all everyone else.

556
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:16,750
Speaker 0: Okay, I've been different to them.

557
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:21,290
Speaker 0: I saw that the one with the juggernaut in the theater and you know what that movie wasn't a bore.

558
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,950
Speaker 1: Well people seem to people seem to mostly laud the first one and second one.

559
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:28,770
Speaker 1: Right, I think I saw the first one and didn't like it.

560
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,390
Speaker 1: I don't think I saw the second one which people say is better whatever.

561
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:36,210
Speaker 0: But anyway, and I kind of like the spider-man live-action movie, but the first one was good.

562
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was but in comic book form.

563
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,269
Speaker 0: I didn't see the others pretty much.

564
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:49,887
Speaker 0: I've liked Superman as depicted in Batman the Dark Knight Returns and I have liked Batman in The Dark Knight Returns and the Watchmen I saw excluded Alan Moore.

565
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:53,738
Speaker 0: Okay That's that's not really underwear perverts.

566
00:40:53,758 --> 00:40:55,323
Speaker 0: they don't wear underwear so much.

567
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:56,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do anyway.

568
00:40:56,908 --> 00:41:00,161
Speaker 1: not so much It's a superhero book whether you like it or not, but they're not underwear.

569
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,025
Speaker 1: pervert doesn't matter.

570
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,150
Speaker 0: You said underwear pervert.

571
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,075
Speaker 0: It's underwear.

572
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,584
Speaker 1: pervert is superhero.

573
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:05,510
Speaker 1: This is the same word.

574
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:11,009
Speaker 0: But the thing is if someone's not in spandex, I'm so much more likely to read it All right.

575
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:19,249
Speaker 1: Anyway, so here we have a comic and let me it says on the front of this comic The greatest superhero book of all time is finally here.

576
00:41:19,732 --> 00:41:21,620
Speaker 1: this is like the recipe for a comic.

577
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:31,958
Speaker 1: rim will not like also on the cover a Spandex or at least very tight glove with some sort of spandex sleeve Punching a guy in the face through a door.

578
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:35,530
Speaker 0: Ah, see I only like punching in the face if it's robots or Hokuto.

579
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,053
Speaker 0: No, Ken.

580
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this kind of comic.

581
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:46,050
Speaker 1: judging by the cover Something rim probably wouldn't give a second eyeball to and something I wouldn't give a second eyeball to either.

582
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,610
Speaker 1: The reason I bought this comic is because it was incredibly cheap through my discount comic book server.

583
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:51,793
Speaker 0: Yeah We've learned something bad.

584
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:59,434
Speaker 0: no matter how awful a comic sounds if it's a nickel or a dime or a quarter hell if it's 50 Cents, it's hard not to buy it.

585
00:41:59,615 --> 00:41:59,836
Speaker 1: Right.

586
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:03,928
Speaker 1: Anyway, the comic the title of the comic is kick - ass.

587
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,664
Speaker 1: That's that's kind of hard to pass up something called kick-ass.

588
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,435
Speaker 0: no, no Scott Is this a?

589
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:12,609
Speaker 0: is this a comic about someone kicking ass?

590
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,890
Speaker 1: That that is what I was trying to find out when I read it.

591
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:23,624
Speaker 1: I ordered the first issue with this comic and because that's what I usually do when there's a when there's a one They really regularly discount the first issues of comics.

592
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:28,150
Speaker 1: that way you'll get the first issue You'll get hooked and you'll buy the rest of the issues that you know.

593
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,346
Speaker 1: Normal discount instead of excessive discount.

594
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:32,537
Speaker 1: Of course What I do is I buy the first issue.

595
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:40,109
Speaker 1: if it sucks, I just stop and if it's good I'll buy the trade paperback of the first volume and then maybe the second and third volumes if it goes on.

596
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:44,170
Speaker 1: So I got this first issue and didn't get any of the further issues.

597
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,378
Speaker 1: But you know and if it's good, I would get the trade.

598
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:49,149
Speaker 1: and let me tell you I think I'll be getting the first trade.

599
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:49,330
Speaker 1: now.

600
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:51,576
Speaker 1: Let me tell you a little bit about this book first.

601
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:53,281
Speaker 1: The book is called kick-ass.

602
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:56,290
Speaker 1: It's written by Mark Miller or Millar.

603
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:56,935
Speaker 1: I don't know.

604
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:59,740
Speaker 1: I'm not sure he's from Scotland Skorin.

605
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:02,257
Speaker 1: yep It's drawn.

606
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:11,530
Speaker 1: the art is by John Romita jr Who is a famous Marvel comic book artist the son of John Romita senior who is also a comic book artist and it's published by icon.

607
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:18,421
Speaker 1: Now when it says icon on the book But if you know comics you'll look inside and it says kick-ass.

608
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:21,610
Speaker 1: number one copyright 2008 all rights deserved.

609
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:29,630
Speaker 1: Published monthly by Marvel Publishing Incorporated, but wait, it doesn't say Marvel on the outside It only says icon on the outside.

610
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:33,241
Speaker 1: That's basically, you know, it's called an imprint like vertigo.

611
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,368
Speaker 1: comics are actually DC comics.

612
00:43:35,468 --> 00:43:37,930
Speaker 1: wild storm Comics are actually DC Comics.

613
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:48,580
Speaker 1: This is a regular thing in the publishing industry where you will put a different logo a different trademark as the publisher even when it's the same company that is doing the publishing.

614
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:53,056
Speaker 1: for example when Tokyo pop publishes a Hentai or a yaoi.

615
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,264
Speaker 1: they put some sort of different logo on it.

616
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:56,690
Speaker 1: They don't say this is Tokyo pop.

617
00:43:57,532 --> 00:43:58,439
Speaker 0: There's two reasons for that.

618
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,693
Speaker 0: in the case Scott is brought up There are many reasons.

619
00:44:00,753 --> 00:44:05,350
Speaker 0: yourself from something you're releasing that will be popular and you will make money off of.

620
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:09,549
Speaker 0: But you don't want to scare away other people by associating your brand with it.

621
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:16,862
Speaker 1: Yep The other reason you do it is because if someone reads something, you know What you want people to sort of have some sort of publisher loyalty.

622
00:44:16,882 --> 00:44:20,033
Speaker 1: and there's a lot more publisher loyalty with comic books And there's other things.

623
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:24,890
Speaker 1: so if someone likes, you know a comic book by Marvel, they like other comics by Marvel.

624
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,930
Speaker 1: They sort of do that like a lot of comic book stores organize the stores by publisher.

625
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:35,330
Speaker 1: So if you group together like all the vertigo books together, there's a lot of people who are vertigo readers.

626
00:44:35,532 --> 00:44:37,190
Speaker 1: You know, they read vertigo books.

627
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:41,050
Speaker 1: They don't care, you know who the actual publisher is doesn't matter so much.

628
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,747
Speaker 1: But but the publishing label on there does matter and it's sort of it.

629
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:53,650
Speaker 1: It sort of means something, you know that because they're basically consciously saying ah This is a book that those kinds of people enjoy.

630
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,070
Speaker 1: So we'll put the same label on it as those other books that people enjoy.

631
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,530
Speaker 0: It's not quite to the level of what goes on in Japan.

632
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,006
Speaker 0: I kind of wish it would get to get there, but that's neither here nor there.

633
00:45:03,107 --> 00:45:05,899
Speaker 0: No now The get into the story of this.

634
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:11,439
Speaker 0: you're gonna get into the book because I can I can synopsize The story as in what it is about.

635
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,810
Speaker 1: We've only got one issue of a comic book here.

636
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,598
Speaker 1: This is like less than how many pages is this thing?

637
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:17,060
Speaker 1: Let's see.

638
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:20,149
Speaker 1: How many pages of content do we have here?

639
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:21,942
Speaker 1: There are no page numbers.

640
00:45:21,983 --> 00:45:22,670
Speaker 1: That's fantastic.

641
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,126
Speaker 0: But like Batman the Dark Knight Returns is about Batman returning.

642
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:27,652
Speaker 0: if I was gonna you know Put it together.

643
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:35,030
Speaker 0: Watchmen is about realistic superheroes in a realistic setting or it's a I'm not gonna get into what it's really about.

644
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:35,992
Speaker 0: You know.

645
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:39,061
Speaker 0: X-men is about spandex wearing people hitting other people.

646
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,431
Speaker 1: This is like 23 22.

647
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:44,879
Speaker 1: It's between 22 and 24 pages of content.

648
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:56,775
Speaker 1: in this one issue kick-ass is about what if Someone in the real physical modern world where there's so far nothing supernatural has occurred Nothing supernatural whatsoever.

649
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:57,939
Speaker 1: No powers.

650
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,921
Speaker 1: No magic.

651
00:45:59,242 --> 00:45:59,904
Speaker 1: No nothing.

652
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:02,989
Speaker 1: It's a world in which everything is normal Just like the real world.

653
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,005
Speaker 0: I mean Watchmen could have been that way except that people were a little larger than life.

654
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:11,440
Speaker 0: and then doc man had dr Manhattan 20 feet tall make a roommate of radiation.

655
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:11,601
Speaker 1: Dr.

656
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:12,564
Speaker 1: Manhattan versus dr.

657
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:12,945
Speaker 1: McNinja.

658
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:15,942
Speaker 1: who wins dr Manhattan?

659
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:19,576
Speaker 0: yeah, probably You know in the nerdfight dr.

660
00:46:19,596 --> 00:46:20,820
Speaker 0: Manhattan really can't lose.

661
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,882
Speaker 0: Oh he can lose.

662
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:23,045
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

663
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:24,730
Speaker 0: Well, maybe Unicron?

664
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:26,654
Speaker 1: Let's not do this.

665
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:27,678
Speaker 0: I think dr.

666
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,354
Speaker 0: Manhattan could kick Unicron's ass, but I digress be close Galactus, that'd be interesting.

667
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:33,518
Speaker 1: Oh Galactus versus dr.

668
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:34,000
Speaker 1: Manhattan.

669
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:36,750
Speaker 0: Anyway, we might have to do another Thursday like that.

670
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:38,370
Speaker 1: We did one a long time ago.

671
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:45,326
Speaker 0: It could be so long ago that we can do it again But it'd be interesting to do it again and see if we are consistent.

672
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:46,290
Speaker 1: That's true.

673
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,437
Speaker 0: I don't remember the old one at all.

674
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:48,402
Speaker 1: You couldn't listening to.

675
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:49,710
Speaker 1: the old one would be considered cheating.

676
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:51,581
Speaker 0: Yes, at least for us.

677
00:46:51,762 --> 00:46:53,009
Speaker 0: All right, but anyway, all right.

678
00:46:53,431 --> 00:47:08,610
Speaker 0: so this comic is about what if in the normal real world some high school kid was inspired and actually decided to get a spandex whatever costume and be a superhero and Basically be a vigilante go around and do the things that superheroes would do.

679
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:11,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's um, you know, it's sort of a normal kid.

680
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:12,889
Speaker 1: He you know, he's a little bit nerdy.

681
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:17,343
Speaker 1: He has some family problems as is common in comic books, right?

682
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:23,250
Speaker 1: He you know, he has some school issues right He's a stalker.

683
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:26,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically one of those.

684
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:30,630
Speaker 1: Hey, if you're some high school kid, we're here's a main character to identify with.

685
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:42,177
Speaker 1: There you go, you know, you'll you'll find they they give a kid so many, you know Small or and sometimes large everyday ish sort of real-world problems that no matter who's reading It will be able to identify with.

686
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:46,961
Speaker 1: at least one of the problems, you know, it's a typical Underwear pervert comic kind of thing, you know, I don't know.

687
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:48,750
Speaker 1: I did spider-man does the same kind of thing.

688
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,419
Speaker 0: I didn't terribly identify with.

689
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:51,464
Speaker 1: you're not a high school kid.

690
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:56,970
Speaker 0: Oh even in high school I wouldn't have identified with a lonely nerdish stalker kid who wants to be a superhero.

691
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:59,419
Speaker 1: No, but that's what the comic tries to do.

692
00:47:59,620 --> 00:47:59,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

694
00:48:00,262 --> 00:48:02,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's going for the target audience here.

695
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,616
Speaker 0: So we're pretty much gonna have to spoil this.

696
00:48:04,656 --> 00:48:12,822
Speaker 0: cuz spoiling that's like what this comic is about is like saying I'm trying to leave a Terminator 2 Arnold's the good guy.

697
00:48:12,843 --> 00:48:14,910
Speaker 1: This is a single issue of a comic book.

698
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:18,729
Speaker 1: We really if they don't spoil it, there's nothing to say about it.

699
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:20,895
Speaker 1: So other than this they read it.

700
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:33,230
Speaker 0: this what this is about is foreshadowed because it begins with someone who looks like a superhero Jumping off of a building and then activating his wings and the wings fail to activate and he dies.

701
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, he falls onto a car and dies.

702
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:44,236
Speaker 1: and then they introduce the kid and they show you all his problems That he has an everyday life and they show him fantasizing about being a superhero.

703
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:57,558
Speaker 1: and then the second half of the comic book is he actually goes out and tries to do some Superhero and he gets himself like a little cudgel and he puts on some spandex costume practices for a couple of days walking around on Rooftops stalking around in the dark.

704
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, he does a little practice actually a little training, right?

705
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:06,450
Speaker 1: And then he sees some guys, you know making mischief in an alley, you know some graffiti and he's like, all right.

706
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:07,068
Speaker 1: Here's my chance.

707
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:14,350
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say this this plays out pretty much aside from the cherry on top of the delicious sundae.

708
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,518
Speaker 0: That is the ass-kicking.

709
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:19,869
Speaker 0: this plays out Exactly how that would play out in the real world.

710
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:23,320
Speaker 1: Fucker gets stabbed he gets they guess Lee.

711
00:49:23,701 --> 00:49:26,670
Speaker 1: he goes over and he starts talking trash and you know what?

712
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,379
Speaker 1: Actually talks a good trash like you don't.

713
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:39,221
Speaker 1: from knowing the kid before it doesn't seem like he's the kind You know, that would be good at the comebacks, but it's like, you know, they're like what the fuck he says Here, let me read it.

714
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:39,747
Speaker 1: Let me read it.

715
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,233
Speaker 0: I'll point out there's a lot of.

716
00:49:41,554 --> 00:49:45,645
Speaker 0: for some reason all the slurs tend to lean toward homosexual jokes.

717
00:49:46,207 --> 00:49:46,367
Speaker 1: Yeah.

718
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:46,688
Speaker 1: Okay.

719
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:50,055
Speaker 1: So here go The the vandal.

720
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:54,050
Speaker 1: the person for spray paintings sees him and says hey what the fuck you looking at?

721
00:49:54,612 --> 00:50:02,204
Speaker 1: So the kids like oh shit, he says I said what the fuck you looking at asshole I don't know if it was the mask they gave over blah.

722
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:05,587
Speaker 1: He says three homos making a mess.

723
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:10,824
Speaker 1: The best part of the vandal is like what the fuck did you say?

724
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:11,607
Speaker 0: but the thing is.

725
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:12,330
Speaker 0: then he steps out.

726
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:16,273
Speaker 0: they see his words like this wetsuit and Their reactions.

727
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:17,316
Speaker 0: Ah, all right.

728
00:50:17,336 --> 00:50:17,758
Speaker 0: Screw this.

729
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:18,620
Speaker 0: This guy's just high.

730
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:21,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like screw this the guy's just high and then he attacks him.

731
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,785
Speaker 1: I'm not high just pissed off with guys like you making this place even more of a shithole.

732
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:27,050
Speaker 0: and that's a good line.

733
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:31,154
Speaker 0: That's the kind of line someone a Batman s character would use Someone's.

734
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:38,270
Speaker 1: he did some good training with the coming up with lines Apparently or it's just you know, good writing which I think is is in abundance in this guy.

735
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:42,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then he attacks the kids and they yeah, that's interesting.

736
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:44,071
Speaker 1: how you know The.

737
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:52,957
Speaker 1: these vandals are basically sort of you know, ignoring him like let this crazy guy go whatever, you know He's insulting us and we're sort of getting angry.

738
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,461
Speaker 1: But this guy's crazy.

739
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:57,930
Speaker 1: What the fuck dude, and then he actually attacks them.

740
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:02,190
Speaker 1: It's like you don't see even real superheroes with actual powers.

741
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,094
Speaker 1: You don't see them doing.

742
00:51:03,114 --> 00:51:06,870
Speaker 1: that fight goes like spider-man which if there was some vandals he just webbed them up.

743
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:07,701
Speaker 1: He wouldn't beat them up.

744
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,940
Speaker 0: That man would make them pee themselves Batman.

745
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just make them pee themselves and then the police would take them away.

746
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:17,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but after the element of surprise he pretty much gets beat.

747
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:21,063
Speaker 0: But then he fights back with a broken bottle and it gets serious.

748
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,910
Speaker 0: so the kids just stab him and run away.

749
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:28,126
Speaker 1: Yep, the vandal stabs him right in the lung right in the freaking lung.

750
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:29,350
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit.

751
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:29,932
Speaker 1: So he starts.

752
00:51:30,073 --> 00:51:30,916
Speaker 1: he's like, ah crap.

753
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,405
Speaker 1: So he starts stumbling away stumbling away.

754
00:51:33,445 --> 00:51:33,565
Speaker 0: Now.

755
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:37,076
Speaker 0: Here is the cherry on top Cherry on top of this comic.

756
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:37,538
Speaker 1: Okay.

757
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,950
Speaker 1: So first of all, this seems like such an obvious idea, right?

758
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:50,670
Speaker 1: Write a comic about someone trying to be a superhero in the real world and just play it straight and play it straight And then obviously the result they're gonna get stabbed or shot or something obviously, right?

759
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,496
Speaker 1: So that's exactly what happens.

760
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:52,858
Speaker 1: and you go.

761
00:51:52,898 --> 00:51:55,730
Speaker 1: Wow, that was such an obvious idea for his story.

762
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,241
Speaker 1: Why didn't anyone do this before?

763
00:51:57,301 --> 00:52:00,639
Speaker 1: I'm sure here it is I'm sure maybe but I've never read it before.

764
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:05,478
Speaker 1: and you see it right here on the page and you go Wow, that's pretty entertaining right there.

765
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,165
Speaker 1: I can't believe I've never read this before.

766
00:52:08,088 --> 00:52:13,209
Speaker 1: and then Well after he stabbed and he's stumbling away in a bloody stupor.

767
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:19,350
Speaker 0: His nose is also broken and he's bleeding from a lot of places and he's wearing spandex all over his body.

768
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:26,690
Speaker 1: then He stumbles into the street and gets smashed by a Benz going real fast.

769
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:31,769
Speaker 1: and then the Benz does a hit-and-run and he's left lying in the street.

770
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,157
Speaker 1: a Bloody broken stat.

771
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:34,839
Speaker 0: what's the line?

772
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:35,521
Speaker 0: What does he say?

773
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:36,926
Speaker 0: My dad's gonna kill.

774
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:37,728
Speaker 1: he doesn't say it.

775
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:38,290
Speaker 1: He thinks it.

776
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,556
Speaker 1: All he says is unt.

777
00:52:40,018 --> 00:52:42,590
Speaker 0: No, you got to read that whole line cuz that line is beautiful.

778
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:50,641
Speaker 1: What he's what he thinks in his mind while he's lying a bloody mess in the street is two broken legs My spine crushed and dressed like a fucking pervert.

779
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:52,529
Speaker 1: My dad was going to kill me.

780
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:57,261
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this might be good, I don't know.

781
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,024
Speaker 0: we'll get the trade.

782
00:52:58,084 --> 00:52:59,550
Speaker 0: we'll review it in more fullness.

783
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:05,829
Speaker 1: You can probably get it cheap and While we well if you go to the comic store, it's gonna be three dollars.

784
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,358
Speaker 0: Maybe we should have a contest to give this away.

785
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:10,506
Speaker 1: No, I guess if we get the trade.

786
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:11,650
Speaker 1: I don't need this issue, right?

787
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:19,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but yeah if you're the kind of person who reads Individual comic books look for kick - ass kick ass.

788
00:53:20,145 --> 00:53:28,350
Speaker 1: and if your comic book store doesn't have it Tell them to order it and then they will order it and then get it to you All right, and then they will know that it's good and then they will order more.

789
00:53:28,691 --> 00:53:31,124
Speaker 0: But I have something much more important that we got to deal with right now.
