1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,510
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 27th, 2013.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,914
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:14,536
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:15,639
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,681
Speaker 0: Tonight, on this episode of Geek Nights, we will be talking about a thing, and that thing is a comic.

6
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:20,865
Speaker 0: A comic about ponies.

7
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:23,575
Speaker 0: We're reviewing the My Little Pony comic.

8
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,722
Speaker 1: I should just edit this episode.

9
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:28,109
Speaker 0: Do you even know how?

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

11
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,561
Speaker 1: Just take the WAV file and chop out the WAV file.

12
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,444
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

13
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:34,066
Speaker 0: What?

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:35,310
Speaker 0: What?

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,173
Speaker 0: You got a problem?

16
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:40,206
Speaker 0: You're not happy with the way I'm running this operation?

17
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:42,995
Speaker 1: We've already discussed this a thousand times.

18
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:47,312
Speaker 0: We haven't done a... I think we might have done a thousand episodes by now.

19
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:47,834
Speaker 0: I can't tell.

20
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:50,425
Speaker 1: Many times it has been discussed.

21
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:57,918
Speaker 0: But now we are talking about the My Little Pony comic, and I've just come out to review it, actually talk about what's good and bad about it.

22
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:58,400
Speaker 0: Mostly good.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,665
Speaker 0: In fact, I like it a lot.

24
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:02,181
Speaker 0: I like it more than some episodes of season three, but we'll get to that.

25
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:06,815
Speaker 1: Any opening bits at all?

26
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:07,316
Speaker 0: I don't know.

27
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:08,761
Speaker 0: I got nothing really important going on.

28
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,267
Speaker 0: Some friends are coming back from out of town.

29
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:11,367
Speaker 0: Yeah.

30
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:13,793
Speaker 0: That's it.

31
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:15,056
Speaker 1: Alright.

32
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:17,422
Speaker 1: Let's just do the show.

33
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:18,908
Speaker 0: Quick show.

34
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,754
Speaker 1: Okay, so check this out.

35
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:21,336
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

36
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:27,343
Speaker 1: It's one of those things is not quite news, because it's not like a thing that happened now, but it's not really a thing of the day.

37
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:35,010
Speaker 1: It's sort of like, oh, there was an interesting editorial sort of research article on the Onion AV Club, right?

38
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:40,490
Speaker 1: And it talks about DuckTales invented a new animated wonderland that quickly disappeared.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,594
Speaker 1: And it talks...

40
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:45,050
Speaker 0: Is it just DuckTales or is it just that Disney Afternoon in general?

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,123
Speaker 1: He talks about the whole era really, but focusing on DuckTales.

42
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:51,115
Speaker 0: I consider that a golden age of animation.

43
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:54,067
Speaker 1: He explains it, you know, whoever wrote this article and might not even be a he.

44
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:54,770
Speaker 1: It's OK.

45
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,284
Speaker 1: Todd vendor where he wrote this article on February 11th.

46
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:59,548
Speaker 1: We published on February 11th.

47
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:15,693
Speaker 1: and he explains why there was this sudden surge in syndicated animation for after the after school programming block of incredible high quality beginning with gummy bears.

48
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:21,330
Speaker 1: And he talks about why it emerged, how good it was, and then why it disappeared.

49
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,877
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, yeah.

50
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,181
Speaker 0: So can you spoil for me?

51
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,485
Speaker 0: why did it disappear?

52
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:33,869
Speaker 0: Summarize the primary reason that the Disney Afternoon really, really missed DuckTales and Tailspin.

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,393
Speaker 1: The primary reason the Disney Afternoon disappeared was it coincided with an executive shakeup at Disney.

54
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:48,405
Speaker 1: And those new executives wanted to push things that were using the same properties as the movie, such as Aladdin after school cartoon and such.

55
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,193
Speaker 0: That cartoon was awful, by the way.

56
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:50,434
Speaker 1: Right.

57
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,157
Speaker 1: And that's it.

58
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:51,479
Speaker 1: Right.

59
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,804
Speaker 0: So how come?

60
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:53,888
Speaker 0: Well, no, not how come?

61
00:02:53,928 --> 00:03:03,129
Speaker 0: we know why, because even in the non animation world, if you back up into the meta, you know, Scott, because while you don't care about these things, you listen to people bitch about it all the time.

62
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:11,125
Speaker 0: There is a show that nerds like and it's on like sci fi or Fox and the nerds like super into it and it's super popular and maybe it's even doing really well.

63
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:15,484
Speaker 0: And then suddenly it's canceled for no reason, even though it was actually profitable.

64
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:30,777
Speaker 0: And usually that's because there's an executive shakeup and the new executives, more importantly than maybe anything else, usually want the stuff the old executives championed to fail so they can then point out how they're better.

65
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,824
Speaker 0: Some fashion like that.

66
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:38,390
Speaker 1: There's a long and whatever those guys were doing, they, you know, they fucked up even if they weren't fucking up.

67
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,574
Speaker 1: And right, basically because think about when executives change, why do executives change?

68
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:43,875
Speaker 1: It's not.

69
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,864
Speaker 1: don't think about what the executives are thinking, right?

70
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,276
Speaker 1: Think about why did the executives just change?

71
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:58,881
Speaker 1: It's because the board voted out the old guy and in with the new guy, if the board voted out the old guy name with the new guy, there's two reasons why a bunch of executives board is expecting to see something new.

72
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:12,943
Speaker 1: And if the board right sees things get worse or not change or they see that the things the old executives did were working better than things new executives did, that means the board voted wrong.

73
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:14,026
Speaker 1: You can't have that.

74
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:14,467
Speaker 0: Sure.

75
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,999
Speaker 0: The guy from the old guys is bad and fails.

76
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:23,158
Speaker 1: And then you got to make sure the new thing is also bad and fails because that's just how it goes.

77
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:23,399
Speaker 1: Yeah.

78
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,314
Speaker 1: But you know, appears to be an improvement or at least is different.

79
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:30,070
Speaker 1: Otherwise, what are the executives vote a new guy in for to do the same thing?

80
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:36,433
Speaker 0: There are other reasons why executives change like that, especially when a guy retired.

81
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:46,028
Speaker 0: I mean, I could cause it, but usually it's because if it isn't the board doing it, it's because a bunch of executives were either jumping ship to start their own thing or to go somewhere else.

82
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,614
Speaker 1: That's the sort of same as retiring.

83
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:52,314
Speaker 0: I would not say it's the same because here's the time the board voted.

84
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,981
Speaker 0: It's a big difference in the corporate world.

85
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:59,177
Speaker 0: If a guy or a group of people retire, it's because they were old.

86
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:00,822
Speaker 0: or they're done or they're something.

87
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:12,286
Speaker 0: If they all moved somewhere else or start their own thing, you've got a team that knows your business that is now directly competing with you and left because of some fuck up or some disagreement they had with you.

88
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:16,420
Speaker 0: So that's when a bunch of your executives leave and aren't retiring.

89
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,688
Speaker 0: That is a huge problem for you.

90
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:24,125
Speaker 1: Most of the problem of too many chiefs, not enough Indians has been around for centuries.

91
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,411
Speaker 1: So I don't think it's going to be solved anytime soon.

92
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:30,221
Speaker 0: It's not just good.

93
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,889
Speaker 0: There's more chiefs that tell that chief to stop chiefing.

94
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:41,135
Speaker 0: How many bronies are sitting here like clenching their fists in impotent anger like Lauren Faust.

95
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:45,286
Speaker 1: If you're a listener of Geek Nights, this article is guaranteed to be of interest to you.

96
00:05:45,306 --> 00:06:04,817
Speaker 0: We should start a White House petition to get President Barack Obama to issue an executive order demanding that tailspin and be produced and returned on taxpayer dollars to broadcast television.

97
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:11,677
Speaker 1: The government is perfectly legally able to put out bids for a contract to produce a television show.

98
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:15,690
Speaker 0: There might be legal challenges about the public sector competing in private, whatever.

99
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,375
Speaker 0: But I digress.

100
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,093
Speaker 0: I don't think we get the 100,000 signatures we need or will we if we did.

101
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:25,500
Speaker 0: I'd love to see the response anyway.

102
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,854
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I've actually been watching a bunch of anime lately.

103
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,308
Speaker 1: I've been watching a bunch of anime, but it's only one anime.

104
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,940
Speaker 1: It begins with the word ghost and ends with the word shell.

105
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,325
Speaker 0: Doesn't it end with the word gig?

106
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:39,809
Speaker 1: No.

107
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:41,474
Speaker 0: What do you watch?

108
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:41,735
Speaker 0: What?

109
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,199
Speaker 0: Get sack first gig, right?

110
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,906
Speaker 1: I watched the movie.

111
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:45,689
Speaker 0: Which one?

112
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,532
Speaker 0: The first movie, right?

113
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:46,853
Speaker 0: Right.

114
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,139
Speaker 0: Did you watch Innocence again?

115
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,721
Speaker 1: I will.

116
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:50,469
Speaker 0: When was the last time you saw Innocence?

117
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,795
Speaker 1: I only saw it once in the theater.

118
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:52,438
Speaker 0: Okay.

119
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,261
Speaker 0: I will say this.

120
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:54,445
Speaker 0: I watched Innocence again.

121
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:55,569
Speaker 1: It's fucked the fuck up.

122
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,178
Speaker 0: Not that long ago, but a while ago.

123
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:06,186
Speaker 0: And all I remember from Innocence that matters is that, holy shit, do I like watching Batou and Togusa talk about stuff?

124
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:06,969
Speaker 1: That's all it is.

125
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,375
Speaker 1: It's 99% of the movie.

126
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:19,288
Speaker 0: I would watch a show that was just Batou and Togusa and occasionally Aramaki just quoting old Japanese and Greek scholars at each other for like four hours an episode.

127
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:19,890
Speaker 1: That's all it is.

128
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:20,954
Speaker 0: I dig that stuff.

129
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:26,320
Speaker 0: But yeah, you're watching this because of Google glass, because of a rise, all these things together.

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,644
Speaker 1: Why are you watching it again?

131
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:30,112
Speaker 1: Net runner, net runner, cyberpunk season.

132
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,340
Speaker 0: It is cyberpunk season.

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,146
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm not watching get sack first gig again, again, is that I recently watched it again, again, again.

134
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:49,222
Speaker 0: And when it comes to anime for a long time, every time I look at the list of new shows, all I think is, are any of these shows better than ghost in the shell standalone complex second gig?

135
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,854
Speaker 0: Cause that was the last anime I watched that I was super excited about.

136
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,845
Speaker 0: What Monica I watched after that.

137
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:58,496
Speaker 1: So you didn't think Monica was exciting till after you saw it.

138
00:07:58,517 --> 00:07:59,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,396
Speaker 0: But at the same time I watch episode ones and I read, you know, reviews.

140
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:09,998
Speaker 0: If they're out there and people I care about, about these new shows, no one's really talking about them.

141
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:13,895
Speaker 0: But Monica, after four episodes, people were flipping out on the internet.

142
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:15,120
Speaker 0: So I knew there was something going on.

143
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:15,643
Speaker 1: I got new.

144
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:19,765
Speaker 1: Let's change the, you know, usually the philosophy is, Hey, I'm only going to live to be whatever years old.

145
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:23,303
Speaker 1: I can't possibly read, watch, listen to everything that we've ever created, right?

146
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:23,967
Speaker 1: It's not going to happen.

147
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:25,899
Speaker 1: So I got to filter out and only get the best ofs.

148
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,060
Speaker 1: Right.

149
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,513
Speaker 1: And hopefully I can get to most of the best ofs before I die.

150
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,159
Speaker 1: You know, that are accessible to me.

151
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,621
Speaker 1: Yup.

152
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:32,785
Speaker 1: I got new philosophy.

153
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:37,183
Speaker 1: I've already seen all the best ones, especially in the anime department.

154
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,816
Speaker 1: Let's just fucking watch those fuckers over and over again.

155
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,202
Speaker 1: Cause nothing new is going to be any good.

156
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:44,095
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is an old man, you're young punk kids.

157
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:44,938
Speaker 1: Shit sucks.

158
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,746
Speaker 1: I'm going to keep watching my old man shit over and over.

159
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:57,872
Speaker 0: We did do a show a long time ago on the rewatch because it seems like anime is a thing in particular, that specific fandom where fans will perennially, and I know all of you out there listening have done this, but like, you know what?

160
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,822
Speaker 0: I haven't seen X show in a few years.

161
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:02,110
Speaker 0: I think it's time to watch it again.

162
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:07,513
Speaker 0: Well, look at how many people think that for like Seinfeld, like, man, I should watch season four of Seinfeld again.

163
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:08,498
Speaker 1: Well, we're right.

164
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:10,686
Speaker 1: You know, the rewatching Utena here, right?

165
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,913
Speaker 1: Is like, it's like a new show basically.

166
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:19,675
Speaker 0: I watched it more recently again than you and I've seen Utena through five times.

167
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,240
Speaker 1: I think I haven't seen it since college.

168
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,032
Speaker 0: So this will be the sixth time through my like 1.5 time scene.

169
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,453
Speaker 1: Yeah.

170
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:32,008
Speaker 0: But the problem is, and I always go back to my go-to example is Kaze no Yojimbo.

171
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,404
Speaker 0: Cause I was watching that on Netflix DVDs when I commute Metro North.

172
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:46,717
Speaker 0: And in fact, I was watching it on a portable, dedicated DVD playing device, not a laptop because that device had way more battery than my laptop.

173
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,087
Speaker 1: I watched like a handful of episodes of that and then stopped.

174
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:49,408
Speaker 1: Yeah.

175
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:59,932
Speaker 0: So I was watching, it was pretty good, but then an episode ended and I was sitting there and I was like, eh, I guess I should watch the next one to, you know, so I can finish the show and send the DVD bag.

176
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:06,034
Speaker 0: And then I got home and I was dicking around and I just kind of randomly watched one episode of cowboy bebop and 126 episodes.

177
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

178
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,008
Speaker 0: And then I was like, you know what?

179
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:11,494
Speaker 0: Fuck how they know Yojimbo.

180
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:14,884
Speaker 0: I'm done watching B minus anime.

181
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,056
Speaker 0: I'll watch B anime because a B anime is better than most stuff.

182
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:22,617
Speaker 0: But anyway, I've been watching a bunch of anime lately and space brothers is super good and super fun.

183
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:24,083
Speaker 0: And I recommend you watch it.

184
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,447
Speaker 0: It'll make you really excited about space.

185
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:36,581
Speaker 0: But the thing I'm watching good yet, but it's given me a lot of feels I haven't had from an anime I've watched in a long time.

186
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,734
Speaker 0: It's Shin Sekayori or from the new world.

187
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:41,416
Speaker 0: Okay.

188
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:44,489
Speaker 0: No one's really been talking about it, but here's the basic deal.

189
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:44,931
Speaker 0: Watch this.

190
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:47,606
Speaker 1: People are going to come out in the form and be like, everyone's been talking about the show.

191
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,150
Speaker 0: Where are you been?

192
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, I poked around now.

193
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:50,523
Speaker 0: Many people are talking about it.

194
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:59,274
Speaker 0: So it's set up in sort of a nearing future, like around this time, some, or maybe the Madoka time, you know, like that, that level of near future.

195
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:10,717
Speaker 0: And suddenly one day, a whole bunch of people like individual people, like in one city, like maybe 20 to 30 people just suddenly get Akira style psychic powers and start accidentally killing everyone around them.

196
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:11,420
Speaker 1: Okay.

197
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:13,688
Speaker 0: And then it just, it shows you that.

198
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:14,672
Speaker 0: And it's just a bloodbath.

199
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,741
Speaker 0: It just like thing doesn't work out so well.

200
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:17,945
Speaker 0: It's not to look at so good.

201
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,052
Speaker 0: And then suddenly just stops.

202
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:31,606
Speaker 0: And then the show starts and the show looks like it's set in ancient Japan, but really it's the far future, like four to 800 years after that day.

203
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:39,049
Speaker 0: And it's basically a post-apocalyptic show, but it's post-apocalyptic as in a psychic apocalypse ruined the world.

204
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:48,881
Speaker 0: Society in Japan rebuilt based on weird old Japanese legends and myths and sort of the Shinto rituals and things to avoid another psychic apocalypse.

205
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,666
Speaker 0: Yes, but all based around the psychic stuff.

206
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:51,929
Speaker 0: It's creepy.

207
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,754
Speaker 0: It's weird.

208
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,900
Speaker 0: It's atmospheric.

209
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:01,141
Speaker 0: Uh, if I had to say shows that reminds me of, I'm going to have to say a lot of really different shows.

210
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:09,724
Speaker 0: It reminds me of Bocorano in that it's got a bunch of kids surrounded by tragedy and high production values and good music.

211
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:24,616
Speaker 0: It's, it reminds me of Mushishi because the psychic stuff and the world around these kids has that sort of mythical self consistency and just the, the stories and the monsters and the things in the outside really just feel like Mushishi.

212
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,505
Speaker 0: If all the Mushi were actually really just assholes.

213
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,250
Speaker 1: A lot of them are.

214
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:34,127
Speaker 0: It reminds me of number six, which is the show of Scott and I are watching with Emily.

215
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:39,693
Speaker 0: That was all about a sort of like there's domes in the future with society living inside of those like 20 shows like that.

216
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:39,995
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:56,037
Speaker 0: That show started out a lot like this where there's also, you know, precursor technology, the inside outside, like ergo proxy had, but that show got stupid, way stupid, not worth watching stupid.

218
00:12:56,718 --> 00:13:14,771
Speaker 0: So this show reminds me of all of those shows and so far I really like it because it's given me a vibe that I haven't gotten from many shows ever, let alone recently, the vibe of, I want to me rim watching the show, figure out what the fuck is going on.

219
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 0: Shows that have given me that included Escaflowne, Utena.

220
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,652
Speaker 1: Every good show has a terrible secret of space.

221
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:27,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, cowboy bebop had the, the terrible secret of space is not the one you care about secret.

222
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,519
Speaker 1: Still had a terrible secret of space.

223
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:30,846
Speaker 0: It wasn't a terrible secret of space.

224
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,274
Speaker 0: It was terrible secret of a few people.

225
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,263
Speaker 1: You know, it sure has a terrible secret to space.

226
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:37,692
Speaker 0: I was going to make a joke and say space brothers, the end.

227
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:51,970
Speaker 0: So I'm feeling the show and I just want to point out that I was, it's directed by the kind of person that tends to make the kind of show that I end up really liking.

228
00:13:53,053 --> 00:14:02,640
Speaker 0: Masashi Ishiyama is one of those guys who was a key animator and animation director for a huge list of just shows all over the place.

229
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:09,464
Speaker 0: And those are the kinds of people who in my experience tended to make the shows that I actually like.

230
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:14,006
Speaker 0: And I point out, he also did the character design and the animation direction for welcome to the space show.

231
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:18,362
Speaker 0: And it kind of shows when you watch this, especially when you meet the library.

232
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,489
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's a geek bite.

233
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,361
Speaker 0: If you're looking for an anime to watch, this is the best one.

234
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:28,134
Speaker 0: that isn't space brothers that I've seen from recent seasons of anime.

235
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,526
Speaker 1: Don't you have an actual news in addition to your geek?

236
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,289
Speaker 0: This is my geek bite.

237
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,735
Speaker 1: I thought you had a news as well.

238
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,143
Speaker 0: Oh, we could talk about Otakon.

239
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:36,724
Speaker 1: Yeah.

240
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:42,479
Speaker 0: So, uh, I saw a tweet a few days ago, however long ago it was.

241
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:47,617
Speaker 0: The tweet was basically they announced Otakon Vegas and I thought that was a joke.

242
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,604
Speaker 1: I didn't know if it was a joke or real.

243
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,186
Speaker 1: I was 50/50.

244
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,932
Speaker 1: I had to investigate to figure it out.

245
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:53,699
Speaker 1: So it's real.

246
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,922
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is real.

247
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,888
Speaker 0: Not really sure what to say about that.

248
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,595
Speaker 0: Uh, I wish them well.

249
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,283
Speaker 0: I do think that I think it's a mistake.

250
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:05,436
Speaker 1: Las Vegas does have a gigantic convention center where CES is.

251
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:11,620
Speaker 1: And I do think that Vegas was the one place that was desperately lacking a geek convention that could support one.

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,137
Speaker 0: But I don't know if Vegas is the right place for an anime convention, right?

253
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:21,170
Speaker 1: Because the other things in Vegas, you don't necessarily want mixing with geeks, right?

254
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:31,919
Speaker 1: When those geeks walk out of a casino full of tourists and casino dwellers, uh, and it's not going to necessarily mix.

255
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:33,869
Speaker 0: So, uh, I don't think that's the problem.

256
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:38,794
Speaker 1: It's not like when you go out in the street and people are friendly and like, Hey, why is everyone wearing costumes?

257
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,175
Speaker 1: Right?

258
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,063
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of drunken gambling.

259
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,913
Speaker 0: You know, I don't actually think that's the problem at all.

260
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,841
Speaker 1: I have much one of the problems.

261
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,206
Speaker 1: I don't even wish there are many.

262
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:58,939
Speaker 0: No, I don't even register that as a problem because I I'm just going to keep saying that word for almost every place in America.

263
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,965
Speaker 0: You can have a convention Baltimore.

264
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:01,346
Speaker 0: It's a.

265
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,295
Speaker 1: You just don't leave that tiny area.

266
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:13,912
Speaker 0: There's either the Heinz that's too small and has problems with the mall next to it getting mad about stuff or the BCEC, which is a spaceship all by itself in the middle of nowhere.

267
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,362
Speaker 0: that, that, that, that problem exists everywhere.

268
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,331
Speaker 0: No, my problems, not problems.

269
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:29,879
Speaker 0: My concerns are more along the lines of Otacon seems to try to actually continue to be an anime convention focused on anime.

270
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,102
Speaker 0: Yes, it is true.

271
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:32,847
Speaker 0: They have East Asian stuff.

272
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:39,568
Speaker 0: that's in their charter, but most of its anime, the vast majority of it is East Asian stuff.

273
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:55,822
Speaker 0: And the stuff they have that is not directly in that sort of, uh, wheelhouse is such a small percentage of the total content that they can get away with, uh, not messing up their five Oh one C three, which if you run conventions, you probably know exactly what that means.

274
00:16:56,886 --> 00:17:06,114
Speaker 0: But my problem is that there aren't that many conventions that can do anime, anime like that and grow large and continue to draw people?

275
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:14,722
Speaker 0: because other than anime, Boston, Otacon, and maybe five or six others, most other quote, anime, convenient cons have a ton of non anime content.

276
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:18,153
Speaker 0: because that's what most people are at most conventions for.

277
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:22,929
Speaker 0: So if they're charters the same, are they going to make a new convention in Vegas?

278
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:29,957
Speaker 0: The only reason to put it in Vegas really is if you think it will get big enough to use the big convention centers there.

279
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:32,969
Speaker 1: Oh, you think that that's a good question, right?

280
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,360
Speaker 1: Because the Otacon brand is mostly strong.

281
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,049
Speaker 1: It doesn't, it's not really a national brand.

282
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,617
Speaker 1: It's mostly a Northeast brand.

283
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:38,838
Speaker 1: Dude.

284
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,629
Speaker 0: I know Baltimore who are anime fans who had never heard of it.

285
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:43,251
Speaker 1: Exactly.

286
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,053
Speaker 1: Who has heard of it?

287
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:49,935
Speaker 1: And is it going to be mostly people flying from here to Vegas to go?

288
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:52,526
Speaker 0: You know, they've said they want to keep it small to start.

289
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,580
Speaker 0: In fact, they want to make a smaller and more intimate setting.

290
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,867
Speaker 1: But then what if it gets too big?

291
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,840
Speaker 1: and if it's small, what's the point of being in Vegas?

292
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,841
Speaker 0: Exactly.

293
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:00,704
Speaker 0: That's why I'm curious.

294
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:12,167
Speaker 0: What, what, what was the course of events internal to the Otacon staff that led to someone saying, let's have a new satellite convention branded Otacon and run it in Vegas.

295
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,816
Speaker 1: Really want to go to Vegas or thinking long-term, right?

296
00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:18,306
Speaker 1: It can grow and you could, someone could actually make use of that.

297
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:23,820
Speaker 0: Otacon uses the BCC in Baltimore to capacity.

298
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,395
Speaker 1: They grew into it so that they think they can repeat the winning formula.

299
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:30,065
Speaker 0: I don't know if a purely anime con could though.

300
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:35,884
Speaker 0: Otacon is big partly because of momentum and because of history and because of guests, big guests.

301
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:53,092
Speaker 0: And I have logistical concerns too, partly because I know Otacon staff culture and I don't foresee them paying to fly a large number of their seasoned staff out there to organize this small.

302
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,001
Speaker 1: They won't need that many and they could use the con money.

303
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,756
Speaker 0: Well, see saying you don't need that many is a recipe for disaster.

304
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:00,342
Speaker 1: You need less than Otacon needs.

305
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:05,159
Speaker 0: But you need to send like your core staff to manage the thing, to do it the same way.

306
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,404
Speaker 0: you run it in the other coast.

307
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:08,230
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

308
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,294
Speaker 0: We'll see how this whole thing goes.

309
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:11,482
Speaker 0: Now this is purely speculative.

310
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:17,724
Speaker 0: If I had to guess as to why Otacon is doing this and I do not have access to the staff forum anymore.

311
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,154
Speaker 0: This is based on no inside information I have whatsoever.

312
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:24,067
Speaker 0: I'm literally guessing a hundred percent speculation.

313
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,553
Speaker 0: They are a 501c3.

314
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,718
Speaker 0: They have a chart or most cons.

315
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,680
Speaker 0: Ah, yes.

316
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:36,099
Speaker 0: Now I'm of the opinion that it is in the modern era, a mistake to be a nonprofit.

317
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,626
Speaker 0: You're better off being a for profit cause.

318
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,214
Speaker 0: then you can do whatever the fuck you want.

319
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:47,912
Speaker 0: Even if you end up effectively being a nonprofit, but that, you know, Connecticut impacts all the other cons that were involved with for the most part are for profit.

320
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,319
Speaker 0: At least we're involved on the staff level.

321
00:19:50,041 --> 00:20:03,580
Speaker 0: So, uh, because they're a 501c3 and they have a charter, uh, 501c3s can get in trouble if they make too much money and don't reinvest it specifically into furthering their charter.

322
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,347
Speaker 1: You think Otacon made too much money?

323
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,613
Speaker 0: In the long run?

324
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,899
Speaker 1: Pretty sure they spend all their money.

325
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,301
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

326
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:19,557
Speaker 0: But it is possible that they, their, their bank account, they're sort of like fund of emergency money and profits over time, especially in light of my guests.

327
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:23,115
Speaker 0: that over time there'll be fewer Japanese guests just because there's less demand for them.

328
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:23,859
Speaker 0: and you know, stuff like that.

329
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,880
Speaker 0: And I know they do really well to get Japanese guests better than most cons.

330
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:35,122
Speaker 0: I would not be surprised if they were, uh, advised to start another event somewhere and funnel some money into it.

331
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:45,384
Speaker 0: And I would not be surprised if independent of that, some people were wined and it was suggested that Vegas would be a great place for it and they might not have thought it all the way through.

332
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:50,749
Speaker 1: There's plenty of other ways you can dump a whole bunch of money into the mission of Otacon besides a con in Vegas.

333
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,111
Speaker 0: I know.

334
00:20:51,251 --> 00:21:02,331
Speaker 0: I'm just, this is me literally just speculating based on nothing and based on the 501c3 discussions I have had internal to other conventions in the past that have led to similar decisions.

335
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:03,094
Speaker 1: Okay.

336
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,800
Speaker 1: So some crazy random guessing.

337
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:06,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is crazy.

338
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,960
Speaker 0: I was very open about this being crazy random guessing.

339
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,842
Speaker 0: All right.

340
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:14,625
Speaker 0: But, uh, what's interesting is they're having it at the planet Hollywood resort and they're making it fan.

341
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,138
Speaker 1: I thought that doesn't exist anymore.

342
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:18,666
Speaker 1: I thought the planet Hollywood went bankrupt.

343
00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:20,959
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know where you get that information from.

344
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,444
Speaker 1: I'm going to look it up.

345
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,595
Speaker 0: I've never heard that in my life.

346
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:34,551
Speaker 0: In fact, they have announced specifically Otacon Vegas will be held at the planet Hollywood resort and casino in Las Vegas.

347
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,155
Speaker 0: So you're probably wrong.

348
00:21:36,235 --> 00:21:37,880
Speaker 1: The company has gone bankrupt twice.

349
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,418
Speaker 1: Nearly a hundred stores have closed worldwide leaving about nine open.

350
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:43,300
Speaker 1: Ah, really?

351
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,646
Speaker 1: So one of the nine, one of the nine is that one.

352
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:55,081
Speaker 0: Anyway, things of the day they got for me.

353
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,945
Speaker 1: Uh, it's not for you.

354
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:04,688
Speaker 1: Uh, so yesterday I saw something that was the greatest something I have seen in a long time.

355
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,500
Speaker 1: It was something on the internet that actually provided lols.

356
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,992
Speaker 1: Something as good as Lord of the rings on the go.

357
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,380
Speaker 1: Something of that level of goodness.

358
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,008
Speaker 1: And what this thing is, it was a threat on board game geek.

359
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,720
Speaker 1: board game boxes with googly eyes.

360
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,423
Speaker 1: This is a pretty good, I really want to know like the biology of neuroscience of why googly eyes are so funny.

361
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:30,467
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty simple.

362
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:33,942
Speaker 0: Googly eyes may take anything and make it less threatening.

363
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:36,250
Speaker 1: Why does it make it funny?

364
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,027
Speaker 0: Because if it's less threatening, you're looking at some crazy ogre.

365
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,071
Speaker 0: That might be threatening.

366
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:44,780
Speaker 0: Suddenly you make it less threatening with googly eyes.

367
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,602
Speaker 1: Why is that funny?

368
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:52,680
Speaker 0: Because of the juxtaposition between something that should be dangerous.

369
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:55,609
Speaker 0: Now suddenly being made non-dangerous.

370
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,897
Speaker 1: Not everything on these boxes is dangerous.

371
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:00,407
Speaker 0: Are almost every one of those things is dangerous.

372
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:03,721
Speaker 1: Anyway, so board game boxes with googly eyes put on them.

373
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:04,745
Speaker 1: This is amazing.

374
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:13,737
Speaker 1: Even if you don't know the board game boxes, it's still hilarious, especially connect four, which you do know, uh, dude is the best one.

375
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,964
Speaker 1: Everyone thinks the same thing when they see that one.

376
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:16,807
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

377
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:19,055
Speaker 1: You got to check this out.

378
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:23,933
Speaker 1: And I suggest maybe checking it out while you're on your iPhone in the bathroom.

379
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:26,703
Speaker 1: So that way, if you pee from funniness, you'll be safe.

380
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:28,548
Speaker 0: There's one in particular.

381
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,591
Speaker 0: You'll know it when you see it.

382
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:36,015
Speaker 0: We did some very intense focus testing, uh, last night during our burning wheel game.

383
00:23:36,035 --> 00:23:38,062
Speaker 0: And we discovered that that is in fact the best one.

384
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:39,346
Speaker 1: The one I just mentioned.

385
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:40,108
Speaker 0: Yes.

386
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:43,879
Speaker 0: So I got a pretty cool thing.

387
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,933
Speaker 0: This was, I'm using tumblr more and more and a friend of ours, uh, reblogged this.

388
00:23:48,876 --> 00:24:01,260
Speaker 0: So this is a bunch of in the little golden book style, almost of Avengers characters as sailor moon characters that are surprisingly faithful to the ideas of both of them simultaneously.

389
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,633
Speaker 0: And the art is just ridiculously good.

390
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:07,204
Speaker 0: If you're a fan of either one of those things, you should look at this art.

391
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,335
Speaker 0: I would watch a show.

392
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:16,732
Speaker 0: In fact, I would pay a lot of money to see a show that was animated that looked even close to this sailors assemble.

393
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:21,992
Speaker 0: I don't even like this dude and whatever it is they're going to do.

394
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:24,063
Speaker 1: I think the new powerpuff girls is going to look kind of like that.

395
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:28,681
Speaker 0: I know I'm kind of excited about it, but I just wanted to bring back.

396
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:36,515
Speaker 0: You mean Accio bonus points.

397
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:41,105
Speaker 0: If you look at this and you recognize the sailor starlights and know why that's hilarious.

398
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,068
Speaker 0: Okay.

399
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:44,818
Speaker 0: You got a meta in the meta moment.

400
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,041
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Metamoments.

401
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:53,942
Speaker 1: Metamoment number one, the book club selection is the player of games by Ian M. Banks.

402
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:57,713
Speaker 1: It is the most geek nights book a book can be.

403
00:24:58,074 --> 00:24:59,860
Speaker 1: That is why it is now in the book club.

404
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,763
Speaker 1: You should read it.

405
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:02,792
Speaker 1: If you listen to this podcast, end of story.

406
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:09,390
Speaker 1: Also in the metamoment, the next convention on the calendar is penny arcade expo EAST 2013.

407
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,523
Speaker 1: We are presenting mastering game mechanics.

408
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:17,733
Speaker 0: We are presenting Bob practical game theory.

409
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:20,883
Speaker 0: We may be presenting third unannounced events.

410
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:22,348
Speaker 1: Come to that.

411
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:27,951
Speaker 1: Uh, actually if you don't already have tickets and things, you're in big trouble because you're not going to be able to come to that.

412
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:28,454
Speaker 0: But yup.

413
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:32,011
Speaker 0: And if you want to see our events, uh, it's in a smaller room than usual.

414
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,682
Speaker 0: I can't guarantee we'll video them because there's no stage.

415
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:37,972
Speaker 0: So get there early or you may not ever see them.

416
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:39,979
Speaker 0: We may not ever run them again.

417
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,123
Speaker 1: Other metamoments.

418
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:45,020
Speaker 1: We have this email newsletter that's actually been doing pretty well for a while now.

419
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:51,660
Speaker 1: Uh, but apparently some people had Gmail automatically spam it or, uh, a market is spam.

420
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,405
Speaker 1: I sent one out today.

421
00:25:53,425 --> 00:26:00,987
Speaker 1: So check if you are subscribed, check your spam folder and see the newsletters in there and market is not spam.

422
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:05,800
Speaker 1: Um, anything else we got going on at all?

423
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,161
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

424
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:08,145
Speaker 1: There is grand prize.

425
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,789
Speaker 0: Scott's baby.

426
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:24,628
Speaker 1: If you want to see if your gaming skills are greater than or less than other listeners of this show, you need to enter into the gaming FRC first annual girl pre 2013.

427
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,136
Speaker 0: However this goes, it is a hundred percent Scott.

428
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:29,525
Speaker 0: I got nothing to do with it other than I am competing.

429
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,871
Speaker 1: It's going to be very smooth.

430
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:31,313
Speaker 1: I don't know.

431
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:33,824
Speaker 1: See why you seem to be skeptical of skeptical.

432
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:34,887
Speaker 0: I was just stating a fact.

433
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:36,112
Speaker 1: I'm totally down with it.

434
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:40,106
Speaker 1: Anyway, you have until, uh, tomorrow to register straight.

435
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:46,532
Speaker 1: I thought about like letting people register late and then you could just enter in late and score zeros for the rounds you missed.

436
00:26:46,993 --> 00:26:53,520
Speaker 1: Uh, I might allow that still, but really if you want to have a chance of winning, you have to register and play right away.

437
00:26:54,222 --> 00:27:01,813
Speaker 1: Uh, you have to join the forum and then you have to, um, you know, just posting that thread that you want to join and your forum name will be your name on the Google doc.

438
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:08,907
Speaker 1: Uh, a lot of people are trying to join the forum lately and some people there's a, when you sign up to join the forum, you put in the reason for joining.

439
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:09,389
Speaker 1: Yeah.

440
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,312
Speaker 0: If you write something that looks like something a spam bot would write, I'm going to decline you.

441
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:17,652
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I declined someone who in retrospect might've been a human, but I really couldn't.

442
00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,668
Speaker 1: There are some people who've been writing things that are sort of borderline like.

443
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:33,260
Speaker 1: one person wrote like, I think like packs question and they wrote packs with not all capitals and that it was just two words and it's like, okay, that could be a person with a question about packs, but they didn't put packs in all capitals.

444
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,376
Speaker 0: One guy was just, it was just video games, all one word, no punctuation.

445
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,299
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,275
Speaker 1: It's like, you got to write, if you want me to accept you, spam is a bigger problem.

447
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:44,676
Speaker 1: Lately.

448
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:48,189
Speaker 1: One person even snuck through with their promotional shilling of something.

449
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,664
Speaker 1: You need to write a full sentence with correct grammar.

450
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:56,438
Speaker 0: Maybe you should update the prompting on that, uh, that page.

451
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,008
Speaker 1: I don't know how to, I got to figure that out.

452
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:01,688
Speaker 0: Cause you should say something like, you know, write something and give them a prompt.

453
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:05,609
Speaker 0: Uh, I know some other vanilla forums do that where they'll say it won't just be, you know, prove to me you're human.

454
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:13,623
Speaker 0: It's like, prove to me you're human and mentioned something about X or prove that you're human with a complete fully formed grammatically correct sentence.

455
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:14,104
Speaker 1: Yep.

456
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:16,773
Speaker 1: Anyway, where they subject predicate, et cetera.

457
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:17,214
Speaker 1: Yeah.

458
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:27,170
Speaker 1: But no, if you, if you cannot differentiate yourself, if you got, if you got a, you know, a denied email, maybe then you should try again and write something proper.

459
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,269
Speaker 0: For example, write something along the lines of, yeah, I listened to the show and now I know why you rejected me.

460
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,912
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

461
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:38,170
Speaker 1: Or I have been a listener of this show for X period of time.

462
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,661
Speaker 1: And now I would like to join the forum, not packs info.

463
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:50,059
Speaker 1: Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton, bagger, bagger, bagger, Michael Jordan, air Jordan, New York.

464
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:56,600
Speaker 0: Lately, I've been getting one that looks like it's the terms of service for another website.

465
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:58,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

466
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:02,761
Speaker 0: Anyway, talking about ponies, I haven't talked about ponies on the show for a while.

467
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,017
Speaker 1: You're looking for any excuse to bring ponies back in the evening.

468
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:09,195
Speaker 0: Actually, no, I just, there was, there hasn't been any other comic or media.

469
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,300
Speaker 0: We haven't already reviewed that.

470
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,147
Speaker 0: both of us are consuming at the same time.

471
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,111
Speaker 1: That's true.

472
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:16,265
Speaker 0: So we're big fans of my little pony friendship of magic.

473
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:20,466
Speaker 0: In fact, we have a sister show we launched a while ago called Radio Free Equestria.

474
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:21,973
Speaker 0: that might get some updates soon.

475
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:29,037
Speaker 0: We just haven't had time to kind of finish that show out for the season, but a good old Katie cook did a comic.

476
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:34,520
Speaker 1: Katie cook is someone that I've known about for a very long time because her art skills were amazing and always improving.

477
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:37,395
Speaker 1: Even when I first found out about her art skills are amazing.

478
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 1: They've only gotten better.

479
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:43,956
Speaker 1: And she does things such as the online web comic Gronk, which is hilarious.

480
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,930
Speaker 1: She also did, done a lot of these sketch cards.

481
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:50,006
Speaker 1: So for example, what the sketch cards are, she did this for a long time.

482
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:51,172
Speaker 1: I don't know if she's done it recently.

483
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:57,336
Speaker 1: It's let's say, for example, you went and bought, you know, collectible cards that don't play a game.

484
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:58,721
Speaker 1: I know those still exist, right?

485
00:29:58,761 --> 00:29:59,183
Speaker 1: Amazing.

486
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:05,607
Speaker 1: For something like Indiana Jones, like when that non-existent movie came out, they had collectible cards you could just buy.

487
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:15,365
Speaker 1: And if you bought those cards at a comic book store, which comes in a direct market box, as opposed to the kind of box that would, they would send target, which is a different box.

488
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:21,587
Speaker 1: There was a chance that in that box somewhere in one of those packs would be a card.

489
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:24,860
Speaker 1: that was a sketch card, which is basically they sent her a blank card.

490
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,216
Speaker 1: She actually drew on it and then they actually inserted it into there somewhere.

491
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:31,103
Speaker 1: So she used to do a lot of those.

492
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,492
Speaker 1: Uh, her web comic is awesome.

493
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:38,671
Speaker 1: At conventions, she does the thing where you give her five bucks and she paints a little tiny thing on a card.

494
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,441
Speaker 1: I got rim before she even did the pony comic.

495
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,606
Speaker 1: I got rim and narwhal.

496
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,493
Speaker 0: It is a pretty great narwhal.

497
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:50,089
Speaker 1: I got Emily bunny and I got me a rainbow dash before she did a pony comic.

498
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:58,170
Speaker 1: Uh, but now of course that person ended up writing, not arting, writing the pony con the first four issues.

499
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:02,766
Speaker 1: And, uh, Andy price ended up arting the pony comic.

500
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:14,141
Speaker 0: Now, uh, Katie cook is credited with some art for the first issue, but I never really figured out what she did in there compared to, you know, there's two credits for, uh, issue one and then one credit for two, three, four.

501
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:14,824
Speaker 1: Okay.

502
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:16,592
Speaker 0: Just so you know, I didn't look in.

503
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:20,693
Speaker 1: there was, there was, she did some of the, there are so many variant covers on this motherfucker.

504
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:21,156
Speaker 1: Yeah.

505
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:21,579
Speaker 1: Right.

506
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:27,140
Speaker 1: She, I know she did some of the variant covers and in fact, some comic book stores get sketch covers.

507
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:36,607
Speaker 1: She had a stack of these comics, pony comics with blank covers and she drew on each one differently and one comic book store got those.

508
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,616
Speaker 0: So I'm digging this as, as a comic.

509
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:42,020
Speaker 0: I enjoy it mightily.

510
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:42,741
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:46,917
Speaker 1: It reminds me a lot of actually the Simpsons comic, right?

512
00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:51,192
Speaker 1: Because what the Simpsons comic is to the Simpsons show, right?

513
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:54,924
Speaker 1: Is they basically, they take the show, the characters, the foundations, right?

514
00:31:55,306 --> 00:32:02,258
Speaker 1: But they get a little bit nerdier, a little bit more inside baseball because it's a comic book and they're a little bit more free to explore.

515
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:02,378
Speaker 1: Right.

516
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:06,855
Speaker 1: Uh, the art style is a little different, just like the Simpsons comic.

517
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:13,059
Speaker 0: I really like the art style is that kind of super detailed, there's crap everywhere in the background.

518
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,460
Speaker 1: It's sort of the Sergio Aragon's thing going on where everything in the background all over the place.

519
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,021
Speaker 1: Right.

520
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:34,831
Speaker 1: Um, and yeah, it's a, it's pretty great and it's like, well, you know, if, if, you know, the show feels like it has a more broader appeal and is simpler and the comic is more like a more it's not, it's, it's, well, I'll put it this way.

521
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,440
Speaker 0: It is definitely like the Simpsons comic.

522
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:40,796
Speaker 0: I would say it is aimed at someone who is already a fan of my little pony.

523
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,258
Speaker 0: Yeah.

524
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:47,303
Speaker 0: I don't, I don't see many people just reading the comic and not having watched or planning to watch or are watching the show.

525
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:50,078
Speaker 1: It doesn't really introduce you to the characters at all, right?

526
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:52,590
Speaker 1: It totally expects you to know the show.

527
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,748
Speaker 0: And by the same token, I mean, who reads the Simpsons comic, but doesn't watch the show is never watched the show.

528
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:57,370
Speaker 1: Exactly.

529
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:11,965
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it is definitely aimed, you know, so it's aimed at the fan, but simultaneously it's not the fan service that you see so often when you get a thing like this around something that has a big specialized fandom.

530
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:17,527
Speaker 1: It's not like a fan comic where it's aimed squarely at like the older, you know, unintended audience.

531
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:20,641
Speaker 1: Like this is definitely aimed at the same audience as the show.

532
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:25,421
Speaker 0: It might be aimed at a slightly older audience than the original demographic of the show.

533
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:26,466
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:26,867
Speaker 1: I don't know.

535
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:28,354
Speaker 1: I see a lot of little kids reading this.

536
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:33,235
Speaker 0: I do too, but I see a lot of little kids, uh, watching the vampire a hundred D and Robocop.

537
00:33:33,376 --> 00:33:34,841
Speaker 1: I'm talking about real little, like three.

538
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:40,759
Speaker 0: I don't think you've seen three year olds reading this real little, the littlest.

539
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:49,847
Speaker 0: I don't think you have any concept of legitimately will play with pony toys for anyone between the ages of six and 40.

540
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:51,555
Speaker 1: Are you playing with your pony toys?

541
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:52,842
Speaker 1: You just letting them decorate your desk.

542
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:56,520
Speaker 0: I currently don't have any, I don't have a selection to throw at my sky castle.

543
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,150
Speaker 0: So the comic is just, I like the story.

544
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:16,902
Speaker 0: It's really faithful to the characters and it, like Scott said, it gets its snark on and it's inside baseball on just enough more than the show to where I would actually like it if the show were more like this comic from this point forward than the other way around.

545
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:20,498
Speaker 1: Uh, but anyway, so what is, what happens in the comic, right?

546
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:26,000
Speaker 0: So the comment, which by the way, I established via Twitter that we can effectively consider this comic canon.

547
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, that Katie Cook said so.

548
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:33,590
Speaker 0: So that raises complications because you know what the plot of the five, six, seven and eight written by someone else are.

549
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,518
Speaker 0: You really, you know what it is?

550
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:36,723
Speaker 1: What is it quotes?

551
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,172
Speaker 0: A new nightmare moon has appeared.

552
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:42,899
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll see what happens there.

553
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:52,284
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the plot of the first four issues here is, uh, basically let's fight against the change lings again, right?

554
00:34:52,786 --> 00:35:01,168
Speaker 0: I love seeing the changeling queen just being herself in long form as opposed to being the villain and just like one two parter.

555
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:03,277
Speaker 0: She's a great character.

556
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,587
Speaker 1: It's like by actually giving the villains more screen time.

557
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:08,080
Speaker 1: In fact, issue three is from the villains perspective.

558
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:13,280
Speaker 1: Uh, you can really go into those characters more because they didn't get a lot of time in the show.

559
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:20,134
Speaker 0: There's this great moment where she's, you know, she's kidnapped the CMC, so they're hanging out and she just being, it's one of those typical stereotypical things of.

560
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:23,425
Speaker 1: I've kidnapped some people and they are bothering me.

561
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:30,770
Speaker 0: But the thing is they're so perfectly on character that it's brilliant and you can almost hear a sweetie house voice.

562
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:36,130
Speaker 1: Like it reminds me a lot of that rarity episode of the show where rarity was bothering the dog dudes.

563
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:37,354
Speaker 0: Ah, true.

564
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:46,414
Speaker 0: But in particular, what I like about that bit is there's this one little bit where, you know, the CMC is basically just commenting on what chrysalis is doing and being annoying about it.

565
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:49,909
Speaker 0: And they're like, well, aren't you just like, why didn't you do X?

566
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,235
Speaker 0: Because that's what evil people do.

567
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:54,790
Speaker 0: And she's like, uh, you realize I'm evil for a reason.

568
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,156
Speaker 0: Like I, I have a plan.

569
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,200
Speaker 0: I'm actually after something.

570
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,787
Speaker 0: I'm not just evil to be fucking evil.

571
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:00,977
Speaker 0: And they like, they couldn't get that.

572
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:02,704
Speaker 0: And I just thought that was a nice little touch.

573
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:07,582
Speaker 0: It's like take the Disney villain and give them an actually realistic motivation.

574
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:17,160
Speaker 1: And there's also a nice mix of taking things from the show and sort of reusing them, like the old split the characters up and then they get together with their powers of friendship.

575
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:25,353
Speaker 0: But the fact that almost immediately afterward, all of them independently like, wait a minute, I'm pretty sure we got broken up due to changeling shenanigans.

576
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:27,100
Speaker 0: Maybe we shouldn't have split up.

577
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,085
Speaker 0: Let's go find each other.

578
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:32,605
Speaker 1: But you know, that kind of stuff where it's like, they got stuff from the show, but also new things.

579
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:39,548
Speaker 1: So it's like, this is clearly pony comic, but this is also clearly not just the show again in a comic.

580
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,653
Speaker 1: It is also a new thing.

581
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:42,400
Speaker 0: Now there aren't that many issues out yet.

582
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,870
Speaker 0: There aren't going to be that many issues.

583
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:52,925
Speaker 0: I mean, Katie Cook's only writing the first four, and then there's that other plot and it's going to be like, you know, there is also, there's two actual comics.

584
00:36:53,126 --> 00:37:01,776
Speaker 1: There's a micro series where each issue focuses on a single character and it gives you a one character related to nothing side plot.

585
00:37:01,797 --> 00:37:03,383
Speaker 1: I don't know if these are canon or not.

586
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:09,908
Speaker 1: The first one we've read already is out, is about Twilight Sparkle and it gives you the story about Twilight in a library.

587
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:10,611
Speaker 1: It was okay.

588
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:19,458
Speaker 1: But it's like, those are the, actually the kinds of things I would like to see as episodes of the TV show, right?

589
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,104
Speaker 1: These sort of, these sort of plots.

590
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:26,629
Speaker 0: Well, I have this hope because you know, you realize the Simpsons got to that point once they'd just been running long enough.

591
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,090
Speaker 1: Yeah.

592
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:32,207
Speaker 0: They'd be like a mo episode and that that's when Barney kind of hit a really nice stride.

593
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:34,935
Speaker 0: quilts and quilts and quills.

594
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:43,629
Speaker 0: So while a lot of people have some problems with the current season of my little pony, people say it's not as good as other seasons and I'm not going to debate that here.

595
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:47,707
Speaker 0: Uh, though I kind of agree, but not a hundred percent and not for the same reasons you assholes do.

596
00:37:47,727 --> 00:38:00,531
Speaker 0: But I hope that the pony show continues long enough to get to that point where they do the, uh, five short Grable style episode or the pulp fiction style episode, you know, the kinds of like.

597
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:07,598
Speaker 0: let's mess up the format or just follow one character things that the Simpsons started doing hardcore like season seven, eight, nine.

598
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:07,698
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,784
Speaker 1: Or the, uh, Dexter's lab.

600
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:12,730
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

601
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:18,987
Speaker 1: That episode really high concept that I appreciate much more as an adult now than I did as a child.

602
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:21,777
Speaker 1: The artistic masterpiece that it is.

603
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:26,375
Speaker 0: I tried to like shuffle my nose, like, like do my sniffle in that pattern.

604
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:27,519
Speaker 0: And I think I just hurt my lung.

605
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,864
Speaker 0: My lung kind of hurts now.

606
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:31,647
Speaker 1: Okay.

607
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:35,680
Speaker 0: But no, that, uh, all that aside, this comic is pretty great.

608
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:41,606
Speaker 0: I would say if you're not a fan of my little pony, like you're one of those people who somehow held out, uh, you know what?

609
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:43,051
Speaker 0: You should try reading the comic.

610
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:44,336
Speaker 0: It's cheap.

611
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:51,163
Speaker 1: I guess you can read an issue, but really it's more, if you're a pony person and you're watching the show, you have to read the comic.

612
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:58,116
Speaker 0: I would say if you're not a fan of the show, read the comic because one, a few people I know who public has said they're not fans of the show privately admitted.

613
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:05,421
Speaker 0: They actually do watch the show, which is weird, but yeah, someone we might know who says they don't like the show anyway.

614
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:16,792
Speaker 0: So even if, you know, if someone's not a pony fan, this comic is pretty funny and standalone in the same way that if you had some random person, the Simpsons comic, even though it's not really aimed at them, I could see them enjoying it.

615
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:18,560
Speaker 0: And then later on going to watch.

616
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:21,013
Speaker 1: I read a couple of Simpsons comics every year.

617
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:23,124
Speaker 1: I'm not going to go get them all because it's just too goddamn many.

618
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:29,451
Speaker 1: Cause that thing has been going nonstop for years, but it's like, I read one once in a while and they're always mildly humorous.

619
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:30,154
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:32,201
Speaker 0: These kind of stand on their own, but no, Scott's right.

621
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:37,420
Speaker 0: These are really aimed at, you're already a fan of my little pony in any stretch.

622
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:40,272
Speaker 0: There is no reason for you to not read these.

623
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,904
Speaker 0: Even if you're only a casual fan, you've only seen a few episodes.

624
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,981
Speaker 0: If you know anything about ponies and liked it at all, you should read this comic.

625
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:52,417
Speaker 1: You probably actually need to watch the chrysalis episodes to understand this.

626
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:53,199
Speaker 0: Yeah.

627
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,691
Speaker 0: But at the same time you can, it's one of those things.

628
00:39:55,751 --> 00:40:01,517
Speaker 1: Like if you don't know that if you haven't seen at least one CMC episode with sweetie bell and scootaloo, you won't understand.

629
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:20,137
Speaker 0: I think it's more that with many secondary works like this, if you are like when I read, uh, that, uh, horrible green lantern thing, horribleness aside, there are, there were bits that were actually pretty well done that I didn't get because I hadn't read other green lantern bullshit,

630
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:23,170
Speaker 1: but that was a green lantern that was told to me was a green lantern.

631
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:28,456
Speaker 0: You could read not having read anything, but at the same time I could read it and get it without knowing those things.

632
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:43,748
Speaker 0: Those things would just enhance it much like how you can totally just watch Wolverine and the X-Men knowing nothing about the X-Men and it is a great show, but if you know anything about the X-Men, it is so much better because of the little sort of bits and the important parts.

633
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:52,460
Speaker 0: The fact that Scott Summers is the loser loner who's tearing everything apart and Wolverine has to get the team back together.

634
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,342
Speaker 0: The irony of that is lost on someone who doesn't read a lot of X-Men, but you can watch the show with or without that.

635
00:40:57,382 --> 00:40:58,065
Speaker 0: It's just ads.

636
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:04,668
Speaker 0: Knowing the personalities of the three different CMC makes this comic way better.

637
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,967
Speaker 0: Not knowing them does not prevent you from enjoying it and figuring out that.

638
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:11,640
Speaker 1: Why did she kidnap those three annoying ponies?

639
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,166
Speaker 1: Why aren't they freaking out?

640
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:18,018
Speaker 0: I don't know, maybe ponies just don't freak out.

641
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:20,044
Speaker 0: You don't see a lot of ponies freaking out in this comic.

642
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,173
Speaker 0: Who freaks out?

643
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,022
Speaker 1: My little pony is about nothing but ponies freaking out.

644
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,127
Speaker 1: That's what the show is.

645
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:31,472
Speaker 0: In fact, Rarity keeps her cool surprisingly well when flowers attack.

646
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:32,120
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

647
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:35,304
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

648
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:38,580
Speaker 0: There's not much to review without just spoiling the crap out of the what?

649
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, come on.

650
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,233
Speaker 1: And I'm kind of hungry.

651
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:43,876
Speaker 1: I want to go home.

652
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:45,020
Speaker 1: I want to do a long episode.

653
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,525
Speaker 0: There might not be shows next week.

654
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:48,132
Speaker 0: I might be in Colombia.

655
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:49,297
Speaker 0: Colombia.

656
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:50,843
Speaker 1: You know what happens if you go to Colombia?

657
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:52,588
Speaker 1: I play more Netrunner.

658
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,056
Speaker 0: But I'll tell you all this.

659
00:41:55,397 --> 00:42:01,920
Speaker 0: We have like four episodes of Geek Nights presents Shoujo Kakamei Utena videoed, ready for post-production.

660
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,389
Speaker 0: I've just been too busy to finish editing them.

661
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,480
Speaker 1: Maybe you should watch some of that there.

662
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:08,006
Speaker 1: Some of that there Utena?

663
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:08,830
Speaker 1: Some of that there Utena.

664
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,647
Speaker 0: I got one dude already who complained about how we pronounce Utena.

665
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,999
Speaker 1: Except the way Wakaba pronounces it is Utena.

666
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:24,840
Speaker 0: All things aside on that debate, yes, Japanese does not have inflection like other languages do.

667
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:32,625
Speaker 0: But at the same time, someone who speaks English and speaks Japanese words will tend to speak it with an accent.

668
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:35,235
Speaker 0: In this case, in English or American accent.

669
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,440
Speaker 1: And he says Utena-sama.

670
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,303
Speaker 1: Which is Utena.

671
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:38,925
Speaker 1: Utena-sama.

672
00:42:39,045 --> 00:42:42,514
Speaker 0: Utena has a slight emphasis on the T the way I said it.

673
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:47,372
Speaker 0: Utena is not how they say it in Japanese either.

674
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:48,900
Speaker 0: And Utena is ridiculous.

675
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,430
Speaker 1: So we told where that there Utena comes from.

676
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,842
Speaker 0: That there Utena is going to get saved for another time.

677
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:57,532
Speaker 0: But let me tell you, I heard a man say...

678
00:42:57,552 --> 00:42:59,158
Speaker 1: I thought you weren't there.

679
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:01,887
Speaker 1: I thought this was a story that was secondhand from Lara.

680
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:02,570
Speaker 0: Lara?

681
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,553
Speaker 0: I thought it was from Luke.

682
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:05,380
Speaker 0: Are we that old?

683
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,522
Speaker 0: I don't know.

684
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:08,428
Speaker 0: Do we not know the origin of this?

685
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:09,552
Speaker 1: Maybe this isn't true.

686
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:15,550
Speaker 0: I have this clear memory of Luke and someone else being in a conversation.

687
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:21,749
Speaker 0: And Luke said something like, yeah, he's a fan of that there Utena, making fun of him saying it that way.

688
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:22,933
Speaker 1: I don't know.

689
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,020
Speaker 0: Do we... I think we're old.

690
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,762
Speaker 0: I think it's over.

691
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:26,806
Speaker 0: It's the end of the party.

692
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,739
Speaker 1: Some guy said he was a fan of that there Utena.

693
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,441
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
