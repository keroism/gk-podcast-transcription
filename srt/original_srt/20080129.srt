1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,867
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 29th.

2
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,291
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:16,260
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:21,359
Speaker 0: We tell you not only how to not suck, but how to beat all your friends at Settlers of Catan.

5
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:29,226
Speaker 0: Let's do this If nothing else.

6
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:31,700
Speaker 0: the new Advance Wars is up hardcore.

7
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:42,399
Speaker 0: It is quite the hardest of course to the point that I think we're gonna hold off on reviewing it another week Or maybe two because I'm real close to beating it and I got a lot to say about it.

8
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:43,699
Speaker 0: Most of it is good.

9
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:54,916
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of things to say about it cuz it's so different from the other advance Wars that if a I think Even if we had done like three Set a show for each and every Advance Wars in the past god.

10
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:55,700
Speaker 0: I could do a show.

11
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,393
Speaker 1: I don't think you're doing a show on this.

12
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:58,240
Speaker 1: new one would be red.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,379
Speaker 0: I think I could do a show a whole show about every single map in the war room of every Advance Wars.

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,324
Speaker 1: today You had to do a whole show about every war room, man I don't think we should.

15
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:10,135
Speaker 0: I think that would get real old real quick, but I think I could.

16
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,440
Speaker 1: that's all you.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,452
Speaker 1: I think it would just take about five minutes to talk about each man.

18
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,500
Speaker 0: Are you kidding span Island alone?

19
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,974
Speaker 0: They're like four different ways to beat it and they're five ways.

20
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:24,832
Speaker 0: if you use a certain CEO there The depth in those games is so great.

21
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,780
Speaker 1: I think you're just a little crazy with the advance orders.

22
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,390
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I am.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,356
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pretend I'm not.

24
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:34,050
Speaker 0: at least I didn't Fail out of graduate school because of Advance Wars like someone else.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,920
Speaker 1: we know fact you managed to play Advance Wars and pass.

26
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:44,940
Speaker 0: Yeah The fact that I s Frank the hard campaign on Advance Wars 1 & 2 and still graduated still amazes me.

27
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:49,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I don't know there was a point at which I would play.

28
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,360
Speaker 0: I would get to school.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,226
Speaker 0: I'd play while I was walking to class.

30
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:53,350
Speaker 0: I'd play in class.

31
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,393
Speaker 0: I'd leave class.

32
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:54,955
Speaker 0: They go to lunch.

33
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:55,477
Speaker 0: I'd play.

34
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:56,540
Speaker 0: batteries would die.

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,572
Speaker 0: I'd go buy more batteries continue to play.

36
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:06,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, GBA You know, in fact when I think about it, I really only played Advance Wars on my GBA.

37
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:12,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, well when that there's a blue and black DS light coming, I'm all about that.

38
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,260
Speaker 1: finally a somewhat decent color.

39
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,608
Speaker 1: I guess I can't afford to wait for a better color.

40
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,860
Speaker 0: So I'll take what I can get, you know, your regular DS works fine.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,496
Speaker 1: Why don't you just keep using it because it's not as bright as a DS light.

42
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:31,675
Speaker 0: It's not as small Yeah, and how much does the DS light cost now compared to say six months ago?

43
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:33,159
Speaker 1: the same, huh?

44
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:41,383
Speaker 0: So if you bought it six months ago the cost of the same But you would have had six more months of the bright screen that the wrong color Plus.

45
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,600
Speaker 0: so so so so aesthetics matter.

46
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,845
Speaker 1: Well, no, it would also.

47
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:48,560
Speaker 1: the wear and tear on the system would have been six months worth.

48
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:51,463
Speaker 1: So now I'm getting a brand new one now which is you know.

49
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:59,066
Speaker 0: see the thing is what my regular DS got beat the hell out of partly because it was kind of big and bulky and also because I Carried on the DS.

50
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,637
Speaker 1: my the plain old DS was new and you turned it on.

51
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:02,280
Speaker 1: it was amazing.

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,991
Speaker 1: And now not so much.

53
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,260
Speaker 0: No, not so much.

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,495
Speaker 0: And the thing is I'll admit my DS seemed fine until it broke.

55
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,740
Speaker 0: it was like I can hold out.

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,972
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy a DS light.

57
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:12,700
Speaker 0: I'll wait for the DS.

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,088
Speaker 1: I still pretty sure you broke it somewhat on purpose.

59
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,480
Speaker 1: Are you kidding even subconsciously on purpose playing Pokemon?

60
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,479
Speaker 0: I was in the middle of some Pokemons and I dropped it.

61
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:34,094
Speaker 0: I would you know how angry I was at the fact that I could not continue to play Pokemon and then I basically had a very large Somewhat suboptimal GBA for the next couple weeks before I bought a new DS but not.

62
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 1: but you don't care about your Pokemons now.

63
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:39,072
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I could throw away my Pokemons and not even blink.

64
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,637
Speaker 0: I'm done with that game forever.

65
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:45,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, well, so we gonna talk about newses or things of the day or any that kind of shit.

66
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,114
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I could start.

67
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:47,660
Speaker 0: I got a news.

68
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:53,062
Speaker 0: I'm sure the forum all knows what this is about and I'm sure they know my opinion but most of you Will see.

69
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:53,785
Speaker 0: we'll go with this.

70
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,631
Speaker 0: So there are some announcements.

71
00:03:55,671 --> 00:04:02,840
Speaker 1: regarding Team Fortress 2 last week The game that we talked about way more on this podcast than it deserves.

72
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,460
Speaker 0: The game the game we waited for 10 years.

73
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:18,680
Speaker 1: I mean, I know it just seems that like if you take we probably talked about Team Fortress 2 on this podcast More than any other single game, but I don't think it really deserves that and I think there are a lot of other games.

74
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,744
Speaker 1: We never talked about that.

75
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:26,210
Speaker 1: We probably could talk about least a little bit like what I don't know a lot of the games You don't play like what game what game you talk about?

76
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,760
Speaker 0: So like Mario Galaxy talk about Mario Galaxy.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, we haven't played it yet.

78
00:04:30,307 --> 00:04:33,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I've been playing a Counter-Strike.

79
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,729
Speaker 1: Great, okay.

80
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:38,297
Speaker 1: Anyway, talk about your thing is Team Fortress 2.

81
00:04:38,297 --> 00:05:04,815
Speaker 0: I've had a mixed love-hate relationship with it because on one hand it's Extremely well put together and well balanced and it's it's overall a really really solid game But at the same time it had a lot of in my opinion fundamental failings that Really really just bother me constantly when I play it and as a result, I haven't played it Nearly as much at all compared to pretty much any other FPS.

82
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:05,980
Speaker 0: I've liked in my entire life.

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,709
Speaker 1: Well, you've got an advanced source now, so just forget about it.

84
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,900
Speaker 0: I can't I just can't forget about it because I love FPS.

85
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:15,100
Speaker 0: I've been playing FPS is for as long as FPS is have existed.

86
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:22,031
Speaker 0: I played Doom like every other day from the day it came out But just play Counter-Strike then and forget I have then.

87
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,620
Speaker 0: but the thing is I like these teeny natural selection.

88
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,967
Speaker 0: Actually, I tried to play natural selection over the weekend.

89
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:28,870
Speaker 0: There were.

90
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,856
Speaker 0: there was one server with people on it.

91
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,002
Speaker 0: The rest were all bots Uh-huh.

92
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to look into that.

93
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:39,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that one server it was running combat and everyone really sucked.

94
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:41,186
Speaker 1: Well, we'll look into that.

95
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,231
Speaker 1: We'll see what the story is.

96
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,736
Speaker 1: They are working on NS2.

97
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,660
Speaker 1: They have a little video.

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,580
Speaker 0: You know what Duke Nukem and Team Fortress 2 have both been being worked on in the past.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,385
Speaker 1: Team Fortress 2 came out.

100
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,160
Speaker 1: Yeah after ten years and NS2 will come out in the next five years.

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,830
Speaker 1: I guarantee five years within the next five years.

102
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:05,280
Speaker 0: Okay, so in four point nine seven years I'm gonna get to be really disappointed by a game that won't live up to my unrealistic expectations.

103
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,510
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that NS2 will is not a game that will disappoint.

104
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,600
Speaker 0: I think you underestimate my my unrealistic expectations.

105
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:18,540
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe me if your if your expectations are too unrealistic then you can't be helped.

106
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,734
Speaker 1: All right I have faith in the people who make the NS2.

107
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:26,471
Speaker 0: so I Realized something and I kind of thought this but I didn't.

108
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:33,320
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure and now it's been proven to me because one Team Fortress 2 that you know, they realize that people aren't playing the game that much anymore.

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:44,556
Speaker 0: They're there aren't even like on eighth the number of people playing it now that we're playing it when it came out at least on the PC Servers have declined and the game is not nearly as popular as I guess they expected it to be.

110
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,202
Speaker 0: so they've been saying Oh, we're gonna change it We're gonna add stuff.

111
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:53,345
Speaker 0: part of that was adding new maps and the first of all these new maps came out Wasn't actually a new map.

112
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:57,440
Speaker 0: It was just that well map, but they changed it to be a capture the flag.

113
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,613
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's a good idea because they only had one capture the flag map.

114
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:04,685
Speaker 1: yet despite after the flag is the most popular Playstyle.

115
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean think back in like the weapons factory days.

116
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:11,291
Speaker 0: There were like 42 fort maps and all of them were popular.

117
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:15,624
Speaker 0: Yeah Team Fortress Team Fortress comes out Yep, and there was one.

118
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:22,107
Speaker 1: and well well was the second most popular map right after I guess, you know To fort.

119
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,600
Speaker 1: so the problem to forward it was too small.

120
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,005
Speaker 1: So they just made a CTF.

121
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,414
Speaker 1: well, and then it sounds good to me.

122
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:36,020
Speaker 0: now pretty much every Idea I had about what was wrong with Team Fortress 2 was crystallized by CTF.

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,137
Speaker 0: Well because CTF well made the game fun again.

124
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:55,430
Speaker 0: CTF well is like the best thing that could have ever have happened to Team Fortress 2 just by having open spaces and by having like Five or six different paths and even on a full-on like 16 versus 16 server You cannot cover every way of coming in and going out

125
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,560
Speaker 1: because on a normal well where it's captured the point, right?

126
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,935
Speaker 1: You're only ever really dealing with in a small area of the map at any one time.

127
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:09,574
Speaker 1: but in a CTF Well, you're dealing with the whole map at once and it really spreads everything out.

128
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,740
Speaker 0: now as a result the gameplay.

129
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,304
Speaker 0: I Noticed one thing people who weren't good at the game hate CTF.

130
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:19,335
Speaker 0: well because you can't do dick if you don't know how to play.

131
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:19,957
Speaker 0: FPS is.

132
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:29,767
Speaker 0: but The FPS skill that was so lacking in pretty much every other map in Team Fortress 2 is back and goddamn Is that like the best map ever?

133
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:33,280
Speaker 0: All right, and it proved everything I thought was wrong with Team Fortress 2.

134
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,010
Speaker 0: I mean I always complain like yeah Everything's slow and everything is like huddled together and aiming doesn't matter.

135
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:53,360
Speaker 0: and while aiming doesn't matter nearly to the degree that it did With the old-school possibly infeasible in the modern era FPS is at the same time just by having the bigger map Aiming matters a hell of a lot more than it did in any other tf2 map.

136
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:59,600
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so my interest in this game has been rekindled a thousandfold, but I will only play on CTF.

137
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,070
Speaker 1: Well, all right, but I might have to play some CTF.

138
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,857
Speaker 0: well you might you might your habits seriously.

139
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:06,780
Speaker 0: the game is fun again.

140
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:08,187
Speaker 0: I've been rocketed up.

141
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,413
Speaker 0: the spies can do shit.

142
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:15,272
Speaker 1: spot snipers matter But but I was waiting for the but I knew it was coming.

143
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:19,747
Speaker 0: see I wonder the good news first because CTF well is pretty.

144
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,593
Speaker 0: it's pretty much like valve said.

145
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,275
Speaker 0: alright rim.

146
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,860
Speaker 0: We heard that you were pissed off.

147
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,086
Speaker 0: Here's some candy.

148
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:31,759
Speaker 0: and then as soon as I eat the candy they say ah But that's the last of the candy and we're going to murder you tomorrow.

149
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,450
Speaker 0: Because it turns out that the other thing they're gonna add to the game is Every class is gonna get like a new weapon or something.

150
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:42,314
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get it all right.

151
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,880
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you wanted though.

152
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,715
Speaker 0: Oh, oh it is.

153
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,989
Speaker 0: yes Every class is gonna get a new weapon more because that's.

154
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:53,280
Speaker 0: the only other thing that was wrong with the game was that Every class needed one more main weapon, and it would have been like the perfect game.

155
00:09:54,242 --> 00:10:08,184
Speaker 0: And they're adding one more weapon or one more ability to every class, but according to valve they're adding these weapons as Achievements I thought you were arguing for the achievements Against me now.

156
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:09,811
Speaker 1: Are you turning code?

157
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:12,200
Speaker 1: Are you joining the Scott anti-achievement brigade?

158
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,545
Speaker 0: I think Scott that you were.

159
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,420
Speaker 0: you're using a tactic that I've used very very often.

160
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,358
Speaker 1: Oh, are you saying my club my tactics are too clever?

161
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:24,900
Speaker 1: therefore I'm right, but a tactic that at the same time pointing out that my tactic is clever in fact proves me right not wrong.

162
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,469
Speaker 0: But clever it may be fallacious it is.

163
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,420
Speaker 0: no it is the fallacy you see of the false dichotomy.

164
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:38,453
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a false dichotomy because Achievements in and of themselves don't hurt games at all as far as I'm concerned.

165
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:38,915
Speaker 0: They're there.

166
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:40,180
Speaker 0: whatever you can go after him.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,364
Speaker 0: Don't go after him if you like him.

168
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:44,455
Speaker 0: That's great, but there is a problem in a game.

169
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:58,880
Speaker 0: That is nominally a stateless Skill-based versus team game where Achievements give you an advantage or change the options you have available to you within the game.

170
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:05,096
Speaker 0: basically team fortress 2 has become an MMO dun dun dun.

171
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:09,164
Speaker 0: now they haven't done this yet and I I was.

172
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:16,537
Speaker 0: everything I said about team fortress 2 being like the best fucking game ever and coming back and like this new map And they realized what they've done wrong, and they're fixing it.

173
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:18,525
Speaker 0: It's pretty much over.

174
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:30,580
Speaker 0: if they actually go forward with this if they decide that you have to arbitrarily level yourself up to get some Achievement in order to get the better healing gun or the different homing rocket launcher or whatever else they're gonna add.

175
00:11:31,282 --> 00:11:36,414
Speaker 0: That reeks of bullshit to the level that I can't even begin to explain how.

176
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,243
Speaker 0: and not angry kind of Disappointed.

177
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:41,556
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean imagining counter-strike.

178
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,747
Speaker 1: right in counter-strike You have one game of counter-strike.

179
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,660
Speaker 1: it begins when the map loads and ends when the map changes, right?

180
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:50,860
Speaker 1: And the economics you know sort of go from round to round.

181
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,533
Speaker 1: But a set of rounds on one map is a game, and that's it.

182
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:56,520
Speaker 1: you don't carry your money from game to game.

183
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:57,543
Speaker 1: That's you know.

184
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:05,183
Speaker 1: in team fortress 2 one game is until the map ends until someone captures the flag three times or Captures all the points.

185
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:10,420
Speaker 1: It's one game alright, and what you do in a previous game should not affect the next game.

186
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,916
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's how it get otherwise.

187
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:13,600
Speaker 1: It's just unfair.

188
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,644
Speaker 1: What if you went to go?

189
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:18,440
Speaker 1: you know play Scrabble with your friend right, but he won the last four games.

190
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,213
Speaker 1: He won the last four games of Scrabble that you were not involved in.

191
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:28,481
Speaker 1: so you go to play Scrabble But he starts with 400 points because he won the last four games that you were not involved in or he starts with all the Ease.

192
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:30,988
Speaker 1: yeah that does not make for a good game.

193
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:40,111
Speaker 1: and what they're gonna do to team fortress 2 is if someone got achievements in previous games Now that means they're gonna have more options.

194
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:48,600
Speaker 1: even if the options are no better or worse They're going to have more options available to them in the next game, and that's that does not make for a good game.

195
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 1: It is not good.

196
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,812
Speaker 1: It takes away skill and encourages other things as bad.

197
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:56,164
Speaker 0: to clarify that sort of thing is Okay in a certain kind of game.

198
00:12:56,225 --> 00:13:02,720
Speaker 0: if you don't want the game to be stateless or you don't want the game to be purely a Game of tactics skill or strategy, then that's fine.

199
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:09,565
Speaker 0: I think battlefield 2 is the example people brought up in the forums where yeah that game is not trying to be a stateless Versus game.

200
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:17,776
Speaker 0: it's trying to be a somewhat stateful semi simulation kind of game And it's this totally different thing and that that's all cool, but team fortress - I'm not a game.

201
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,418
Speaker 1: want to play them?

202
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,900
Speaker 0: well No, I respect a game like that.

203
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:27,998
Speaker 0: It's just that the kind of game I like is a game that is pretty much entirely a game of skill and a stateless game of skill at that.

204
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:28,982
Speaker 0: each round is Unique.

205
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:30,552
Speaker 0: that's why I play tennis.

206
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:31,800
Speaker 0: That's why I like games like that.

207
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,225
Speaker 0: I like to compete against people.

208
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:38,020
Speaker 0: German board games would totally suck if I could level up like in the Camarilla God.

209
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:48,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh by the way in other news the cam sucks Because I'm curious if any man rim rim you better.

210
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,536
Speaker 1: you better take care of that news.

211
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:53,184
Speaker 1: it's an antique You know.

212
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:54,153
Speaker 0: you better watch that joke.

213
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,207
Speaker 0: Crap we're in a recursion loop.

214
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,031
Speaker 0: There's no way out.

215
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:03,619
Speaker 1: better watch that recursive loop.

216
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:08,459
Speaker 0: So uh I don't have a lot more to say about this other than that.

217
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:10,347
Speaker 0: You know what valve?

218
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,015
Speaker 0: fuck you this.

219
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:18,040
Speaker 0: I've waited for this game I for ten years and it came out and it was so close to being good.

220
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:27,096
Speaker 0: and then you're fixing the problems and you've realized there are problems and You're so close to perfection, and then you just take a big ol poop on it.

221
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:33,357
Speaker 1: well speaking of valve and the steam This better not be a steamy.

222
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,032
Speaker 1: Yeah How about how about the plumbing to go with your valve and your steam?

223
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:40,055
Speaker 0: all right?

224
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:41,820
Speaker 0: What's going on all right?

225
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,812
Speaker 1: So you know they have the steam thing right.

226
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,540
Speaker 1: let's you download the games now.

227
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,746
Speaker 1: We were by the game.

228
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:53,580
Speaker 0: we were talking about steam at work today, and I'm curious Why up in light of what happened to Vmware today?

229
00:14:54,021 --> 00:15:03,540
Speaker 0: I'm I'm curious why steam doesn't try to work with Vmware to Get video stuff to work to the point that they could sell or give away for free.

230
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:10,913
Speaker 0: They steam appliance that runs on any any Computer that can run the M way because the problem there is.

231
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,780
Speaker 1: there's nothing steam could do to help them.

232
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:20,060
Speaker 1: They would need help from nVidi or Ati because they be oh yeah And if I need to write a piece of software that does everything that a video card.

233
00:15:20,142 --> 00:15:20,245
Speaker 1: Oh,

234
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:39,260
Speaker 0: I'm well aware And I'm saying that if I were steam I would be doing everything I could I mean within the bounds of reality to Convince or lean on Ati or nVidia or Vmware all of them combined to try to get something like that because that would be pretty much the best thing in the world steam could Ever do to make themselves entrenched forever.

235
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:51,500
Speaker 1: It just seems like valve really never has and never will care about having steam running anything But windows pcs and it doesn't look like it's going to change even though it's something I want more than almost anything.

236
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,637
Speaker 0: It's something I'd be willing to pay a lot of money for.

237
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,115
Speaker 1: yeah I'd pay a lot of money for that.

238
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,228
Speaker 1: anyway What they have done right is there.

239
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:02,240
Speaker 1: they are now giving away something called steamworks, right?

240
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,563
Speaker 1: Let me.

241
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:08,888
Speaker 1: steamworks is for people who make games And it basically provides the.

242
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,115
Speaker 1: let me let me quote to gabe newell.

243
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:21,600
Speaker 1: You know Mr.. Steam Developers and publishers is spending more and more time and money cobbling together all the tools and back-end systems Needed to build and launch a successful title in today's market.

244
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:31,899
Speaker 1: Steamworks puts all those tools and systems together in one free package Liberating publishers and developers to concentrate on the game instead of the plumbing ha ha ha plumbing steam valve.

245
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,610
Speaker 1: all right Let me list everything.

246
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,760
Speaker 1: steamworks does you ready?

247
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,140
Speaker 0: This is either going to be a great list or a really really disappointing.

248
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,217
Speaker 1: It's a half great list and a half disappointing list all right.

249
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:42,700
Speaker 0: Let's hear it.

250
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,319
Speaker 1: So remember this is a tool to help people who are making games game publishers and game developers, right?

251
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,259
Speaker 1: First it gives you real-time stats on sales gameplay and product activation know exactly how well your game is selling etcetera, etcetera.

252
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,968
Speaker 1: alright State of the art encryption system.

253
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:01,916
Speaker 1: stop paying to have your game pirated.

254
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:02,658
Speaker 1: they have the.

255
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,481
Speaker 1: you know It's just.

256
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,823
Speaker 1: it'll be as hard to pirate.

257
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,626
Speaker 1: You know your games as it is to pirate.

258
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,069
Speaker 1: You know team fortress 2 or whatever.

259
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:08,910
Speaker 0: all right?

260
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,128
Speaker 1: Territory slash version control.

261
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,380
Speaker 1: basically you can release your game.

262
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:18,795
Speaker 1: You know different parts of the world and not worry about people in other parts of the world getting it.

263
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:20,138
Speaker 0: um so far.

264
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:27,079
Speaker 0: These all reek of like evil businessman DRM kind of things and not things to help me make a game.

265
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, is the bad ones all right now here.

266
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:28,958
Speaker 1: We go ready.

267
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:35,422
Speaker 1: Auto-updating ensures all customers are playing the latest and greatest version, okay, duh voice chat That's.

268
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,790
Speaker 1: you don't have to program voice chat.

269
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:42,657
Speaker 0: You just use the steam voice chat, man I think I haven't tried it yet, but I think you can voice chat in the new advanced horse Wi-Fi.

270
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,367
Speaker 1: yep Multiplayer matchmaking.

271
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,640
Speaker 1: so you don't have to make a matchmaking thing for your game.

272
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,167
Speaker 1: We just use the counter-strike team fortress matchmaking.

273
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,818
Speaker 0: That's actually really good because that's like the best system out there currently.

274
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,956
Speaker 1: yep Social networking with achievements leaderboards and avatars.

275
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,820
Speaker 1: fuck the achievements.

276
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,860
Speaker 1: But leaderboards and avatars without having you know there's nothing wrong with the achievements.

277
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,885
Speaker 0: They're chatting.

278
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:12,800
Speaker 1: as long as they don't give me the uber awp yep and Development tools so you can administer betas and things all right.

279
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:20,500
Speaker 1: So if you're making a game, and you guess you want your game to be on the steam You can just get the steamworks, and you can add all these features to your game.

280
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:27,060
Speaker 1: Especially you know if it's the sort of game where you know it's online Matchmaking you know servers and such without having to program all that shit.

281
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:27,984
Speaker 0: I don't get.

282
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,008
Speaker 1: I've already programmed it.

283
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,779
Speaker 0: so the game publisher you want to publish your game now.

284
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:44,330
Speaker 0: I can understand wanting to limit the markets in different places like release in the US and Japan and then in Britain or sorry Albion then in Australia or whatever because you know Distribution and all that is difficult.

285
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:49,534
Speaker 1: the main reason you want to do that I mean you think people would want to just release the game around the world to make the most money.

286
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:49,795
Speaker 1: right?

287
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:57,647
Speaker 1: the main reasons I think that that I've got you know Re-importation from the cheap versions in the US.

288
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:05,384
Speaker 1: well no I think the reason that they don't want to release games worldwide just immediately is because Two reasons.

289
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,012
Speaker 1: number one right is you?

290
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:16,319
Speaker 1: they want to kind of translate the games You know and adapt them for different countries and stuff especially if there's laws about certain things like you know You can't have a let's say you make like Wolfenstein.

291
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:19,754
Speaker 1: well it's kind of hard to sell that in Germany you know with the Nazi whatnots and the laws there.

292
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:21,668
Speaker 1: so they want to avoid that kind of trouble.

293
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:29,799
Speaker 1: and Secondly they I guess Similarly you want to avoid you know if you do business in a one more country.

294
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:37,990
Speaker 1: now You're you know you're beholden to that country like Microsoft is getting sued in the EU even though They're you know country in Washington's your company, Washington State.

295
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,776
Speaker 0: well, so the thing is though.

296
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:52,347
Speaker 0: with digital distribution most of the barriers for worldwide release are eliminated and the only ones left are ones that come from you being afraid to stand up to some country that's afraid of Something that they shouldn't be.

297
00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:01,626
Speaker 0: or if you're trying to be evil and make extra money Yeah, but I think that's why you still see different iTunes music stores for each country and do what I think we're gonna see as A result different.

298
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,880
Speaker 1: you know we shop channels for different countries.

299
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:11,220
Speaker 0: It just means that games released on Steam are going to for whatever reason Not appear in Australia until four months later for twice as much money.

300
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:19,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I really I just think that if anything you know well It's it's kind of crummy with the Steam DRM and all that other bullshit.

301
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:24,025
Speaker 1: You know you're gonna see a lot more games on Steam Which is just what Steam needs.

302
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,269
Speaker 0: and you know what I got to say.

303
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,974
Speaker 0: I see no problem with that.

304
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,720
Speaker 0: because Bioshock, right?

305
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:36,929
Speaker 0: I realize now that I know I don't need to go to stores at all anymore except for food and maybe very very Any video game any PC game?

306
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,477
Speaker 1: I can't buy on Steam or download from a website for free.

307
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:44,513
Speaker 0: I could buy an Amazon Yep, and I really really don't like going to stores anymore.

308
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,840
Speaker 0: going to stores is not pleasant and even then I don't want to a new like Bioshock comes out.

309
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,946
Speaker 0: I don't want to have to all right.

310
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,232
Speaker 0: go to Amazon pre-order it.

311
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:52,820
Speaker 0: then a physical box comes.

312
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,394
Speaker 0: What happens when I buy in a DS game?

313
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,500
Speaker 0: right a box comes?

314
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,528
Speaker 0: I open the box and throw the box away in.

315
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,396
Speaker 0: it is a smaller plastic box.

316
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:01,380
Speaker 0: I open the box.

317
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,552
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of papers in it.

318
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:07,236
Speaker 0: I pull them out I flip through one of them then I throw all of that away and all I have left is the game.

319
00:21:07,256 --> 00:21:10,026
Speaker 0: yep and Computer games are even worse.

320
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:12,380
Speaker 0: they come with all this other stuff, but they don't come with anything useful.

321
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,480
Speaker 0: It's not like anyone ships manuals anymore

322
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:27,064
Speaker 1: and the only advantage of having the disc for a computer game is that if somehow your internet connection is dead and You need to install the game on a computer to play it because you don't have it installed already or broke or something Require

323
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,980
Speaker 0: online registration to work anyway

324
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:29,645
Speaker 1: I know.

325
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:39,500
Speaker 1: so if you have a net connection And you have steam you can download the game from steam and the only worry there Is that one day of steam dies you won't be able to get your games anymore, which is true.

326
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,768
Speaker 1: But I really just I don't see that happening.

327
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,760
Speaker 0: steams come a long way and steam has offline mode.

328
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:55,050
Speaker 1: So if you know that steam is gonna go away forever Get some drives and download and install all of your steam games And then put steam in offline mode and be done with it.

329
00:21:55,331 --> 00:22:00,339
Speaker 0: plus if that really happened the one nice thing about steam and the Fact that gamers and nerds is that I?

330
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,604
Speaker 0: Imagine a lot of nerds would very quickly do everything they could to make steam work again Just so we can get with that.

331
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:15,641
Speaker 1: if it wasn't being constantly updated the DRM on the steam would be broken and all your games Would become unlocked or I imagine valve is really nice, and you know I you know the guys there even though They're.

332
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,032
Speaker 1: you know they're doing this stuff at it for the business reasons.

333
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:18,876
Speaker 1: They're not assholes.

334
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,760
Speaker 1: They make the good games.

335
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,966
Speaker 1: They care about the gamers.

336
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,900
Speaker 1: You know you could tell this the love and something like portal, right?

337
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,227
Speaker 1: So they're not gonna fuck us over.

338
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:31,997
Speaker 0: you could trust them unless we're fans of Skill based team FPS is yeah, well you know.

339
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:34,067
Speaker 1: like I said That's what we want.

340
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:39,127
Speaker 0: doesn't seem to be what most of the gamers want except the thing is Playership of Team Fortress has been dropping.

341
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:41,874
Speaker 1: so yeah because people don't know.

342
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,960
Speaker 1: people don't know what they want.

343
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:53,013
Speaker 0: I'll say this People may not want what I want because I'll admit that what I want is something from an older era But at the same time people don't want what's out there now.

344
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,620
Speaker 1: No people don't know what they want.

345
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:02,744
Speaker 0: That's the problem, and if a game could be made that was halfway between what I want and what they want It'd be a great game.

346
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:08,290
Speaker 0: the problem is that's up from the center of this triangle and valve is going to the exact opposite direction right now.

347
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:23,435
Speaker 1: full life consequences Consequences that will affect you for the rest of your life, so uh This was on FARC.

348
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,149
Speaker 0: I did not do any research into the veracity of the claims behind the origin of it.

349
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:39,650
Speaker 0: however I'm going to believe that the story is true because the The writing looks exactly like what a semi literate nine-year-old would spew forth from their hand or possibly onto a keyboard.

350
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:51,875
Speaker 0: alright, but uh Think about half-life and about John Freeman.

351
00:23:52,097 --> 00:24:01,177
Speaker 0: Gordon Freeman's brother Must pretty creative for a nine-year-old kid live up to his family name and face full life consequences.

352
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:09,945
Speaker 0: now someone else being a genius took this and Narrated it while also acting it out in the half-life 2 engine.

353
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,390
Speaker 1: a little makinima actions.

354
00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:15,430
Speaker 0: And let me tell you this is a little hilarious.

355
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,590
Speaker 1: No, I actually I didn't think it was so funny.

356
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:24,228
Speaker 0: I think you're a broken hearted cold-hearted horrible person for not liking this.

357
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,114
Speaker 1: yeah I don't not like it.

358
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:27,758
Speaker 1: I just didn't find it that exciting.

359
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,982
Speaker 1: I think it was just kind of.

360
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,807
Speaker 0: so what do you find exciting?

361
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:31,850
Speaker 1: Oh?

362
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,226
Speaker 1: You want to know the secret all right?

363
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:34,689
Speaker 0: What do you got?

364
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:37,670
Speaker 1: Alright, so this thing it is alright.

365
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:40,841
Speaker 1: I'm not exactly sure what the history of this is.

366
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:58,273
Speaker 1: that I think is why it is so appealing and Exactly what that why this video exists and what it's trying to do, but it's Ronald McDonald speaking Japanese To some song and he's doing DDR hottest party on three side-by-side DDR mats.

367
00:24:58,755 --> 00:25:00,100
Speaker 0: oh man three mats.

368
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:01,967
Speaker 1: I wish I could play three mad DDR.

369
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:03,775
Speaker 0: That'll be something I know we both could.

370
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:07,150
Speaker 0: I wish I could set it up so where we could actually do it.

371
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,450
Speaker 1: You know what I'd like more than you know what I'd like more than that a DDR machine.

372
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,042
Speaker 1: No two by two mats to make a format square with screens on all sides.

373
00:25:15,063 --> 00:25:16,105
Speaker 0: It was even better than that.

374
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:20,447
Speaker 0: what a dance floor Techno DJ.

375
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:35,275
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is uh it's pretty interesting, and I realized number one way to cheat at DDR clown shoes Especially with double mats.

376
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:37,883
Speaker 1: I know right there's double mats and clown shoes.

377
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,450
Speaker 1: you could hit two arrows at once with one foot with ease.

378
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,657
Speaker 1: It's diggity with the clown shoes, so You know if you want to if you want to win.

379
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,546
Speaker 1: It's some too mad DDR.

380
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:48,530
Speaker 1: Just get some clown shoes.

381
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:49,244
Speaker 1: It's real easy.

382
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:53,010
Speaker 1: You can you can stand up for you can say you could literally with clown shoes.

383
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:57,514
Speaker 1: You could just if you're doing single mat DDR Standard DDR.

384
00:25:57,775 --> 00:26:02,369
Speaker 1: you could just put the clown shoes on and then just jump up and down really fast and pass the hardest on.

385
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:16,794
Speaker 1: So we've done a lot of shows You know Reviewing different board games or telling you about the rules or how they work and stuff and there's a lot of other Podcasts and things out there that do this, and you know we thought hey It hasn't really.

386
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,645
Speaker 1: no one's really done this yet at least not at a big scale of.

387
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:27,677
Speaker 1: you know actually telling you Strategy and how to win at games, and this is exactly what you do to play this game the best It can be played.

388
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:33,250
Speaker 1: and I guess for video games It's sort of hard to do that because we don't have the visuals necessary for a video game.

389
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,795
Speaker 1: You know and we don't have the.

390
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:52,970
Speaker 1: you know game facts sort of covers a lot of the the games that are just you know Sort of puzzle solution games, and maybe we could do like Street Fighter stuff But you really need to see pictures for that too, so but for board games We can pretty much just talk about strategy and how to win and you don't really need to see that much.

391
00:26:53,232 --> 00:27:03,225
Speaker 1: You know maybe if it's a game like Tigris and Euphrates or go or chess you need to see the patterns, but for other games You don't really need to see any patterns or anything.

392
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:06,269
Speaker 1: we could just tell you how to win And that's what we're gonna try to do here.

393
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:20,056
Speaker 0: Yeah Now plus part of the reason we're doing this is that At some point in the near future Scott are gonna buy a camera and we want to start making just videos that show you how to be really good at board games like T&E in Puerto Rico and Gotta figure out how well this works.

394
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:23,690
Speaker 0: and settlers is such a simple game to basically beat that.

395
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:25,296
Speaker 0: What other game could we do first?

396
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:28,609
Speaker 0: maybe I guess Carcassonne, which is easily all right?

397
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,538
Speaker 1: Carcassonne you kind of need to see though.

398
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:34,778
Speaker 0: yeah, but in terms of simplicity of explaining how to win There's not so much to say.

399
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:35,120
Speaker 1: I think.

400
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,729
Speaker 1: guess who would be easier to explain?

401
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:39,189
Speaker 0: Ask if he's wearing glasses.

402
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:46,113
Speaker 1: Okay maybe maybe Yahtzee Actually battleship.

403
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:48,844
Speaker 0: We could just tell you what the search algorithm will work best.

404
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:50,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway.

405
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,258
Speaker 1: So we're gonna.

406
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,550
Speaker 1: we're gonna tell you how to win at settlers.

407
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:58,770
Speaker 1: I'm gonna see if that's interesting and we're gonna first of all we're gonna assume you already know how to play settlers of Catan.

408
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:04,129
Speaker 1: If you don't already know how to play settlers of Catan Then why you listen this show you got to learn how to play before you learn how to win.

409
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:08,070
Speaker 0: Well at the same time just log on to your Xbox and start playing some settlers.

410
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:09,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd you should.

411
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:14,150
Speaker 0: settlers is a fantastic game until you solve it and even then it's still not horribly unfun.

412
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:24,030
Speaker 1: No, all right, so First rule of settlers of Catan right is when you're starting the game The first thing you have to do is sort of put your initial settlements out there, right?

413
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,952
Speaker 1: Now when you're putting the initial settlements You know what where you go, you know Either are.

414
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:30,575
Speaker 1: you are there.

415
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:41,326
Speaker 1: you're gonna be the guy who puts out the first settlement ever and then the last one or you know the rules, right Basically on each of the numbers on the board because each resource spot has a number on it.

416
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,169
Speaker 1: There is some dots.

417
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:47,028
Speaker 1: More dots means that that space is more likely to be rolled.

418
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:51,386
Speaker 0: the six The dots are basically just if you don't know enough statistics to know the odds on 2d6 exactly.

419
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,012
Speaker 1: So six and eight have five dots and they're red because those are going to be the most frequently rolled statistically.

420
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:02,985
Speaker 1: after that comes you're like nine and five and then you know four and three.

421
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:08,070
Speaker 1: so you want to put your Settlement touching as many dots as possible.

422
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,230
Speaker 1: So this is a spot where you can put it where it's next to a six and a four and a ten.

423
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,537
Speaker 1: That's a pretty damn good spot.

424
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:17,685
Speaker 1: I mean the ten has what like three dots, right?

425
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:19,030
Speaker 1: The four has four dots.

426
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,247
Speaker 0: The thing is in terms of positioning in the early part of the game.

427
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,043
Speaker 0: now It doesn't matter when you go.

428
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:32,940
Speaker 0: other than that If you go last you have a special option of being able to know exactly where both of your settlements will go Mm-hmm, but generally you care about the dots more than anything.

429
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,595
Speaker 0: and if you're gonna win it settlers on average and in general When in doubt go for more dots.

430
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:39,537
Speaker 0: more dots can.

431
00:29:39,598 --> 00:29:44,050
Speaker 0: you can never go wrong with more dots except an extremely specific and obvious situation.

432
00:29:44,492 --> 00:30:00,086
Speaker 0: However, if the difference between a good loadout of Resources and a crappy loadout of resources is one or at most maybe two dots different You might want to edge toward picking the resource spot based on resource.

433
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,270
Speaker 0: They give you as opposed to number.

434
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:01,552
Speaker 0: Yeah,

435
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:17,070
Speaker 1: I wouldn't sacrifice more than two dots But let's say I can choose to go here where there's you know, twelve dots or I can go there for ten dots But I'll have brick then that might be worth it Especially, you know depending on how late you're putting your settlement out if you can see where other people's settlements already are.

436
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:20,000
Speaker 1: Maybe not a lot of people are on brick.

437
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:24,085
Speaker 1: So it'll be much more valuable to go on a brick that's you know a little bit more likely.

438
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:27,864
Speaker 1: or Maybe you'll be a little closer to a very useful port.

439
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:32,284
Speaker 1: or maybe you know Your first settlement is really trapped by other people's settlements.

440
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:33,710
Speaker 1: You're not gonna be able to build any roads.

441
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:44,970
Speaker 1: So really you're not gonna be able to win if you don't put your second settlement somewhere that you can build a lot of roads Even though you get less dots, but I wouldn't sacrifice one more than one or two dots and it shouldn't be necessary too.

442
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:54,336
Speaker 0: If you're playing properly, yeah I mean there are crazy situations like let's say you go last and there's a spot that gets a ton of sheep and nothing else And a sheep port.

443
00:30:54,817 --> 00:31:04,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the weather one is taken exactly in the worst case scenario would be Basically, every other player puts their settlements in a way to fuck you horribly Sometimes which could happen.

444
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:12,883
Speaker 1: but in that case they'd pretty much have to detriment themselves Leaving a really great space wide open for you and you just take that.

445
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:21,551
Speaker 0: and so now before we get into I mean the exact specifics of placing that I think the the main discussion here is what are the strategies of settlers?

446
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:24,603
Speaker 0: because we can talk about the mechanics of like.

447
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:31,990
Speaker 0: there are certain things that are that are Universal to all strategies like how to deal with trading when to go after stiffy cards when to go after whatever.

448
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,728
Speaker 0: but the the fundamental thing about settlers that advanced players will think about and novice players don't.

449
00:31:37,748 --> 00:31:40,035
Speaker 0: so much as What direction are you going to go?

450
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:47,384
Speaker 0: and there are effectively only three viable strategies in settlers of Catan and there are minor variations on these strategies.

451
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:56,410
Speaker 0: and Looking at the board and looking at where you can place You have to decide which of these you want and not let up and not change for the rest of the game.

452
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,310
Speaker 0: If you try to change strategies midstream, you're done.

453
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:02,838
Speaker 0: Now the strategies basically boil down to the.

454
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:10,611
Speaker 0: there's a little people call them different names, but there's a brick and wood grain and sheep and Tripod.

455
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:13,361
Speaker 1: well tripod is sort of a set.

456
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:15,570
Speaker 1: is it sort of goes along with either one of the two?

457
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,259
Speaker 0: The thing is they're kind of like tripod.

458
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:23,610
Speaker 0: tripod is special in that What it where you place and what you do is not dependent upon what resources you want.

459
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:27,494
Speaker 1: You know, you sort of need some brick and woods to do it But very little because you can trade.

460
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:31,686
Speaker 0: tripod is basically the strategy of go for dots and nothing else.

461
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:35,619
Speaker 0: get whatever resources you can No matter what they are because more resources always better.

462
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:38,770
Speaker 1: and with tripod you're gonna be building more settlements and fewer roads.

463
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,634
Speaker 1: So you're gonna want to try to get a more of a spread on the resources You're gonna need.

464
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:47,522
Speaker 1: you know, cuz a settlement requires a brick One of each one of four, right?

465
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:48,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't need stone.

466
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,698
Speaker 1: Yeah It doesn't need stone but it needs one of everything else.

467
00:32:50,980 --> 00:33:06,095
Speaker 0: and then the brick and wood strategy is Basically you want to start getting a lot of brick and wood and you don't really care about much else and you use the brick And wood to expand out all over the board as fast as you can and cut other players off from key areas that you're then Going to build it.

468
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:06,276
Speaker 0: Yep.

469
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,633
Speaker 1: That also gets you the longest road Which is very.

470
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:18,276
Speaker 1: something is very important in the game is that you know You're playing on this in this game and the way to get points is to build settlements build cities longest road and Biggest army.

471
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:23,284
Speaker 1: if you're not going for either Longest road or biggest army, you're not gonna win.

472
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:24,390
Speaker 1: You need one of the two to win.

473
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,539
Speaker 1: I've never seen someone win without one of those two.

474
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,090
Speaker 0: I have but not when every player is experienced, right?

475
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,210
Speaker 0: You know, well think of it this way.

476
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,270
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna give these strategies to you from the perspective of you're playing against suboptimal players.

477
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,690
Speaker 0: If you follow our advice, you're probably going to win every time.

478
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,552
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

479
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:47,575
Speaker 1: if you follow what we say and you do it correctly then you will beat people who do not do this pretty much Statistically most of the time.

480
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:54,025
Speaker 1: if you're playing if everyone playing is following these strategies Then the game is gonna come down to chance.

481
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:54,849
Speaker 1: pretty much.

482
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,972
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the.

483
00:33:55,992 --> 00:34:01,689
Speaker 0: the example is I entered a sanctioned official settlers of Catan tournament round one where everyone's in.

484
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,936
Speaker 0: I Won by like seven points.

485
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:06,125
Speaker 0: everyone just sucked like horribly and I didn't.

486
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:09,982
Speaker 0: and the next round I still won by a lot, but there were other players who were good.

487
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:17,688
Speaker 0: the third round It was literally every player was pretty much exactly equal in skill and it was totally random who won.

488
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:21,449
Speaker 0: and The fourth round it was perfectly random.

489
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:29,752
Speaker 0: It was literally without any exaggeration the player across from me one with ten points the player to their Around.

490
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:34,810
Speaker 0: the next player would have no matter what gotten their tenth point on that round.

491
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:41,250
Speaker 0: I would have gotten my tenth point on that round and the other player would have gotten the tenth point on that round.

492
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:48,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the odds were really nice and even out but you could have been paired with one of those people that you played The final game with in the first round.

493
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:48,719
Speaker 1: Yep.

494
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,643
Speaker 1: I guess you just didn't.

495
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:52,588
Speaker 1: yeah luckily But yeah.

496
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:59,423
Speaker 0: So in that case because the thing is the way it was it was soft Elimination where the bottom two players were eliminated from the first round.

497
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:00,265
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

498
00:35:00,486 --> 00:35:01,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not bad.

499
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,410
Speaker 0: So it wasn't that there's a pretty good way to do it.

500
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,885
Speaker 0: But that was when I realized that settlers is random among skilled players.

501
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:18,257
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm All right, so but then the other strategy is the the stone and sheep strategies alternately known the city stiffy Strategy, yep You can either real.

502
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:23,830
Speaker 1: if you if you try to get lots of bricks and woods Then you're gonna build lots of roads and process a lot more settlements.

503
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,814
Speaker 1: If you try to get more rocks and grains and sheep You're gonna be able to build.

504
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:32,650
Speaker 1: upgrade to your cities getting more rocks and grains and sheep getting a lot of stiffy cards.

505
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,209
Speaker 1: Oh, but stiffy cards are development cards, but you're not cool unless you come stiffy guys.

506
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:43,190
Speaker 1: That's what they're called in German I guess but I think it's because the original German the development.

507
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,194
Speaker 1: They were really thick.

508
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,603
Speaker 1: They were printed on very heavy card stock.

509
00:35:46,964 --> 00:35:48,470
Speaker 1: So people called them stiffy cards.

510
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:50,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, yes.

511
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:56,991
Speaker 1: So if you get lots of stiffy cards, you can then use those, you know to get the largest army and also to win the Game.

512
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:02,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically the brick and wood lets you expand a lot But you're not gonna get a lot of cities and you just have to expand.

513
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,816
Speaker 0: block other players build as many settlements as you can The the and you'll get longest road.

514
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:15,211
Speaker 0: the sheep and stiffy strategy is you're gonna get the largest army and you're gonna have all these Cards, which are gonna help you with the fact that you don't have a lot of brick and wood like.

515
00:36:15,231 --> 00:36:20,468
Speaker 0: hopefully I get road building or something, but even if you don't you'll be able to trade and get a board or something.

516
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:23,157
Speaker 0: and Tripod is the generic.

517
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,108
Speaker 0: this strategy will always work.

518
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, tripod means that you build a settlement right.

519
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,650
Speaker 1: you ignore resources.

520
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:33,690
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to build another settlement within one space.

521
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:38,346
Speaker 1: So what you do is you build two roads and then you build another settlement.

522
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:45,150
Speaker 0: and then well, no No, you build one road and then from that one road you branch out in both directions with a road.

523
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,955
Speaker 1: That's what I was about to say.

524
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:48,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you build a settlement on each of each of those.

525
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,015
Speaker 1: So basically you have three settlements.

526
00:36:50,637 --> 00:37:02,668
Speaker 1: each settlement has one road pointing inwards and those three roads meet each other So that you can get the most settlements in the least amount of space, you know Normally, you'd have to build a settlement two roads a settlement two roads a settlement.

527
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:06,985
Speaker 1: here You can build three settlements with three roads pointing all pointing at each other.

528
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:12,890
Speaker 0: now the drawback obviously is one You're not gonna get longest road and two you're gonna be building settlements in suboptimal places.

529
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:24,410
Speaker 1: Yeah But because you have so many settlements and you're not really competing to fight for a lot of territory on the board You're saving a lot of territory and you're saving a lot of resources not having to build extra roads.

530
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:41,770
Speaker 1: All those extra settlements are a lot of extra points and you're gonna get you know, even though you won't get a quantity of resources you're gonna do above average because you're gonna be having you know, all these settlements over the place and just keep doing it and You know, it puts you in a really strong position in the game.

531
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,479
Speaker 1: You build a lot of stuff and then you just kind of win.

532
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,987
Speaker 0: now these three strategies.

533
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:49,650
Speaker 0: you might say Hey, I thought you said this game was kind of random, but look there's three strategies and they do well have pros and cons.

534
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,657
Speaker 0: I mean tripods kind of like the.

535
00:37:52,099 --> 00:38:06,130
Speaker 0: I'm going to march slowly toward the end and no one can stop me and brick and wood is a really strong early game, but stiffy sheep has a really strong late game, but The problem is you really don't have any choice in which strategy you use.

536
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:17,070
Speaker 0: And the reason I say that is that You don't choose your strategy going into the game and then try to put your pieces where you can enact that strategy Based on when you go in the order of placing settlements.

537
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:29,870
Speaker 0: You have to look right now what your options are what the board looks like and from there decide Opportunistically which of those three strategies is the best tactically for you based on the current situation, right?

538
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,182
Speaker 1: So if I'm putting my initial settlements down and the spot there's a spot with a whole bunch of dots That's open like I'd like.

539
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:39,650
Speaker 1: maybe you know Like for kidding more than 14. that like a whole lot of dots not 14.

540
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,608
Speaker 1: I have a whole lot of dots like it's got a six in a five and a nine.

541
00:38:43,648 --> 00:38:48,456
Speaker 1: It's huge it's a great spot right and It's got rock rock grain under it.

542
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:53,770
Speaker 1: Guess what my strategy is gonna be lots of cities and lots of stiffy cards.

543
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:58,078
Speaker 0: Yep, and beyond that I mean you really just have to look at the.

544
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:05,310
Speaker 0: I mean the only other real concern in terms of strategy and placement is simply Is there going to be a resource or a commodity that's going to be ultra rare?

545
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:08,668
Speaker 0: but again because of the way placement goes don't have a lot of choice.

546
00:39:08,728 --> 00:39:12,737
Speaker 0: because Sir, if you get to play first Then you got to play your second settlement last.

547
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:15,910
Speaker 0: you can have one good spot and almost no control over your second spot.

548
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:17,630
Speaker 0: So you got to play a more conservative game.

549
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:21,493
Speaker 0: but you'll offset that by having one really good settlement and The old.

550
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:29,570
Speaker 0: and although you also have to look at in terms of dots This is a very much a secondary concern, but you do want to keep an eye on where other players have placed.

551
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:38,349
Speaker 0: I mean, oh if you're thinking well, I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna be brick and wood So right away, I'm gonna blitz a road out and get that sheet port over there.

552
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:40,578
Speaker 0: That's a really crappy idea.

553
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:44,875
Speaker 0: If anyone else is also gonna go after that sheet port and is also doing brick and wood You can't rely on it.

554
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, you basically want to sort of avoid Competition.

555
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:56,748
Speaker 1: there's enough resources in the game for you to get ahead without having to fight anyone else for the things you need.

556
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,870
Speaker 1: and If you want if you think oh, well, I can expend resources to maybe fuck someone else.

557
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,836
Speaker 1: well maybe you can.

558
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:10,010
Speaker 1: but if you do that and It's the only way to do that really is if you're going for longest road and you can build roads to sort of block people.

559
00:40:10,352 --> 00:40:13,890
Speaker 1: But other than that trying to screw people use the robber.

560
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,847
Speaker 1: Yeah No There's no other way to do it.

561
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,860
Speaker 1: Really that is not gonna hurt you in the long run.

562
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:28,356
Speaker 1: if you try to screw people a different way like taking something they need That you don't particularly need Then you're just gonna hurt yourself and someone else is gonna win besides the two of you Especially in the opening placement.

563
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:29,140
Speaker 0: never think.

564
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,816
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll go here because that denies him the blah Cuz one.

565
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,430
Speaker 0: if it's a good spot someone else would go there.

566
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,615
Speaker 0: Anyway, you don't have to worry about it.

567
00:40:35,037 --> 00:40:37,790
Speaker 0: and number two only go the place that is best for you.

568
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,207
Speaker 0: Don't worry about hurting some other player because everyone's gonna place optimally or they're dumb.

569
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,624
Speaker 1: Yep Now that I mentioned the robber.

570
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:46,032
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the robber All right.

571
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:53,121
Speaker 0: Now if people have cute little rules about the robber like house rules like oh, well It's traditional for everyone to bribe whoever gets the robber.

572
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:58,923
Speaker 0: or you don't put the robber on the first round Or you put the robber somewhere where it won't hurt anyone and everyone plays nice.

573
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:03,705
Speaker 0: if you want to win at this game One there is no robber leeway.

574
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:04,470
Speaker 0: That's a house rule.

575
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,417
Speaker 0: Yep, you robbers in play right away.

576
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:11,742
Speaker 1: If you roll a seven if the seven is the first role of the entire game Robber goes that's it.

577
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:12,650
Speaker 1: That's how the game works.

578
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:12,931
Speaker 0: now.

579
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:22,145
Speaker 0: if you're playing with a house rule fine, you have to follow the house rule if everyone else agrees and Beyond that it doesn't matter because if you roll the robber you can accept bribes.

580
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:23,208
Speaker 0: You can do whatever you want.

581
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:28,270
Speaker 0: However Do not ever not fuck someone with the robber.

582
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:34,170
Speaker 0: Put the robber in the place that hurts the most the player who needs hurting the most every time.

583
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have pity.

584
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,070
Speaker 0: don't think oh, I should be fair.

585
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:44,350
Speaker 0: Just if you keep rolling sevens keep putting them on the lead players like forest and now you have the only wood in the game.

586
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:47,218
Speaker 1: Yep put it where you can do the most damage.

587
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:51,935
Speaker 1: if someone is in second place right behind you and the other people have way less Points than you do like.

588
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:56,437
Speaker 1: if I have the longest road and rim has the largest army and I get the robber I gotta fuck rim.

589
00:41:56,477 --> 00:41:57,341
Speaker 1: So I look on the board.

590
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:59,090
Speaker 1: Where can I fuck rim the hardest?

591
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,750
Speaker 1: Oh, look, he's got a wood factory and I've got a wood factory.

592
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:04,970
Speaker 1: That's the only wood in the game and he's got two settlements in that wood factory.

593
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:08,541
Speaker 1: I'm gonna rob and I'm gonna take a resource from rim, you know.

594
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:11,490
Speaker 1: also pay attention to what resources people have.

595
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,701
Speaker 1: You don't need to remember exactly.

596
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:17,765
Speaker 1: It's not really that useful But remember it's sort of what people have like if someone just rolled.

597
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:22,165
Speaker 1: if you just roll the six You know last turn that means that so-and-so has a lot of rock.

598
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,682
Speaker 1: if you need rock Maybe you should rob them to get rock.

599
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:27,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, the odds are pretty good.

600
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:33,350
Speaker 0: You can always play the bribe because inexperienced players will often do the bribe now first of all for experienced players.

601
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:36,406
Speaker 0: Never ever bribe anyone you'll never gain.

602
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:37,029
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

603
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:39,035
Speaker 0: No I mean totally a waste of your resource.

604
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:39,838
Speaker 1: think about how stupid.

605
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:42,005
Speaker 1: if they robbed you they take one resource.

606
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,761
Speaker 1: if you bribe them You give them at least one resource.

607
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:51,100
Speaker 1: It's basically you're saying don't rob me I'll rob myself to prevent you from robbing me now.

608
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:57,608
Speaker 0: instead if someone other player is foolish and decides to bribe you Take the bribe and then screw someone else because now you've screwed two people.

609
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,956
Speaker 0: Yep And that's pretty much.

610
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:01,667
Speaker 0: it do as much damage with the robbers.

611
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:03,950
Speaker 0: you can Always, okay.

612
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:12,502
Speaker 1: And here's another strategy because the with the sniffy cards right the sniffy cards you can get our soldiers vast majority of them Right, if you get a soldier, you're gonna.

613
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:16,769
Speaker 1: if you're going for largest army You're gonna be using lots of soldiers every time you use one.

614
00:43:17,412 --> 00:43:20,444
Speaker 1: Move the robbers somewhere and use them just like we said to fuck someone the hardest.

615
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:25,242
Speaker 0: now remember there is a rule a lot of People forget you can on your turn before you roll the dice.

616
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:29,470
Speaker 0: if you have a soldier card Play it to move the robber.

617
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:39,090
Speaker 0: So if the robbers on you don't play the soldier before you roll the dice to move them off your stuff Then roll the dice and if you roll a seven you get to rob twice in the same turn.

618
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:39,687
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

619
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:52,010
Speaker 0: Also and in terms of the soldier cards if you were going for largest army Or you think you might go for largest army Pretty much as soon as you get a soldier play it immediately because remember you can only play one card per turn.

620
00:43:52,831 --> 00:44:01,377
Speaker 0: Already having a soldier out before other players do gives you a huge advantage because when it comes the longest road in largest army Ties go to the defender.

621
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:04,190
Speaker 0: You want to be the first one out there the first one with stuff.

622
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:10,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if I have three soldiers and then rim plays his third soldier I keep the largest army until he plays a fourth one.

623
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:19,689
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're not going for a largest army If you've decided you are not going to pursue that at all don't play the soldier until you need to.

624
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:24,410
Speaker 1: yeah Play the soldier pretty much on your turn before you roll when the robber is on you.

625
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,857
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you know that will.

626
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,630
Speaker 1: basically it's always good to hold on to one soldier.

627
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:35,549
Speaker 1: Anyway, even if you're going for largest army because then you can always if you get robbed You can move the soldier you robber off right away

628
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:35,690
Speaker 0: but

629
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,433
Speaker 1: only

630
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:44,281
Speaker 0: hold on to it if you already have one n plus one soldiers out there and Number of soldiers any other player has

631
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:44,904
Speaker 1: exactly.

632
00:44:44,924 --> 00:44:51,210
Speaker 0: All right In terms of the other stiffy cards, I think it's pretty obvious when to use them it is.

633
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:53,168
Speaker 1: However, there's a trick with monopoly.

634
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:58,410
Speaker 1: now The monopoly trick only works against moron players who don't haven't played the game and have no experience.

635
00:44:58,511 --> 00:44:59,809
Speaker 1: So it's not gonna work against us.

636
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,504
Speaker 1: but the monopoly card the way it works is you.

637
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:10,290
Speaker 1: basically you say Monopoly on rock or monopoly on wood and everyone in the game has to give you all of their rock or all of their wood.

638
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:13,010
Speaker 1: Right, so that's really good.

639
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:18,149
Speaker 1: If you need a specific resource and you don't have it and you know Other people have a lot of it then you can do that, right?

640
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,394
Speaker 1: Now the problem the thing is you have to make sure you don't use it on something No one else has like.

641
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:26,508
Speaker 1: don't say monopoly on rock when there's only one rock out there.

642
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:30,684
Speaker 1: wait And then a whole bunch of people rolled up a whole bunch of rock and they haven't used it yet.

643
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:32,189
Speaker 1: then monopoly on rock, right?

644
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,699
Speaker 0: Another thing the the the special strategy.

645
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:36,422
Speaker 1: I'm almost there.

646
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:36,964
Speaker 1: I want to take cuz.

647
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:37,386
Speaker 1: it's so awesome?

648
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,420
Speaker 1: Okay, because it fools noobs every time.

649
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,023
Speaker 0: Yes, it does.

650
00:45:41,063 --> 00:45:42,330
Speaker 1: It does it fools noobs every time.

651
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:51,313
Speaker 1: The the real trick with monopoly is this Let's say I've got a lot of rock and I know that other people in the game need rock Right now.

652
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:57,350
Speaker 1: if they're dumbass players right who are noobs, they're gonna trade me their stuff for my rock.

653
00:45:57,471 --> 00:46:00,890
Speaker 1: I'm the only one with rock or I have a you know, a lot of rock and no one else does right?

654
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,600
Speaker 1: So I trade away my rock and get all the stuff I really need the wood and the sheep and the grain right.

655
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:10,595
Speaker 1: then I say monopoly on rock and they have to give me all the rock back and The coup de gras.

656
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:13,930
Speaker 0: if you do this, yeah, I think it's pretty much a law of the universe.

657
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:19,287
Speaker 0: You must immediately after you've taken all the rock say well anybody need rock.

658
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:23,650
Speaker 1: Yep Now you don't have to do with the rock you could you know?

659
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,459
Speaker 1: If you have wood and everyone in the game needs wood badly You can trade away all your wood.

660
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:29,310
Speaker 0: then monopoly the wizard needs wood bad.

661
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:37,256
Speaker 0: Then monopoly all the wood back after you trade it all away now in terms of trading because this is very important When you see most people.

662
00:46:37,276 --> 00:46:40,849
Speaker 0: the fun of settlers is you know trading and negotiating and whatever.

663
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:47,474
Speaker 0: but you'll find and especially like in tournament player among experienced players people don't trade a lot and The rule for trading.

664
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:54,353
Speaker 0: there are two rules of trading and if you're going to win at settlers follow these rules 100%.

665
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,864
Speaker 1: yes, if you trade see the thing is part of the fun of settlers.

666
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,690
Speaker 1: is all the trading action in the bargaining?

667
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:04,678
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing is in reality Bargaining is not a good idea.

668
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:13,630
Speaker 1: so much if you're a settler if you want a bargaining game play dude Oh, if you want a bargaining game play traders of Genoa Which is a game of bargaining where you can't win without bargaining.

669
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:20,430
Speaker 0: But unless one of the following two conditions is true do not ever trade with anyone under any circumstances ever.

670
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,129
Speaker 0: It will never ever ever be a good idea.

671
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:26,207
Speaker 1: Trading is always almost always a bad idea.

672
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:26,650
Speaker 1: in settlers.

673
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,162
Speaker 1: If you trade you will lose except in these conditions.

674
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:41,523
Speaker 1: now condition number one is if You rip someone off exactly if I'm trading someone like a wood for three sheep Yeah, that's gonna be a good trade for me and a bad trade for them.

675
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:43,871
Speaker 1: Hooray do that It.

676
00:47:44,232 --> 00:47:49,326
Speaker 1: but if someone's ripping you off or if they're making an even trade don't do it now.

677
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:53,720
Speaker 0: ripping off pretty much means either Getting more resource cards than you gave the other person.

678
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:54,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

679
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,610
Speaker 0: Oh and even then that's not always a good ripoff.

680
00:47:57,051 --> 00:48:06,994
Speaker 0: Or if you know or you're pretty sure but you should know if you're keeping track of everything that the card you were giving To the other player will not help them nearly as much as the card They're giving you.

681
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:09,430
Speaker 0: Yes, in which case they made the mistake of trading with you.

682
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,072
Speaker 0: They shouldn't have.

683
00:48:10,132 --> 00:48:17,634
Speaker 1: yeah, unless you are super confident that you are getting a way better deal than the other person Don't trade at all.

684
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:17,875
Speaker 0: Now.

685
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:28,370
Speaker 0: The only other circumstance where an even trade would be acceptable is if You're trading with you're basically gonna be a kingmaker but the reverse kind of kingmaker.

686
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:42,350
Speaker 1: Yep trading with the last place player exactly if you're in first place Right and you make an even trade with the last place player or even a slightly disadvantaged a disadvantageous trade with the last place player You're helping out the guy in last place.

687
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:54,330
Speaker 1: He's not gonna come up and beat you even if you help him out as though as long as it helps you a little bit That's a good trade as long you know Of course if it's a trade you could have made with a with a port or you know.

688
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,963
Speaker 1: But with the four to one don't do that with a player.

689
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:58,390
Speaker 1: use a port or something, you know.

690
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:59,608
Speaker 1: No point in helping anyone else.

691
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,978
Speaker 0: Yep unless that you know a player is not going to win.

692
00:49:01,998 --> 00:49:02,259
Speaker 0: if you're.

693
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:14,355
Speaker 0: if there is one person in your group who you know is Not going to win this game trade with them as much as you can but don't trade with anyone else Right and that way even though you help someone out they're not gonna win.

694
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:16,649
Speaker 1: and you got helped out a bunch and now you're gonna win.

695
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:24,693
Speaker 0: and And When in doubt always use a port instead of trading with the player if you think it's if if you can't find a way to Rip someone off.

696
00:49:24,774 --> 00:49:32,750
Speaker 1: I mean if I have a port that lets me turn two sheep into anything I want right and someone else is gonna say hey, I'll trade you anything you want for two sheep.

697
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:39,670
Speaker 1: I could either give two sheep to another player to get a brick or give two sheep to the bank to get a brick.

698
00:49:39,781 --> 00:49:44,630
Speaker 1: Yes What two sheep to the bank to get a brick is the same for me and it doesn't help someone else by giving them two.

699
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:47,140
Speaker 1: It's obviously a better move now.

700
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:55,867
Speaker 0: if every player is smart enough to follow these rules then basically there's gonna be no trading going on in the game pretty much or Everyone's going to be trading with the last place player.

701
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:55,947
Speaker 0: Yes

702
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:12,245
Speaker 1: I mean if you have three awesome players and one crappy player then what generally happens is everyone sort of fights to see who can take advantage of the crappy player the most and It's sort of a sad thing and this is why the game loses a lot of its fun But everyone's really good at it because there's not so much trading going on

703
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:12,949
Speaker 0: now.

704
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,102
Speaker 0: That's largely all you need to know.

705
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:22,401
Speaker 0: to be a badass at settlers I mean beyond that Get resources buy what you can.

706
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:25,170
Speaker 0: in general you want to buy things and expand as quickly as possible.

707
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,235
Speaker 0: If you can build a settlement You probably want to build it.

708
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:37,070
Speaker 0: if you're racing someone else to get to the good spot Get there before them and get there before that like do whatever you can to ensure that you get there before them.

709
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:43,532
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean always make sure that you have at least one spot that's you know has a road where you can build a new Settlement.

710
00:50:43,553 --> 00:50:49,524
Speaker 1: you probably want to you know, if you can't it's like if you have enough to build a settlement But you don't have a road that will let you build one.

711
00:50:49,565 --> 00:51:00,210
Speaker 1: build that road quickly You know, you don't want to hang around, you know with all this settlement, you know I guess if you have enough for a settlement you have enough for a road, you know Cuz you need the other brick in the wood, but you know always make sure that at any moment.

712
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:03,110
Speaker 1: What if you happen to roll up enough stuff for you to build a settlement?

713
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,564
Speaker 1: You don't want to have to spend a turn building a road and then the settlement next turn.

714
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,770
Speaker 1: you want to go settlement right away.

715
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,350
Speaker 1: You know make sure you have always a settlement.

716
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:11,054
Speaker 1: That's not a city.

717
00:51:11,074 --> 00:51:15,377
Speaker 1: yet in case you get enough stuff to turn something into a city You can't if you have all cities.

718
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:17,385
Speaker 1: Well, you can't build another city.

719
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:18,470
Speaker 1: You need to build a settlement first.

720
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,730
Speaker 1: So, you know do stuff in the order to never leave yourself in a situation.

721
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:27,190
Speaker 1: We have the resources to buy something but you can't actually buy it because you're not set up to do it.

722
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:36,584
Speaker 0: Yep now once you've determined what strategy you're using and you're following all this other advice in terms of enacting them if You're doing the sticky sheep or you know, the rock.

723
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:40,376
Speaker 0: whatever the endgame strategy You pretty much you're you want to.

724
00:51:40,436 --> 00:51:42,181
Speaker 0: if you can build a settlement.

725
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:45,937
Speaker 0: whenever you can build a settlement with that strategy do it No matter what.

726
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:52,003
Speaker 0: build the settlement, but other than that You pretty much want to get cities and stiffy cards in fairly.

727
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:55,540
Speaker 0: eat like get them whenever you can whenever it's advantageous Before other players.

728
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,810
Speaker 1: you want to start buying stiffy card.

729
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,152
Speaker 0: You know what?

730
00:51:57,173 --> 00:51:59,269
Speaker 0: Yes, you want to buy the first stiffy card in the game?

731
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you want to have the first city in the game, which is very likely going to be a possibility.

732
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:04,422
Speaker 1: It's a good.

733
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:07,620
Speaker 0: it's a good deal And then from there you're not going to win.

734
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,226
Speaker 0: because remember there's hard and soft points.

735
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:15,700
Speaker 0: hard points are victory point cards Settlements and cities because those points cannot ever be taken away from you.

736
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:21,217
Speaker 1: and then there are soft points longest road largest army because you can Get largest army, but then someone could take it away from you.

737
00:52:21,237 --> 00:52:22,300
Speaker 1: So it's a soft point.

738
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:29,119
Speaker 0: now you can win with the Stiffy sheep strategy without getting largest army.

739
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:39,330
Speaker 0: However, the way to do that is to buy more stiffy cards and and Basically buy stiffy cards as much as you can and if you get victory point cards instead of soldiers.

740
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:43,530
Speaker 0: Don't worry so much about largest army and just hold on to those victory point.

741
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:46,525
Speaker 1: Victory point cards are great because you don't have.

742
00:52:46,565 --> 00:52:47,630
Speaker 1: you don't have to play them.

743
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,130
Speaker 1: You just hold them in your hand and then basically let's say I have six points on the board, right?

744
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:53,909
Speaker 1: And I'm holding some stiffy cards.

745
00:52:55,131 --> 00:53:00,250
Speaker 1: Smart players will realize I probably have some victory points in there But they don't know how much because some of them are one some of them are two.

746
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:08,686
Speaker 1: I could be holding a soldier to bluff which is a good idea sometimes, you know, and So it looks like I have six and other people probably have like eight or something at this point.

747
00:53:08,706 --> 00:53:17,490
Speaker 1: So they think I'm behind They might even make a trade with me or something if they're really dumb and then I just go Oh, look, I actually had like three points hiding up here.

748
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,722
Speaker 1: So I built one settlement and then I win.

749
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:24,969
Speaker 0: because remember The rule is you can only play one card per turn and you can't play the card that you bought that turn.

750
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,289
Speaker 0: Unless they're victory point cards that win you the game.

751
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:31,310
Speaker 1: Yep, then you can just play all of them at once.

752
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:43,177
Speaker 1: So just hold on to victory point cards don't play them and then at the end of the game When you as soon as you get ten points including those cards just flip them over and that that is no There's no point revealing information You don't have to reveal

753
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:43,440
Speaker 0: now.

754
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,466
Speaker 0: in general don't Scrimp and save and dump things into ports in order to make a little road and put a settlement somewhere.

755
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:55,790
Speaker 0: if you're doing this strategy Because the stiffy cards will carry you and you want the stiffy cards to carry you you'll have the largest army.

756
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get.

757
00:53:56,353 --> 00:53:56,655
Speaker 1: you get.

758
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:57,982
Speaker 1: you know, if you need something, you know.

759
00:53:58,022 --> 00:53:59,430
Speaker 1: occasionally you'll get the stiffy cards.

760
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:07,630
Speaker 0: unless you build a few roads or you get the one that lets you you're a plenty or you can just keep using the Robber and get stuff and then you get so many resources with your cities.

761
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:13,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, just keep robbing the people that have the bricks in the woods as you don't need a lot of other stuff to win.

762
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:20,277
Speaker 0: now with the brick and road strategy the brick and wood just Expand as fast as you can.

763
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:21,421
Speaker 0: do not build cities.

764
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:22,585
Speaker 0: Don't even go for cities.

765
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:23,730
Speaker 0: Don't buy stiffy cards.

766
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:30,150
Speaker 0: Just you have to build roads out and then put settlements on them as fast as you can.

767
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, just pretty much build road road road road road road road.

768
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,190
Speaker 1: and every time you're able to build a settlement build one and then Build roads every other chance.

769
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:46,590
Speaker 0: So if you're sitting there with a brick and wood build a road now if you're doing the brick and road Strategy and you're not gonna tripod with it It is this is one of the few times where it's kind of advantageous to to advantageous to fuck another player.

770
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:57,270
Speaker 0: Let's say I can build road road settlement or I can build road road road settlement and That's if I put the settlement in the third place.

771
00:54:57,371 --> 00:55:00,636
Speaker 0: It's equivalent in terms of what it gives me But it blocks another player.

772
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:09,048
Speaker 0: you probably want to do that because the brick and road strategy Involves being in everyone's way and preventing them from expanding.

773
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:14,170
Speaker 1: Yep I mean if you think about it, you cannot build a settlement within one space of another settlement.

774
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:24,910
Speaker 1: So put you since you're gonna be going around with a lot of roads and other people are gonna be moving kind of slowly You can really put your settlements in places that prevent people from being able to build settlements.

775
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:29,229
Speaker 1: You know you put your settlement one away, you know from the spot that some other guy wants.

776
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,488
Speaker 1: now He can't build anything there.

777
00:55:31,234 --> 00:55:33,649
Speaker 1: You got him or build it right in the spot that he wants.

778
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:36,745
Speaker 1: now He can't build it there and you can get it there faster than he can.

779
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:37,208
Speaker 1: so,

780
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:44,912
Speaker 0: haha Now beyond that don't buy stiffy cards, really They're not gonna help you that much unless you really really really have a good reason to you Unless

781
00:55:44,932 --> 00:55:47,670
Speaker 1: you just got like a bounty of resources from incredible luck

782
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:52,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're probably gonna win and you're really only gonna need probably one city and then everything else can just be settlements

783
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:53,592
Speaker 1: Yep.

784
00:55:54,315 --> 00:56:01,210
Speaker 1: Now the thing is if you're following all these things we're doing and you're doing it correctly You know, you're not screwing up and you're not winning.

785
00:56:01,712 --> 00:56:03,441
Speaker 1: That's because it's a game of luck.

786
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:09,370
Speaker 1: primarily most of the game, you know If everyone plays the way we just said it pretty much comes down to the roll of the dice.

787
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:12,966
Speaker 1: I mean, you know while sixes and eights are more likely to be rolled.

788
00:56:13,006 --> 00:56:13,810
Speaker 1: It's not necessary.

789
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:21,450
Speaker 1: I mean Someone has their settlement on a five and ten and no one else does and fives and tens just happen to be rolled a bunch.

790
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:25,927
Speaker 1: That person's probably gonna win and it's not do any fault of you know, strategy or tactic.

791
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:26,770
Speaker 1: It's just the dice.

792
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:28,476
Speaker 1: Yep, that's how the game goes.

793
00:56:28,536 --> 00:56:32,450
Speaker 1: It's it's a semi mostly random game when you get down to the bottom of it.

794
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,965
Speaker 1: So don't be upset if you lose even though you were playing the best you could.

795
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:37,210
Speaker 1: cuz that's just how it goes.

796
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:37,853
Speaker 1: Nothing you could do.

797
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:38,658
Speaker 1: but it's not your fault.

798
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:39,985
Speaker 1: only be upset if you lose.

799
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:40,568
Speaker 1: cuz your fault.

800
00:56:42,092 --> 00:56:43,702
Speaker 1: Got any any other settler strategies?

801
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:44,084
Speaker 0: I don't know.

802
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:45,029
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty much it.

803
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:52,770
Speaker 0: I mean, unless anyone has a specific question You can ask us in the forums and we'll go into laborious excruciating detail about exactly what to do in that situation.

804
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:57,187
Speaker 1: But other than that, yeah, I mean that's that's how settlers of Catan goes.

805
00:56:57,388 --> 00:57:00,395
Speaker 1: I don't see It's not that complicated.

806
00:57:00,435 --> 00:57:04,406
Speaker 1: There's not much else you can do to do better at it than just said.

807
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:05,950
Speaker 0: there's no other strategy.

808
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:06,942
Speaker 0: I mean, there's there's.

809
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:12,925
Speaker 0: the Poison is in the other cup strategies of going like say no one puts their things around for.

810
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:19,419
Speaker 0: so you have settlement on four and in the early game, so alright if Statistically fours aren't rolled very often.

811
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:20,344
Speaker 0: You're not gonna win.

812
00:57:20,384 --> 00:57:21,430
Speaker 0: You're not gonna have any resources.

813
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:37,190
Speaker 0: But if I have fluke of the die as far as get rolled more often than statistically is expected You're probably going to win because every time that's rolled You're the only person getting reef resources But every time a six is rolled two people get resources or three people get resources, but that's not a strategy.

814
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:42,990
Speaker 0: That's just going for the like lower chance of happening, but the higher chance of winning if it does happen.

815
00:57:43,412 --> 00:57:46,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like, you know, it's it's like gambling.

816
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:47,490
Speaker 1: you can bet on.

817
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:57,010
Speaker 1: You know the the horse that's probably gonna win the Kentucky Derby and if you the odds are 50% of the time It's like you'll win, but you'll win very little or you can bet on that.

818
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,029
Speaker 1: You know long shot horse, then you might not win.

819
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:04,005
Speaker 1: But if the long shot horse gets ahead you win big and that's sort of like.

820
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:05,290
Speaker 1: that's sort of what he's talking about.

821
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,712
Speaker 0: But I mean beyond this strategy it's just.

822
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:08,737
Speaker 0: it's a game of tactics.

823
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,976
Speaker 0: and be as opportunistic as you can at every point you can and Because the game is simple enough.

824
00:58:13,016 --> 00:58:19,037
Speaker 0: There is usually an exactly perfect or Arbitrarily equivalent move to make at any given point

825
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:41,096
Speaker 1: and then at this the thing you just have to remember is that don't play nice You got to be a bastard and fuck everyone as hard as you can and try to win as hard as you can and that's that's True for pretty much every game and that's why I think a lot of people Some people don't like playing with us because we play to win and when someone's playing for fun against someone who plays to win It's not gonna be very fun.

826
00:58:41,478 --> 00:58:42,744
Speaker 0: Yep, like that.

827
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:44,190
Speaker 0: There was the game of end decker.

828
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,170
Speaker 0: I played with our friend Luke way back in the day and it was a good game.

829
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:52,666
Speaker 0: I eventually won that particular instance, but the way I won was basically by.

830
00:58:52,686 --> 00:59:13,807
Speaker 0: I Did a tricky maneuver and I did all-out attacked Luke who was currently winning to the point because I realized and this is a General strategy for all board games if you're in second place and you do something that attacks the front runner Taking points away from the front runner is Perfectly equivalent to giving yourself points.

831
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:20,561
Speaker 0: Yep So if you can do something that gives you a lot of points or do something that gives you a few points But takes a lot of points away from the front runner.
