1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,742
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 4th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:17,075
Speaker 0: Tonight, we discuss three new arcade games we ran afoul of in Wildwood.

3
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:23,550
Speaker 0: Dance Dance Revolution Supernova, House of the Dead 4, and Time Crisis 4.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,548
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

5
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,229
Speaker 0: And now Scott is back from the beach.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,134
Speaker 1: Lethargy is king.

7
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,870
Speaker 0: So, uh, how was your drive back from the beach?

8
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:38,337
Speaker 1: Uh, it was alright.

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:39,685
Speaker 0: Did anything happen?

10
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:40,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

11
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:42,050
Speaker 0: Uh, what happened?

12
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,118
Speaker 1: Why do we have to talk about this first?

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,910
Speaker 0: Uh, it's the leader bits, the stuff we talked about before we did the episode.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,830
Speaker 1: No, why do we have to- why can't we talk about some other things from the beach first?

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,457
Speaker 0: 'Cause I already talked about all that yesterday.

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,950
Speaker 1: You know, I spent a whole day there that you didn't spend.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

18
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,209
Speaker 0: In that day, you didn't go to the boardwalk.

19
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,559
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but we did other stuff.

20
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:00,586
Speaker 0: Alright, what do you got?

21
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:01,250
Speaker 0: You went to the bookstore.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,172
Speaker 1: Bookstore?

23
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:02,976
Speaker 0: You laid on the beach.

24
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,081
Speaker 1: Laid on the beach a whole lot.

25
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:05,690
Speaker 0: You played some mini golf that Adam won.

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,033
Speaker 1: Yeah, by two.

27
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:07,796
Speaker 0: Three.

28
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:09,000
Speaker 1: No, he won by two.

29
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:09,382
Speaker 0: Three.

30
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,225
Speaker 1: I have the scorecard.

31
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:11,048
Speaker 1: I'll go look at it again.

32
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:11,450
Speaker 1: Alright.

33
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,297
Speaker 1: And, uh, yeah.

34
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:15,482
Speaker 0: Oh, that's it.

35
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:16,868
Speaker 1: We ate some good food.

36
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:16,968
Speaker 1: Yeah.

37
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:18,909
Speaker 1: You know.

38
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,654
Speaker 1: That sort of stuff.

39
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,810
Speaker 1: We watched, um, what did we watch?

40
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,795
Speaker 1: We watched Buckaroo Banzai.

41
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:27,890
Speaker 0: Didn't you try to watch some, uh, horrible space movie, too?

42
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:32,350
Speaker 1: We watched- we tried to watch, like, this werewolf versus vampire movie.

43
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,677
Speaker 0: So, uh, what came of that?

44
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:45,023
Speaker 1: A couple people there didn't want to watch it, and, uh, we had trouble getting- it was black and white-ish, and the TV there shows red instead of black because there's something wrong with the contrast.

45
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:45,425
Speaker 1: I don't know.

46
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:51,270
Speaker 1: I couldn't fix it, even by adjusting all the color settings and the tint and everything, so we didn't watch it.

47
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,092
Speaker 1: And that was that.

48
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:55,043
Speaker 1: Lot of relaxification going on.

49
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,814
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you, uh, got another speeding ticket on the way home.

50
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:58,457
Speaker 1: Yep.

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,053
Speaker 1: But that's- see, the other time I got one, it was like, "Alright, you got

52
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:02,253
Speaker 1: me.".

53
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:09,024
Speaker 1: This time it was bullshit, and I'm gonna fight it, and it's not too far away to go to the court, so I'm gonna fight it tooth and nail.

54
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:15,014
Speaker 0: Yep, which is a good thing, at least in the fact that now we're going to have a lot of first-hand coverage of fighting things in traffic court.

55
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:18,068
Speaker 1: I mean, seriously, it's guilty until proven innocent.

56
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:18,510
Speaker 1: It's bullshit.

57
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:30,359
Speaker 1: And especially since I wasn't going as fast as the guy said I was, and I wasn't real- it's like, usually, if I'm, you know, zipping around, like, flooring it and going around cars, 'cause you see a lot of guys doing that.

58
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,110
Speaker 1: They'll get on your ass, they'll pass you on the right.

59
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,873
Speaker 1: It's usually me.

60
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:36,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll go down, they'll dodge between two cars, they'll keep going, you know?

61
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:40,308
Speaker 1: It's like, if I was doing that and I got pulled over, I'd be like, "Okay, you got

62
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:40,429
Speaker 1: me.".

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,088
Speaker 1: If I was just zooming and passing a million cars, they'd be like, "Okay, you got

64
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:44,188
Speaker 1: me.".

65
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,250
Speaker 1: I was just going, just cruising down the highway, the same as everyone else.

66
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,078
Speaker 1: However, technically- And the guy picked on me.

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,954
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, uh, technically, you're breaking the law.

68
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,683
Speaker 0: anyway, as much as I disagree with the law.

69
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,916
Speaker 0: And they can just pick who they want to pull over.

70
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:58,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

71
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,850
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember, it's an apocryphal tale, but it's a relevant one nonetheless.

72
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,350
Speaker 1: What really bothers me, though, is he said I was going 81 when I definitely was not.

73
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:07,835
Speaker 0: There's a decent chance.

74
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,700
Speaker 0: you were at some point.

75
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,470
Speaker 1: Probably for, like, a nanosecond.

76
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,279
Speaker 0: That's all he needs.

77
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,270
Speaker 1: I know, it's bullshit.

78
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,149
Speaker 0: But, I mean, you can't deny that you were, in fact, breaking the law.

79
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:15,912
Speaker 1: Yeah.

80
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,191
Speaker 1: You know, especially since it was- I thought it was 65.

81
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,479
Speaker 1: The guy was like, "Do you know the speed

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Speaker 1: limit?".

83
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,747
Speaker 1: And I'm like,

84
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:22,828
Speaker 1: "65.".

85
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,154
Speaker 1: And he's like, "You're wrong, sir.

86
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,247
Speaker 1: It's 55 miles an hour, blah blah blah blah

87
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:26,509
Speaker 1: blah.".

88
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,253
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

89
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:35,530
Speaker 0: Actually, if it was a 65 and you were still speeding at that rate, you would have been more screwed, because fines are all doubled and there's special things if you're in a 65 and speeding in New Jersey.

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,716
Speaker 1: Nah, New Jersey sucks.

91
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you do anything bad in a 65 zone, they just fuck you.

92
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:51,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna, you know- But in regards to why they pick on you, the classic apocryphal tale is a guy gets pulled over, and, you know, he's going 80 and everyone's going 80, and a cop pulls just him over.

93
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,767
Speaker 0: And while the cop's writing him a ticket, he asks, "Why'd you pull me over?

94
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:55,972
Speaker 0: Why didn't you put everyone else

95
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:56,253
Speaker 0: over?".

96
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:59,684
Speaker 0: And the cop says, "You ever been fishing,

97
00:03:59,704 --> 00:03:59,965
Speaker 0: boy?".

98
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:00,908
Speaker 0: And the kid says, "Uh,

99
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,394
Speaker 0: occasionally.".

100
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,648
Speaker 0: And the cop says, "You ever catch all the

101
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:04,890
Speaker 0: fish?".

102
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,827
Speaker 1: And the guy says, "Nope, but I throw the small ones

103
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:09,089
Speaker 1: back.".

104
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, in the real world, the cop says, "Hahaha, here's your

105
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:11,948
Speaker 0: ticket.".

106
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,551
Speaker 1: Yep.

107
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,322
Speaker 1: It was annoying because the guy was such a hard-ass.

108
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:20,274
Speaker 1: Like, some cops are nice, and they're like, "Hey, man.

109
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, I caught

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,420
Speaker 1: you.".

111
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,327
Speaker 1: And it's like, "All right.

112
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:23,728
Speaker 1: God

113
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:24,070
Speaker 1: damn.".

114
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,690
Speaker 1: This guy was like, it was like, I don't think, I think he was not a cop, but a robot.

115
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,158
Speaker 0: See, that does one thing.

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,610
Speaker 1: I think he had, like, the Miranda Mariah lights, like, scanned into him.

117
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,479
Speaker 0: He was RoboCop.

118
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was pretty much, like, RoboCop without the robot part.

119
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,318
Speaker 1: See, the thing is- Like, without the physical robot part.

120
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:48,617
Speaker 0: I don't want to disparage police officers, but with a few exceptions, I, every cop I've ever talked to- While they were on the job.

121
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:51,151
Speaker 1: Like, if you're hanging out with cops at the bar, they're like, "Yeah,

122
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:51,573
Speaker 1: whatever.".

123
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,090
Speaker 1: But if you're hanging out with cops while they're working, they're just assholes.

124
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,078
Speaker 0: Not all of them.

125
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,110
Speaker 0: Not all of them.

126
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,510
Speaker 0: But I gotta say, the only, like, one of the only nice cops I've ever met wasn't actually a cop.

127
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,066
Speaker 0: He was Campus Safety at RIT.

128
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:03,450
Speaker 1: Yep.

129
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,850
Speaker 0: That cool black guy who came after we were accused of hacking.

130
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,371
Speaker 1: Yep.

131
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:13,850
Speaker 1: Well, actually, there are also some, if you see cops who are standing on the street, like, traffic cops or stand on the corner cops, those guys are usually cool.

132
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially in New York City.

133
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:15,730
Speaker 0: They're awesome.

134
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,740
Speaker 1: It's cops who drive around in cars and pull people over and come, and cops who knock on doors to do stuff.

135
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,098
Speaker 1: Also- Those seem to be the asshole cops.

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,730
Speaker 0: Most of the asshole cops I run into, 'cause I guess my theory here is that I don't do anything bad.

137
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,634
Speaker 1: Or maybe is it just cops become assholes when they're doing certain things and not doing other things?

138
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:38,503
Speaker 0: Or maybe it's a certain type of person becomes a cop because of various power issues.

139
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:44,010
Speaker 1: Like, if the guy pulled me over today, if he was standing on a corner in New York City copping, policing, would he be such an ass?

140
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:44,934
Speaker 1: You know what?

141
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:45,970
Speaker 1: Like, if I asked him for directions?

142
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,016
Speaker 0: I'd guess probably.

143
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a tough call.

144
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:49,090
Speaker 1: I don't know.

145
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:57,674
Speaker 1: We need to do some sort of- See, that's the thing, is that police are so police that you can't really, like, do stuff to them or research them or- 'Cause they'll be all?

146
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:58,598
Speaker 1: eh, you know?

147
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:03,681
Speaker 1: I'd like to do some sort of studying of police to see what makes them the way they are.

148
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:09,674
Speaker 1: And if there's, like, if we could change the attitude of the police, maybe we could change the attitude of, you know, the people.

149
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:21,620
Speaker 0: Like, maybe people would like police instead of- Well, you know, there was a time when people did like police and that disappeared as we stopped having, you know, regular foot patrols and police officers became solely a method of revenue collection.

150
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,054
Speaker 1: You know, this is racist and stereotypical and untrue.

151
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:33,510
Speaker 1: However, I'm going to say that I have a new requ- If I was in charge of the world, I would require that every single police officer be jolly and Irish.

152
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,075
Speaker 0: But what if you end up getting the fake jolly Irish but they're actually corrupt from the Untouchables?

153
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:41,547
Speaker 1: I would find out right quick.

154
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,910
Speaker 0: No you wouldn't 'cause they'd shoot you in the elevator.

155
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,675
Speaker 1: Someone else would take over.

156
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:49,590
Speaker 0: And there's no Elliot Ness in the-.

157
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:50,970
Speaker 0: Well, there was an Elliot Ness in the real world.

158
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:51,537
Speaker 1: 'Cause there was.

159
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:52,023
Speaker 1: He was a real person.

160
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:52,590
Speaker 1: And you know what?

161
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,083
Speaker 0: Elliot Ness was an asshole.

162
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:54,849
Speaker 1: Yes, he was.

163
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,830
Speaker 1: Just like all the- Just like the guy who pulled me over.

164
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, if you guys- I mean, you've all seen The Untouchables out there.

165
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,080
Speaker 0: And Elliot Ness seems like an awesome guy.

166
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,523
Speaker 0: And you know what?

167
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:02,369
Speaker 0: In that movie, he is.

168
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:08,470
Speaker 0: But in the real world, Elliot Ness is probably one of the worst people- We should've talked about him in Worst Week.

169
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, he wasn't the worst though.

170
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just- He has done such horrible things.

171
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,291
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

172
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:21,390
Speaker 1: But if you want to find someone worse, just find some crooked cop who like, you know, did drugs and shit and mafia stuff.

173
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

174
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,964
Speaker 1: But I mean, freaking- What was I just gonna say?

175
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:26,348
Speaker 1: I don't know.

176
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but my theory is just that I've noticed that all the cops I've met are assholes.

177
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,141
Speaker 0: But then again, I don't do anything bad.

178
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:36,175
Speaker 0: I do a lot of things that may or may not be illegal in various situations.

179
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:39,230
Speaker 0: I'm being very non-committal because I'm here on the air on the internet.

180
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,370
Speaker 0: But whenever I run afoul of a cop, it's always the cop who's giving me a hard time.

181
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,010
Speaker 0: Because the cops that aren't assholes wouldn't give me a hard time about the things I was doing.

182
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:49,648
Speaker 1: Yep.

183
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,896
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that's it.

184
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,190
Speaker 0: Only the cops with bugs up their butts would bother me.

185
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,081
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, we don't do wrong things.

186
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,186
Speaker 1: We don't do evil things.

187
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,070
Speaker 1: We don't do bad things.

188
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,156
Speaker 1: We don't beat people up.

189
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,001
Speaker 1: We don't shoot.

190
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:00,966
Speaker 1: We don't rob.

191
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:01,630
Speaker 1: We don't steal.

192
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,399
Speaker 0: Let's rob.

193
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,150
Speaker 0: Let's rob a bank.

194
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,958
Speaker 1: We don't jack cars, you know?

195
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,690
Speaker 1: And so, we're not doing anything evil.

196
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,028
Speaker 1: We're only doing things that are illegal but kind of lame.

197
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:16,150
Speaker 1: Like, you know, using an access point or sitting around town with a computer.

198
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,370
Speaker 0: Playing Vampire Tag in a park at night.

199
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, stuff like that.

200
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:25,539
Speaker 1: We're doing things that are technically illegal, but they're mostly harmless and good-natured.

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,009
Speaker 1: Like trespassing somewhere, you know, that's kind of lame.

202
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,208
Speaker 0: I was trespassing about four hours ago.

203
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:32,972
Speaker 1: See, there you go.

204
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:36,690
Speaker 1: Or speeding slightly or anything like that.

205
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,629
Speaker 1: So, you know, when a cop pulls you over, only cops who are assholes are gonna bother you if you're doing any of those things.

206
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,590
Speaker 0: Of course, really, things like that shouldn't be illegal.

207
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,830
Speaker 1: That's damn right.

208
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:53,670
Speaker 0: You run into the situation where a lot of people are breaking a law, so a police officer now gets to decide who he's going to pull over.

209
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,803
Speaker 0: Or a government gets to arrest and bother.

210
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:58,510
Speaker 0: Like, hypothetical example.

211
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,658
Speaker 0: I'm not a conspiracy nut.

212
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,210
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this is happening.

213
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,950
Speaker 0: Don't quote me on this saying that this is happening.

214
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:07,690
Speaker 0: But suppose we have speed limit laws, right?

215
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,074
Speaker 1: It's possible.

216
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,310
Speaker 1: It's possible they could be happening.

217
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:16,530
Speaker 0: Say you told the police to only go after these license plates for speeding, because those guys are, I don't know, liberal sympathizers.

218
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:18,829
Speaker 1: It could happen.

219
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,412
Speaker 1: Yeah.

220
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,270
Speaker 0: In fact, it's very easy for that to happen.

221
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,849
Speaker 1: And there's not much you can do about it.

222
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,550
Speaker 0: Because it's perfectly within the law.

223
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:24,959
Speaker 1: Yep.

224
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,290
Speaker 0: That's the problem with broad laws.

225
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:37,449
Speaker 1: There really needs to be a law that if a law is violated too often, and you make a line, like a significant portion of the population is violating a law, the law just goes away.

226
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,210
Speaker 0: Now the thing is, in a democracy, it's already that way.

227
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:41,969
Speaker 0: It is that way.

228
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,770
Speaker 1: But we need to actually vote.

229
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,409
Speaker 1: It requires people to do an extra effort.

230
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,058
Speaker 0: Not even that.

231
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,870
Speaker 0: It's very simple.

232
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:54,690
Speaker 0: All we need to do, for everything except traffic law, because traffic law is different, is educate people about jury nullification and the fact that it exists.

233
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:56,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, that's not a...

234
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,530
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll point this out, that there's a very specific reason why traffic violations are not handled by jury.

235
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,770
Speaker 1: Because they would always be not guilty.

236
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,351
Speaker 0: Yeah.

237
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:10,411
Speaker 0: I mean, seriously, if all you need on a jury is one person to say, "What?

238
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:10,954
Speaker 0: I speed.

239
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,847
Speaker 0: There's no way I'm going to bust this guy's balls for

240
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:13,189
Speaker 0: speeding.".

241
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,548
Speaker 0: You could never convict someone with speeding again unless...

242
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,090
Speaker 1: Well, unless, no, because you know what would happen with a jury?

243
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,490
Speaker 1: It would be doled out fairly.

244
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,930
Speaker 1: Someone like me who was just going along with traffic...

245
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,888
Speaker 0: Well, I was about to say that.

246
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,870
Speaker 1: But some guy who was, like, had a rice car would totally get busted.

247
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,010
Speaker 0: Well, not just the rice car, because there's nothing wrong with that.

248
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,050
Speaker 0: A guy with a rice car going 140 miles an hour in a nun zone, or a baby zone.

249
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,033
Speaker 1: Nun zone.

250
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:40,147
Speaker 1: No, the guys going 140 in the nun zone would get off, because guys like me would say, "Yeah, you teach those

251
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:40,429
Speaker 1: nuns.".

252
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:45,870
Speaker 1: There's guys going 140 in the school zone, or in the old folks' home zone.

253
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,129
Speaker 0: Or in the puppies, kittens, and babies zone.

254
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,509
Speaker 1: Or in the hospital zone.

255
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:50,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

256
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:50,770
Speaker 0: You know what?

257
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,530
Speaker 1: The guy who didn't pull over in front of the ambulance zone.

258
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:11,310
Speaker 0: See, I really have a lot of faith in parts of democracy that, if we had, if everyone was aware of jury nullification, and things like traffic violations and everything, if everyone got their right to a trial by jury, and the system was set up where people weren't, where there wasn't an incentive to get out of jury duty.

259
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,249
Speaker 0: I mean, right now, jury duty fucks me.

260
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,050
Speaker 0: It does nothing but harm me in my life.

261
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,670
Speaker 0: Outgoing on jury duty makes me lose vacation days from work, or not get paid.

262
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,349
Speaker 1: There needs to be a law that says, if you go on jury duty, your company has to pay you what they normally would have paid you for work that day, if you would have worked that day.

263
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,910
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's really complicated.

264
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,550
Speaker 1: And that you can't, and that if you're taken away from your job for more than X days for a jury, then X, Y, and Z, and all that jazz.

265
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:49,850
Speaker 0: Well, there's also the problem that juries will not, I mean, while I would want to serve on a jury for ideological reasons, I can guarantee that no lawyer or judge would ever let me anywhere near a jury.

266
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,809
Speaker 0: I like that story about James Randi.

267
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,970
Speaker 1: If I got on a jury, I would, if I was at jury duty, I would show up and I would try to get on the juries.

268
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,690
Speaker 1: I would just answer honestly everything.

269
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,569
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing, you'd have to lie to get on the jury.

270
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:01,898
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,190
Speaker 0: Because the moment they ask, like, you know what jury nullification is?

272
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:05,969
Speaker 0: I'd say absolutely.

273
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,510
Speaker 0: And then they'd say goodbye.

274
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,130
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's like when those lawyers, as soon as they found out that James Randi...

275
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:15,910
Speaker 1: How is it legal for them to, you know, make that question a filter?

276
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,029
Speaker 0: Well, they can make any question they want a filter.

277
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, but who decides how to make a fair jury?

278
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,189
Speaker 1: Where is that decided?

279
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,288
Speaker 0: You know how that works?

280
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:32,909
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into the details of it, but very simply, the lawyer, the prosecuting lawyer and the defense lawyer, sit together and work it out on their own, the two of them.

281
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,509
Speaker 0: So, like, they both agree, like, all right, you can have that crazy guy if I get this crazy guy.

282
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:41,489
Speaker 0: Or, all right, we both agree that this guy will be fair.

283
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:42,826
Speaker 0: You know, stuff like that.

284
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,709
Speaker 0: There's a whole process where they ask all the jurors questions and then they confer.

285
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,930
Speaker 1: There should be a standard, like, this is the standard for selecting a fair jury.

286
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,849
Speaker 1: You do this process and there's the jury.

287
00:12:54,131 --> 00:13:01,569
Speaker 0: Actually, there was a case recently, I was going to make it a thing of the day a while ago, where an old person, a very elderly person...

288
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,770
Speaker 1: How old, like 90?

289
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,462
Speaker 0: Like, late 80s.

290
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:04,309
Speaker 1: Okay.

291
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,409
Speaker 0: Was acquitted of a crime.

292
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,889
Speaker 0: I believe it was murder, but really you don't... I got to look it up and I'm not going to look it up now, I think I'll talk about it another day.

293
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,347
Speaker 0: It just is very relevant since we got on a tangent.

294
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:23,390
Speaker 0: She was acquitted because they could not construct a jury of her peers, because there were no people who were her peers.

295
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,389
Speaker 0: There were not enough people, old enough, and in any way peerish enough, I like a word like that, to serve on a jury for her.

296
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,470
Speaker 0: And everyone agreed and she was let off the hook.

297
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:35,750
Speaker 0: We

298
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:49,230
Speaker 1: really need, like, you know, jury of your peers is what the Constitution says, but we really need some laws to further define that, as well as some court precedents, which I'm sure we have, but, you know, we need to really say this is how a jury is selected.

299
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,010
Speaker 0: Or, you know what, go pure math, make it just a lottery, and no one gets any say except the computer that picks it randomly.

300
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that, where no other human being can sculpt the jury in any way.

301
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:11,490
Speaker 1: Lawyers got... If given X pool of people, if I follow the process, or if you follow the process, or if a judge follows the process, we should all end up with the same jury.

302
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,089
Speaker 1: That's what needs to be done.

303
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:23,230
Speaker 1: It shouldn't matter who does the jury selecting, the process should be complete, in that no matter which pool of people you have to select from, the same jury is always selected.

304
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,370
Speaker 0: But anyway, to get off of our attention...

305
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,290
Speaker 1: I'm fighting this no matter what, because it's not as far away as the other one, and it's bigger than the other one, so I'm gonna...

306
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,046
Speaker 0: I'd fight it if I were you.

307
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,830
Speaker 1: Especially since it's "I'm not guilty", unlike last time, where I was guilty.

308
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,309
Speaker 0: Well, you are guilty, that's the thing.

309
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,210
Speaker 1: I'm not guilty of what the ticket says.

310
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might be, though.

311
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,169
Speaker 0: No... Because you're not 100% sure, and you can't prove it.

312
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:46,513
Speaker 1: 99% sure.

313
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,849
Speaker 0: But yet he has evidence against you.

314
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:49,487
Speaker 0: He does.

315
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,270
Speaker 1: Could be fake evidence.

316
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:52,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a bunch of ways.

317
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,270
Speaker 0: We'll do a whole show on this someday.

318
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:55,486
Speaker 1: Fuckers.

319
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:56,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

320
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:04,230
Speaker 0: But anyway, in the news, Cambridge University has... Now, this is old news that people cracked the Great Firewall of China.

321
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:11,070
Speaker 0: The thing that prevents Chinese people from getting to anything the Chinese government deems in any way dissident or seditious or bad.

322
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:19,788
Speaker 0: And people broke it a while ago, where I don't... You probably don't care about the details, but basically it's trivial, trivial to get around it.

323
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,321
Speaker 1: Replace the CCPIV stack.

324
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,849
Speaker 1: So basically you run a little program and then you're good.

325
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:30,390
Speaker 0: Which doesn't really matter, because the people running the Chinese firewall could see that this was happening and they would just come kill you or something.

326
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,290
Speaker 1: They'd probably just come and punish you in some way.

327
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends on what you were doing.

328
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,070
Speaker 0: But anyway, Cambridge University broke it one step further, where not only is it trivial to get through it...

329
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,709
Speaker 1: But they can't see.

330
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,604
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

331
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,970
Speaker 0: You can use the Chinese firewall to attack people.

332
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:46,747
Speaker 1: Really?

333
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:53,310
Speaker 0: The way the Chinese firewall works, I'm only not going over the details because it's not Monday and none of you know or care.

334
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,406
Speaker 0: At least most of you know or care.

335
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:03,049
Speaker 0: You can send packets to it that are spoofed and it'll then ban or block the people you sent it from.

336
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,189
Speaker 0: And things like that.

337
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,830
Speaker 0: You can trick it into doing bad things to other people.

338
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,470
Speaker 1: You can trick it into completely blocking out the internet from other people?

339
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,585
Speaker 0: Because it's entirely...

340
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,730
Speaker 1: Or from other Chinese people.

341
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also get it to react to people.

342
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,947
Speaker 0: And you can do DDoSs.

343
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,130
Speaker 0: Well, DDoSs, not DDoSs.

344
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,290
Speaker 1: We should send things to the Chinese firewall to basically disable the internet in China.

345
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:25,189
Speaker 1: So no one can get on the net.

346
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:26,490
Speaker 1: Even big companies.

347
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,490
Speaker 0: They would be fairly trivial to do.

348
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:29,689
Speaker 1: I know, we should do it.

349
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,770
Speaker 0: It's entirely... Well, because then we'd probably get in trouble with our government.

350
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:33,810
Speaker 1: That's fine.

351
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,630
Speaker 1: They always talk about how cyber terrorism is real.

352
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:37,130
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah.

353
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,627
Speaker 1: It's gonna happen.

354
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,290
Speaker 0: Great, so you're advocating we become terrorists.

355
00:16:39,691 --> 00:16:41,009
Speaker 1: And it's never happened and it's not real.

356
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,568
Speaker 1: But here, I can fucking do it.

357
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a great idea.

358
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,149
Speaker 1: It is a great idea.

359
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:45,989
Speaker 0: That's all you.

360
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,829
Speaker 0: I got nothing to do with it.

361
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,109
Speaker 1: All right, I'll do it.

362
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,629
Speaker 1: All right.

363
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:51,068
Speaker 1: If I can figure out how.

364
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,910
Speaker 0: See, I'll show you the article.

365
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,450
Speaker 0: Basically, it's stateless and it just looks for bad contents in individual packets.

366
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:00,090
Speaker 0: Anyway, got some news?

367
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,070
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so I don't know if everyone knows.

368
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're doing all this tech news on Tuesday.

369
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,300
Speaker 1: Great.

370
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:05,909
Speaker 1: What do you want?

371
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,787
Speaker 1: I wasn't here Monday.

372
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,349
Speaker 1: Apparently...

373
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,009
Speaker 0: It's going down the tubes.

374
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Microsoft has this thing called Windows Genuine Advantage.

375
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,990
Speaker 0: This is the thing that tries to figure out if your copy of Windows is pirated?

376
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,770
Speaker 1: Yes, if you go to Windows Update now, it does this Windows Genuine Advantage thing.

377
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:32,669
Speaker 1: And basically it is, what it is, is if your copy of Windows is genuine, they give you the advantage of actually getting all sorts of updates and patches.

378
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:38,110
Speaker 0: As in, if you don't have this, you're just a waiting target for every worm and virus in the world.

379
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,090
Speaker 1: Yes, or you can somehow get the patches and things some other way besides Windows Update.

380
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:43,949
Speaker 1: That's not easy.

381
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,329
Speaker 0: Also, while they've now denied the rumor, there was a rumor going around for a long time that they were just going to shut everyone down.

382
00:17:50,830 --> 00:18:04,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a rumor that they had a kill switch in which if they detected that your copy of Windows had a pirate key or you didn't pay for your copy of Windows, that they would just make your computer unusable unless you paid the money.

383
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,370
Speaker 1: They have denied that there is a kill switch in XP.

384
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,049
Speaker 1: They haven't said anything about Vista yet.

385
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:11,910
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,750
Speaker 0: Also, I mean, it'd be trivial for them to implement that if they really wanted.

387
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:23,810
Speaker 1: However, Microsoft has said that 80% of all... Okay, because this Windows Genuine Advantage thing doesn't always work.

388
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,110
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can't get updates even when you paid.

389
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Microsoft will say, "Oh, you've got a pirated copy," even when you don't.

390
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,690
Speaker 0: Or worse, you've got a legit copy.

391
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,590
Speaker 0: Someone else generated your CD key on their own, and then Microsoft is flagging both as pirated.

392
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,490
Speaker 0: And despite what they tell you, there's no way to undo that.

393
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,329
Speaker 0: Microsoft will not restore you.

394
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, well, you have to fight with them.

395
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:46,309
Speaker 1: It's not easy.

396
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:52,630
Speaker 1: You know, a stupid person would just end up paying Microsoft, whereas a smart nerdy guy would fight a little bit.

398
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,510
Speaker 0: Though I've seen a lot of... It's all anecdotal, but a lot of people who this has happened to, and they couldn't get Microsoft to do it.

399
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:06,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, the point is that 80% of the time that it fails to authorize you, it's pirated.

400
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:14,110
Speaker 1: Which means 20% of the time that it fucks up and doesn't let you update, you're perfectly okay.

401
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:21,129
Speaker 1: One out of five times this Windows Genuine Advantage thing screws up, it's a perfectly legitimate non-pirate person.

402
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,730
Speaker 0: One in five.

403
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:27,050
Speaker 1: That's not one in five of Windows users, which would be insane.

404
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,450
Speaker 1: It's one in five of the times it screws up.

405
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,289
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it's screwed up.

406
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,410
Speaker 0: Well, one in five of the times it gets something.

407
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:34,759
Speaker 1: Yeah.

408
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:39,714
Speaker 1: So every time... So this thing is basically telling Microsoft, "Someone pirated it.

409
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:40,821
Speaker 1: Someone pirated Windows.

410
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:41,505
Speaker 1: Someone pirated

411
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:41,868
Speaker 1: Windows.".

412
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,316
Speaker 1: It's only right.

413
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:45,508
Speaker 1: four out of five times it says, "Someone pirated

414
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:45,850
Speaker 1: Windows.".

415
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,090
Speaker 1: One out of five times it's wrong, and it's really an okay copy of Windows.

416
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:50,406
Speaker 0: So, uh, don't roll low.

417
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,540
Speaker 0: Well, for all of our US listeners, it is Independence Day.

418
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:05,280
Speaker 0: It's also Monkey Tuesday.

419
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:11,260
Speaker 0: Now, I didn't actually write my story for Penn just because I didn't have time.

420
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,920
Speaker 1: And because your story was made up, and I'm sure there's gonna be some better stories on the show.

421
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:21,960
Speaker 0: Actually, I refined the story, and I think the story's pretty good, but it wasn't enough, and I just didn't feel like sitting down and writing it.

422
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,160
Speaker 0: I mean, I did last night's show at around two in the morning.

423
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:34,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, because it is Independence Day, which for all of you non-US listeners, it is known in America as Blow Shit Up Day.

424
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:42,139
Speaker 1: I must celebrate the independence of my nation by blowing up a small... A small part of it.

425
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,393
Speaker 1: Yes.

426
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:42,814
Speaker 0: Yeah.

427
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:49,340
Speaker 0: So, and as going along with that, we both have firework-related things of the day.

428
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,120
Speaker 0: In fact, you know what, I decided right now, I have two things of the day.

429
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,000
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

430
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:55,600
Speaker 0: I gotta use the bottle rocket.

431
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,719
Speaker 1: You can't resist?

432
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,820
Speaker 0: No, I can't resist, it's just so funny.

433
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,720
Speaker 1: I would have two, but I used my firecrackers the other day.

434
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,280
Speaker 0: You could use the other bottle rocket.

435
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 1: No, I'm not gonna use the other bottle rocket.

436
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,800
Speaker 0: Or you could use the other, uh, bottle rocket.

437
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,300
Speaker 1: That's, uh, no, that one's no good either.

438
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,139
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'll do mine first.

439
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,020
Speaker 0: They're all firework-related.

440
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 0: The first one is my favorite dog ever.

441
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:26,260
Speaker 0: Now, I saw this video, and I knew that the video involves fireworks and a dog, and I was worried because I didn't want to see a video of a dog getting hurt by fireworks.

442
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:32,699
Speaker 0: And the video starts, there's a Roman candle, and it's just a big Roman candle, and it's shooting its things off.

443
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:37,840
Speaker 0: And then this little puppy runs over to it, like as happy as a puppy could ever be, like stumbling over itself.

444
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:39,899
Speaker 0: And I thought, this isn't gonna be good.

445
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:46,600
Speaker 0: And I'm thinking about turning it off, then the puppy grabs the Roman candle by the side, like a stick, runs off with it, and it keeps shooting.

446
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,759
Speaker 0: And the puppy, like every time it shoots, the puppy like, but doesn't care, and I think the puppy kind of figured out what was going on.

447
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,139
Speaker 0: Because he's just running around with this thing now, shooting at people with it.

448
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,660
Speaker 1: Hey, that's what Roman candles are for.

449
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,999
Speaker 0: Like he almost hits one guy.

450
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you think they did back in the, you know, the days of Rome?

451
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:05,440
Speaker 1: They didn't have regular candles.

452
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,599
Speaker 1: All they had were these freaking things.

453
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was a fucker to read a book with those things.

454
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:09,938
Speaker 1: It was.

455
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,540
Speaker 1: I mean, you really had to be careful not to set the book on fire.

456
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,759
Speaker 0: You had to be really quick too.

457
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,060
Speaker 0: That was the origin of speed reading.

458
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:19,036
Speaker 1: Haha, that's why they invented Latin there.

459
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:23,437
Speaker 1: Okay, I got it.

460
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,460
Speaker 0: I'm awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.

461
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:26,718
Speaker 1: Something like that.

462
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:33,780
Speaker 0: Anyway, my second one is, now this guy's obviously drunk and everyone involved is drunk.

463
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,360
Speaker 0: He's decided to shoot a bottle rocket from his anus.

464
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:41,200
Speaker 0: As in, take the little stick, stick it in there.

465
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,500
Speaker 1: I don't think everyone knows what a bottle rocket is because it seems like in our childhood we experienced like the end of the days of easy access to fireworks.

466
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:54,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, the nearest state to us where we can get the good fireworks is ten of fucking C. Tennessee.

467
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:56,540
Speaker 0: That is a long ways away.

468
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,098
Speaker 1: All right, so let me explain to everyone what a bottle rocket is.

469
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,000
Speaker 1: A bottle rocket is a stick, a very narrow round stick.

470
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,020
Speaker 1: It's about a foot long, I'd say.

471
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you get the weird ones.

472
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,140
Speaker 1: It's a standard bottle rocket.

473
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,499
Speaker 1: It's a foot long stick.

474
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,340
Speaker 1: It's really thin and cheap.

475
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,260
Speaker 1: Like you can just break it and a baby could break this stick, right?

476
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,080
Speaker 0: You buy these things like a hundred of them for ten bucks, they're nothing.

477
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a cheap little tiny stick and at the top of the stick is a little tuft.

478
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,480
Speaker 1: And inside the little tuft is pyrotechnic matter.

479
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,040
Speaker 0: Propellant then explosive.

480
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:29,538
Speaker 1: Yes, so it has a little fuse coming out of it.

481
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,379
Speaker 1: So what you usually do with a bottle rocket, the safe way to use one, the recommended way is to have a tube.

482
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:37,020
Speaker 0: Or a bottle.

483
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,400
Speaker 1: Or a bottle with a solid bottom.

484
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,000
Speaker 1: Some sort of circular opening.

485
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Speaker 1: And you would light the bottle rocket, drop it into the tube or bottle, wait, and after about, I don't know, a second, when the fuse is done, the propellant shoots the bottle rocket up into the air in some direction.

486
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,500
Speaker 1: And then it whistles as it goes up.

487
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,659
Speaker 0: Well some do, the cheapest cheapest ones don't.

488
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,640
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but you want the ones that whistle.

489
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,340
Speaker 1: Those are the good ones.

490
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,660
Speaker 1: They go *whistles* and then when they get to the top they just go snap.

491
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:12,120
Speaker 1: That's what a bottle rocket does, it goes fly up in the air, snap.

492
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
Speaker 0: So imagine a firecracker that gets shot up in the air.

493
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,960
Speaker 1: And it doesn't really have a lot of light, it's mostly a noise.

494
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,780
Speaker 1: It just kind of goes whistle, crack.

495
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the ones that have the full huge light shows are usually, they're not actually rockets, they're more like mortars.

496
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, people make things that are more, they're better.

497
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,280
Speaker 1: bottle rockets that go like spiral, spiral, spiral, spark.

498
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,940
Speaker 1: But those are, you know, those are not bottle rockets.

499
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,060
Speaker 0: Or the UFOs that go up in the air and set your neighbor's roof on fire.

500
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:37,892
Speaker 0: Yeah.

501
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,339
Speaker 0: Or the ones that I can't name because they have a really racist name.

502
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:43,299
Speaker 0: All sorts of old.

503
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,560
Speaker 0: But anyway, so this guy, they lean him back and he's laying there with his butt exposed, and he sticks the end of the bottle rocket into his butt.

504
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:52,020
Speaker 1: The wooden end, not the fire end.

505
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,879
Speaker 0: Yes, and they're gonna light it and launch out.

506
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:01,939
Speaker 0: Now the fact that I've seen more than one video on the internet in the past few days about this exact subject, I have one thing to say.

507
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:08,378
Speaker 0: If you ever stick a bottle rocket in your butt, be warned that your butt will probably clench up from having something in it.

508
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,140
Speaker 0: Meaning your butt's holding on to that rocket.

509
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:19,080
Speaker 1: And it's gonna go... And it's gonna pull with its little splintery woodenness on the insides of your buttocks.

510
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,259
Speaker 0: Now it doesn't in fact move.

511
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,080
Speaker 0: They light it and the fire starts coming out of the bottom, and it doesn't move at all.

512
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,420
Speaker 1: Which means it's pulling on his butt.

513
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,620
Speaker 0: It doesn't move, it's just hitting the guy with fire.

514
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,728
Speaker 0: And the kid's going, "Ah!

515
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:31,131
Speaker 0: Ah!

516
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:31,514
Speaker 0: Ah!

517
00:25:31,535 --> 00:25:31,797
Speaker 0: Ah!

518
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:31,918
Speaker 0: Ah!".

519
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:35,560
Speaker 0: And then he like gets up in a panic and starts running away.

520
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:38,960
Speaker 0: And you see the thing still hanging out of there, and then it explodes.

521
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,300
Speaker 1: Don't put a bottle rocket in your butt.

522
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,420
Speaker 0: Now the guy was okay, but good god was that one of the funniest things I've seen on the internet ever.

523
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,039
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

524
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,680
Speaker 1: Pretty funny.

525
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,459
Speaker 0: Of course your thing of the day is pretty awesome, so.

526
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,540
Speaker 1: Okay, so the bottle rockets, which you just explained for the non-fireworks initiative.

527
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:57,700
Speaker 0: I think mine was a bottle rocket.

528
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, so bottle rockets.

529
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:06,249
Speaker 1: Some geniuses, and they are geniuses in the non-sarcastic sense, took 45,000 bottle rockets.

530
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,841
Speaker 1: Approximately 45,000.

531
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:13,620
Speaker 0: It was actually, he said like 44,000 and something, but it was pretty much.

532
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,460
Speaker 1: No, there was a different video where they said how many.

533
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:16,419
Speaker 0: All right, there were two videos.

534
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,218
Speaker 1: Yes, this video is just the setting off of the bottle rockets.

535
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:22,320
Speaker 0: It was a lot of bottle rockets.

536
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:29,480
Speaker 1: They set up so many of them in this giant array, and they kind of just set it on fire and run.

537
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:31,779
Speaker 0: And it's insane.

538
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:41,480
Speaker 1: It's like, if you watch my thing of the day from before with the firecrackers, how it starts off and then it picks up the pace and goes insane, this picks up the pace and goes insane.

539
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,879
Speaker 1: Now remember how I told you bottle rockets fly up in the air and snap, and then the stick kind of falls to the ground?

540
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:49,325
Speaker 1: 45,000 sticks flying around really fast.

541
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,320
Speaker 1: A lot of them.

542
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,320
Speaker 1: Like faster than any machine gun ever.

543
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,940
Speaker 1: Well, like Vulcan cannon fast.

544
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, not as fast as a metal storm.

545
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,019
Speaker 1: No, not as fast, maybe as fast as metal storm even.

546
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,620
Speaker 0: No, metal storm shoots more than a million rounds in a short amount of time.

547
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,360
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

548
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,118
Speaker 0: Metal storm is...

549
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,700
Speaker 1: We're talking like the guns on a fighter jet fast.

550
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,999
Speaker 1: The guns on a helicopter fast.

551
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:16,395
Speaker 1: Like, it's insane.

552
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:24,499
Speaker 0: It makes me happy to have the internet because these are the sorts of things that I always wanted to do as a kid, but I didn't have access to the resources to do it.

553
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,860
Speaker 1: Now I don't even have to do them because someone else did and I can watch a video.

554
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,332
Speaker 1: Yep.

555
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,580
Speaker 1: Of course I might try to beat their records.

556
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:42,360
Speaker 0: So anyway, we were in Wildwood, which in addition to being an awesome beach and boardwalk to hang out at, it's probably the best arcade we go to on any regular basis in our lives.

557
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:46,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just there aren't... It's not a lot of competition out there.

558
00:27:47,660 --> 00:28:00,920
Speaker 1: I mean, the only places to find better arcades these days are at real amusement parks, which always seem to have arcades to, you know, get more money out of the tourists and places like Dave and Buster's, which are super overpriced.

559
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:03,778
Speaker 1: And of course Japan, but we're talking about the US here.

560
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:18,640
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're there and there are three games we like to talk about because while arcades I don't think are going to go through a renaissance anytime soon, these games have rekindled my personal interest in going to an arcade and dropping a bunch of money.

561
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 1: Well, really they haven't rekindled my interest in going to arcade.

562
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:24,200
Speaker 1: They just... They're three games I want to play that aren't at home yet.

563
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:24,711
Speaker 0: True.

564
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:36,720
Speaker 1: And they're pretty much, if you look at them, they're really the only franchises still... I mean, you may not realize this, kiddies, but back in the day, games came out in the arcade first.

565
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:41,539
Speaker 0: In fact, like a game would come out in the arcade and be a big deal and everyone would go to the arcade to play it.

566
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, when Mortal Kombat 2 came out, it was only in the arcade for a long time before you could play it at home.

567
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,040
Speaker 1: And when you could finally play it at home, it wasn't as good as the arcade version.

568
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,820
Speaker 1: People would go to the arcade and line up and compete with each other to play Mortal Kombat 2.

569
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:04,980
Speaker 1: It was... Those are the days, you know, Ninja Turtles 2, like the arcade game was so much better than the NES version.

570
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,000
Speaker 1: It's just like chocolate and shit when you compare the two.

571
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,820
Speaker 0: You know, you see on like old episodes of The Simpsons, where Bart's always hanging out in an arcade?

572
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,139
Speaker 0: It was just like that.

573
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,400
Speaker 1: It was really like that.

574
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,732
Speaker 0: You would go to the arcade and hang out and there'd always be like, "That guy never loses in Mortal

575
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:19,136
Speaker 0: Kombat."

576
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,380
Speaker 0: And that guy would never lose in Mortal Kombat.

577
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,711
Speaker 1: No, because he'd put in 50 cents.

578
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:24,578
Speaker 1: He'd win.

579
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,579
Speaker 1: You would put in 50 cents to fight him.

580
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,059
Speaker 1: He would win and get more free games and more free games.

581
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,200
Speaker 1: And if you actually, you know, if no one challenged him, he would beat the game.

582
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,659
Speaker 1: So he'd get his name on the high score table.

583
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 0: All right, so first let's talk about House of the Dead 4.

584
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, so House of the Dead is... The games that still work in the arcade are obviously games that have peripherals that can't be had at home easily.

585
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:55,360
Speaker 1: And, you know, it started out where they put guns in the arcade and, well, we got the Zapper, so you're done with that.

586
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,520
Speaker 1: So House of the Dead 4.

587
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,839
Speaker 1: Well, House of the Dead 1 was guns.

588
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Speaker 1: House of the Dead, I think, 3 had the shotgun, right?

589
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:02,718
Speaker 0: Yep.

590
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,740
Speaker 0: 4 goes into... Because I wondered, what are they going to put in House of the Dead 4?

591
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Speaker 1: I didn't even know there was going to be a House of the Dead 4.

592
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, they came out with the Uzi.

593
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 1: Yep.

594
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,660
Speaker 1: What's better for mowing down a shit ton of zombies than an Uzi?

595
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the game...

596
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,140
Speaker 1: That's not a shotgun because you already made a game with shotguns?

597
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:20,785
Speaker 1: Uzis.

598
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,780
Speaker 0: The game is... It rekindled the interest in a game that I otherwise wouldn't have cared about.

599
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I really didn't enjoy that much the previous House of the Dead games.

600
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,779
Speaker 1: I mean, I kind of played them, but I wasn't crazy about them.

601
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,052
Speaker 1: This one is kind of like, "Ah,

602
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:37,259
Speaker 1: ah.".

603
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:39,780
Speaker 1: It's sort of got a Resident Evil 4 style to it.

604
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,960
Speaker 0: Yes, it has very much got the "This is a zombie world, survive" as opposed to "This is a zombie world, kill all the zombies" because there'll be a lot of zombies on the screen at every given time.

605
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,800
Speaker 1: But only some of them are actually Scooby-Doo-ified where you actually have to shoot them.

606
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,779
Speaker 1: The rest of them are just there.

607
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,420
Speaker 0: Only shoot the ones that are about to get you and it's really fun, kind of a survivalist game.

608
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:03,160
Speaker 1: Yep, now here's the thing is that there's a catch and the reason that this game can't be played easily at home.

609
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,920
Speaker 1: Number one is the Uzi with force feedback and all that good stuff.

610
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,160
Speaker 1: Number two, the Uzi has a button towards the front that shoots grenades.

611
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,520
Speaker 1: Kind of like the grenade button in Terminator 2, the arcade gun game.

612
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:21,400
Speaker 1: And number three, if a zombie grabs you, there's a lot of times where something will grab you or like the boss or a zombie or something.

613
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:28,118
Speaker 1: And what you have to do is you shake the Uzi and inside of the Uzi is this thing that knows when you're shaking it.

614
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,500
Speaker 1: And if you shake it quickly enough and in the right direction, you can shake the zombie off of you.

615
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,619
Speaker 1: If you don't shake it properly, the zombie will hurt you.

616
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,999
Speaker 0: Got a Nintendo wrist it.

617
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

618
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:48,720
Speaker 1: Like the other thing is that if you put in enough money to play two player or each of you has an Uzi, you can also do two Uzi mode, which is one guy with two Uzis.

619
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:52,719
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to hit the grenade button in that mode.

620
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:58,659
Speaker 1: But and it's kind of hard to shake both Uzis if zombies grab, you know, both of them.

621
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:05,820
Speaker 1: But it's a lot of fun to use two Uzis on one game and it's going to shoot and shit.

622
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,253
Speaker 0: Yep.

623
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:10,535
Speaker 0: The games at least seems good enough to where I'm probably going to spend enough money to beat it.

624
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:19,460
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll send enough money to beat it, but I will gladly play it and put money into it if I am, you know, maybe, you know, like a team up where someone else dies.

625
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,060
Speaker 1: I continue.

626
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,368
Speaker 1: I die.

627
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,480
Speaker 1: Someone else continues.

628
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:27,099
Speaker 0: Now, the second game that we were greatly interested in, but we've been waiting for this time crisis for.

629
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew time crisis four was coming out.

630
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:31,400
Speaker 1: It was the only arcade game I knew was coming.

631
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,320
Speaker 1: And time crisis has pretty much been the perennial awesome gun game.

632
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,400
Speaker 1: And in my opinion, time crisis one, two, three and four are the best gun games there are.

633
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,759
Speaker 1: Two is probably actually my favorite one.

634
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,020
Speaker 0: Four is very good from what little I played it.

635
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played.

636
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,140
Speaker 1: it wasn't actually the first level.

637
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,740
Speaker 1: It was like a little bit into the game I played and it has some new interesting things.

638
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,500
Speaker 1: First of all, the gun is just as awesome as ever.

639
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,015
Speaker 1: It's heavy.

640
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,132
Speaker 0: It has the nice built into the game for anyone who plays.

641
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:05,840
Speaker 1: it is a calibration mode where before you play, I think it had calibration mode before in the other versions.

642
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,660
Speaker 0: Well, this one, it said it and you could just do it.

643
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Speaker 0: I never saw it say it before.

644
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it wasn't really needed.

645
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:20,199
Speaker 1: But now, if you think your gun is off, you can push some buttons when you start the game as you insert the coins to get to calibration mode to line everything up.

646
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,578
Speaker 1: And I recommend you do that if you're going to like go for beating the game or something like that.

647
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,860
Speaker 1: You want to make sure you're accurate.

648
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:30,289
Speaker 1: Now, it has the same things.

649
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:37,740
Speaker 1: time crisis three has where, you know, you have the classic time crisis pedal where you let go to hide and you step on it to come out and shoot.

650
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:39,759
Speaker 1: And when you're hiding, you reload.

651
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:44,518
Speaker 1: And in time crisis three, if you pulled the trigger while you were hiding, you would change weapons.

652
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,060
Speaker 1: And you had the pistol, the shotgun, the machine gun and the grenade launcher as usual.

653
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,380
Speaker 1: But in this mode, you start out with ammo for all the guns.

654
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,620
Speaker 0: And you seem to get a lot more ammo.

655
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,300
Speaker 1: You do get a lot more ammo so you can use all the different guns at different times.

656
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,200
Speaker 0: Which was great because playing the other time crisis, I loved him, but I really almost always just use the pistol.

657
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, time crisis three was the only other one to have more than one gun.

658
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,780
Speaker 1: Well, the other ones had more than one gun, but it wasn't the same.

659
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:13,580
Speaker 1: It was like you get a gun temporarily and then it's gone.

660
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:16,159
Speaker 0: See, most of the time you use the pistol.

661
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,438
Speaker 1: In time crisis three, when you could actually switch weapons, you still ended up using the pistol a lot.

662
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,219
Speaker 1: And, you know, using the other weapons kind of helped, but you didn't get that much ammo for them.

663
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:34,100
Speaker 1: Now you get plenty of ammo and there are certain bad guys where, you know, that are better to kill with certain types of ammo.

664
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,880
Speaker 1: Like if you're real close to a heavily armored guy, whip out that shotgun real quick.

665
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,560
Speaker 0: And it'll flash like best weapon.

666
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,219
Speaker 1: It'll flash best weapon when you hit him with the best weapon.

667
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:47,280
Speaker 1: And like sometimes there's like a million bugs coming after you as you fall into quicksand.

668
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:51,060
Speaker 1: So you'll use the machine gun to kill a bunch of little bugs and it'll say best weapon.

669
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,159
Speaker 1: You know, also another thing interesting about the game is that you'll have to look around.

670
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,959
Speaker 1: Like you'll see your screen will be up and you'll see what you can see, but there'll be arrows pointing left and right.

671
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:07,100
Speaker 1: If you just point the gun off screen to the right or left, you'll turn and see what's going on to the right.

672
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,960
Speaker 0: So you've got to be aware of your surroundings.

673
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:13,779
Speaker 0: And like if you see a guy and you turn away and you're dealing with stuff, that guy's coming up or shooting at you.

674
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,578
Speaker 0: He's still there.

675
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy's behind you and to the right and to the left of you where you can't see.

676
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,160
Speaker 1: So you need to keep looking around.

677
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,740
Speaker 1: You know, when you kill all the guys in one screen, go look at the other screen.

678
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,639
Speaker 1: There might be guys there.

679
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:26,300
Speaker 0: I'm worried about the later levels being very difficult with that.

680
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the game is going to be difficult and relatively long and awesome.

681
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:39,540
Speaker 0: Also, one thing I like is that most of the cut scenes are very short and it seems like a lot of the plot cut scenes are fully integrated into the game.

682
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,100
Speaker 0: Like I'll be running and shooting guys, but there's someone talking at me, telling me plot while I'm going.

683
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,559
Speaker 1: Well, the plot seems to be the same as the other time.

684
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:48,560
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the plot of you're too bad ass guys, go be bad ass.

685
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:53,831
Speaker 1: Well, no, the plot happening during the game is about the same amount as the other Time Crisis games.

686
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:02,860
Speaker 1: It's the same as Time Crisis 1, which you shouldn't have much plot, but since Time Crisis 2, the plots have been presented in the same way and been similar in content.

687
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:10,440
Speaker 0: And of course, last and definitely not least, we didn't even realize it was coming out, but DDR 9th Mix appeared.

688
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,560
Speaker 1: It's Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

689
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:24,960
Speaker 0: Now, basically DDR was all but dead to me in that I want to play it at home, I really don't have the opportunity to, but I like more of the old mixes more than the new mixes and I like the old music more than the new music.

690
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:34,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really like 4th Mix and kind of 5th Mix, but 4th Mix Plus was the best DDR machine you could get because it had more of the good songs, it had all the good songs, it was perfect.

691
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,360
Speaker 0: Yep, 6th Mix I hated the most because I didn't like anything in it just about.

692
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:46,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, 7th and 8th Mix had some redeeming new songs, but not many, and they had some redeeming old songs, but not many, so they were pretty much average DDRs.

693
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,168
Speaker 0: Yep.

694
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,033
Speaker 1: They're equivalent to me if it's 7th or 8th.

695
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,880
Speaker 0: We'd moved on to In the Groove in Wildwood.

696
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:55,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, In the Groove 2 had some advantages and disadvantages.

697
00:36:56,021 --> 00:37:09,839
Speaker 0: It had good music, and I thought the arrows were great, but the timing of hitting the arrows is a little different in that there are more levels of perfection, and it seemed like the highest level of hitting an arrow perfectly was a little early compared to DDR.

698
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,616
Speaker 1: And also you had to, you know, you had to use the menu to change the settings on In the Groove.

699
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the default settings are crap.

700
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,920
Speaker 1: The default settings are ass, and it pretty much forced, if you weren't a elite master of DDR, then In the Groove isn't for you, it's only for the elite masters.

701
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:40,680
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say so much the elite master, because I noticed that the default settings are the kinds of things that all the, like, crazy elite freaks use, well, and a lot of the normal people use in, like, 8th Mix and 7th Mix, who, if you set it to normal, they can't dance anymore, because they can't deal with the arrows being so clumped together.

702
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, but normal mode is, I think, is better for the average schmuck walking up on the boardwalk.

703
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:50,996
Speaker 1: The acceleration and stuff will just confuse brand new people, but elite masters love that stuff.

704
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,280
Speaker 1: It was set up for, In the Groove is set up and created for DDR fanboys by DDR fanboys.

705
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, except the true elite masters shun anything except 1x.

706
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaker 1: That is true.

707
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,540
Speaker 1: Well, at least, as far as we care.

708
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, but, I mean, In the Groove was fun, but it wasn't, like, we'd play it every now and then, and we didn't really care about it.

709
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:19,120
Speaker 0: Now, we saw, and I talked about this yesterday, so I don't need to describe this in great detail, but they must have just come off the boat, like, 10 or 11 of these supernova machines.

710
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:23,000
Speaker 1: This one place had three machines, 50 cents to play three songs.

711
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,900
Speaker 0: And also, I mean, this guy, they had three supernova machines, and an In the Groove 2, and a 7th Mix in this giant area with, like, dance lights in the ceiling.

712
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,816
Speaker 1: With an air hockey and a Time Crisis 4, so.

713
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,760
Speaker 0: Like, it's the DDR hangout.

714
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,300
Speaker 0: It's unbelievably awesome.

715
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,960
Speaker 1: It's super crazy cool.

716
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,560
Speaker 0: I mean, all of us were playing DDR at the same time.

717
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:44,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could have all done doubles at the same time, almost.

718
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:48,280
Speaker 0: And, I mean, these machines are brand freaking new.

719
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:51,100
Speaker 0: It's the newest I've ever touched a DDR machine.

720
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
Speaker 0: The pads were absolutely perfect.

721
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, the pads were shiny, clean, and flawless.

722
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,139
Speaker 0: They lit up perfectly.

723
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,558
Speaker 1: Like, no one even said, "Oh, the arrow's not

724
00:38:59,598 --> 00:38:59,860
Speaker 1: working.".

725
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:01,320
Speaker 1: No one even thought about saying that.

726
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,600
Speaker 1: They were so new and perfect.

727
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,100
Speaker 0: Like, the screen, it was just, it was a beautiful thing to behold.

728
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for the one that was in the glare of the sun, but the other machines are great.

729
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,999
Speaker 0: Yep, and it really made the In the Groove 2 machine and the 7th Mix machine look like ass.

730
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:14,159
Speaker 1: It really did.

731
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,578
Speaker 1: When there's three DDR Supernova machines, the In the Groove 2 machine is like,

732
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,000
Speaker 1: "Aww.".

733
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,879
Speaker 0: Plus, I know, I gotta verify this.

734
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:31,740
Speaker 0: Either there is no upgrade to Supernova, or for some reason no one did that, because every Supernova machine was a brand new DDR machine.

735
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:39,038
Speaker 0: Well, in the past, like, all the 8th Mixes on the boardwalk and 7th Mixes are upgraded 4th Mixes, which themselves are upgraded 3rd Mixes, just...

736
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:48,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, people would buy bootleg or legitimate upgrade kits to turn old DDR machines with, like, 4th Mix into new DDR machines with Extreme.

737
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:58,698
Speaker 1: And it seemed like everyone was able to upgrade all the machines in the world all the way up to Extreme, because there was a point at which the only machines I ever saw were DDR Extreme, which is 8th.

738
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the bootlegs were very prevalent and cheap.

739
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:01,537
Speaker 1: Yep.

740
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,680
Speaker 0: Which was sad, because I always missed my 3rd Mix Korean.

741
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,148
Speaker 0: That was 25 cents.

742
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:06,327
Speaker 1: Yeah.

743
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,420
Speaker 0: That was like the best machine.

744
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:17,040
Speaker 1: But no, all the DDR Supernova machines were DDR Supernova machines from the factories, wherever they are, but, you know, from Japan, in quotes.

745
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,419
Speaker 1: I don't know where they actually make these things.

746
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,220
Speaker 0: And, I gotta say, most of the music is new.

747
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,580
Speaker 0: There is very little of the original music.

748
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,259
Speaker 1: I think what it is, is the, if you choose, you know, all music mode, right?

749
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:34,920
Speaker 1: It actually, it's kind of weird, because A, they've brought back the characters, but you don't get to choose the characters.

750
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,259
Speaker 1: It's sort of random, which I like.

751
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:41,500
Speaker 1: But, when you turn on the machine, it doesn't just put you into song selection.

752
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,520
Speaker 1: It puts you into a choice of easy, medium, difficult, you know, what are the other choices?

753
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,020
Speaker 0: Like non-stop, and all that stuff.

754
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,960
Speaker 1: And all music.

755
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:56,840
Speaker 1: And if you choose easy mode, it removes all the songs from the song list, besides the easy ones.

756
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,459
Speaker 1: So, it's, you know, it's real good for noobs, you know, they pick easy on that screen, then they're all set.

757
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:13,000
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you pick all music mode, the first color of songs, because if you go up, you go to the roulette random, and then to the bottom of the list, the top of the list is all the new stuff.

758
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,360
Speaker 1: And then there's like the blues section, which is sort of like, you know, the hyper kind of stuff.

759
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,660
Speaker 1: I mean, Fifth Mix started that trend, where the hyper music was a different color.

760
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:21,950
Speaker 0: Yep.

761
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:23,880
Speaker 1: The higher BPM music.

762
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:26,700
Speaker 1: And then, under that, is like the pink songs.

763
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:27,498
Speaker 1: I think they were pink.

764
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:31,519
Speaker 1: And those are all the old school, you know, previous mix songs.

765
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:34,879
Speaker 0: But you'd think, I mean, we were very, I don't know, old school and picky.

766
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,080
Speaker 0: And you'd think, because normally, when all the other, like when Sixth Mix, and Seventh Mix, and Eighth Mix came out, we mostly just complained, like they took out all the good music.

767
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,659
Speaker 1: I mean, they did have, Sixth and Seventh Mix, and Eighth Mix, did have a lot of old songs brought back.

768
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,220
Speaker 1: But not enough, really.

769
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,558
Speaker 1: And not the really good ones.

770
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,120
Speaker 0: But this new one, it's mostly new music.

771
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:58,440
Speaker 0: But all of the new music is really good.

772
00:41:58,764 --> 00:41:59,319
Speaker 1: Not all of it.

773
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:00,920
Speaker 0: Well, with one exception so far.

774
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,140
Speaker 1: Enough of it is actually good.

775
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaker 0: I only played one bad song.

776
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,260
Speaker 0: And it wasn't that the song was bad, just that I really hated the arrows.

777
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, we haven't played enough of the songs to really get a perfect percentage.

778
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:15,280
Speaker 1: But there were plenty of good, there were plenty of good songs to be had.

779
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,240
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know, the other mix is not as many.

780
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,120
Speaker 1: Maybe two or three.

781
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,580
Speaker 1: This one, like, maybe ten good songs.

782
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,620
Speaker 0: The other nice thing is the foot ratings.

783
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,738
Speaker 0: You know, DDR songs have a foot rating from one to eight.

784
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,740
Speaker 0: And then there's nine and ten, but they're special.

785
00:42:29,662 --> 00:42:31,020
Speaker 0: Actually, here's a bit of trivia.

786
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,260
Speaker 0: I'm just curious if anyone knows this without googling.

787
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,680
Speaker 0: In the original versions of DDR, and this went on right up until the end of third mix, there was a name for every number of feet.

788
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was.

789
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:42,632
Speaker 0: Yes.

790
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,460
Speaker 0: So I can tell you, like, that nine feet was catastrophic.

791
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,480
Speaker 0: Anyone out there know all of them without looking it up?

792
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:52,359
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

793
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've gotten rid of that.

794
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,580
Speaker 1: Now it's just one through ten feet.

795
00:42:56,862 --> 00:43:01,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, though they still call things catastrophic and oni, but that's just people and not the game.

796
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,360
Speaker 0: Also, long time ago, they call everything, like, beginner or easy, difficult, challenging now.

797
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,439
Speaker 0: They used to call them something else.

798
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:12,400
Speaker 1: So that's what we still call them.

799
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:12,826
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,540
Speaker 0: You know, it used to be, what, basic trick maniac?

801
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:16,419
Speaker 1: Trick.

802
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:17,200
Speaker 1: That's right.

803
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,740
Speaker 1: Trick mode.

804
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,107
Speaker 1: Yeah.

805
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:19,840
Speaker 0: No one calls it that anymore.

806
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:21,040
Speaker 1: I call it trick and maniac.

807
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,159
Speaker 1: I don't call it basic, though.

808
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,060
Speaker 0: Well, no one plays basic.

809
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,600
Speaker 1: I call it easy trick and maniac.

810
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:24,994
Speaker 1: Yeah.

811
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:29,240
Speaker 0: If it says a song is seven feet, it's exactly seven feet.

812
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,360
Speaker 0: Like, it is exactly the difficulty I would want.

813
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:42,539
Speaker 0: And other than one song that was nine feet and, you know what, it was nine feet and I failed it, I was happy that I could still do all the difficult songs for the most part, even though they were brand new.

814
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not really sure how many feet of difficulty I can still do.

815
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,300
Speaker 1: I used to be able to do seven and eight foot songs.

816
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,160
Speaker 1: You know, eight foot songs most of the time and seven foot songs almost all the time.

817
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:52,500
Speaker 1: Yep.

818
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:57,400
Speaker 1: I think now I can do, like, six foot songs all the time and seven foot songs most of the time.

819
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:57,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

820
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,259
Speaker 1: So, like, if I rebuild, I think I can get back to where I was.

821
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:00,937
Speaker 0: I think you can.

822
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:02,679
Speaker 1: I just need to play some more.

823
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:10,140
Speaker 1: And, you know, I was losing interest in DDR, but now, for some reason, this new version has slightly rekindled the DDR spirit.

824
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,980
Speaker 0: I mean, we played more DDR on Saturday.

825
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,560
Speaker 1: Have we actually said Dance Dance Revolution during this podcast?

826
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,217
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

827
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,440
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you don't know, DDR is Dance Dance Revolution.

828
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,680
Speaker 1: It is a game with four arrows and you dance on the arrow.

829
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,248
Speaker 1: You don't, you dance on the arrows.

830
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,340
Speaker 0: I'll retroactively, the opener where we say, you know, it's whatever, this is Geek Nights, I'll say the names of the games we talk about.

831
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:35,695
Speaker 1: Okay.

832
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,598
Speaker 0: Just because.

833
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,276
Speaker 1: All right.

834
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,039
Speaker 0: But, yeah, we played more DDR on Saturday than we played in, like, the last year.

835
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:43,438
Speaker 1: That's about right, yeah.

836
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,939
Speaker 0: And during, when we go back after Otacon, I'm gonna play a lot of freaking DDR.

837
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:53,120
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm probably gonna have, like, a whole half a day to DDR and then I'm gonna beat Time Crisis 4 with a friend.

838
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,759
Speaker 0: And I think I have a new favorite song.

839
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,479
Speaker 0: I mean, Rhythm and Police is my favorite song in DDR.

840
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one's missing.

841
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,482
Speaker 1: And my favorite song in DDR is Music, which is not in-- ♪ When the music ♪.

842
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:05,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not in Supernova either.

843
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,080
Speaker 1: But that was in Supernova, Supernova would be the best mix, period.

844
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,500
Speaker 1: Because it would be missing nothing.

845
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:10,849
Speaker 1: Yeah.

846
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,740
Speaker 0: But, like, Rhythm and Police is my favorite song.

847
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,240
Speaker 0: And actually, I really miss Shooting Star and Flash Dance.

848
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this one had Sexy Planet in '59.

849
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:20,859
Speaker 0: It did, it had two versions of Silent Hill.

850
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had pretty good stuff.

851
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 0: But there's a song called Dragon Blade.

852
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:30,920
Speaker 0: And on, like, on Maniac, that is an awesome freaking song.

853
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,380
Speaker 0: And I might like it more than I like Rhythm and Police.

854
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,459
Speaker 0: I don't know, I'm gonna have to play it a couple times and make sure.

855
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:36,994
Speaker 1: We'll see.

856
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta play them both side by side before I can determine.

857
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, the beginning part of that song was pretty good, but then the middle part was kinda...

858
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the thing is, it's, what I like about it is that-- Arrows-wise.

859
00:45:46,982 --> 00:45:48,899
Speaker 0: I love the arrows, because they're a stream.

860
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,960
Speaker 0: But they're a very... They're not an off-beat stream, but they're interesting rhythms.

861
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,255
Speaker 0: But they're not stupid rhythms like in some of those Max 300s.

862
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,499
Speaker 1: There was one song I played where, I forget what song it was, it was sort of Samba-y, I think.

863
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:02,839
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

864
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,280
Speaker 1: But, oh, this, also Wild Rush has made a comeback.

865
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love that song.

866
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,560
Speaker 1: But at one point, the arrows were, like, perfect.

867
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,680
Speaker 1: They were just, you know, completely steady.

868
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,519
Speaker 0: Like, arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow.

869
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:18,800
Speaker 1: And exactly, you know, they weren't too fast, they weren't too slow.

870
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:24,839
Speaker 1: I would just love a DDR song to just continue with that sort of rate of steady arrows just the whole time.

871
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:25,900
Speaker 1: That'd be perfect.

872
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,820
Speaker 1: But it was only for a small part of the song.

873
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, I guess I've gotten weird to the point that my favorite songs now are the ones that are really fast with a lot of arrows in the stream.

874
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,580
Speaker 0: Like, I don't like the tricky stuff with the holds and jumping around so much.

875
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:41,820
Speaker 0: But, like, a song like Sakura, I just love that stuff.

876
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,960
Speaker 1: There's some stuff that feels stompy, like, you know, like Japan, where it's like, dun-ka-dun-ka-dun-ka-dun-ka-dun.

877
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,936
Speaker 0: Or, chomp-chomp, right?

878
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,640
Speaker 0: Dun-ka-dun-ka-dun-ka-dun-ka-dun.

879
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:52,479
Speaker 1: I like the songs.

880
00:46:52,781 --> 00:47:02,299
Speaker 1: Even though, you know, I could probably do those arrows, it's like the way the music combines with the arrows is sort of like this painful grating kinda thing, that, like, hurts your knees.

881
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,742
Speaker 1: But I like the songs, even if they have more hours, and like,

882
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:06,789
Speaker 1: "do-do-do-do-do-do.".

883
00:47:09,742 --> 00:47:13,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like the songs that are like "da-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tata -tata-tata-tata".

884
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, music is like "be-be-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-".

885
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:21,680
Speaker 1: You know, something like that.

886
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's got that "tata-ta-ta-ta-ta-tata" section at the beginning and end.

887
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,009
Speaker 1: Yep.

888
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of songs that have that exact rhythm bit that I really enjoy in this mix.

889
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,439
Speaker 1: The whole "Arrows" is still slightly annoying, but not so bad.

890
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:37,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not stupid like they were in some of the 6th and 7th mix songs.

891
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still not sure, you know, like the best way to handle them sometimes.

892
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,380
Speaker 0: I think I'm used to them now.

893
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:53,320
Speaker 1: Like sometimes, I can do them just fine, but sometimes they put them in a weird way and I'm like, you would have had to know the song in advance or used an accelerator or something to make it right.

894
00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:04,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like my favorite songs all over are like Dropout, Shooting Star, Era, Rhythm and Police, Sakura, Dropout.

895
00:48:04,516 --> 00:48:05,660
Speaker 0: I really like, I said that already.

896
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,520
Speaker 1: I like a lot of those like, what was it, Hypnotic something.

897
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, Healing Vision.

898
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,000
Speaker 1: Not Healing Vision.

899
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,780
Speaker 0: I like Healing Vision.

900
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,000
Speaker 1: Uh, Night in Motion.

901
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:18,160
Speaker 1: That was a good one.

902
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,039
Speaker 0: Captain Jack.

903
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:19,619
Speaker 1: Captain Jack.

904
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,639
Speaker 0: Any Captain Jack song.

905
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:22,419
Speaker 1: Oh, Captain Jack, You Are Dead.

906
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,900
Speaker 0: Yep, one of my favorite songs that hasn't made a comeback since 8th mix is Dam Daryam.

907
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:27,762
Speaker 1: Eh.

908
00:48:28,362 --> 00:48:29,019
Speaker 0: I love that song.

909
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 0: That was the second song I ever passed on Trick.

910
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:33,355
Speaker 1: So?

911
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:35,679
Speaker 0: I like that song a lot.

912
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds so good.

913
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,259
Speaker 0: First song I ever passed on Maniac was Shooting Star.

914
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:38,807
Speaker 1: Eh.

915
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,520
Speaker 0: Because it's only seven feet.

916
00:48:41,624 --> 00:48:44,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, well then what was that other song that made a comeback, I forget.

917
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:45,939
Speaker 1: But it's good, I like it.

918
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:46,212
Speaker 1: Yeah.

919
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,039
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

920
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,550
Speaker 0: Oh well.

921
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:58,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll probably talk about these a bit after we come back from the week we spend there after Otacon, but this is- Putting in a bazillion dollars to beat it.

922
00:48:59,161 --> 00:49:00,739
Speaker 0: I think I'll count how many zombies I kill.

923
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:01,249
Speaker 1: Eh.

924
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:03,840
Speaker 0: I'll get someone to stand there with a counter or something.

925
00:49:04,681 --> 00:49:05,440
Speaker 1: I don't think that's gonna happen.

926
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,599
Speaker 0: Maybe we could interview people playing these games.

927
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:08,829
Speaker 0: Maybe.

928
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,660
Speaker 0: About arcades and these games.

929
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,320
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna have one hell of a couple weeks of shows after Otacon.

930
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,279
Speaker 0: That's all I gotta say.

931
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, we sure are.

932
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:22,639
Speaker 0: And of course, since some meta news, I talked about all this yesterday, but Scott and I both appeared on GeekSpeak.

933
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:26,360
Speaker 0: You can find a link in the forums and there's a link from yesterday's episode.

934
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,419
Speaker 1: I think it's SpeakGeekSpeak.com?

935
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

936
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:29,920
Speaker 0: Yep.

937
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,259
Speaker 0: Pretty sure.

938
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:37,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're on his whole show and as soon as Anime World Order puts up their next episode or maybe the one after that, we're on there.

939
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:37,818
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

940
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,420
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see if we're on there.

941
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,159
Speaker 0: We're on there.

942
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

943
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,680
Speaker 1: Most likely we'll be on there this show or the next show they do.

944
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,680
Speaker 0: They said we'll be on there.

945
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,199
Speaker 0: If we're not, I have more choice words.

946
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,320
Speaker 1: Oh, choice words.

947
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:52,079
Speaker 0: And check out the promos we made.

948
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:58,680
Speaker 0: They're... All the feedback I've gotten already, everyone likes the promo about how promos suck promo more than anything.

949
00:49:59,320 --> 00:49:59,390
Speaker 1: Yep.

950
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,180
Speaker 1: So, we'll see.

951
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,120
Speaker 1: We gotta toss these things up on the net and see if anyone plays them.

952
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,860
Speaker 0: I put one up on that podcast promo whatever.

953
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:07,819
Speaker 1: Okay, cool.

954
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,680
Speaker 0: Alrighty, I figured out how that worked and I listened to a bunch of promos and good God.

955
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,800
Speaker 0: Now, I don't want to just... I'm not going to name names, but good God, what are you people thinking?

956
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,559
Speaker 0: No one's going to want to listen to what you do after that.

957
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,592
Speaker 1: Well, you know what it really is, is a podcast.

958
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:27,758
Speaker 1: promo is a way to get other podcasts, people who are already podcast listeners...

959
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,520
Speaker 0: You know what's hilarious?

960
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,120
Speaker 1: ...to listen to your podcast instead of or in addition to an existing one.

961
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,140
Speaker 0: You're basically saying exactly what I said yesterday.

962
00:50:34,426 --> 00:50:34,620
Speaker 1: Yeah.

963
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,700
Speaker 0: I did yesterday's show on promoting podcasts.

964
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:37,600
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

965
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:37,830
Speaker 1: Yeah.

966
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,284
Speaker 1: Oh.

967
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:40,079
Speaker 0: Good job.

968
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:41,233
Speaker 0: I think we agree 100% on this.

969
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,159
Speaker 1: Okay, forget it then.

970
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it is true.

971
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,996
Speaker 0: I mean, all these promos are like, "So, you already listened to podcasts.

972
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:47,660
Speaker 0: Listen to mine.

973
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,571
Speaker 0: Every promo sounds like this.

974
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:50,519
Speaker 0: I'm going to make mine sound just like

975
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:50,620
Speaker 0: this.".

976
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:57,340
Speaker 1: You need to promote in other mediums, I think, to get new listeners to listen to you, because if you're the entry point, then you're the king.

977
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:00,300
Speaker 0: And that is exactly what we're going to do at Otacon.

978
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,038
Speaker 1: That is what we're going to do.

979
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:04,460
Speaker 0: So, once again, peace out.

980
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,260
Speaker 0: We'll see you tomorrow when on Anime Day, I think we're going to review some more anime.

981
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,240
Speaker 1: Oh, and I'm going to go catch up on these forums here, which you should join.

982
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:25,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, we had a surge of people join the forums over the weekend, and because I came back early, yesterday I authorized all of you, and I saw it looked like some of the email addresses might have been typos or something.

983
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,260
Speaker 1: Or might have been hotmail.

984
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I authorized all of you.

985
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,720
Speaker 0: We have not denied membership to anyone on the forums yet.

986
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,595
Speaker 1: Yep, so if you applied for membership to the Front Row Crew forums, and you didn't get an email saying, "Guess what?

987
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:47,179
Speaker 1: You're in," go to frontrowcrew.com, click on discussion forum, and sign in with whatever name and password you picked, and you'll be all set.

988
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,320
Speaker 0: In fact, not only have we never denied anyone, but we've only banned one person ever.

989
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,840
Speaker 1: Yep, for being very, very, very, very, very annoying.

990
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,639
Speaker 0: Yep, and despite that, he was not even a quarter as annoying as some other people I've seen on other forums.

991
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:05,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that means our forum is very enjoyable, and you should come because there are no annoying people there.

992
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, except for, you know, Scott.

993
00:52:08,782 --> 00:52:09,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

994
00:52:10,662 --> 00:52:11,380
Speaker 1: Or Rim.

995
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't been too active in the forums lately.

996
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,480
Speaker 0: I've been too busy.

997
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:16,375
Speaker 1: Me either, I haven't been here.

998
00:52:18,732 --> 00:52:18,959
Speaker 1: All right.

999
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:28,260
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1000
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,879
