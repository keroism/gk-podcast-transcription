1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,688
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 5th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:13,113
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:13,935
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,600
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,368
Speaker 0: Point and click adventure games.

6
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:20,242
Speaker 0: I can't believe we've never talked about these on Geek Nights before.

7
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:21,746
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,532
Speaker 0: What's up, Scott?

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,314
Speaker 0: You've been tantalizing me.

10
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,833
Speaker 1: We should start the "can't believe we haven't talked about these on Geek Nights before" series.

11
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:31,588
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the only place we're going to get new ideas.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,732
Speaker 0: Thing is, we've already talked about almost everything I can't believe we didn't talk about.

13
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:36,275
Speaker 0: The Simpsons didn't.

14
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:37,281
Speaker 1: Geek Nights did it.

15
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:41,298
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, you know, there's an old saying, "The good things come to those who

16
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:41,499
Speaker 1: wait.".

17
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,069
Speaker 1: And I know there's a lot of nerds out there.

18
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:44,377
Speaker 1: They don't like waiting for things.

19
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:47,153
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh my God, they got to see the thing as soon as it comes

20
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:47,515
Speaker 1: out.".

21
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:48,662
Speaker 1: Or, "They got to go to the midnight

22
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,124
Speaker 1: screening.".

23
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,538
Speaker 0: You got to wait in line at Hall H to see the thing.

24
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,951
Speaker 0: that's going to be on YouTube sooner than you can see it.

25
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,308
Speaker 1: Got to play Portal 2 at PAX because I can't play, "Oh wait, it's $5 now.

26
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:57,570
Speaker 1: Gee.".

27
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:59,761
Speaker 1: You know, "Oh my God, I have to wait for another season of

28
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:00,163
Speaker 1: Ponies.".

29
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:00,645
Speaker 1: Guess what?

30
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:02,634
Speaker 1: At this time, we've already done that twice.

31
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,664
Speaker 1: And the third one's almost over already.

32
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:06,655
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's easy to forget that.

33
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:08,022
Speaker 1: The waiting is so short.

34
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:12,123
Speaker 0: It is easy to forget that because, you know, we were watching Ponies a long but then we had a lull.

35
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:18,387
Speaker 0: So Adventure Time has four whole seasons out and we marathoned through that shit like butter.

36
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,958
Speaker 0: I hit the end, it's like hitting a brick wall.

37
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:23,569
Speaker 0: Now I got to wait a week for a half episode?

38
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:23,911
Speaker 1: Yep.

39
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,203
Speaker 1: Well, I got to tell you, there's something I've been waiting for since 2011.

40
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:28,887
Speaker 1: Okay, so Half Life 3 longer than that.

41
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:29,649
Speaker 0: And I have it right now.

42
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:36,148
Speaker 0: Oh, that was totally worth waiting two years for.

43
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,876
Speaker 0: Scott, I hate you so much.

44
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,362
Speaker 1: That was worth waiting two years for.

45
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:41,690
Speaker 0: I can't believe that exists.

46
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,196
Speaker 0: You have it in our house.

47
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,064
Speaker 0: You put it in my fucking eyeball.

48
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,612
Speaker 1: You see how bright that shit was?

49
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:47,979
Speaker 0: That was pretty fucking bright.

50
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,128
Speaker 1: That was worth waiting two years easily.

51
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:50,671
Speaker 1: See?

52
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,077
Speaker 1: It's like I didn't wait at all.

53
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,984
Speaker 1: I feel like I bought that on Kickstarter yesterday.

54
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,939
Speaker 0: But you have ruined one of my greatest go to sticks.

55
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,564
Speaker 0: Your eyeball.

56
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,767
Speaker 0: Also my eyeball.

57
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:07,992
Speaker 0: Anytime Kickstarter comes up, what I'll always be like, I'll always turn to Scott and be like, yeah, just like your Hexbrite.

58
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,359
Speaker 0: When did you kickstart that?

59
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:12,669
Speaker 1: 2011.

60
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,231
Speaker 1: I looked it up.

61
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:13,974
Speaker 1: That's how come I know.

62
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:15,298
Speaker 0: Why did I turn around?

63
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,884
Speaker 0: My brain was like, don't turn around, Rym.

64
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,632
Speaker 0: But it was too late.

65
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:21,204
Speaker 1: My body was like, are you seeing a nice spot in your eye?

66
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:21,646
Speaker 0: I actually.

67
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was actually on the highest setting.

68
00:02:24,118 --> 00:02:26,350
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good flashlight and it has three settings.

69
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,417
Speaker 1: Also the blinking setting.

70
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,502
Speaker 0: So is it going to be in stores?

71
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:29,447
Speaker 0: Can I just go buy it?

72
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,107
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll show you all the details of it later without putting in your eye to turn around again.

73
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,332
Speaker 0: It's not.

74
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,276
Speaker 1: It's in my bag now.

75
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:37,823
Speaker 1: I still don't trust you.

76
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:38,849
Speaker 0: I'm not going to turn around.

77
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,504
Speaker 1: It overheats if you leave it in that setting too long.

78
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,046
Speaker 0: Really?

79
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:42,709
Speaker 1: Slightly.

80
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:42,890
Speaker 1: Yeah.

81
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,777
Speaker 1: It has an auto off in the heat feature.

82
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,515
Speaker 1: So if it gets too hot, like if you leave it in a bag on by accident, it'll turn itself off.

83
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:49,962
Speaker 1: It's pretty amazing.

84
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:57,638
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, so, and if you've kickstarted something and it's been a long time since you've received it, odds are you're not gonna, but it's still possible.

85
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,264
Speaker 1: Don't lose hope and don't become impatient with anything ever because there's a whole world of things, right?

86
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,711
Speaker 1: I mean that new ghost in the shell.

87
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,842
Speaker 1: go a show that'll be out tomorrow pretty much.

88
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually it'll be out in about a week.

89
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:10,374
Speaker 1: Yeah.

90
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:12,544
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not, you know, what's, what's the rush.

91
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,096
Speaker 0: So all I got is some, my office, right?

92
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,302
Speaker 0: You know, we talk about memes.

93
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:26,312
Speaker 0: Actually we haven't talked about memes a lot on the show, but Scott and I have talked about memes for a long time and you know, as a unit of information that spreads like a virus through humans, you know, all that kind of stuff.

94
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:29,788
Speaker 0: We're not, when I say meme, I don't mean a lolcat with impact font though.

95
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:30,551
Speaker 0: That is a meme.

96
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,640
Speaker 0: That is not what a meme means.

97
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,780
Speaker 0: But a meme made its way through my office and it's, I'm like watching it cultivate and grow.

98
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:40,683
Speaker 0: It's like a fish ball.

99
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:50,304
Speaker 0: So one day one of my coworkers just kind of whistles, you know, little thing.

100
00:03:50,324 --> 00:04:00,487
Speaker 0: And unlike any other tune that has been whistled or anything like that or even Gangnam style, this just kind of got repeated around the office, kind of in a loop and there weren't that many people in.

101
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,549
Speaker 0: And every day as days go by, different people kind of just do it randomly and hum it.

102
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:10,048
Speaker 0: And people who weren't in the office before come in and they hear it, they replicate it out.

103
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,003
Speaker 0: Someone's doing it every five minutes now unconsciously.

104
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:17,473
Speaker 0: And it's just.

105
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:20,944
Speaker 1: That's from a song, but I can't exactly put my finger on it right now.

106
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:26,587
Speaker 0: So I'm going to keep tabs on this and I'm curious if it's going to make it from me to other people.

107
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:32,952
Speaker 1: It feels really familiar, like an old video game song or a portion of a song from something, a soundtrack.

108
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,885
Speaker 0: It might be some garbage pop song, we just don't know the name of it.

109
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:43,115
Speaker 1: No, I think it's either from a video game or it's a sound effect or it's from an OST, like a portion of a song from an OST.

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,781
Speaker 1: I feel like the part after that goes like, you know, doo

111
00:04:45,841 --> 00:05:26,163
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

112
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,227
Speaker 1: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:30,489
Speaker 0: doo

114
00:05:30,509 --> 00:06:39,821
Speaker 1: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

115
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,160
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

116
00:07:09,180 --> 00:08:39,120
Speaker 1: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

117
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,403
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo doo

118
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:36,147
Speaker 1: doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

119
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,741
Speaker 0: so that's a cool thing right?

120
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:11,460
Speaker 0: so i have my augmented reality glasses and that stuff just built in there right?

121
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:14,879
Speaker 0: so i can see heat signatures of things.

122
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,860
Speaker 0: so i can see which card you were holding most recently.

123
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:24,260
Speaker 0: if you just did something in a game of cards and the cards were shuffled is that cheating?

124
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:37,251
Speaker 0: maybe so i think there is going to be a problem in the board gaming world and only the tabletop board gaming world casinos can cover it.

125
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:44,099
Speaker 1: there's already all sorts of devices you can use to cheat in a casino and casinos already keep those out.

126
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:48,895
Speaker 1: well for now they'll just be like hey you can't wear that shit in the casino.

127
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:53,139
Speaker 0: so then when i have my cyber eyes no cyber eyes in the casino?

128
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
Speaker 1: exactly, people with cyber eyes can't gamble.

129
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:11,660
Speaker 1: wait a minute, the rich people who are willing to spend money on ridiculous extravagances stay out of our casino the rich people who are willing to go into this EMP area or they'll invent some sort of un-cheatable system where you don't have the physical cards.

130
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,611
Speaker 1: it's some digital thing you're not plugged in.

131
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,696
Speaker 1: they'll just use some other system.

132
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:17,100
Speaker 1: that doesn't.

133
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,949
Speaker 0: here's how casinos get around that they have a ton of money.

134
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,159
Speaker 0: craps has the best odds.

135
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:28,555
Speaker 0: there's a reason why in most casinos craps is so expensive per play that most people can't play it.

136
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:29,840
Speaker 1: you can play craps.

137
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,514
Speaker 1: you put whatever the minimum chip is on whatever the line.

138
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:40,717
Speaker 0: and the last several times i've been in a casino the minimum entry point on any craps table was 100 bucks up.

139
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:44,819
Speaker 1: oh i've seen like 10 dollar craps i have, but not often.

140
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:46,780
Speaker 0: it depends on the time of day.

141
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,500
Speaker 1: who's gonna pay 100 dollars on one roll of the dice?

142
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:50,199
Speaker 1: you insane.

143
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,319
Speaker 1: i'm like i don't wanna buy a 3ds cause there's not enough games out.

144
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:59,037
Speaker 1: dude if i'm willing to put 100 dollars on the roll of a dice i'll buy two 3ds before i do that shit.

145
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:07,784
Speaker 0: what i'm saying is that casinos will minimize games or eliminate games over time culturally that have good odds or that could be game by.

146
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:08,979
Speaker 0: systems like that, separate question.

147
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:19,840
Speaker 0: tabletop competitive games ortho games to use the richard garfield terminology are gonna have a big problem when augmented reality is ubiquitous.

148
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:37,499
Speaker 0: because while there's the social contract of don't cheat during games you can't bring in external shit, like if scott got a piece of paper and started writing down how many victory points people were taking during a game in puerto rico or flipping a coin to act randomly, no no no this is a social contract.

149
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:47,460
Speaker 0: but when all those interactions are invisible and indistinguishable from what if you just have a really good memory that's a problem.

150
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:53,166
Speaker 0: there's a solution that you're completely missing board game mode and my electronic eyeballs?

151
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:54,460
Speaker 1: that's exactly right.

152
00:12:55,146 --> 00:13:00,279
Speaker 1: if you have these magic eyeballs that can change colors, well obviously they can project any image to your eyes, right?

153
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:16,500
Speaker 1: so you don't even have fucking cards that could have heat signatures on them, both just you and the other guy are playing a video game and the display is your electronic eyeballs and when you look at the table you see cards that aren't there and you touch them to move them around but they're not actually there.

154
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:24,740
Speaker 1: so you can't possibly cheat unless you hack which is the same exact problem that we already have with Counter Strike video game cheating which is gonna have the same solution.

155
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:33,980
Speaker 1: so you headed me off, which is good because it means we're kind of on the same page with all this stuff right, so as soon as I have electronic eyeballs we have to be the first people to make Puerto Rico Electronic Eyeball Edition.

156
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:39,528
Speaker 0: so here's why I said it's a problem for board games not because it makes-

157
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:43,930
Speaker 1: oh no, people will stop sending money so that China can print games on cardboard, oh no

158
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:55,420
Speaker 0: no, because now, right now if someone wants to design a board game they basically don't need anything except their brain and pieces of paper and you know, fiddly bits

159
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,459
Speaker 1: oh, they're gonna have to learn to code.

160
00:13:57,443 --> 00:14:01,899
Speaker 1: all board games will become video games amongst people with electronic eyeballs.

161
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:11,359
Speaker 0: basically yes suddenly board game development just becomes an interface for video game development which is something nerds have wanted for a long time.

162
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:22,338
Speaker 0: but I foresee that being a hugely disruptive period, especially in tabletop tournament gaming and that whole industry is gonna get really fucked by this.

163
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:28,600
Speaker 0: now the nice result is, it's pretty much a win for the gamers and for the game designers.

164
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:37,220
Speaker 1: A, you can just pirate all the board games right, you don't have to have a tabletop library, you just need the other people and everyone has electronic eyes.

165
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,818
Speaker 1: everyone can play every game ever.

166
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,010
Speaker 0: but I'm even pumped.

167
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,371
Speaker 0: now about Augmented Reality in tabletop games,

168
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:48,736
Speaker 1: oh no, I won't have to set up Eclipse, I'll just blink and I'll take a look at Eclipse, oh Eclipse is on the table don't you see it, yeah I see it

169
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:55,923
Speaker 0: there it is, but once we get to that point where a tabletop game is really just a video game and the bits are just an interface and

170
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,879
Speaker 1: it'll be so much faster to play, you won't mess up any rules.

171
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:17,420
Speaker 0: thus, the problem with the kinds of tabletop games we like now and while this is not an insurmountable problem it is not a problem that's going to be easily surmountable by most people why do we always say that tabletop games are the best games to study in design when you're a novice designer and why they tend to be very elegant?

172
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,778
Speaker 1: because the limitations of the physical world can strain your design decision.

173
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:39,140
Speaker 0: so suddenly if the physical world is not a limitation again but is simply a manifestation of the interface we again no longer have that limitation and it lets the non-genius non-expert game designers basically, it ruins their ability to make a good game.

174
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:55,160
Speaker 1: no it doesn't, because they can still create the game physically, right forgetting all those, you know, the fact that people can cheat with using their magic eyes and then once they've designed that beautiful game, just translate it into a digital version as has been very successful for many a developer.

175
00:15:55,281 --> 00:16:05,241
Speaker 0: but the people who will design faster and rise faster in the early days of this are the ones who are game designers and programmers leaving everyone else in the dust, thus making it the point where well.

176
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:18,850
Speaker 1: I think, you know, if they were public companies I would invest a bit in the companies that are, such as Big Daddy's Creations who have made a business of taking other people's games and turning them into iOS, iPad PC apps.

177
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:21,360
Speaker 0: That is an apt investment that I think I would agree with.

178
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:30,287
Speaker 1: Those companies are going to do very well and in fact I would not be surprised if some of those companies started hiring the board game designers instead of just you know, taking contracts from other game companies.

179
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:37,519
Speaker 0: Because I was thinking about this and I realized how rapidly all the strictures of tabletop break down, like, even forget the heat signatures, alright, I'm holding cards.

180
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:48,690
Speaker 1: well, if I have Google Glasses or something like it recording everything that's going on constantly You could rewind and play the shell game to see and you could find where the card was.

181
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,119
Speaker 0: No, better, I could rewind because everyone holds their cards, right?

182
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,570
Speaker 0: There's that moment where for a second you lean forward a little bit and the cards are visible for a second but no human could actually see what they were.

183
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,949
Speaker 1: And you rewind to that exact frame on your 60fps video.

184
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:06,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, suddenly my thing just shows me, like, here's the, it has an overlay of.

185
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:14,367
Speaker 0: here's our best guess as to what's in everyone's hands based on glances we've seen or reflections off of eyeballs with the 8K camera Yeah.

186
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:19,838
Speaker 1: So The 8K camera in my own eyeball I think is a ways off.

187
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, but within our lifetime I think.

188
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:24,959
Speaker 1: We'll be old.

189
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,207
Speaker 0: If that's the best time, it means that when my body starts falling apart We're gonna need it.

190
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:33,134
Speaker 1: You'll be lucky if you can even see at all.

191
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:41,320
Speaker 0: When I'm old I'm gonna be a brain attached to artificial genitalia and and a USB interface for playing Counter Strike.

192
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:48,890
Speaker 1: We can only hope as the genitalia is for the Counter Strike So you can talk about it while you play Counter Strike.

193
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,919
Speaker 1: That's the only reason you need it.

194
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,072
Speaker 0: No, but then you also need a joint.

195
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,123
Speaker 1: It's not like it's gonna work.

196
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:56,244
Speaker 0: You also need a marijuana simulator so you can talk about how high you are.

197
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:07,414
Speaker 1: But no, actually you won't need it anymore But anyway Things of the day!

198
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:15,739
Speaker 0: I would normally make this a Wednesday geek night thing, but I'll make it a Tuesday thing to spread the love and the horrible judgement of the moon.

199
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:21,031
Speaker 0: There's a guy, he was thinking a long time ago, and he would recreate openers to anime.

200
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:22,686
Speaker 0: Like Fist of the North Star.

201
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:32,852
Speaker 0: But he would do it live action and play all the parts and basically dress up and then make himself be all the characters in all the scenes in the entire opener.

202
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:33,420
Speaker 0: It's hilarious.

203
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,469
Speaker 0: Different guy is doing something similar and this is something pretty fantastic.

204
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:44,611
Speaker 0: Basically he's doing that with surprisingly better cosplay skills than I exhibited at RIT.

205
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:54,412
Speaker 0: Which isn't saying much Making costumes out of construction paper and redoing all of the transformation sequences from Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

206
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,019
Speaker 0: Your favorite Not my favorite, but you know what?

207
00:18:57,885 --> 00:19:00,638
Speaker 0: I do not regret having watched that entire show.

208
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:06,057
Speaker 0: So you should watch this and I'm not sure what you'll think of it.

209
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,983
Speaker 1: Okay, so this dude is playing I guess paintball it looks like?

210
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:17,872
Speaker 1: It doesn't look like airsoft and he's playing apparently a game called I guess CQB.

211
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:27,607
Speaker 1: no, I think the place is CQB Tactical and they're playing a game called One Man Army and in the description it says "Game was based around one floor at a time.

212
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:32,860
Speaker 1: Attackers have unlimited lives, defenders one life, and are timed on how long it takes to clear the floor.

213
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,305
Speaker 1: Rest of my team got finished off as I came around and shot the last two guys.

214
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:43,729
Speaker 1: I stayed quiet in one of the side rooms and to my surprise not one single person decided to check that they were clear.

215
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,528
Speaker 1: This was the result of that.

216
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:46,882
Speaker 1: Full video of day to

217
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:47,205
Speaker 1: follow.".

218
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:50,558
Speaker 1: So this video is just a 1 minute 19 second video.

219
00:19:50,578 --> 00:20:00,216
Speaker 1: so that's pretty short and a large portion of this video is spent with him in a room just quiet waiting in the dark but he basically pops

220
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:00,619
Speaker 0: out

221
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:08,642
Speaker 1: and nobody knew he was in there and they were all facing the other way and he takes out enough people to make a thing of the day.

222
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:13,692
Speaker 0: So when you started telling this story what I was going to say but I did not interrupt because I wanted to see if it was the story.

223
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,925
Speaker 1: He's got like a GoPro on his gun or something.

224
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,570
Speaker 0: That was a clutch moment.

225
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,613
Speaker 0: I am a connoisseur of clutch moment Counter Strike YouTube videos.

226
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:22,865
Speaker 1: Yeah well this isn't Counter Strike.

227
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,096
Speaker 1: this is the paintball for real.

228
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:24,480
Speaker 1: Exactly.

229
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,418
Speaker 1: So this is more clutch.

230
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,267
Speaker 1: I mean he takes out like 2 Counter Strike teams worth of people.

231
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:41,914
Speaker 0: Yeah because it's one thing in Counter Strike In Counter Strike when my guy runs across the entire map murdering everyone that's not as impressive as a human running and murdering everyone because fingers get hurt and people get tired.

232
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:51,408
Speaker 1: I especially like how at one point he says "whoop whoop whoop bitches" and the second top comment on YouTube is "whoop whoop whoop bitches".

233
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,373
Speaker 0: Are you sure he wasn't playing Counter Strike?

234
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:56,660
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm sure you can check it out yourself.

235
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,843
Speaker 1: So in the meantime PEX East coming up soon we're going to be there March right?

236
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:04,600
Speaker 0: Yes March.

237
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:12,480
Speaker 0: we are doing not one March 22nd through 24th possibly three but probably two panel.

238
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:13,550
Speaker 0: well actually lectures.

239
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,589
Speaker 0: we call them panels but they're lectures at PEX East.

240
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,215
Speaker 0: We are doing announced officially here.

241
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,913
Speaker 0: I'm delaying because I'm scrolling through the email to find the titles again.

242
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:38,502
Speaker 0: We are doing Mastering Game Mechanics at noon on Saturday March 23rd and we are doing Practical Game Theory at 1.30 on Saturday in the same room p.m.

243
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:48,558
Speaker 0: p.m These are both going to be two pretty cool lectures because the room might not have a stage and we tell you guys right now might not video them.

244
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,276
Speaker 0: it's way hard to video a lecture if the panelists aren't on a stage we'll see.

245
00:21:55,082 --> 00:22:00,296
Speaker 0: Kineticon submissions are open and it's February so we're starting to schedule stuff.

246
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:10,377
Speaker 0: so if you want to present at Kineticon in Hartford Connecticut a convention about literally everything which is the week before PEX OSS in August submit your shit.

247
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:20,757
Speaker 0: and Scott myself and one other person are the sole deciders of whether or not you get to present and if you present enough we'll give you a free badge.

248
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,420
Speaker 1: Is there any other meta like the book club?

249
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,600
Speaker 0: The book club book was The Great Gatsby.

250
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,508
Speaker 0: we both finished it.

251
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,139
Speaker 0: we'll do the show as soon as we have a Thursday episode free to do it.

252
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,540
Speaker 0: if you didn't read it you're a bad person.

253
00:22:31,004 --> 00:22:34,179
Speaker 0: if you read it and didn't like it you're a bad person.

254
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,609
Speaker 1: I'm going to pick another book soon.

255
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,885
Speaker 1: I don't even know what really?

256
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:40,159
Speaker 0: What's that book going to be?

257
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,866
Speaker 0: I don't know.

258
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:41,476
Speaker 0: Pressure's on.

259
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,064
Speaker 1: I should stick with my plan of pick book.

260
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:46,679
Speaker 1: I own physically but have not read yet.

261
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:50,060
Speaker 0: I'm just warning you the second you pick something I don't like it's all non-fiction.

262
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:52,280
Speaker 0: or The Count of Monte Cristo.

263
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:54,420
Speaker 0: you would like The Count of Monte Cristo a lot.

264
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:55,368
Speaker 0: it's so long.

265
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,794
Speaker 0: The thing is you'll read it so fast because it's so awesome.

266
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:03,548
Speaker 1: Anyway anyway let's forget about any other metas right now.

267
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,386
Speaker 0: yeah we got videos online.

268
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:10,984
Speaker 0: I uploaded the third and final of our presentations from magfest 11 and he immediately goes into more meta.

269
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,228
Speaker 0: well I won't tell people I got a thing out.

270
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,185
Speaker 1: okay good is that?

271
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:15,670
Speaker 1: it is that all?

272
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,074
Speaker 1: it's all.

273
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,366
Speaker 1: that is all all right.

274
00:23:17,427 --> 00:23:20,035
Speaker 0: so I can't believe we didn't talk about this.

275
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:20,420
Speaker 0: I'm pretty.

276
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:21,880
Speaker 0: I searched the theme song.

277
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:24,873
Speaker 0: we may have talked about this.

278
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:34,176
Speaker 1: we may have talked about this but in searching our website extensively with many methods I have not found any links to it.

279
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:39,408
Speaker 1: therefore we've I don't think we've ever done an episode on the point and click adventure game genre.

280
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:48,540
Speaker 1: so let us do that now because it is a genre of games that is beloved by many is of historical significance and is a recent resurgence.

281
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:53,833
Speaker 0: now we can talk about like actual history and things later.

282
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,287
Speaker 1: you can read about that on Wikipedia.

283
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,843
Speaker 0: yeah we're just talking about our own experiences and our own thoughts on these things.

284
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:00,620
Speaker 0: you know back to classic geek nights.

285
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,380
Speaker 0: you know a little bit of Dave and Joel style a little less anime world order style.

286
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:14,540
Speaker 0: so the reason I thought of this and Scott thought of this and Scott hasn't heard of this game though I'm really interested in it is that Kentucky Route Zero is this indie game.

287
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,328
Speaker 0: that is a point and click adventure but it does.

288
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:20,320
Speaker 0: it's not like old point and click adventures.

289
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:24,660
Speaker 0: okay and it reminds me kind of if you look at the graphics of Out of This World.

290
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,419
Speaker 1: oh like Flashback.

291
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,307
Speaker 0: yeah well Flashback came way later.

292
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,893
Speaker 0: Out of This World was the first one right and they're not.

293
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:35,025
Speaker 0: they're not really in the same genre but they'll they're remnant.

294
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:35,955
Speaker 0: anyway I digress.

295
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:42,659
Speaker 0: so I'll get back to why I think Kentucky Route Zero might be different but it has to do with things James Portnow said.

296
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:49,989
Speaker 0: you might know him from Penny Arcade stuff in our video from Magfest anyway.

297
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:56,740
Speaker 0: so the only point and click adventures I've ever actually liked were Maniac Mansion.

298
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:00,175
Speaker 0: but that's because I've never played anything like that before Shadowgate.

299
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:03,670
Speaker 1: because I'm a moron I like Déjà Vu more than Shadowgate.

300
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,449
Speaker 0: I liked them both equally.

301
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,854
Speaker 1: I beat Déjà Vu without cheating or looking up any facts or anything like that as did I.

302
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:15,409
Speaker 0: I beat Shadowgate mostly on my own but I looked in not facts.

303
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,480
Speaker 0: but I had a Nintendo Power.

304
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,105
Speaker 1: I actually didn't play Shadowgate until the emulator era but I had a strategy guide of NES games I didn't own and Shadowgate was in there.

305
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,510
Speaker 0: so I rented Shadowgate and I didn't know what to expect.

306
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:33,508
Speaker 0: and I remember playing through it and I was like I thought it was the most awesome thing ever because I was dumb and didn't really realize what was going on mostly because of the crazy deaths.

307
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:37,891
Speaker 1: all I cared about was alright we've talked about enough about Shadowgate crazy deaths.

308
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:39,265
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to talk about it more.

309
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:43,231
Speaker 0: Déjà Vu it's all about punching that mugger three times but not four times.

310
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,420
Speaker 0: no don't punch that other mugger but don't shoot him either.

311
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,340
Speaker 1: if you punched him three times don't go in the alley anymore.

312
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:51,569
Speaker 1: you only have to go in the alley three times at most right.

313
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,298
Speaker 1: just don't go that way.

314
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:56,573
Speaker 0: the only problem is if that other asshole mugger shows up anyway.

315
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,540
Speaker 1: anyway if you run out of money for the taxi.

316
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,611
Speaker 1: that's why you have to win the lottery in the slot machine.

317
00:26:01,631 --> 00:26:02,499
Speaker 1: I'm gonna admit something.

318
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,791
Speaker 0: I hated King's Quest King's Quest 1.

319
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,922
Speaker 0: I just I hated it.

320
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,820
Speaker 0: I wanted nothing to do with that fucking game.

321
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,546
Speaker 1: I didn't hate them but I didn't play them significantly long.

322
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,691
Speaker 0: enough amounts of time to start to hate them.

323
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:14,216
Speaker 1: but it's not like.

324
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:15,206
Speaker 1: I loved them where I was like.

325
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,580
Speaker 1: I couldn't play them and I couldn't stop.

326
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,184
Speaker 1: I just sort of played them a little bit and said oh that's what King's Quest is like.

327
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:24,622
Speaker 0: okay I played King's Quest 1, 4 I think 5.

328
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:27,443
Speaker 0: I know I never played 2.

329
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:29,004
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the list of King's Quest.

330
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:39,269
Speaker 0: yes I definitely played King's Quest and King's Quest 4 and King's Quest 5 was on a computer at my school but I never actually played it.

331
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:42,176
Speaker 1: most of the ones I played I played King's Quest 1.

332
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:44,398
Speaker 0: I played 5 because that's the one that was on the NES.

333
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:46,440
Speaker 1: I never played any on the NES.

334
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,884
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that there was one on there.

335
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,120
Speaker 0: King's Quest 5 was on the NES.

336
00:26:50,181 --> 00:26:51,653
Speaker 0: it really sucks to play.

337
00:26:51,713 --> 00:27:06,039
Speaker 1: I played King's Quest 1 a little bit just to learn historically what it was like and I also played one or two of the ones that were sort of Windows 3.1 era where you would right click to change the mouse cursor and single click to do that action on the thing.

338
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:08,885
Speaker 1: I see some screenshots of them here.

339
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,389
Speaker 1: let's see which one is this this is King's Quest 6.

340
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:13,336
Speaker 1: I think I might have played 6 a little bit.

341
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,117
Speaker 1: this is I Heart Chaos King's Quest 3.

342
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:29,920
Speaker 0: I might have played King's Quest 3 it's possible but basically I didn't enjoy them primarily because I was used to playing action games or puzzle-y games and I just didn't enjoy the kinds of puzzles in King's Quest games.

343
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:33,190
Speaker 0: they felt very arbitrary.

344
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,533
Speaker 1: well that's exactly the problem of most of these point and click adventure games in general.

345
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:46,991
Speaker 1: right I beat what was the one the one that everyone really likes the Skull Guy I beat it a long time ago.

346
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,969
Speaker 1: and Grim Fandango Grim Fandango yeah.

347
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:50,099
Speaker 1: so I beat that one.

348
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:52,967
Speaker 1: right is that so much of these games?

349
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:53,916
Speaker 1: is it's really?

350
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:54,987
Speaker 1: I hesitate?

351
00:27:55,714 --> 00:28:03,431
Speaker 1: I guess it's more of a game than Dungeon Village but even so it's really just a story a cartoon.

352
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:07,334
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure in that there's branching but it's not.

353
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:09,878
Speaker 1: but it's not that you choose.

354
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,120
Speaker 0: there usually isn't actually branching.

355
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,049
Speaker 1: well that's exactly it.

356
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:19,269
Speaker 1: each branch is incredibly short and ends in a death or an end of game and then you just return to the main trunk.

357
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:30,220
Speaker 1: there's no thick branches that really go far away and have a different ending and most of these most of them is one big long trunk with the real ending at the end and very tiny branches.

358
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:45,470
Speaker 1: if you choose an incorrect action you will die or soon die but you want to do those most of them to see all those animations of funny jokes that result from them because a lot of them the different ways to die actually do a different way to die and there's something to see and this content.

359
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,077
Speaker 0: I think Quest for Glory was the best in terms of crazy deaths.

360
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:53,287
Speaker 1: right but then you just return back to the trunk and try to figure out the thing you're supposed to do to continue and not die.

361
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,236
Speaker 0: see you talk about the trunk.

362
00:28:54,317 --> 00:29:06,602
Speaker 0: I do feel we were talking about this earlier that there are at least two sort of distinct within this genre a word I use very lightly these days that there's like full throttle and a lot of the scum.

363
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:13,975
Speaker 0: games were much more linear and they'd like be in an area and you'd interact with all the shit in that area and then you go to the next area exactly.

364
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:20,839
Speaker 0: meanwhile games like the King's Quest even though they do some Legend of Zelda can't get there from here till you got the hook shot.

365
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:27,052
Speaker 0: they'd still be a much more like they'd be a grid instead of a line of go around and go figure out.

366
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:34,926
Speaker 0: oh I got to go here with this thing and then back over to here and then there were games like just because they had more screens per area.

367
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:36,444
Speaker 1: doesn't really make it right.

368
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:36,666
Speaker 1: I mean.

369
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,163
Speaker 1: what about those ones that are like?

370
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:39,439
Speaker 0: no it does in one sense.

371
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,539
Speaker 1: what about those ones that like escape the room?

372
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:44,080
Speaker 1: they're no different it's just more or less complex.

373
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,820
Speaker 1: it doesn't make it a different kind of game.

374
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:48,320
Speaker 0: well no I didn't say it was like a different kind of game.

375
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,373
Speaker 0: I said they are distinct.

376
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:58,947
Speaker 0: in one sense the grid ones have an initial sort of long discovery phase where you're discovering this world and you're like making a map for yourself.

377
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:02,810
Speaker 1: oh because they're more complex they have an extra part to the game just in the geography.

378
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:06,200
Speaker 0: no other aspect the fact that it's a big two dimensional grid.

379
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:08,180
Speaker 0: you're thinking to yourself like where is that village?

380
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:13,835
Speaker 0: again you're taking notes like alright this place had this but in like full throttle you're walking back and forth.

381
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,682
Speaker 1: yeah the other ones do still have that but it's very short right?

382
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:18,096
Speaker 1: it's like okay there's three screens.

383
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:22,320
Speaker 1: you can go to look at all three of them right and figure out all the things you can interact with on all of them.

384
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:30,220
Speaker 0: King's Quest had discovery and exploration but full throttle really just had discovery.

385
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:31,699
Speaker 0: like here's the new area.

386
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:33,674
Speaker 0: see all the things in this area.

387
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,690
Speaker 0: move on King's Quest also.

388
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:43,068
Speaker 1: you had to actually explore right now what the thing is full throttle and others like it did have something that the others didn't have which is an action element.

389
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:47,229
Speaker 1: in fact they basically put in a mini game or another game where it's like.

390
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:58,079
Speaker 1: yeah not only do you have to do the usual point and click figure out the stupid logic bullshit but you also have to play this motorcycle racing game and be able to survive to the end of the motorcycle racing game.

391
00:30:58,645 --> 00:30:59,877
Speaker 1: uh and then that's the only you know.

392
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,856
Speaker 1: so that would be like it's like okay enough puzzle solving.

393
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:10,748
Speaker 1: now do shooting you know and there's some I'm sure there's adventure games you have to shoot or you have to do platforming or you have to do other.

394
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:15,494
Speaker 1: skills are tested to progress in addition to just figuring out the puzzles.

395
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:20,599
Speaker 1: so a fact won't help you beat the entire game automatically like it would with say Maniac Mansion.

396
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:23,275
Speaker 0: now the ones that I liked.

397
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:33,620
Speaker 0: I really like Police Quest because the only problem with Police Quest is that the driving was the worst driving in any game ever.

398
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,359
Speaker 1: I just remember the elevator in Police Quest.

399
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:36,798
Speaker 0: oh my god up the elevator down.

400
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:52,400
Speaker 0: the thing is Police Quest I liked because it was so fucking boring and so fucking procedural and it's like alright go into the locker room, change your police uniform, get your keys, go upstairs, go to the briefing, back into the elevator, click the button, close the door go downstairs, put the hank up on the tube.

401
00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:05,140
Speaker 0: you actually had to push the buttons in the elevator but as a result that game would take you through the minutia of police procedure in a way that was actually pretty interesting to a nerd like me who was into that stuff at the time.

402
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:09,440
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go play that now like I feel like going home and trying some Police Quest.

403
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,731
Speaker 0: the problem with Police Quest is that it's the driving is unbearable unbearable.

404
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,772
Speaker 0: and the other problem with it is that a lot of the it's not like.

405
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,684
Speaker 0: it's open in terms of like where you go and there's a lot of kind of random events and stuff.

406
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:24,899
Speaker 0: but really the plot.

407
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:30,026
Speaker 0: there's only one solution to every plot scenario like in the poker room.

408
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:35,838
Speaker 0: at the end it's like alright wait for the guy to leave go use the phone, if you do anything else you die.

409
00:32:37,026 --> 00:32:41,320
Speaker 1: these aren't visual novels, they're adventure games, it's not the same thing at all.

410
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:42,960
Speaker 1: it's like on the surface.

411
00:32:43,384 --> 00:33:00,940
Speaker 1: you would think that they were similar because they have the key, the primary thing to enjoy in both of those is not the play of the game but the art and the story and the music and the visuals, it's like an animation

412
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:08,760
Speaker 0: and also the give and take of the mechanics of you're sitting there with the guy and it gives you the option of do you handcuff him in the front?

413
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,009
Speaker 0: because he seems harmless, do you handcuff him in the back anyway?

414
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:15,179
Speaker 0: and then exploring the results of those two actions.

415
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,000
Speaker 1: but it's really just seeing.

416
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:25,280
Speaker 1: the entertainment comes not necessarily from the choice but from the fact that you do actually get to see two different things happen, it matters.

417
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:29,220
Speaker 1: and you see, oh, you did it in the front and he was evil and he stabbed you.

418
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,740
Speaker 1: you did it in the back, you safely bring him in the police car, and there's two different animations to see and two different stories.

419
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:34,921
Speaker 1: but

420
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:52,779
Speaker 0: there is, well, there's only, there's a one like we tell, you know, in our old losing should be fun lecture I want to do again sometime just to video it, there's the narrative structure where there's a straight line to the end and every branch ends in death or basically gives you a scene you wouldn't otherwise see and then returns to the main branch.

421
00:33:53,345 --> 00:34:09,985
Speaker 0: so they're similar to visual novels in the same way that Choose Your Own Adventure is similar to just another book because the whole point of a visual novel, at least some visual novels, is that you can actually branch, there's different endings and the decisions affect things later down the road and

422
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:15,159
Speaker 1: they don't bullshit you by trying to, like, make you do, you know, solve or test your skills.

423
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:19,100
Speaker 0: some do, some do nine whatevers, nine whatevers, nine whatevers.

424
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:20,340
Speaker 1: that's not really a visual novel.

425
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,659
Speaker 0: it's arguably in the visual novel genre.

426
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,579
Speaker 1: it's more of a, it's more like it's a visual puzzler.

427
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:29,179
Speaker 1: yeah, it's more like Myst than it is with easier, not stupid puzzles.

428
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,159
Speaker 0: oh, Myst, alright I hated Myst.

429
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,380
Speaker 1: yeah, Myst is not the greatest.

430
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,679
Speaker 0: I like puzzles, I like crazy puzzles that don't.

431
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,819
Speaker 0: but the puzzles in Myst don't even fucking no, they do make sense, I just don't like them.

432
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:49,259
Speaker 0: they're not good, I don't agree that they're good puzzles, right well, they give you the explorer with so little content, you know what it is?

433
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:50,067
Speaker 0: you know what it is?

434
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:55,380
Speaker 0: Myst has fucking zero directional heuristics unless you were willing to take notes.

435
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,659
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean, well that's why I give you a notebook with the box when you buy it.

436
00:34:58,841 --> 00:34:59,225
Speaker 1: yeah, you know

437
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:08,840
Speaker 0: what, there's only one point in all of Shadowgate where you actually have to take notes, and that's to know how to do the order of the bullshit in the, in the, anyway

438
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:15,399
Speaker 1: right, cause in Myst you'll go up to a device and you'll learn how to interact with the device and see how it works and say, okay, this button does this, this lever does that?

439
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:19,460
Speaker 1: okay, this has something to do with that, and it controls something along those lines.

440
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:22,631
Speaker 1: okay, but what do I actually want to set it to to do something?

441
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:23,459
Speaker 1: I don't know.

442
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:32,979
Speaker 1: so you go examine the rest of the game and maybe, maybe if you're lucky, you'll find something that looks like the thing you learned how to operate before and you'll learn that that goes with that.

443
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:50,066
Speaker 1: but most of the time, the thing that tells you you know, what to do with a particular device looks nothing like that device and has no indication that it goes with that device, you just sort of have to say well, if this was the thing that told me how to use this then that would mean that I would have to do this with it, and

444
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:50,975
Speaker 0: sort of try

445
00:35:50,995 --> 00:36:14,969
Speaker 1: it out and you try everything on everything but trying everything and everything isn't as simple as it is in a LucasArts adventure game where you're like, hammer on that nope, screwdriver on that, nope bread on that, nope, in Myst it's like, okay, if I use this on that, that means one, five seven, ten, and if I use this on that, it means middle lever up, side lever down right, and it's like, come on yeah, but again,

446
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,418
Speaker 0: I'm not saying this is a bad game, I just fucking hated it.

447
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,412
Speaker 1: I say it is many, there are many bad things about Myst.

448
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,419
Speaker 1: it did bad things to the gaming industry that's for sure, it is a bad game in many ways.

449
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:43,780
Speaker 0: but actually, the games like this I like the most were the Quest for Glory games, I talk about them a lot because I love those games and unlike a lot of these other ones which I tried to replay in the last decade from my youth and just couldn't deal with them, like, I tried to play King's Quest again in like 2004, and I just couldn't.

450
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,620
Speaker 1: I just didn't get it, I agree completely.

451
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,709
Speaker 1: when I was a kid, I fucking loved these kind of games like, my memory, see,

452
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:53,700
Speaker 0: I didn't, when I was a kid the SCUMM games, I actually hated most of those, really

453
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:54,023
Speaker 1: I

454
00:36:54,406 --> 00:37:05,259
Speaker 0: remember, because my brother was playing Full Throttle, and I was playing Quest for Glory, I think, four and, you know, I was like, alright I'll try your game, you try mine, and he liked mine, okay and I was like, Full Throttle, what is this?

455
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,859
Speaker 0: it was just like a straight line, there's like, nah there's nothing to this game, just click on everything just click, just fucking click.

456
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:16,080
Speaker 1: but anyway, it's like, when I was a kid pretty much any adventure game was awesome, right.

457
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:33,762
Speaker 1: but now, if I try to play one I might feel like, aw yeah, at the start of it like, when I'm about to start playing but then as soon as I get to screen two, I'm like oh right, fuck this, and maybe what I'll do is get a FAQ, and just play it straight through to see the story, or watch it on YouTube, to get that enjoyment from the story and all the endings, alright well, we've

458
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:36,340
Speaker 0: talked about that as a game piracy if you watch someone play through it on YouTube

459
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:40,280
Speaker 1: right, and because there's no enjoyment for me in solving puzzles that make no sense.

460
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:48,140
Speaker 1: and here's the other problem, I played a game called Stacking, the one with the Matrashka doll oh yeah, which is basically sort of a point and click adventure.

461
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:59,879
Speaker 1: it's basically, you go to a there's a bunch of levels, in each level you have to solve these different parts of the level, and you can walk around it mostly freely, in order to advance to the next part, right.

462
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:11,515
Speaker 1: so in many ways it is a point and click adventure in the solving your way out of the room, sort of, what do I use on what you know, which Matrashka container do I use on that, and even if you know which one to use on that, where can I go?

463
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:15,700
Speaker 1: get the one that I need, right, and there's a little bit of that going on, well I guess, you know, here's the distinction.

464
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:16,063
Speaker 0: but

465
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:29,795
Speaker 1: the point is, is in that game most of the things to do made sense, unlike a LucasArts adventure game, well, a lot of the things because they made sense, it was so easy as to not be challenging at all, but Scott, a lot

466
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:34,202
Speaker 0: of the things in LucasArts stuff did make sense like in Full Throttle, the asbestos suit like.

467
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,555
Speaker 0: what do you think that does, yeah,

468
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:42,686
Speaker 1: most a lot of things made sense, but they still had a lot of things that were Nintendo logic, right whereas the stacking game had almost no Nintendo logic, but

469
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:54,907
Speaker 0: the difference is in these scum games for example, because of the limited set of items and the limited interactivity, even an 8 year old in their head could map out every possible combination of things they could do in a given room,

470
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:56,199
Speaker 1: yeah we played these when we were little kids.

471
00:38:56,321 --> 00:39:09,319
Speaker 0: so yeah, meanwhile Myst is the opposite of that, there's no way to map out every combination, you have to solve it via an entirely different mechanism, yep so I like the games that are in between the two and Quest for Glory.

472
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:18,119
Speaker 0: that series of games with the first one doesn't really do it so much, but after the first one they kind of figured out the deal, well Quest for Glory has the RPG element to it.

473
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:26,000
Speaker 0: yes, Quest for Glory is more like an RPG that looks like an adventure game but it doesn't do the RPG stuff of like, I don't know.

474
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,057
Speaker 1: player based combat, oh yeah it doesn't do that.

475
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:33,059
Speaker 0: but we'll get back because Quest for Glory I could talk about for hours.

476
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:35,160
Speaker 0: it's like my game from my childhood.

477
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,231
Speaker 1: it's your jam, everyone

478
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:36,473
Speaker 0: knows

479
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,786
Speaker 1: it's your jam,

480
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:52,917
Speaker 0: I can do a pretty good job of separating the sort of semi objective reasons why I rationally enjoy the game from the sort of, it was one of those games I played as a kid but I can't separate them 100% but I did play all those other games.

481
00:39:52,977 --> 00:40:20,796
Speaker 0: as a kid as well, I hated most of them, Quest for Glory, here's the reasons that don't make sense for anyone but me, one the first like computer game that was for real like a triple A blockbuster that I bought in a store, didn't just pirate where I didn't have an instruction book or whatever, but I actually physically bought with dollars for a brand new computer was Quest for Glory 4 because 1, 2 and 3 are not a

482
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,027
Speaker 1: triple A blockbuster,

483
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,220
Speaker 0: in that era it was one of the A games, it was like on the shelf.

484
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,597
Speaker 1: let's see what year that came out.

485
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:28,467
Speaker 0: that was what, '94?

486
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,920
Speaker 1: it was a long fucking time ago, Shadow of Darkness?

487
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,560
Speaker 1: yes, '93, and '94 came with the CD version, did you buy the CD or the floppy version?

488
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,685
Speaker 1: floppy version of course, ok so that was '93 right?

489
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:43,439
Speaker 1: yeah, so looking with Quest for Glory 1 came out, well hold on, I'm gonna look up something else.

490
00:40:46,925 --> 00:40:55,520
Speaker 1: oh ok, MechWarrior 2 came out in '95, so it was before MechWarrior 2, ok so here's the thing, Quest for Glory 1 2, 3 were ancient.

491
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:57,216
Speaker 1: yeah, Doom came out in '93.

492
00:40:57,782 --> 00:41:01,120
Speaker 1: I think that was the blockbuster as opposed to the Quest for Glory.

493
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,159
Speaker 0: well Quest for Glory was on, if you went to a computer game store.

494
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:07,279
Speaker 0: Quest for Glory 4 was underneath the Doom shelf.

495
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:09,719
Speaker 0: well no, it was on the shelf with all the other.

496
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,239
Speaker 1: all the shelves had Doom.

497
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:13,299
Speaker 1: Doom was every shelf.

498
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:13,824
Speaker 0: actually.

499
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:16,653
Speaker 0: I bought Doom 2 with babbages.

500
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,939
Speaker 0: I think yeah, anyway.

501
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:21,758
Speaker 0: so Quest for Glory 4 was like a big, I bought it.

502
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:26,684
Speaker 0: it was awesome but I was like 4.

503
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:31,099
Speaker 0: I've been through this rigor role before Final Fantasy 6 like I knew about that stuff.

504
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:34,942
Speaker 0: so I was already mad, it was like 4. where's 1, 2 and 3?

505
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:37,899
Speaker 0: and the internet didn't really exist in the way it does today now.

506
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:43,799
Speaker 0: so I'd like ask older gamer dudes I knew like on chat boards and things.

507
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:54,479
Speaker 0: and eventually I discovered and I found it and I went to a game store and bought this, Quest for Glory 1 had been re-released as a VGA version updated with clicking instead of typing nice.

508
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:59,500
Speaker 0: so I bought that and I realized oh you can fucking export and import characters.

509
00:41:59,723 --> 00:42:03,559
Speaker 1: oh my god that is a great thing that I wish.

510
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:07,179
Speaker 1: modern games only Golden Sun has that, what else has that?

511
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,219
Speaker 0: uh Halo, not Halo.

512
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:11,285
Speaker 0: Mass Effect does it?

513
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:15,331
Speaker 1: yeah, but the decisions you make carry through from Mass Effect 1 to 2 to 3?

514
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:18,599
Speaker 1: yeah there are too few games that do this.

515
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:19,439
Speaker 1: that's all I'm saying.

516
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:31,428
Speaker 0: when I was a kid many of you probably went through this you had Final Fantasy 1 on the NES you had Final Fantasy 2 and 3 on the SNES and then when Final Fantasy 7 came out you were like what?

517
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:32,379
Speaker 0: what?

518
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,300
Speaker 0: and then when you learned yeah but then as soon as you knew something was up and you were burned and you were like oh there's all these NES.

519
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:42,920
Speaker 0: so I knew something was up with this.

520
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:43,838
Speaker 0: it bothered me.

521
00:42:44,343 --> 00:42:53,548
Speaker 0: that drove me to get deep into gaming, that's why I knew who made Quest for Glory, I didn't know who made any other game that I ever made, but I knew about Laurie and Corey Cole.

522
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:59,492
Speaker 0: solely because I was so desperate to figure out how to get Quest for Glory 2 and 3, did you see they have a Kickstarter for something?

523
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:01,188
Speaker 1: yes did you kickstart it?

524
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:08,439
Speaker 0: I noticed it too late because Quest for Glory 5 was terrible and it was made way later.

525
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:20,400
Speaker 0: but I eventually acquired floppies and these were 700 whatever K floppies not 1.4 megabyte of Quest for Glory 2 which is the best one in my opinion.

526
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:27,374
Speaker 0: but those are all the reasons why I like these games that you don't want to care about, the reasons you should like these games like Scott said they're more like.

527
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:33,688
Speaker 0: they're more like an RPG, you have stats that level up and there are puzzles but they're not puzzles like.

528
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:40,940
Speaker 0: well first you have to lick the toad and then push the witch into the oven and then close the door and then type duck, they're not like that.

529
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,700
Speaker 0: they're more like alright you need an anvil because of a spell, you know you need an anvil.

530
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:51,338
Speaker 0: well there's a couple of different places you could steal one from or maybe you buy one I don't know.

531
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:57,459
Speaker 0: so like I go to the blacksmith and I'm like alright I'm just going to fucking steal his anvil.

532
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,798
Speaker 0: so I pick his lock and I go into his place and I'm like alright I sneak because I don't know.

533
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:05,016
Speaker 1: if he you can't lift the anvil.

534
00:44:05,036 --> 00:44:07,500
Speaker 0: though yes I go to the anvil and I'm like take anvil.

535
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:11,057
Speaker 0: oh I'm not strong enough, now if I were strong enough I could have just lifted it.

536
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:13,040
Speaker 0: but I was a thief not a fighter.

537
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,099
Speaker 0: I didn't put anything to the strength, I couldn't lift that thing for shit.

538
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:16,858
Speaker 0: so I'm like oh what do I do?

539
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:23,060
Speaker 0: so I get some oil and I try to grease it up and then the guards appear in the doorway and I'm like what and I get arrested.

540
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:33,958
Speaker 0: so the next time I do it and I close the door behind me and I lock it again and then I make so much racket trying to get the fucking thing out there that I wake the guy up and he comes down and beats me to death.

541
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:41,800
Speaker 0: and the fact there's so many ways to solve that puzzle that it's ridiculous.

542
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,257
Speaker 0: and depending on your class there's all these different options.

543
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:54,759
Speaker 0: but it's not like one of those games where oh if you're a wizard you can solve it by doing this but if you're a thief do it by this, no there's just like four solutions based on the skills you have and the items you have and the things you can do.

544
00:44:55,285 --> 00:45:05,579
Speaker 0: any class can do any of them and that aspect of it made it feel a lot more open and a lot more interesting that there were multiple solutions to pretty much every.

545
00:45:06,124 --> 00:45:07,859
Speaker 0: they weren't puzzles they were problems.

546
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:11,917
Speaker 0: there were puzzles in those games but that's kind of a separate piece.

547
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:15,600
Speaker 1: yeah is there anything else to say about the point?

548
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,140
Speaker 1: oh there's a recent resurgence right cause it's sort of a genre that died.

549
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:23,982
Speaker 1: no one was making games in the genre anymore and more people sort of bemoaned this cause.

550
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:27,198
Speaker 1: they had nostalgia for them or they really liked them and just wanted there to be more of them.

551
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:31,318
Speaker 1: so more recently there have been quite a bunch of these remade.

552
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:33,920
Speaker 1: you can buy a lot of them on Steam like they redid Sam and Max.

553
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:38,635
Speaker 1: they made a whole bunch of them and there was the Back to the Future ones and some people like them.

554
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,414
Speaker 1: some people don't you know.

555
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:55,605
Speaker 1: I haven't really played all too many of them but I'm sure if you enjoy like the story animation acting video story part that you could check them out on YouTube or buy them and play them or buy them and play them with a fac and it would probably be pretty awesome.

556
00:45:55,665 --> 00:46:00,009
Speaker 1: but you know not having played them I question the game part.

557
00:46:00,393 --> 00:46:06,139
Speaker 1: I imagine that they're along the lines of try clicking on everything until you proceed to see the rest of the story.

558
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:15,848
Speaker 0: because for example my problem are the games that have the sort of Nintendo logic it's just a puzzle or the games where there isn't any consequence of failure.

559
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:18,009
Speaker 0: you literally just click on everything like the escape the room.

560
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,299
Speaker 0: games are usually just click on everything until you get out.

561
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:35,462
Speaker 1: there's no consequence to failure not even death sometimes the worst consequences you have to try to escape the room again from back from the beginning and re-click everything you already clicked and remember what you already clicked because you died.

562
00:46:35,725 --> 00:46:46,760
Speaker 0: yup but then again if the Nintendo logic is full on Nintendo logic like Maniac Mansion I enjoyed Maniac Mansion because it was arbitrary and crazy.

563
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:54,007
Speaker 0: but you were trying to figure out the logic of the arbitrary crazy world which was itself pretty self consistent.

564
00:46:54,027 --> 00:47:04,580
Speaker 0: so I did enjoy Maniac Mansion and Maniac Mansion also frustrated the ever living crap out of me primarily because I played it mostly on the NES where it's very difficult to control.

565
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:11,138
Speaker 0: but once I learned there were a few ways to die I was obsessed with trying to kill all the characters and I came up with a way to do it.

566
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,719
Speaker 0: and I got this crazy ending that I didn't know was there.

567
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,279
Speaker 0: I killed all three kids.

568
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:16,409
Speaker 0: you know how I did it?

569
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:17,075
Speaker 1: How would you do it?

570
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,590
Speaker 0: you remember that game enough?

571
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:19,380
Speaker 1: Not too much.

572
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:21,739
Speaker 1: is there where you can put something in the microwave and it explodes?

573
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,258
Speaker 0: uh yeah the hamster.

574
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:24,651
Speaker 1: and doesn't that kill you?

575
00:47:24,672 --> 00:47:26,778
Speaker 0: No it just kills the hamster.

576
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:29,580
Speaker 0: so here's how you do it.

577
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:42,379
Speaker 0: there is a way where the I think that there's a botanical that can kill you or the meteor can kill you in one situation but if you drain the pool and you don't fill it back up within a certain amount of time the whole place goes nuclear and everyone dies.

578
00:47:43,104 --> 00:47:44,138
Speaker 0: but that's not the way I did it.

579
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:45,498
Speaker 0: I emptied the pool.

580
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,354
Speaker 0: I then put two of the kids in there and then I had the third kid fill the pool up.

581
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:50,999
Speaker 0: they both drowned.

582
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,079
Speaker 0: gravestones appeared I thought that was cool in the front lawn.

583
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,320
Speaker 0: so then I had to kill the third kid.

584
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:07,838
Speaker 0: so I went back, I borrowed the hamster, I put it in the microwave, I killed it and then I went into the room with the guy whose hamster it was and I gave it to him and he murdered me.

585
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:13,019
Speaker 0: I put a lot of effort into figuring that out and I don't know.

586
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:19,260
Speaker 0: like you said, part of the enjoyment of these games really is the funny and weird crap that happens.

587
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,859
Speaker 0: you want to experience it, that's why I'm kind of interested in Kentucky Route Zero.

588
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:29,020
Speaker 1: ok, so you've been talking about this Kentucky Route Zero, so far you've said it's a point and click adventure that looks like out of this world.

589
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:36,099
Speaker 0: so as far as I can tell by reading around a little bit on the internet there aren't really puzzles.

590
00:48:36,503 --> 00:48:40,279
Speaker 0: it has the interface and aesthetic of a point and click adventure.

591
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:46,358
Speaker 0: but it is just, see the interesting stuff that's happening and try to figure out the story of this place.

592
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:48,999
Speaker 0: there is no puzzle to solve.

593
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:52,319
Speaker 0: it's also episodic and it doesn't end apparently yet.

594
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:55,680
Speaker 1: I should wait for more of it then and buy the whole thing.

595
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,019
Speaker 0: well right now it's going to be on Steam soon.

596
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:01,800
Speaker 1: I'll wait for there to be a giant bundle like Kentucky Route Zero complete edition.

597
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:06,099
Speaker 0: right now it's $25 for the whole thing or $7 per act, there's only one act out.

598
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:07,036
Speaker 1: yeah, it's too much.

599
00:49:09,184 --> 00:49:11,279
Speaker 0: I'm going to buy the act one because I want to see what the deal is.

600
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:18,760
Speaker 0: because in that Magfest panel, the point James Portnau made that was really interesting was that we talk a lot about genre in games.

601
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:35,795
Speaker 0: we always define it by game mechanics and he pointed out that pretty much every other medium except music, as we came up in the discussion talks a lot more about mood and feeling like Phil Noire is more about the atmosphere than it is about the black and white camera angle close-ups.

602
00:49:37,368 --> 00:49:59,378
Speaker 0: but we talk more about horror movies, but yet when we say survival horror game, we usually mean action, you know third person shooter or tank controls or something this feels like this is in the style of an adventure game point and click, but it is a game that is defined by the feeling it gives you and the experiences you have.

603
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:02,918
Speaker 0: so I want to give that kind of game a big chance.

604
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:08,858
Speaker 1: I have nothing against that, I just think it's not really a game, it's closer to what a boogie is.

605
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:17,320
Speaker 0: this is the one point where we disagree with Garfield in his book, I think we can define what a game is very well if we use our three definitions.

606
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:19,219
Speaker 1: what skill is this testing, right?

607
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:23,640
Speaker 0: a game is a game if it satisfies any one of our three definitions.

608
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,860
Speaker 0: it's like three types of games, either a competitive test of one or more skills.

609
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,692
Speaker 1: so this is not that?

610
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:31,152
Speaker 0: No what is the second definition?

611
00:50:31,172 --> 00:50:37,140
Speaker 0: Oh, a series of meaningful decisions or a consensual interactive amusement?

612
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:38,340
Speaker 1: yeah, it's an amusement.

613
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:48,366
Speaker 1: it's like a Nickelodeon, you put a nickel in you take a look, you have fun you click on things and you have fun the same thing as Dungeon Village, you click on it and you have fun.

614
00:50:48,386 --> 00:51:00,504
Speaker 0: Yes, but it is distinct from a novel or a book in that you are interacting, you could miss things, your interaction might be different than someone else's interaction and consensual has to be in there.

615
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:08,159
Speaker 0: because of a good example that I thought of a couple days ago at the panel last year, people were like, it has to be consensual but no one really gave a good reason why.

616
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:16,560
Speaker 0: here's why let's say every day I break into your apartment and I piss in your Cheerios so I'm making your life worse.

617
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,100
Speaker 1: that's just vandalism.

618
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:23,818
Speaker 0: so maybe it's a game to me, I'm like, I wonder if I can get in and do this, how many days can I do this before I get caught?

619
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,440
Speaker 0: it's a game to me, for me, that is a game pissing Scott's Cheerios.

620
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:38,899
Speaker 0: it's not a game for Scott because it's not consensual, now if Scott consented to that of, alright, I will try to catch you pissing in my Cheerios and then, you know, whatever then it's a game for both of us.

621
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:50,179
Speaker 0: or a better example, bullying to a lot of bullies or trolls, it's a game but it is really missing the point to call it a game from the context of the person being bullied.

622
00:51:50,743 --> 00:51:59,859
Speaker 1: some people will say, you know, you think this is a game right, that's what they're talking about exactly, it's like, you think this is a game but it's not, I'm not playing, only you're playing.

623
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:06,799
Speaker 0: but I think and actually it's kind of my challenge to you listeners is there something you think is a game that does not satisfy one of those three?

624
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:15,540
Speaker 0: I'm just curious because I really like our definitions and I really want to do something with those definitions other than have the slide in every panel.

625
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:19,080
Speaker 0: we do alright.

626
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,940
Speaker 1: I think we talked enough about these.

627
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:24,840
Speaker 1: I mean, really, I've talked about most of the ones that I've played extensively.

628
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:29,859
Speaker 1: I've played a lot of them, a little bit each so it's not like I have much to say about any specific ones.

629
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:32,959
Speaker 1: I remember playing the Indiana Jones one on the Mac, that one was pretty good.

630
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,200
Speaker 1: the Atlantis one.

631
00:52:34,422 --> 00:52:39,259
Speaker 0: I played a bunch of the King's Quest, I played as many of the police quests as I could get.

632
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:44,560
Speaker 0: I didn't play any space quests ever, so I don't know anything about them me either, I know what it looks like.

633
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:46,460
Speaker 1: I could recognize it, like oh, that space quest.

634
00:52:46,744 --> 00:52:47,839
Speaker 0: I played the SCUMM ones.

635
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,188
Speaker 0: I didn't like them even as a kid but yet I liked all the other kinds except for King's Quest.

636
00:52:55,284 --> 00:53:04,999
Speaker 1: and you know, I played a lot as younger but my memory is more vague I did a more recent replay of a lot of SCUMM VMs, like a year or two ago of SCUMM games.

637
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:08,700
Speaker 1: and yeah, it's pretty much like, oh, I just want to fack, you know, fuck this bullshit.

638
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:11,525
Speaker 0: Oh, Quest for Glorious also have action-based combat.

639
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,299
Speaker 1: I guess we should say the words Monkey Island, so no one gets mad.

640
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,979
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Monkey Island games yes, they're funny.

641
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,528
Speaker 0: the comedy that happens in them is hilarious.

642
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:25,930
Speaker 1: That is the enjoyment pretty much comes 90% from the comedy and the rest of it, whatever.

643
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:31,379
Speaker 0: And yes, they wouldn't work as just cartoons because some of the jokes involve the mechanics.

644
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:39,480
Speaker 0: I can think of a bunch of examples where there's only one option to click on, but the fact that that is the option you have to click on it is hilarious.

645
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:48,960
Speaker 1: But, you could just watch someone play on YouTube and get 99% of the enjoyment from them, as long as the person explored all of the things.

646
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:53,060
Speaker 0: Yep, I don't need to play these games again for any reason except nostalgia.

647
00:53:53,282 --> 00:53:59,692
Speaker 0: but, like I said, I'm gonna give Kentucky Route Zero a try and if it passes muster I will see that.

648
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:02,118
Speaker 0: Scott does the same and we'll talk about that.

649
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:12,020
Speaker 0: and before any of you haters start bitching about us, we didn't really say anything bad about your genre nor did we talk about the history of it or get anything wrong about.

650
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:17,760
Speaker 0: well, technically, you know, ScumVM came one year after this other emulator whatever.

651
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,146
Speaker 0: don't tell us about games we didn't talk about unless you think they'd be worth playing.

652
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:31,296
Speaker 0: In fact, if there's a game out there with this Light Quest for Glory that I didn't play I kinda wanna know, because Quest for Glory 2 I played again like a couple years ago and it really holds up.

653
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,140
Speaker 1: I hear us talking.

654
00:55:32,302 --> 00:55:34,880
Speaker 0: That's because the Closer music was playing in the background very faintly.

655
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:36,299
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what it was.
