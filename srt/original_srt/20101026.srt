1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,835
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 26 2010.

2
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:12,380
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,111
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight civilization 5.

4
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,108
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:38,768
Speaker 1: So I discovered in Filling out some government forms today that in fact The people living one floor above me in my building have a different zip code from me And in fact the people living on the ground floor have a different zip code.

6
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:42,443
Speaker 1: yet again There are nine zip codes in my building.

7
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,487
Speaker 0: How many floors are there?

8
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:44,190
Speaker 1: ah?

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,754
Speaker 1: 15.

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,550
Speaker 0: oh so some builders some floors have the same and some have different.

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,370
Speaker 1: There's the floor under me as the same zip code as me, but the next thing is there's a brand new zip code.

12
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,974
Speaker 0: I don't it.

13
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,210
Speaker 0: is it a different on the final four digits?

14
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:58,842
Speaker 0: Or is it actually the first five digits the final four?

15
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:00,609
Speaker 1: well you think it's the first five.

16
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know that.

17
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:04,443
Speaker 0: then it's not really a different zip code.

18
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:04,644
Speaker 0: Well.

19
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,330
Speaker 1: It is that is part of the zip code.

20
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,173
Speaker 0: It's a different.

21
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,663
Speaker 0: zip plus four is the reason it's not zip code.

22
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:11,008
Speaker 0: It's zip plus four.

23
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,674
Speaker 0: right well Four is different.

24
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:13,677
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean anything.

25
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:14,340
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone it plus fours are like they change every few houses.

27
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,877
Speaker 1: It's the actually depends on where you live.

28
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:26,213
Speaker 0: like any actual zip code the first five digits is one proposed in many Populated areas.

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:32,395
Speaker 1: the the board the last four they actually don't change nearly as often as you think it's because there's less people City.

30
00:01:32,455 --> 00:01:34,665
Speaker 0: so that makes perfect sense for the final board.

31
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,438
Speaker 0: It's not a different zip code It's a different plus four.

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,790
Speaker 1: the plus four is part of the zip code Scott.

33
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:40,715
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

34
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:41,399
Speaker 0: It's that's.

35
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:43,510
Speaker 0: how can they don't just call it the zip code?

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,213
Speaker 0: It's the zip.

37
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:48,610
Speaker 0: well because the plus four was the plus four is an additional thing that is not part of the zip.

38
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,557
Speaker 0: I know it is.

39
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,009
Speaker 1: the fire was added to this.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,110
Speaker 1: it.

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,194
Speaker 1: You don't know anything about the zip code.

42
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:53,419
Speaker 1: What's it even stand for Scott?

43
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:54,926
Speaker 0: It doesn't stand for anything.

44
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:55,307
Speaker 0: It's zip.

45
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,078
Speaker 0: It's haha.

46
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,618
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got any video game news.

47
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,965
Speaker 0: Oh, you're just rushing right to the news already.

48
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,717
Speaker 1: well because you don't know anything about zip code We can't have this discussion.

49
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:09,476
Speaker 0: What does no session have?

50
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,467
Speaker 0: a zip code is one number per post office.

51
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:21,907
Speaker 0: usually and It's that way they know which post office to go to without having to look at the address And then they only look at the address When you know they're actually at the post office, and then they can know which house to go to.

52
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,370
Speaker 1: actually There's a lot more to it than that, but anyway anyway.

53
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,176
Speaker 0: So let's see video game news.

54
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:28,858
Speaker 0: You know what?

55
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,550
Speaker 0: why don't we talk about the plastic instrument games all right?

56
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:37,194
Speaker 1: I'm amazed that they're still going as strong as they are But they're definitely.

57
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:43,546
Speaker 1: they lost a lot of steam like they don't get nearly as much Pressing plays they did a few years ago, but they're still very popular.

58
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's weird.

59
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,950
Speaker 0: It's like you figure that this would be a fad that would go away.

60
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,997
Speaker 0: I think some of it.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,110
Speaker 0: some of the reason it hasn't gone away Is that there you know I mean it's sort of fun for everyone to do it.

62
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,890
Speaker 0: But if most people get bored with it after a time, but there are some people who are just way into it, right?

63
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,115
Speaker 0: So that's all right.

64
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:07,950
Speaker 1: well much like DDR DDR reached pretty surprising highs back at the peak of DR went way up, and then it went way down.

65
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,304
Speaker 0: But there was still some people who are way into it and will still do DDR forever.

66
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:20,590
Speaker 1: there are now more DDR machines in the Midwest than there are in like California, New York combined anyway, so the plastic instrument games are sort of the same way.

67
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:27,259
Speaker 0: But I think also they're being helped because a. they're a little bit more accessible than DDR You know and the music keeps people.

68
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:34,359
Speaker 0: you know they keep releasing the DLCs that use people engaged and They also people invested in these plastic instruments.

69
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,430
Speaker 0: a lot more people invested in those and events vested in dance pads.

70
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:43,070
Speaker 0: So because they invested in the plastic instruments they want to keep using them And if they just sit there it makes people feel guilty yeah.

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,750
Speaker 1: But at the same time a lot of people Claimed that the main reason the games were popular was because the rock star fantasy which is a big part of the games.

72
00:03:51,272 --> 00:04:02,536
Speaker 1: But I still maintained that the primary reason most people were playing not necessarily the hardcore fans But like the family or like that because even like people at my work like older people just have You know the cyst.

73
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:11,900
Speaker 1: they have one of the games and they play it every now And then like when they have people over as a diversion, and I feel like they play it because It makes listening to music a more active activity.

74
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:18,423
Speaker 1: I don't feel like many people at least in America in Current modern day listen to music as an active activity.

75
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,170
Speaker 1: It's always a passive secondary active.

76
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, it used to be that you would get your friend your hippie friends around and you would sit in a van or in your Basement whatever down by the river.

77
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,887
Speaker 0: you'd put a record on and you would sit around listening to the record.

78
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:34,189
Speaker 0: right and that would be An activity that you would do with people you know.

79
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:42,446
Speaker 1: Go further back and the common thing to do was that the neighbors will all come together Sit around the piano someone would play a song and you'd all sing it.

80
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:51,213
Speaker 1: yeah Well, that's singing that's different Yeah, but that was actually a very common activity among these families and people when they were bored and until you know We had records.

81
00:04:51,775 --> 00:05:06,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know listening to music as an activity just listening not playing not Participating not karaoke ing not lip-syncing not writing you know it really is only sort of done in present times in this society.

82
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:19,209
Speaker 0: at least if It's a concert right people don't or they do it as not as a group activity But as a. you constantly have music playing on your computer on your headphones, but then they're doing something else They're not really thinking about it.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

84
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,927
Speaker 0: listening to the music is not the primary activity in that case.

85
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,849
Speaker 1: now at the same time There's definitely I mean people listen to a lot of music now.

86
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:34,028
Speaker 1: And there are the audio files and the audio files And just people who are really into music who you know do that sort of thing.

87
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:34,209
Speaker 1: still.

88
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:38,550
Speaker 1: I mean I'll occasionally sit down and listen to an album as an activity much like I'd watch a movie.

89
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:54,641
Speaker 1: But I feel like the music games in particular gave someone an excuse to listen like really listen to and be Participatory with in some fashion like olds that led Zeppelin that otherwise they wouldn't listen to or they'd hear a snatch of in the background On the iPod.

90
00:05:54,662 --> 00:06:01,230
Speaker 0: yeah Anyway, so the Rock Band 3 is coming out, and you know I'm sort of done with the plastic instruments.

91
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,418
Speaker 0: I bought Guitar Hero 3 for the Wii.

92
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:04,783
Speaker 0: yeah, we played it out.

93
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,510
Speaker 0: You know as much as we were gonna play it.

94
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,099
Speaker 0: I only have one plastic guitar.

95
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,629
Speaker 0: didn't waste money on extra one.

96
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,055
Speaker 1: well It amazed me like I knew I would get sick of it like I knew all right This will be fun eventually.

97
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,672
Speaker 0: like it actually lasted quite a while well worth the money That was.

98
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:20,756
Speaker 1: but it lasted far shorter than I expected About a month and a half.

99
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:25,297
Speaker 1: then I was like yeah, and I kind of stopped doing it and then after about three months I was completely done.

100
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:33,009
Speaker 0: I think it lasted about the amount of time I expected you know prepared to say DDR, which I'm actually playing more now than I have recently.

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,812
Speaker 0: well I think Paul.

102
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:45,808
Speaker 0: so part of that problem right was that we had the Wii version which did not constantly add new songs Whereas a DDR there were frequent updates that did not require changing of the equipment.

103
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:46,289
Speaker 0: right.

104
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:49,310
Speaker 1: well That was only because we pirated the game.

105
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,789
Speaker 0: Exactly yeah, I guess we didn't pirate the Rock Band or a Guitar Hero right now And they didn't come out with more Guitar Heroes for the Wii either.

106
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:58,034
Speaker 0: We went ahead.

107
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:04,268
Speaker 0: if we would have started for example with Rock Band 1 on the 360 It would have basically been constantly new.

108
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,516
Speaker 0: The game would just keep getting updated.

109
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:18,050
Speaker 0: if we kept that we had kept playing it every day and actually paying attention all the new Stuff we probably would have remained hooked you know especially because it had four instruments to switch between there's a lot more value To.

110
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:22,669
Speaker 0: you know you can play the guitar then you can play the drum then you could do the singing.

111
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:27,246
Speaker 1: yeah But at the same time the experience was fun at first because it because it was this act.

112
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,551
Speaker 1: you know we're playing on the easier modes.

113
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,620
Speaker 1: I'm active and I'm engaged in the song that I'm also listening to as an activity.

114
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:42,538
Speaker 1: and Then as I played and I started getting to the higher difficulties DDR had the physical aspect the exercise Aspect the full body movement really getting into it.

115
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:55,300
Speaker 1: But plastic instrument games with the exception possibly of the drumming which I actually do kind of enjoy because it's kind of like real drumming Started to ring more and more hollow and just started to feel like I was really wasting my time.

116
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also was you know far.

117
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,940
Speaker 0: I mean DDR on stupid hard.

118
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:06,894
Speaker 0: You can get pretty hard on DDR where it's still doable But I mean stupid hard and me in like the guitar portions is just.

119
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,560
Speaker 0: it's just beyond anything.

120
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,148
Speaker 0: That's worth my time to bother to master course.

121
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:14,840
Speaker 1: we neither one of us ever mastered the ultra hard DDR either.

122
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:20,319
Speaker 1: I mean we're like we can do maybe half the nine footers And I don't think any of us can pass more than one or two ten footers.

123
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know that's.

124
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:22,609
Speaker 0: you know this is different.

125
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,636
Speaker 0: This is like anything on the hardest mode.

126
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,299
Speaker 0: forget it right?

127
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:35,339
Speaker 0: so Anyway Rock Band 3 is coming out and one thing apparently that Rock Band 3 has is their pro mode and Apparently I was looking at pro mode and in pro mode.

128
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:36,679
Speaker 0: well It also has a keyboard by the way.

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,150
Speaker 0: But pro mode is actually playing a real guitar.

130
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:47,153
Speaker 0: basically kind of they have a plastic guitar that you can buy That has a button on every single fret and every single string.

131
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:55,167
Speaker 0: so it's number of frets times six Strings is the number of buttons they have on this thing and the buttons are long You know and thin so you can.

132
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,800
Speaker 0: you know you can play guitar kind of you can play plastic guitar.

133
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:03,206
Speaker 0: And then at the bottom they have six Partial strings.

134
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,831
Speaker 0: right the strings don't go all the way up the neck.

135
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:05,353
Speaker 0: that you're sort of.

136
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:10,109
Speaker 0: only in the strumming area are six Strings that you can pick and whatever.

137
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:16,612
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like it's a guitar But it's not because if you play it without Rock Band doesn't do anything.

138
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,439
Speaker 0: It doesn't make any noise or anything like that.

139
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:33,818
Speaker 0: So I'm like huh, that's actually playing guitar like you could play that thing for just 150 bucks in pro mode and learn a song And then get a real guitar and play the same exact fingerings and hand whatever and you would.

140
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:34,520
Speaker 0: that would be it.

141
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,066
Speaker 0: You're playing the song for reals.

142
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is four hundred and fifty dollars.

143
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 0: You could buy a guitar.

144
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:46,240
Speaker 0: So why would I buy a guitar that only does Rock Band when I could buy a guitar guitar well her the same money.

145
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,546
Speaker 1: I don't think a lot of people.

146
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,860
Speaker 1: I think have this kind of misunderstanding of how much guitars cost.

147
00:09:50,905 --> 00:10:00,854
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean like mo you know Well like if you want to buy a real guitar like the kind that you're gonna play if you're a professional That's gonna be at least a thousand dollars if not multiple thousands.

148
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,543
Speaker 1: you want a guitar that kind of goes But you can e box.

149
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:28,310
Speaker 0: you can buy an electric guitar with six strings and an amp and an amp that will work And in fact usually also with like a bag to carry it in and all kinds of you know all the stuff you need For a complete beginner that will work and serve you well to learn guitar for like a hundred bucks 150 bucks less than that right I think squire this Fender makes one and Gibson makes one and some other.

150
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,356
Speaker 0: you know every guitar company pretty much has one.

151
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:37,680
Speaker 0: That's like the entry-level Beginners electric guitar that comes in a box with an amp and the cable and everything that you need.

152
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,632
Speaker 0: So if they're gonna charge 150 bucks for this thing.

153
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:41,937
Speaker 0: It's like well screw that.

154
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:48,334
Speaker 0: however I Saw on YouTube They are going to sell another pro guitar.

155
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:53,939
Speaker 0: That is an Actual guitar, but it's also a rock band guitar.

156
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,328
Speaker 1: How does the rock band guitar thing work though?

157
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:58,075
Speaker 1: is it just MIDI and some sort of like?

158
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,420
Speaker 0: I think what do you mean?

159
00:10:59,840 --> 00:10:59,920
Speaker 1: Like.

160
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,139
Speaker 1: I wonder if I could just retrofit a real guitar to work with rock band.

161
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd probably need some sort of device to do that yeah, but that's something I could make.

162
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,758
Speaker 0: Possibly you could make that device.

163
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,240
Speaker 0: however They're gonna sell a guitar that basically has the device in it already.

164
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:22,326
Speaker 0: That is also if you just don't plug it into a computer or you know a console is a guitar straight-up Completely normal in every way.

165
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:32,575
Speaker 0: so depending on the price of that guitar I may be interested because suddenly right that that hollow Ringing is gone.

166
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:38,926
Speaker 0: It's like hey I can actually learn to play real songs with this thing But it's also a real guitar.

167
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,631
Speaker 0: that is not a complete waste of money right?

168
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:46,620
Speaker 0: because you buy a plastic instrument like this pro guitar They're trying to sell for 150 bucks, and you get bored of rock band.

169
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,320
Speaker 0: Well, you just wait you got this useless plastic guitar.

170
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,452
Speaker 0: But if I buy a real guitar that also happens to play rock band.

171
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:58,520
Speaker 0: I could buy the rock band game Play it until I'm not bored with it anymore, and then I have a real guitar.

172
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,390
Speaker 0: So even if I never use it to play rock band again.

173
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,133
Speaker 0: It's a guitar.

174
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:03,216
Speaker 0: It's useful.

175
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,220
Speaker 0: It's not a waste of money.

176
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:10,799
Speaker 1: I predict a giant surge in the number of mediocre to guitar players walking into guitar center and playing stairway.

177
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,819
Speaker 0: I Also agree that that will happen, but I mean it also depends right there.

178
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,608
Speaker 0: charging 150 for the fit for the guitar.

179
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,811
Speaker 0: that isn't a real guitar.

180
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 0: so you know the real ones gonna be more right.

181
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,770
Speaker 0: Maybe not that much more, but if it's only like 200 250 tops I might get it.

182
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,226
Speaker 0: But if it's like 300 fuck that.

183
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,775
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be pretty low because they know their demographic.

184
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:37,455
Speaker 1: the demographic is definitely Affluent, but the demographic is not wealthy like if it's 250.

185
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,540
Speaker 0: I'd be a little shaky.

186
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,610
Speaker 0: I'd be like maybe I'd have to.

187
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:40,831
Speaker 0: you know.

188
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,545
Speaker 0: the thing is the song list is looking pretty good So I might go for it anyway.

189
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:47,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but and then it won't for 300. for 300 I just like fuck that you should buy it.

190
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,279
Speaker 1: I'll come over to your place, and we'll play.

191
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you go buy one.

192
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:51,812
Speaker 0: you had to buy another one.

193
00:12:52,053 --> 00:13:00,842
Speaker 0: I'll take turns single-player I'm paying for it you pay half, and then we definitely get it even if it's 300.

194
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:13,200
Speaker 0: But actually that would be really cool though if we had two of the real ones and played rock band We could do like wicked guitar solo, and then other paired guitar, so obviously no you got to do dueling banjos.

195
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:13,724
Speaker 0: Oh, can we?

196
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,552
Speaker 0: how awesome would that be?

197
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,460
Speaker 0: that'd be the greatest right?

198
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:19,000
Speaker 0: We had to do that if they actually came out if it was the right price.

199
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:19,422
Speaker 0: Yeah,

200
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:33,870
Speaker 1: yeah the thing is I think I posted in the forum But you know I was a trumpet player and then kind of half a piano player for much of my life and I I was 50/50 on going to school for technology or conservatory and At one point in high school.

201
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,279
Speaker 0: Why do they call it a conservatory?

202
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:35,340
Speaker 0: ah?

203
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,910
Speaker 0: Because they do you don't know.

204
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:44,789
Speaker 1: so at one point in high school I didn't have any classes left to take and I was really just waiting to go to college And I already took every AP class.

205
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:55,920
Speaker 1: so I signed up for the orchestra Which was eighth period and I just never showed up to the orchestra and went home every day and the band Instructor never really noticed that I was even on his roster, so he never thought to mark me absent.

206
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,665
Speaker 1: And about a month later.

207
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,354
Speaker 1: He noticed and he told me that either.

208
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,159
Speaker 1: I had to learn the cello or he's gonna flunk me.

209
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:12,599
Speaker 1: And after a week of me attempting to learn the cello He set me aside and said that I have what he likes to call stupid fingers And that he never wants me to touch a stringed instrument for the rest of my life.

210
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,336
Speaker 1: I then had to play the trumpet for the stupid orchestra for the rest of that year, huh?

211
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:22,720
Speaker 1: So I don't know if I can actually play a guitar, and I don't know if anything will ever help me play a guitar.

212
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,094
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I played guitar when I was in fifth grade right, and I actually was.

213
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,157
Speaker 0: you know I've had this.

214
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:28,820
Speaker 0: I could do that.

215
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,034
Speaker 0: Right it's totally within my abilities.

216
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:31,779
Speaker 1: Can you play stairway?

217
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,931
Speaker 0: Hold on That was a nice stairway there, I know right you like that stairway.

218
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,440
Speaker 1: the thing is or that was a phone call about football.

219
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,113
Speaker 1: That's all right.

220
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,860
Speaker 0: No, I mean like you know I was basically when I learned it in fifth grade.

221
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:47,586
Speaker 0: It was like all right.

222
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:52,820
Speaker 0: here is the book how to play guitar And it's like learn the first string learn the second string learn the thirds.

223
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,647
Speaker 0: You know you'd learn one string at a time And then I got his.

224
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:03,378
Speaker 0: you know I was progressing at a steady rate until I went to middle school and stopped To play the clarinet instead, and that was that was it.

225
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,446
Speaker 1: well We'll see how you do.

226
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,603
Speaker 1: I mean not to not to disparage And I watch you

227
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:07,649
Speaker 0: if I do and I want

228
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,149
Speaker 1: you to buy this game and play it and learn the guitar But the harmonica taunts you from a distance

229
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,606
Speaker 0: yeah, but I mean the harmonica did not have harmonica To go with it.

230
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:22,090
Speaker 0: so speaking of video games plus I could always just resell the shit on Amazon if it's no good.

231
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,300
Speaker 1: scribble knots was a pathetic disaster of a game.

232
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:29,240
Speaker 0: I know right that was like this greatest idea, but the fact is the actual execute.

233
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,345
Speaker 0: I you know I bought it.

234
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,511
Speaker 0: I paid real money for it.

235
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:35,027
Speaker 0: the actual game was not So it's not what it.

236
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:37,240
Speaker 1: I ignored the people who made it.

237
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:51,220
Speaker 1: I ignored everything about it until penny arcade updated and Tycho talked about the new scribble knots game And there's a new one I'm going to quote Tycho of penny arcade super scribble knots features, and I am NOT joking about this.

238
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,347
Speaker 1: Why would I joke about this?

239
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:54,359
Speaker 1: the ability to use?

240
00:15:55,322 --> 00:16:02,576
Speaker 1: adjectives uh-huh a metal cock a Chocolate cock, but I mean okay a female cock.

241
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:06,327
Speaker 0: so wait Can I apply any adjective to any noun?

242
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,111
Speaker 0: they have every combination worked out.

243
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:11,560
Speaker 0: probably see cuz that's the one thing actually doodle God.

244
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,136
Speaker 0: You ever played doodle God.

245
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:16,732
Speaker 0: now So doodle God is this game where basically you start out with the four?

246
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:20,966
Speaker 0: sounds like something a five-year-old would say it's basically this Little game, it's a time waster.

247
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:27,500
Speaker 0: It's not even a game where you have the four elements earth wind air and oh yeah Yeah, and you combine them to create new elements.

248
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,026
Speaker 0: And you combine them to create new elements.

249
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:32,038
Speaker 0: for you know until you figure out you find all the elements in the game.

250
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,852
Speaker 0: the problem It doodle God is that it's really just a process of elimination.

251
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,709
Speaker 0: right you just try every combination Until you you know and most of the combinations don't work.

252
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:40,969
Speaker 0: is this?

253
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,213
Speaker 0: nope that combination doesn't work.

254
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:46,210
Speaker 0: the game would be much better if every Combination did something right

255
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:50,247
Speaker 1: even if it did something bad like maybe Combinations that are bad hurt you or something or

256
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:57,594
Speaker 0: maybe even if they just make the same exact thing or combinations of things you already Have like let's say person in fire makes fireman.

257
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:57,996
Speaker 0: You know.

258
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:06,839
Speaker 0: and then person and Magma makes well like water and snake makes a hose and the person hose also makes fireman.

259
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,644
Speaker 0: You know just.

260
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,179
Speaker 0: you don't need to come up with exponentially more combination things.

261
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,079
Speaker 1: I Don't know why but all I can think is I got a snake man faded some beer man.

262
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,054
Speaker 0: So you know the thing with doodle.

263
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:20,920
Speaker 0: God is most combinations?

264
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,044
Speaker 0: Don't do anything right.

265
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,859
Speaker 0: and scribble knots had a pretty large selection of nouns.

266
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,280
Speaker 1: It was pretty impressive, but the nouns were not sufficiently differentiated.

267
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:34,220
Speaker 1: I make Zeus or Thor or Apollo and they all do the same thing.

268
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:43,100
Speaker 1: There were really only a few things that were useful like ladder and According to YouTube there are only two things that were useful the vending machine and the handcuffs.

269
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:49,391
Speaker 1: Uh-huh as you could beat every mission with the vending machine in the handcuffs Alrighty spot a vending machine next to the star like handcuff.

270
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,175
Speaker 1: the star put it in.

271
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,159
Speaker 1: take the vending machine back.

272
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,025
Speaker 1: There was some dumb way.

273
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,817
Speaker 1: There's a video you can watch that'll beat every single level in the game.

274
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:56,520
Speaker 0: That's cool.

275
00:17:57,062 --> 00:18:07,300
Speaker 1: But anyway trouble with the game was that it shouldn't have like it being a puzzle game was okay But I realized the puzzles were boring and all that I cared about was making crazy shit happen.

276
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it should almost have been more of a sandbox.

277
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,051
Speaker 0: Well.

278
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,055
Speaker 0: You could you could use juice.

279
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:12,300
Speaker 0: There was a sandbox room.

280
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,688
Speaker 0: It was just this place you can go.

281
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,894
Speaker 0: I think was on the home screen.

282
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:15,840
Speaker 0: You just do anything.

283
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,594
Speaker 0: There's a home screen.

284
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:25,517
Speaker 1: yep But if they'd flesh the game out more in that regard and less in the puzzle regard and just made Interesting and crazy and wacky stuff the way to do it is multiplayer.

285
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,985
Speaker 0: Yeah But it shouldn't have been online multiplayer Just been local Wi-Fi.

286
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:37,080
Speaker 0: You know you go to this big area with some other people on a double screen and You you're both standing there, and you just do stuff.

287
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:37,986
Speaker 1: But it's kind of like in.

288
00:18:38,026 --> 00:18:44,880
Speaker 1: taiko alluded to this and made me realize that When I played old games like quest for glory I remember the moment when I was I was trying to pick the lock.

289
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,912
Speaker 1: I was like pick lock and I tried to pick a lock.

290
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:58,813
Speaker 1: I sat there for a second And I was like hey, and I typed pick nose and it didn't just say I don't understand you it said you definitely insert the lock pick into your nose and Proceed to die of a brain hemorrhage.

291
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,518
Speaker 1: you fuck wit.

292
00:18:59,538 --> 00:18:59,760
Speaker 1: yeah.

293
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,009
Speaker 1: However, if your lock picking skill was high enough.

294
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,153
Speaker 1: It would say congratulations.

295
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,731
Speaker 0: You've successfully picked your nose Yeah, and there were little.

296
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:14,299
Speaker 1: you have unlocked the torrent of snow As opposed to the previous torrent of blood yeah and brain.

297
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:19,732
Speaker 1: But I feel like that was what would have made scribble knots as a raw concept.

298
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:20,334
Speaker 1: great.

299
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:33,340
Speaker 1: the the discovery of interesting things in Scribble knots was very very very wide But very shallow and the way they've implemented adjectives as far as I can tell is not actually any more deep.

300
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:36,419
Speaker 1: I don't think a metal lion is any different than a wood lion.

301
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:42,860
Speaker 1: No, it sounds like just maybe a wood lion will catch on fire, and maybe any condiment based lion can be eaten.

302
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds like they just had a list of adjectives right like metal or wooden or whatever and they just applied.

303
00:19:48,179 --> 00:20:04,751
Speaker 0: it Looks different you know or maybe it has slightly different properties right anything wood and will set on fire You know and it's not like you actually need a wooden lion as opposed to a metal Helicopter you know to solve the puzzle any differently.

304
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:13,587
Speaker 0: I would try to solve everything with flesh something Yeah, like you know flesh handcuffs or like you know a leaf Because they didn't even.

305
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:20,195
Speaker 1: this is why role-playing games like to even Dungeons & Dragons Especially old D&D when the rules are kind of busted and fiddly and vague.

306
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:21,099
Speaker 1: was that?

307
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,764
Speaker 1: well I guess not.

308
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:26,672
Speaker 1: fiddly because you do weird stuff But because you had an eye instead of an AI.

309
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:28,500
Speaker 1: the game master would make crazy things happen.

310
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,871
Speaker 1: You know many times people would cast stone to flesh.

311
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:32,800
Speaker 1: I'm just like a wall.

312
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:36,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's just all right.

313
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,920
Speaker 1: the entire wall is made of soft and supple flesh.

314
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:46,079
Speaker 0: Great now what I use my sword to cut a hole in the wall that is now much softer than its former stone self.

315
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:48,563
Speaker 0: Yeah Congratulations.

316
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:52,380
Speaker 0: This wall is actually the edge of the dungeon and you find dirt on the other side.

317
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,582
Speaker 1: Good job But I feel like there is so much potential and scribble knots barely scratched the surface Which is fine.

318
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:06,930
Speaker 1: scratching the surface is fine, but the game is Crap, and I don't know if super scribble knots is going to.

319
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,240
Speaker 1: I don't have any indication that it's going to be any less crap.

320
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:14,067
Speaker 0: It's just another Game in the series of.

321
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:22,850
Speaker 0: we have stuff that looks really good on the surface and it's really good novelty as a demo But isn't actually worth your money or a significant amount of time.

322
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,257
Speaker 0: I feel like Lego universe.

323
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,460
Speaker 0: see Batman.

324
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:27,690
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

325
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:39,380
Speaker 1: remember that talk We didn't actually go to at PAX years ago that pointed out that if you have a game with a demo It actually sells much less especially small games because people get everything they wanted out of the demo.

326
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why this game doesn't have a demo.

327
00:21:41,882 --> 00:21:47,105
Speaker 1: However, the scribble knots had a demo in the sense that if you went there You're a hardcore gamer

328
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,834
Speaker 0: as one is a demo and you

329
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:58,620
Speaker 1: went to a convention You could try it out at the con and a lot of people played it at cons and were like, oh my god I'm gonna buy this game and I think the reason it worked was that it was so wide.

330
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:03,532
Speaker 1: Play it long enough to realize how shallow was exactly.

331
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,377
Speaker 1: they typed Zeus and a god appeared.

332
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:07,227
Speaker 1: They're like, holy shit It's got everything.

333
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:12,971
Speaker 1: and then they realize that Apollo Same God if you you people right?

334
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:15,300
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they say here's the thing, right?

335
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,720
Speaker 0: You know, they say you got to hook someone in like the first like 30 seconds of a book, right?

336
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:35,840
Speaker 0: So let's say I write a book and the book has a whole two chapters that are awesome But then the rest of the book is just the word fuck a hundred times and So if you get even if you give someone a demo that one awesome chapter is the demo.

337
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,960
Speaker 0: So they go oh man, and they just they are really feeling they need more.

338
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,108
Speaker 0: So they rush out and buy it and they read chapter 1 again.

339
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:44,340
Speaker 0: I read chapter 2 and then off what?

340
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,194
Speaker 1: All of my period exactly.

341
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,700
Speaker 0: so that's the super secret.

342
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Speaker 0: That's what scribble knots one was was I played it a little bit then I bought it.

343
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,935
Speaker 0: I played it even more and it took about 30 to 45 minutes before I was like.

344
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,160
Speaker 0: Oh So now that super scribble knots is adjectives.

345
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,359
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that it would only take me 15 to 20 minutes to exhaust that.

346
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:09,603
Speaker 0: That'd be done.

347
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:11,671
Speaker 0: However, I haven't played it though.

348
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,778
Speaker 0: So maybe there is something extra there.

349
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:14,260
Speaker 0: I don't know.

350
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,043
Speaker 1: I don't think so But I don't I would predict.

351
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:21,200
Speaker 1: not I am worryingly curious about his promise to try to install an IUD into a male shark.

352
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:33,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway anyway Things of the day, I'm sure you know, we link to College Humor a lot.

353
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,320
Speaker 1: But they actually spun off a little site called dorkly.

354
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,958
Speaker 1: That's the idea was and they actually they kind of announced this at PAX a while ago.

355
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,167
Speaker 1: X East Yeah, the first PAX East.

356
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:49,739
Speaker 1: Yeah that the idea was, you know College Humor is a lot of video game stuff But a lot of times it was Mortal Kombat was oh my god.

357
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:58,385
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty sure the guy who played you out in the later years in Street Fighter the later years was at the New York Comic-con dressed as Zangief.

358
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,839
Speaker 1: possibly there is no way it was not him if it was in fact not him.

359
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,364
Speaker 0: Dude, Zangief.

360
00:24:03,404 --> 00:24:08,140
Speaker 1: There's a guy who looks just like you who is also dressing up as Zangief in New York City.

361
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:12,192
Speaker 1: All righty, but they spun off dorkly with the idea that all right.

362
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:17,088
Speaker 1: Sometimes we want to make the more Gamery joke like the joke.

363
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's make a joke just like all these jokes We've been making but is so nerdy that you know, you'd have to really be a nerd to understand it.

364
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,670
Speaker 0: You know a Street Fighter joke most people can sort of get it a Mario joke.

365
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,156
Speaker 0: a lot of people can get that right.

366
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:45,594
Speaker 0: but if you make a specific joke about like a specific bad guy in Ninja Gaiden 2 Then normal people are not gonna quite understand it if it's an inside joke.

367
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,300
Speaker 0: It has a narrow appeal.

368
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:50,130
Speaker 0: I even have to like Penny Arcade Even at PAX.

369
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:56,220
Speaker 1: I have to explain what fucking Shadowgate is whenever I use that torch slide that I'm so famous for using in every panel.

370
00:24:56,521 --> 00:25:01,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and I don't think many people actually recognize my I'll take you to a good place panel.

371
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,059
Speaker 0: I'll take you to a good place.

372
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:07,920
Speaker 1: So anyway my thing of the day, this is just I love I'll take you to a good place.

373
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:12,440
Speaker 1: This is just one video, but you know, there'll be a link to all the other videos.

374
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,747
Speaker 1: But Yoshi hates Mario and it's Jordan.

375
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:15,088
Speaker 1: well done.

376
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:18,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you ever make a lot of people have been making video games.

377
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,214
Speaker 1: Almost everybody right almost everybody has been making video games.

378
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,200
Speaker 1: I don't believe that is in fact true.

379
00:25:26,562 --> 00:25:27,185
Speaker 0: A lot of people.

380
00:25:27,246 --> 00:25:29,237
Speaker 1: and the thing is we haven't even made video games.

381
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:33,172
Speaker 1: one problem You made a square that could rotate around its own axis.

382
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,640
Speaker 0: I've made video games before technically speaking.

383
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:44,511
Speaker 0: I mean I made a combat a multi an ad-hoc networking multiplayer combat clone and we got an a in in a Ad-hoc networking class at RIT.

384
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,820
Speaker 1: I made a pong clone.

385
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:49,816
Speaker 1: I made a game where you tell a stick figure to sing and then he sings.

386
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:51,566
Speaker 1: if you tell him do anything else He tries to kill you.

387
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:53,360
Speaker 0: I've made text adventures.

388
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,814
Speaker 0: I've made games that aren't really that are just sort of broken and don't do anything.

389
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've met all kinds again.

390
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,827
Speaker 0: Anyway, one problem.

391
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,577
Speaker 0: I always had making games is making the sound effects, right?

392
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,767
Speaker 0: Cuz it's like Yeah, what are you gonna do?

393
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:07,642
Speaker 0: You're gonna get a microphone and go pew pew pew Yeah, exactly.

394
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:12,637
Speaker 1: You usually do do, you know pull a an anime like voices of distant stars do it yourself.

395
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:18,320
Speaker 1: Just go for it Yeah, and if your game's good, you can probably at that point trick someone else to do the sound effect.

396
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,071
Speaker 0: I mean, you know The other thing you do is you get like some sort of chiptune thing.

397
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:29,120
Speaker 0: you get the chip out of a audio chip from a Gameboy or a Commodore 64 or a Nintendo and you know, you just work that or you just emulate that shit.

398
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,228
Speaker 1: Don't actually get the chip.

399
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:30,913
Speaker 0: That's what I mean.

400
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:34,971
Speaker 0: You can emulate it But anyway to make it even easier than that.

401
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:42,977
Speaker 0: This guy has made something called it's at super flash brothers dotnet, but it's called the AS3 SFXR.

402
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:49,260
Speaker 0: right and basically what it is is It's an emulation of one of those chips.

403
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,579
Speaker 0: It can make a square wave a sawtooth a sine wave and a noise.

404
00:26:53,825 --> 00:27:07,724
Speaker 0: You know like, you know noise but In addition to giving you all the necessary settings to fiddle with those waves such as attack time sustain time decay time frequency slide vibrato Everything right.

405
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:16,000
Speaker 0: phaser portamento filter low-pass filter high-pass filter repeats, you know It's got every setting you would need to make any sound that you can.

406
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:35,680
Speaker 0: It's like a basic sin, yes, but on the side here's the great part on the left hand side There are seven buttons and the seven buttons are as follows pick up slash coin laser slash shoot explosion power up hit slash hurt jump and blip slash select.

407
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:38,380
Speaker 1: Let me does it start you with a basic default?

408
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,160
Speaker 0: No, it just know it randomly sort of with it this each one is sort of a limited parameter set, right?

409
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,800
Speaker 0: So it basically says a blip slash select will have this setting between these areas and it randomly sets it between those areas.

410
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,796
Speaker 0: So every time you click it it plays a different blip slash select.

411
00:27:56,877 --> 00:28:00,460
Speaker 1: noise at random, dude I'm gonna blip slash slice you right?

412
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,230
Speaker 0: so if you need a jumping noise for your game just keep pushing the jump button to hear when you like and then tweak it A little bit and then push the export wave button and boom.

413
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,478
Speaker 0: You've got a wave file of that jumping noise.

414
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:11,020
Speaker 1: Not bad.

415
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 0: So if you're making a video game, especially a platformer that has these sort of, you know Or a shooter or any sort of game like, you know, and you want 8-bit old-school noises.

416
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:22,880
Speaker 0: This is gonna give you all the noises you need really quickly.

417
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:32,740
Speaker 1: I still think you're better off going with the Scottish Ava philosophy of helicopter blade helicopter blade helicopter blade Maybe if it was a poorly drawn stick figure game as opposed to a pixel.

418
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,384
Speaker 1: No, I want to see a game that looks like counter-strike, but it's just pew pew pew pew pew Put put put.

419
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,913
Speaker 0: Ah, no, we should make a game that looks.

420
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:46,760
Speaker 0: we should make a game that looks like Atari combat, but sounds like fucking Star Wars in the movie.

421
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,369
Speaker 1: We're not gonna make any of those things.

422
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:57,980
Speaker 1: yeah, so meta Moment the book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks.

423
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,953
Speaker 1: It's about world wars and zombies and all that shit you kids like.

424
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have an additional meta.

425
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:16,194
Speaker 0: It's probably a day too late on this but basically Malky and you know all these other people who are awesome webcomic writers the dinosaur comics guy And see I love dinosaur comics.

426
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:20,668
Speaker 0: Yeah Matthew Bernardo Dave Malky who's of Wondermark?

427
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,813
Speaker 0: and Ryan North, right?

428
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:29,953
Speaker 0: They made this book called machine of death and It's a collection of stories about people who know how they will die?

429
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:34,954
Speaker 0: because the machine tells them I guess And basically they had a campaign to.

430
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,244
Speaker 1: I just I Imagine the book being.

431
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:42,017
Speaker 1: every person goes to the machine and the machine says you will die by the hands of the machine and then It kills them.

432
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:44,398
Speaker 0: That's not a suicide booth.

433
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:50,960
Speaker 0: So this book came out and the cover price is $18, but the Amazon price is nine dollars.

434
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,025
Speaker 0: No sense.

435
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,515
Speaker 0: and they're having a special thing today.

436
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:55,560
Speaker 0: They pushed really hard.

437
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,562
Speaker 0: They said hey guys, let's make this the number one book on Amazon today October 26 2010.

438
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,605
Speaker 0: And sure enough they did it.

439
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,711
Speaker 0: It's the number one best-selling book in Amazon.

440
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:12,113
Speaker 0: today, October 26 2010, of course Most people listen to our episode a day later because it's a night show so it'll be.

441
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,214
Speaker 1: let's make it like the number eight book Tomorrow.

442
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:18,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Regardless I ordered a copy.

443
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:22,740
Speaker 0: I even paid shipping because I couldn't find anything else to get the order over $25.

444
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,807
Speaker 1: I just made an Amazon order.

445
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:28,480
Speaker 0: if you order quickly enough, it'll be added to your previous order already got shipped.

446
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:30,099
Speaker 1: It shipped the same day.

447
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:31,731
Speaker 1: Damn it.

448
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:38,240
Speaker 1: Anyway, actually I made two separate orders because I also pre-ordered a bunch of stuff that I've been meaning to pre-order.

449
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, just order a copy of machine of death.

450
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,335
Speaker 0: It's probably gonna be good.

451
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:51,180
Speaker 0: I mean, come on it's got huge awesome talents behind it, you know best webcomic writers out there among them and You know, the cover art is really good.

452
00:30:51,360 --> 00:31:01,291
Speaker 1: Also, we're gonna be at mag fast as part of the the mag 9 also doing at least one panel on our own called losing Should be fun, which is an old classic slightly updated.

453
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:02,193
Speaker 0: What other we do?

454
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:05,086
Speaker 1: any other conventions Pax East Pax East We will be doing.

455
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,020
Speaker 1: you should get a hopefully two panels.

456
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,278
Speaker 0: You should get a hotel and a ticket today if you think you're gonna go.

457
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,564
Speaker 1: Yeah I hope all the good hotels are already sold out.

458
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,869
Speaker 0: You're already too late, but you can still maybe go.

459
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,363
Speaker 0: kind of I don't know.

460
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:18,949
Speaker 0: I can't really think of anything else.

461
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,432
Speaker 1: That's it.

462
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,380
Speaker 1: We're gonna be a free to be a Pax Prime.

463
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay Be an anime Boston.

464
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:31,596
Speaker 0: Sure Okay, so Civilization 5 we have played it enough at this point to do a show about it.

465
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:32,460
Speaker 1: a little history.

466
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,820
Speaker 1: So Civ games are some of my favorite games ever.

467
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:44,060
Speaker 1: I probably spent more time playing Civ 2 than I've spent playing any game in my entire life With the possible exception of all counter-strikes combined.

468
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,641
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if I can say that but I did basically Civ 1.

469
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,978
Speaker 0: I played it like once or twice on a Mac at summer one.

470
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,264
Speaker 1: I'd never played.

471
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,940
Speaker 0: played on a Mac at summer camp once or twice and there was no instruction book and no one helped me.

472
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,979
Speaker 0: So I don't even know what the hell was going on.

473
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,120
Speaker 1: In fact, someone gave me Civ 2 and I didn't know what it was and I didn't have the instruction book.

474
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:09,209
Speaker 0: I just installed this hack coffee See colonization my friend had for DOS.

475
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,379
Speaker 0: I played it also once or twice didn't know what the hell was going on.

476
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:21,900
Speaker 0: But when Civ 2 came out I went and bought like it on CD-ROM and I had a 486 and I freaking played the hell out of it.

477
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:24,719
Speaker 1: I played Civ 2 every day and I put in my own CD.

478
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,659
Speaker 1: So I would play my own music and I would just sit there playing Civ 2 for life.

479
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,245
Speaker 0: I love the freaking the music.

480
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,212
Speaker 0: I would try to get Leonardo's workshop.

481
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,360
Speaker 0: just who would play the Leonardo's workshop music with the video?

482
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,453
Speaker 1: I tried to get Leonardo's workshop because then you could upgrade all your units immediately.

483
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,580
Speaker 1: I got musket men and I got workers.

484
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:45,980
Speaker 0: I wish they still had that shit because paying money to upgrade guys is not fun.

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,892
Speaker 0: I would get every science I could until I had to get.

486
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:50,960
Speaker 0: It was so great because you just built a million warriors.

487
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:54,915
Speaker 0: You got as many sciences as you could and then built Leonardo's workshop.

488
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:59,435
Speaker 1: a Leonardo's workshop Oh my and the pyramids granaries in every granary and everything.

489
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:00,640
Speaker 0: They were so powerful.

490
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,686
Speaker 1: They weren't really that powerful.

491
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,389
Speaker 1: I just didn't.

492
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:04,793
Speaker 1: I hated having to build.

493
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,378
Speaker 0: I meant I'm just saying wonders.

494
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,325
Speaker 0: in general We're so much more powerful.

495
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,691
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah today great.

496
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,056
Speaker 1: Well, everyone has to offer.

497
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:11,397
Speaker 1: Peace.

498
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:18,093
Speaker 0: Yeah Hey you want this water and I have a great wall.

499
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:18,760
Speaker 0: You have to offer me.

500
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,256
Speaker 0: I don't have to build the military cuz you get attacked me.

501
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:23,100
Speaker 0: I'll just build settlers.

502
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:23,924
Speaker 0: we get there.

503
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:34,040
Speaker 1: the game just had this beautiful balance between fiddliness and world-building and Abstraction that I would just play forever and it didn't really have multiplayer.

504
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:41,960
Speaker 1: But I would play for like four six hours in a row While on the phone like a conference call with two of my friends who were all at their houses two or three friends.

505
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:47,760
Speaker 1: They'd all be playing their own single-player games and we just be kind of sharing the narrative of our empires as we went along.

506
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:52,271
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't do that But as we'd email save games to each other.

507
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,800
Speaker 0: sieve three came out a long time later.

508
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,656
Speaker 0: I was at RIT already and I bought it as soon as it came out.

509
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:58,340
Speaker 0: I didn't buy it.

510
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,340
Speaker 0: I didn't play it, but I didn't really play it all that much because I don't I just don't think it was as good.

511
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:04,366
Speaker 1: I didn't get it.

512
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,640
Speaker 1: mostly got it and he said it wasn't that good.

513
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,326
Speaker 0: I mean, it was a significant improvement.

514
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:13,446
Speaker 0: interface wise and technology wise, you know ran out of more modern computers And you know work.

515
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,495
Speaker 1: it introduced a lot of interesting new mechanics.

516
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:16,820
Speaker 1: that culture culture.

517
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:29,034
Speaker 0: It was pretty nice and you know A lot of the things that were introduced in Civ 3 were carried on in Civ 4 and 5. but Civ 3 itself I don't I think really is sort of like the black sheep of the Civ series.

518
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:31,301
Speaker 0: It's like nobody still plays Civ 3.

519
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:37,001
Speaker 1: It was a missing link a progressive game between Civ 2 and Civ 4.

520
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, Civ 4 was a masterstroke.

521
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:43,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, Civ 4 was basically Civ 2 Plus.

522
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,447
Speaker 0: this new stuff in Civ 3 play.

523
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:45,810
Speaker 0: It was like.

524
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,014
Speaker 0: it was like everything.

525
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,540
Speaker 0: it was like let's put fucking every.

526
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,409
Speaker 0: It's like you go to the store and you look at the board game shelf and there's that one board game that the box is Twice as big and it's 20,000 pieces.

527
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,000
Speaker 1: It'll say how many pieces it has on the cover like that.

528
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, something that's it for Civ 4 has fucking every possible thing Imaginable.

529
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:08,760
Speaker 1: there was a time where I played Civ 4 for my like every train ride I had in both directions every day.

530
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I basically I played some Civ 4.

531
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:12,700
Speaker 0: I got into the game late.

532
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:19,580
Speaker 0: I waited until Steam, you know, I mean it came out a while ago But I didn't buy it until Steam had it for way cheap and a huge bundle.

533
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,980
Speaker 1: Yeah You played a couple of games with us because you wanted to get back into Civ and we all knew Civ 5 was coming.

534
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,900
Speaker 0: So I didn't want to kill too much time.

535
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,040
Speaker 0: And the thing is Civ 4 was pretty much like it was Civ 2 plus Civ 3 plus even more.

536
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:34,500
Speaker 0: That was what it was and it was you know, it was great at what it was.

537
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Speaker 0: But at this point in my life, I like I wasn't feeling that not because it was bad but because Like you basically it had this, you know The fundamental things going on did not fit with what I was looking for in gaming, right?

538
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,934
Speaker 0: It's like you had to build a million units and manage them all.

539
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:59,573
Speaker 0: and because it has everything It's like you got to worry about the religion and you got to worry about You know your money and you got to worry about the taxes and you got to.

540
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:00,596
Speaker 0: and I was just like.

541
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:03,006
Speaker 0: I do not have The time for this I'm trying to.

542
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:06,080
Speaker 0: I am, you know busy doing all this other stuff in my life.

543
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:07,622
Speaker 0: I don't have time for Civ 4.

544
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:10,986
Speaker 1: I still enjoy it and I still say, you know You want the short version of our review.

545
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:17,271
Speaker 1: Civ 4 will continue to be a relevant game because Civ 5 is Not a replacement.

546
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:18,300
Speaker 1: It is a different game.

547
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,760
Speaker 0: It is definitely a different game and you know, both are good games.

548
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,773
Speaker 0: But I think that Civ 5 has a place in my life that where Civ 4 does not.

549
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:31,097
Speaker 1: Civ 5 is a revolution not to be Confused with civilization revolutions, which is baby Civ.

550
00:36:31,217 --> 00:36:36,996
Speaker 0: Yeah I have Civ Rev on my phone and I had it for the DS but it got stolen.

551
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,120
Speaker 1: It's a little baby game.

552
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,856
Speaker 0: It's a little baby game, but it's great to play like on your phone.

553
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:41,500
Speaker 0: It's not good.

554
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,909
Speaker 0: I don't know why you would get it for the Xbox or the PC.

555
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,696
Speaker 1: Nah, but like I got.

556
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:50,777
Speaker 1: I got a city I got an army unit the army units gonna go capture the barbarian.

557
00:36:50,817 --> 00:37:02,153
Speaker 0: Yeah But I mean actually I think one good thing they took from Civ Rev and put into Civ 5 was the better interface because Civ Rev Definitely had a far superior user interface to any previous Civ.

558
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,236
Speaker 1: Civ 4 was pretty good.

559
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:05,748
Speaker 1: It was okay But Civ 2 was actually great.

560
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:08,080
Speaker 1: It was just cluttered looking but it was very usable.

561
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:11,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think Civ 5 really has it down, right?

562
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,823
Speaker 0: Cuz I mean Civ 5. a lot of people came to it from Civ 4 and like oh This is so.

563
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:16,989
Speaker 0: this is like they're like it's.

564
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,000
Speaker 0: it's only slightly more than Civ Rev.

565
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:22,882
Speaker 0: It's like baby Civ with a little bit of stuff on it, but that's not true I don't think.

566
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:31,820
Speaker 0: Civ 5 actually I think is just as you know, it doesn't have as much stuff But it's just as you know full of a game as any of the non rev Civs.

567
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Speaker 0: The thing is is they've simplified the user interface so much that it's just so much easier.

568
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:42,760
Speaker 0: Well, you know you don't open up the city screen and see like a hundred icons of wheat and can't figure it out.

569
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,760
Speaker 0: It said instead there's a green number that's like plus five food.

570
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:53,988
Speaker 1: This is the kind of fundamental change and there are a bunch of articles saying basically the same thing so you've probably seen them.

571
00:37:54,048 --> 00:38:02,340
Speaker 1: but Civ 5 is more like a Good German style board game done with a complexity that a computer allows.

572
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:07,480
Speaker 1: Then it is Civ 4 which was more like a world building simulation game.

573
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:26,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, and while they both serve both purposes the fundamental difference in Civ 5 not that they changed to hexes or any of that it's that every decision you make every little thing you can do like if you zoom in all the way and Micromanage everything every individual decision matters a huge

574
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:26,640
Speaker 0: amount.

575
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:35,664
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah in Civ 4 the really zoomed in stuff did not matter that much unless you were trying to win like crazy Circumstances.

576
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:35,925
Speaker 0: Yeah.

577
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:40,200
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it's not so much the hexes right but it's the one unit per square.

578
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:42,200
Speaker 0: Every unit is really valuable.

579
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,860
Speaker 0: It took you like eight maybe you know, 14 turns to make that guy and every turn is a huge deal.

580
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:51,620
Speaker 0: Right, and now if he dies, oh shit, right?

581
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,945
Speaker 0: You just lost a unit.

582
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:56,000
Speaker 1: or look at buildings instead of for build every goddamn building.

583
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,248
Speaker 1: That's fast as you can.

584
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:57,430
Speaker 0: every.

585
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,021
Speaker 0: every Civ 1 through 4.

586
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:06,100
Speaker 0: It was build every building you can as fast as you can while also somehow Having one city that only builds barracks and cranks out military units.

587
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:09,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in Civ 5 you don't need to build every building.

588
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:20,211
Speaker 0: You only need to build the buildings you need because the maintenance cost of that building is gonna bring you down Whereas, you know, you could deal with the maintenance cost in the earlier civs Yeah, but every building now does something that really matters.

589
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:25,149
Speaker 1: like you build a granary plus two food Oh two food, holy shit, and it wasn't.

590
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:31,880
Speaker 0: you know, you look at what some of the buildings did in the previous civs For example aqueduct right you they don't even have aqueduct anymore.

591
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,036
Speaker 0: But it was like you need an aqueduct to grow your city beyond X and then in Civ 4 it was.

592
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:42,792
Speaker 0: it reduces pollution Yeah, but now it's Listen, none of these buildings you need.

593
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,320
Speaker 0: you don't need any of them.

594
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,828
Speaker 0: You can choose to build them if you want to right.

595
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,818
Speaker 0: so it's like do I need happiness?

596
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,924
Speaker 0: Yes I'm minus three happiness.

597
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:53,690
Speaker 0: Well, how can I decrease happiness?

598
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,612
Speaker 0: I can get rid of a city.

599
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:56,678
Speaker 0: I can decrease population.

600
00:39:56,718 --> 00:39:57,120
Speaker 0: somehow.

601
00:39:58,202 --> 00:40:00,812
Speaker 1: I think there should be more ways to get and lose happiness.

602
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,225
Speaker 1: the one one or I can Try to reassign.

603
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:08,440
Speaker 0: I can stop growing to maybe, you know before I get unhappy to prevent unhappiness.

604
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,031
Speaker 1: Well, one thing that is pointedly missing from this is argue build a colosseum.

605
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,759
Speaker 1: is unhappiness due to continuing to be at war?

606
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:20,540
Speaker 1: Mmm, there's no penalty from just staying at war with someone for as long as you want to stay at war with them.

607
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:27,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact sometimes being at war makes you guys happier Yeah, but all that aside would like think about the with happiness, too.

608
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:41,644
Speaker 1: They've made it a game where different styles of empires are much more viable Like one really big city with a bunch of satellite cities works because things like the economy and happiness are global Variables of the sieve.

609
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,069
Speaker 1: it's not like this.

610
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,420
Speaker 1: city's happy and this city's unhappy and I got to deal with all that bullshit.

611
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,326
Speaker 1: It's my Empire's ex happy.

612
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,777
Speaker 1: Yep, which made the game a lot more fun.

613
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:57,120
Speaker 1: I will say straight up It makes it so much more easier to manage - it's it also made it less of a boolean thing.

614
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,353
Speaker 0: We're liking simple hover over that happy face.

615
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,600
Speaker 0: This is user interface stuff, right?

616
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:06,180
Speaker 0: You hover over the happy face with your mouse and it tells you where all of your happiness points are coming from and where?

617
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,520
Speaker 0: You're spending all your happiness points and that one little area.

618
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,060
Speaker 1: It's it forward to that - it's really clear that for did that - but this is so much more clear.

619
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,526
Speaker 1: But it was person was you hover over.

620
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:18,106
Speaker 1: it was like plus five due to X plus two due to Y per city though This is for your whole city.

621
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,572
Speaker 0: This is for your whole sieve.

622
00:41:19,592 --> 00:41:21,460
Speaker 0: You can just see all your happiness in a little square.

623
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:23,408
Speaker 0: It's all see all your whole economy in this little.

624
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:25,859
Speaker 1: it's also no longer a boolean state of like up.

625
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:26,763
Speaker 1: now They're unhappy.

626
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:27,927
Speaker 1: all the bullshit happens.

627
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:31,120
Speaker 1: you're get unhappy which just slows down the growth rate.

628
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:35,119
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you've got angry which is now there's trouble big trouble.

629
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:46,931
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean that's the one thing right that we've always complained about is with a lot of board games Right is we say oh man, this board game is a pretty good game Maybe but it's got too many fiddly bits.

630
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:54,700
Speaker 0: Twilight struggle the Twilight struggle Twilight struggle I mean Twilight or even if a game is not a good game or it doesn't matter but it has a big setup time.

631
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,400
Speaker 0: We got to set up all these pieces, you know, it takes so long to set it up.

632
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,309
Speaker 0: I don't want to play it or I'll got the game takes.

633
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:04,128
Speaker 1: All right, even Puerto Rico when we set it up They're like, oh, it's already set up.

634
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,300
Speaker 1: We might as well play it four or five more times.

635
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:12,320
Speaker 0: If five is that it's a German board game that is more complex than any German board game that you can buy on the shelves.

636
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:22,060
Speaker 0: But because they use a computer instead of making you fiddle with pieces It totally works and because the user interfaces are streamlined you can process all that information.

637
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:26,419
Speaker 0: You know, even if you're not You don't have a huge brain now.

638
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:48,047
Speaker 1: Thus a fundamental for me at least like gameplay mechanism design aspect that I've noticed as I've played and I'm sure other people have noticed It too and I think it derives heavily from this kind of board game style design the idea that every decision should matter that you know Even little decisions come out over time and it's not just this kind of momentum thing of you know I build this and build this and build this.

639
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,656
Speaker 1: I have to follow this progression everywhere all this fiddliness.

640
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,279
Speaker 1: I Really?

641
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:01,375
Speaker 1: try to win which is weird because in sieve - I never Tried to win like I'm going to win the game.

642
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:02,360
Speaker 1: Yeah victory conditions.

643
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:08,402
Speaker 0: I played because I just fucking like playing and so for one sieve - there were really only a couple ways to win Right is?

644
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:10,811
Speaker 0: you could win with the UN voting, right?

645
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,160
Speaker 0: You could win with score at the end of the game.

646
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,330
Speaker 1: I don't think could win the game in sieve - you could.

647
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,422
Speaker 0: you could win with the spaceship and you could win by just killing Everybody.

648
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,014
Speaker 0: yeah in sieve 3 they added like a cultural victory sieve 4.

649
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,820
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of victory conditions.

650
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,705
Speaker 0: They're now they still.

651
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,520
Speaker 0: they still have a bunch, you know, they have the cut that you can build.

652
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:29,932
Speaker 1: Here's the big difference.

653
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:35,578
Speaker 1: when I played sieve 4 I would just play to make my awesome Empire and then midway through the game.

654
00:43:35,638 --> 00:43:36,240
Speaker 1: I'd get to the mode.

655
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,744
Speaker 1: We're alright, maybe I'll try to win.

656
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,912
Speaker 1: what victory conditions I go for in sieve 5?

657
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:42,617
Speaker 1: against the computer or against humans?

658
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:45,448
Speaker 1: every round I'm thinking how am I going to win?

659
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:47,920
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, how am I going to win the game in the end?

660
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,542
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

661
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:49,486
Speaker 1: Am I going for culture?

662
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:50,230
Speaker 1: Well, I got to do this.

663
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,475
Speaker 1: What am I going to do to win?

664
00:43:51,555 --> 00:43:56,880
Speaker 1: I my brain Literally shifts into board game mode every second that I'm playing.

665
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:57,423
Speaker 1: I've started.

666
00:43:57,464 --> 00:44:00,000
Speaker 0: I've just started playing the game in the in the hex view.

667
00:44:00,602 --> 00:44:05,120
Speaker 1: I don't because my video card is not up to the challenge.

668
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:05,765
Speaker 0: Well, you can't.

669
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:07,800
Speaker 0: the hex mode is easier on the video card.

670
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,668
Speaker 1: No, the hex mode actually gives me more trouble.

671
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:12,660
Speaker 1: really cuz I'm my last hope they gave me more trouble.

672
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:16,196
Speaker 1: I just installed an Nvidia update that I didn't realize I hadn't installed.

673
00:44:16,216 --> 00:44:17,019
Speaker 1: I have not tried again.

674
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:19,569
Speaker 0: But see I and my computer.

675
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:21,356
Speaker 0: I desktop at home with a new video card.

676
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:26,980
Speaker 0: I can play in either mode No problem, but on my laptop and with the integrated Intel piece of crap, right?

677
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,480
Speaker 0: I play in DirectX 9 mode with the hexes and there's some grant.

678
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,960
Speaker 0: There's some graphical glitches, but it's totally smooth and it doesn't interfere with the game.

679
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:43,360
Speaker 1: See I tried it once with it when I was like one driver behind in Nvidia Which actually does fix some important things for sieve.

680
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:52,744
Speaker 1: If you if you're having any trouble with sit five at all Go get the newest Nvidia drivers like seriously or whatever driver your video card is But specifically with Nvidia.

681
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:56,035
Speaker 1: the most recent Nvidia drivers fix very specific issues.

682
00:44:56,075 --> 00:45:02,019
Speaker 0: that very if you're a gamer If you're a gamer of any kind, you need to upgrade your video card driver all the time.

683
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,125
Speaker 0: Yes However, there's a new one.

684
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:13,700
Speaker 1: There was a time when that wasn't true when I had my creative graphics blaster extreme I Upgraded the driver and that actually caused a serious problem with quake.

685
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:19,080
Speaker 0: Anyway, no, let's talk about some of the things that yeah, I don't like in Civ 5.

686
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,341
Speaker 0: All right.

687
00:45:19,502 --> 00:45:24,239
Speaker 0: So one thing I don't like is that the multiplayer first of all technologically has some issues, right?

688
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:26,545
Speaker 1: Players always had issues.

689
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:27,207
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

690
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:28,712
Speaker 1: Why can't it spy?

691
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:29,696
Speaker 1: Listen, I why?

692
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:30,278
Speaker 1: games fine.

693
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:31,787
Speaker 0: They're not using you So they're using steam.

694
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:33,400
Speaker 1: the game spy logo is still there.

695
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,020
Speaker 0: I don't know why the game spy logo is there because it completely uses steam for everything.

696
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,742
Speaker 1: I'll bet under the hood.

697
00:45:37,762 --> 00:45:39,107
Speaker 1: He uses games five bullshit.

698
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:40,872
Speaker 0: It possibly does which is bullshit.

699
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:41,695
Speaker 0: And again, why?

700
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:42,317
Speaker 1: why the fuck?

701
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:43,420
Speaker 1: game spies terrible?

702
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, but regardless whether it's game spy or not.

703
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,457
Speaker 0: They're networking just doesn't really work.

704
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,380
Speaker 0: The game is slow.

705
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,672
Speaker 0: Why do they fucking fuck up networking?

706
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,800
Speaker 1: Why do they turn off all the animations by default?

707
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,321
Speaker 1: There's no real.

708
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:58,449
Speaker 1: that's not what's slowing down the network play.

709
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,420
Speaker 0: the network plays slow because your networking code is shitty.

710
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,907
Speaker 1: Why does the game continuously just say I'm gonna restart and Everyone who's ever making a networked game.

711
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:11,076
Speaker 0: You have to make the network code first.

712
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:13,362
Speaker 1: hire an IT guy I don't know.

713
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:17,073
Speaker 0: hire valves guys because Val games always fucking work.

714
00:46:17,114 --> 00:46:19,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, Darwin multi-winning it.

715
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,960
Speaker 0: That was a game that got fucked up by bad networking.

716
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:24,760
Speaker 1: Well also by the fact that they didn't have invert mouse by me.

717
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean there are just so many games, you know, and s2 was having huge networking problems.

718
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,307
Speaker 0: I think they've tweeted recently.

719
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,115
Speaker 0: They finally figured out what I said.

720
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:34,320
Speaker 1: No network problems at all.

721
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,333
Speaker 0: Yeah valve never has networking problems.

722
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:37,320
Speaker 0: counter-strike perfect.

723
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,914
Speaker 1: Here's the amazing thing that really bothers me counter-strike and left for dead.

724
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:44,627
Speaker 1: our real-time FPS is where it really matters.

725
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:45,490
Speaker 1: on the latency.

726
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,617
Speaker 0: This is a turn-based game here.

727
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:59,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, dudes Another thing that bothers me in multiplayer, even when it works simultaneous the simultaneous mode, you know what I found out according to Asking a question on the gaming equivalent of Stack Overflow.

728
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:00,172
Speaker 0: Yes.

729
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:02,399
Speaker 0: It's apparently whoever clicks first goes.

730
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:04,391
Speaker 0: Yes That's why I always bullshit.

731
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,640
Speaker 1: Well, here's the problem.

732
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:11,950
Speaker 1: Sieve for and before you could turn on or off Simultaneous turn-taking.

733
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:13,440
Speaker 1: I didn't look to see if you can do it.

734
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:14,080
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

735
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,620
Speaker 0: If you don't have simultaneous turn-taking I basically to wait for all you fuckers to take your turns in sequence.

736
00:47:20,102 --> 00:47:24,879
Speaker 1: Not only that but say I went first I will always go before you.

737
00:47:25,724 --> 00:47:27,759
Speaker 1: Yep, that'll matter when we're close to each other.

738
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,953
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, but the thing is it only matter like let's.

739
00:47:32,074 --> 00:47:35,495
Speaker 0: the thing is once the game gets going Let's say I attack you first.

740
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,267
Speaker 0: Okay Well now I'm even though you went first.

741
00:47:38,348 --> 00:47:43,024
Speaker 0: you always have a turn and you know ahead of me in terms of how much stuff You've made in the entire game.

742
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,135
Speaker 0: I'm sort of I have the initiative in the combat.

743
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,640
Speaker 0: So I've you know, I attacked first.

744
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,984
Speaker 0: It's not I'm always.

745
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:52,273
Speaker 0: you're always gonna be reacting because I'm always going before you.

746
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:57,579
Speaker 0: they could do something along lines of power grid Right where the the turn order is shuffled.

747
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone takes a turn and then we reshuffle the turn order.

748
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:02,780
Speaker 0: what I would actually get two turns in a row.

749
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,220
Speaker 1: I would have a hybrid mode where the game would be simultaneous turns all the time unless quote it matters.

750
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:12,467
Speaker 1: Yeah Define situations where it matters like say

751
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:13,128
Speaker 0: if you're

752
00:48:13,148 --> 00:48:27,939
Speaker 1: at war and any unit you have is within range of Being able to interact with any unit with the people you're at war with and maybe a whole bunch of other Situations like anywhere around a ruin where there's anyone within range of it all that stuff.

753
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:34,060
Speaker 1: Then you switch into some sort of turn-based mode for movements and movement only.

754
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:36,380
Speaker 0: Here's a here's an interesting question, right?

755
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:43,560
Speaker 0: Let's say theoretically speaking right you are one turn away from completing the utopia project.

756
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,219
Speaker 0: You as soon as you click next turn on that turn I click next turn first.

757
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:53,160
Speaker 0: No, let's say you click next turn and on that next turn you will have won the game with cultural victory.

758
00:48:53,723 --> 00:49:00,152
Speaker 0: Let's say also for instance on the exact same turn Well, I'm one turn away from launching my spaceship on the next turn.

759
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:05,432
Speaker 0: when I click next turn that turn after that My spaceship will have reached Alpha Centauri and I'll have won the game.

760
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:06,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what the answer is.

761
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:07,802
Speaker 1: Fuck you I don't know.

762
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:08,688
Speaker 1: It's gonna be terrible.

763
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:11,443
Speaker 1: It's gonna break and we're not gonna know and some randomly Listen.

764
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:16,020
Speaker 0: guys, you have to make multiplayer the priority here, right?

765
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,643
Speaker 0: You know you have to think of multiplayer first and design the game around Multiplayer.

766
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:24,820
Speaker 0: right because as it stands single-player multiplayer completely different games that I've almost nothing to do with each other.

767
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,849
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's kind of bullshit.

768
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:27,994
Speaker 0: I don't like it.

769
00:49:28,014 --> 00:49:32,549
Speaker 1: Yes me granted That is not why your entire collapsed in our recent multiplayer game.

770
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:39,709
Speaker 1: Well, I mean because a quote my military advisor I think I saw Egypt's only military unit.

771
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,772
Speaker 1: It looked lonely.

772
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:41,875
Speaker 0: That's true.

773
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:51,740
Speaker 0: I did have few units however, I would have Done a lot significantly better right if the simultaneous thing had not happened, right?

774
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,342
Speaker 1: Yes, you would have.

775
00:49:52,442 --> 00:50:01,660
Speaker 1: you would have it would I would still have because because the military you were fighting against my Advisor said the same thing about him is his military was larger than mine.

776
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,576
Speaker 0: But the different the thing was is my military was largely comply.

777
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,600
Speaker 0: I was Egypt.

778
00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:11,840
Speaker 0: I mostly had the horse Archer Egypt guys who are ranged attacking units.

779
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:24,657
Speaker 0: I am I. they were hiding behind some warriors and some spearmen and if I had been able to go first I could have Launched my range attacks doing significant damage to his guys before being rushed.

780
00:50:25,018 --> 00:50:25,600
Speaker 0: as it stands.

781
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:30,440
Speaker 0: He rushed me and these units were basically completely useless if they get attacked.

782
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,879
Speaker 0: So he just killed the guys before they had any chance to shoot.

783
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:36,251
Speaker 0: So even you know meaning that it totally mattered.

784
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,900
Speaker 0: and but because of simultaneous turns he clicked first.

785
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,580
Speaker 1: So the option is always cue up move movements before you end your turn for the next turn.

786
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:45,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I you know, it was.

787
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:46,432
Speaker 1: I know it's bullshit.

788
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:47,014
Speaker 0: It's bullshit.

789
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:49,069
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter me or Scott Johnson They're gonna win that game.

790
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

791
00:50:50,062 --> 00:51:03,440
Speaker 1: Anyway, of course I do like the thing where domination victory and this is so board gamey only the capitals matter Because then you can get into situations where like in the game we're playing Scott's dead and icon and it's me and Scott Johnson.

792
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,267
Speaker 1: I have like two massive empires and then Alex has a pretty good Empire he's conquering the rest of Scott's and consolidating.

793
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:17,809
Speaker 1: if scojo and I go to war the two big like world empires and We end up taking both of each other's capitalism point Alex just wins.

794
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that.

795
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:25,170
Speaker 1: that dynamic makes the game interesting Mmm, even though it's not necessarily realistic.

796
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,620
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's not realistic, but it's a German board game kind of thing, which I like.

797
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:38,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, also Everyone's fears that the game's military would devolve into advanced wars are true But it's not who says devolve.

798
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:39,099
Speaker 0: I think that's it.

799
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, but it's true in that I've never lost a military conflict with anyone.

800
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,953
Speaker 0: Yeah in any play multi kind of it's kind of sad and single-player.

801
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:53,739
Speaker 0: if you don't turn up the difficulty to give the computer And even if you do their militaries are pitiful like it they'll declare war on me.

802
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:59,080
Speaker 0: I'll have like because I you know They basically the computer declares war on you if you're too weak and you have good stuff that they want.

803
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,396
Speaker 0: So you just huddle like four good units around where they're attacking.

804
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:04,600
Speaker 0: they attack in one spot.

805
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:07,785
Speaker 0: Maybe you have a great general out there Maybe even have it build a citadel.

806
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:12,060
Speaker 0: you can basically hold off waves and waves of units unless they're significantly better.

807
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:17,233
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh unrelatedly remember we were arguing about the benefits of the culture bomb.

808
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:18,837
Speaker 1: culture bomb Citadel.

809
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:24,992
Speaker 1: Oh I realized that ten seconds ago.

810
00:52:25,012 --> 00:52:25,875
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

811
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:29,098
Speaker 0: Oh, man They know culture bombs are actually the problem.

812
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:29,983
Speaker 0: reason I don't use that.

813
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:34,188
Speaker 0: the problem with the culture bomb right is like I want to use it and if I'm at war someone I'll totally use it.

814
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,020
Speaker 0: but it's like The time that I get a great artist.

815
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:44,080
Speaker 0: I've probably we've already pushed our cultural borders right up next to each other right and there's no empty space.

816
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:52,039
Speaker 0: So a culture bomb will get me some hexes, which is pretty good But it'll only get me hexes from someone I don't necessarily want to go to war with right now.

817
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:57,080
Speaker 1: Let's go to war anyway, because as I've learned in single-player just declare war on the entire world.

818
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,532
Speaker 1: There's nothing they can fucking do to you.

819
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:01,319
Speaker 1: Yeah As long as you have advanced war skills.

820
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:07,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you but you have to also build a military right if you'd build nothing but wonders and buildings You're gonna get crushed.

821
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:09,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're Gandhi, I like how Gandhi's really peaceable.

822
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:17,787
Speaker 1: every game I see him and he's super nice to me and we're really friendly and we cooperate and trade and once he's got a Gigantic city full of wonders.

823
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:31,000
Speaker 1: I conquer it like immediately and it's awesome But I feel bad and he really he rubs it in after you conquer him He's like, well, I hope you're happy having conquered a peaceful civilization with nothing but good intentions for you.

824
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:35,618
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I feel bad for a minute and then I look at my wonders and you look at your score.

825
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:38,498
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm gonna win this game.

826
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:39,409
Speaker 0: That's that is.

827
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:46,685
Speaker 0: one thing though That I think is a. perhaps the negative in Civ 5 is the military play is actually much better Because you don't have to manage it.

828
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,010
Speaker 0: It's not about who has most units.

829
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:49,456
Speaker 0: It's actually about moving the units.

830
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:56,600
Speaker 0: It's about rim wins Yeah, but the problem is is that military pretty much dominates everything else or I was going to win.

831
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,351
Speaker 1: I've had two games where this happened.

832
00:53:58,411 --> 00:53:59,760
Speaker 1: I said I'm gonna go for culture victory.

833
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:17,420
Speaker 1: I was going for culture victory like the whole game and I'm near culture victory like five to 20 turns from guaranteed cultural victory and I look and realize that I Can just go conquer like two capitals right now because the game in the game I'm playing right?

834
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,631
Speaker 0: I'm trying out the new Genghis Khan, right?

835
00:54:20,154 --> 00:54:21,400
Speaker 0: He's got awesome mounted units.

836
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:25,434
Speaker 0: So I got all these mounted units and a great general and some musket men marching around.

837
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,220
Speaker 0: just I totally took Arabia.

838
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:30,740
Speaker 0: I took every city they have except for one that's on the other side of Napoleon.

839
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,007
Speaker 0: So then I made peace with them.

840
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:34,958
Speaker 1: No you make peace with and then you get open.

841
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:35,964
Speaker 1: game Is he march over?

842
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:36,386
Speaker 0: hold on.

843
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:39,020
Speaker 0: Genghis Khan has like 25% bonus of city-state.

844
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,482
Speaker 0: So I can't.

845
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:42,874
Speaker 0: I conquered every nearby city-state and the best thing is I puppeted them all.

846
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,580
Speaker 0: I didn't actually annex anything.

847
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,566
Speaker 1: Puppet everything cuz there's no penalty.

848
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:49,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, who wants to freakin actually bother managing any?

849
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:52,506
Speaker 1: unless you want to do military stuff I just puppet everything.

850
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:55,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want you can add you can switch from puppet to annex.

851
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:01,908
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying puppet everything and then later only like when you suddenly need to do something specific It's the only time you should ever annex.

852
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:07,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I always annex capital Annex, make sure you do when you have a pile of money so you can get a courthouse.

853
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:19,040
Speaker 0: Ah, yep Mad important anyway, but then I go and I check and I'm looking at the advisor menu And it says I'm looking at how strong everyone is and it's like Washington is on the other side of the world.

854
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,608
Speaker 0: I just discovered him with my caravel.

855
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:29,888
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, don't even fuck with Washington Yeah, and then but I look and Napoleon who's pretty much the only person sharing the content with me now Continent with me at this point.

856
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,356
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, Napoleon's weak-ass.

857
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,020
Speaker 0: You should go rape him.

858
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,780
Speaker 0: I'm like Napoleon's Empire is three times the size of mine and I have like these five units.

859
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,079
Speaker 0: They have been upgraded like crazy because they've been killing big destroyed.

860
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:47,780
Speaker 1: It amazes me how a couple of horsemen and some like bowmen used effectively can take out entire empires.

861
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:51,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they're just so experienced from getting all these upgrades.

862
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:58,980
Speaker 0: I basically have every single upgrade that gives you plus if you have for on open terrain and then I've got plus 25%.

863
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,441
Speaker 0: Mongo, you know plus 25%.

864
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:04,941
Speaker 0: I have like a hundred plus 25% Plus.

865
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:10,200
Speaker 0: they're near a great general plus another 25 and those stack on top of each other is basically like I shoot a guy.

866
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:14,240
Speaker 0: Cuz the the the special unit as you know range attack the Keshiks.

867
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Keshik is array as shoots arrows at guys from his horses.

868
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:18,736
Speaker 0: Just boom any unit.

869
00:56:18,796 --> 00:56:27,574
Speaker 0: just shoot him with hours dead Right, so I'm like I'm gonna as soon as I load this game up I'm just gonna March these six guys over towards Napoleon and I'm gonna take over this.

870
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:29,339
Speaker 0: I tired gigantic continent.

871
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:33,740
Speaker 0: And basically the way the computer fights they'll send all the units after you.

872
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:43,780
Speaker 0: So you have to actually have some extra units to begin with to fight off their army and as soon as you destroy their army Basically, they spit out one unit every few turns and you just go city to city.

873
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:45,320
Speaker 0: You just go city to city puppet.

874
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:50,318
Speaker 1: But it's only hard to take them if there's two cities within range of each other and they start double bombarding.

875
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:50,680
Speaker 0: you know.

876
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:51,517
Speaker 0: Yeah I hate that.

877
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:52,503
Speaker 1: Usually I'll.

878
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:53,045
Speaker 0: that is.

879
00:56:53,226 --> 00:57:00,633
Speaker 0: another thing that I really love about the game is that you used to have to build a spear man in Every city and then upgrade into a pikeman upgrade until musket upgrade, right?

880
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:08,560
Speaker 1: Sometimes I'm sieve for even in multiplayer I just forget about a couple of you have to have multiple Johnson marches in with cavalry and I'm like, whatever my inventory will take care.

881
00:57:08,962 --> 00:57:10,732
Speaker 1: Oh my pikemen are not gonna take care of that.

882
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:12,139
Speaker 0: I forgot to upgrade that.

883
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,740
Speaker 0: I forgot to have enough guys in that city.

884
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,168
Speaker 0: I forgot to upgrade the guys in that city.

885
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,260
Speaker 0: now you can only have one unit in a city.

886
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,565
Speaker 0: Anyways, you don't have to worry about.

887
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:22,300
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't have enough right but a city can defend itself.

888
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:24,940
Speaker 0: It's even if you don't have any guys near the city.

889
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:31,120
Speaker 0: It can shoot and do wicked damage and if it has walls or something It's gonna be pretty hard for them to just take your city.

890
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:37,640
Speaker 0: They can't just sneak over with like the weak-ass military unit all in his own and just take your city because you left it empty.

891
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:46,265
Speaker 0: Right, they actually have to attack a city with at least three or four guys to take it from you or to Companion cavalry.

892
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,672
Speaker 0: it takes more than a turn to do it.

893
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:51,300
Speaker 0: They can't just sneak in and snatch an entire city, right?

894
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,040
Speaker 0: That's pretty unrealistic too, right?

895
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:59,220
Speaker 0: Like there's a whole big city here and a tiny group of military guys just walk into the city and now it switches countries also.

896
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,176
Speaker 1: No spies, I can't just go buy an enemy city.

897
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:05,309
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Oh, that's that glad they took that out right.

898
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:08,200
Speaker 0: that sort of just was sort of annoying and fiddly to have spies.

899
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:20,184
Speaker 1: Yeah You know I think I'll add it back in because one thing I really look forward to and I think this is going to be But this game is going to be the replacement for Civ 4. when Civ 5 I thought you said it wasn't.

900
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:33,948
Speaker 1: When Civ 5 gets its equivalent of the Beyond the Sword expansion because that added Everything to Civ 4 and imagine Civ 5 with all that stuff just crammed into it Oh, yeah, that'd be pretty good.

901
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,260
Speaker 1: other rider weird complaints.

902
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:46,100
Speaker 1: I wish you could do more with city-states like trick them Independent ones into declaring war on people or make them like yeah I wish there's also more ways to gain favor with them.

903
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:47,585
Speaker 1: Yeah just money or quests.

904
00:58:47,685 --> 00:58:53,540
Speaker 0: you can give them money or you can wait for them to randomly have a quest and Sometimes the quest is a huge pain in the ass, right?

905
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:59,198
Speaker 0: Like someone on the other side of the world to be like, hey make a road to me and I'm like, no I'm like, you know how far that is?

906
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,650
Speaker 0: You know how much I would have to pay for that fucking road?

907
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:07,312
Speaker 0: Fuck you and tires just like yeah, whatever It's not worth it to get like 25 favor with you.

908
00:59:07,332 --> 00:59:08,797
Speaker 0: That's gonna run out pretty soon.

909
00:59:08,877 --> 00:59:14,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Just you know, maybe you'll give me a military unit or maybe you'll give me a few turns.

910
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,588
Speaker 1: That's why I think a modern expansion.

911
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:23,280
Speaker 0: when I could just say I get it upon city-states Why why would I make a road to you or kill barbarians for you when I could just conquer you with four military units?

912
00:59:23,501 --> 00:59:26,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, like three turns and then you'll give me everything you've got.

913
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:33,482
Speaker 1: You know a lot of times they give you far less culture if you conquer them than if they're a cultural city-state and you Pay them.

914
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:36,132
Speaker 0: I know right but then I had to pay freaking money.

915
00:59:36,393 --> 00:59:37,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not worth it.

916
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:46,560
Speaker 1: I also don't like I have to keep paying the money a lot of it all the time If this was a conscious decision on the designers part or just a mistake.

917
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:50,900
Speaker 1: But how come whenever I tell a unit to go anywhere?

918
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:53,673
Speaker 1: That's more than like a direct path.

919
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:54,980
Speaker 1: like I click over a distance.

920
00:59:55,401 --> 01:00:01,440
Speaker 1: They will go way the fuck out of their way to go through enemy territory to go through city-state territory.

921
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:04,170
Speaker 1: They'll embark like ten times on all.

922
01:00:04,552 --> 01:00:06,680
Speaker 1: they take the worst possible paths.

923
01:00:07,082 --> 01:00:08,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not too good with the hex pathing.

924
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:13,840
Speaker 0: the worst is if there's a road near a guy He'll like go out of his way like an extra hex to use the road.

925
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:17,380
Speaker 0: It's like I have to tell him how to move one hex at a time to get the right way.

926
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:20,440
Speaker 1: You'd think all right, maybe he did that because that's a more optimal path.

927
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,383
Speaker 1: No, it never is.

928
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:21,443
Speaker 0: no.

929
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:23,310
Speaker 1: or worse the city-states.

930
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,280
Speaker 1: There are two paths that are completely equal in cost.

931
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,580
Speaker 1: He'll go through the city-state pissing it off.

932
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:34,895
Speaker 0: I think what they need to do in their algorithm from what I can tell is Basically, it does a shortest path in terms of cost, right?

933
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:40,942
Speaker 0: So it's like, okay It'll cost you three movement points to get here And if you want way and three if you go that way It doesn't.

934
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:45,519
Speaker 0: what he needs to do is it also needs to pick the path that will use the fewest hexes.

935
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:49,855
Speaker 0: Okay, these two paths from A to B are cost three movement points.

936
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:51,020
Speaker 0: this one is two hexes.

937
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,005
Speaker 0: This one is five hexes.

938
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:53,353
Speaker 0: use the two hex one.

939
01:00:53,614 --> 01:00:54,459
Speaker 0: Not the five hex one.

940
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:58,193
Speaker 1: That maybe one of them is more defensive and one of his more.

941
01:00:58,213 --> 01:01:00,447
Speaker 1: but then again if you want it if you care You'll go.

942
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:01,279
Speaker 1: do it turn by turn.

943
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:09,045
Speaker 1: Yeah The real trouble is why do they take they should wait city-state occupied territories that aren't allies Slightly negatively.

944
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:12,077
Speaker 1: So my guys don't always wander in you have to build.

945
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:12,940
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true.

946
01:01:13,422 --> 01:01:15,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like unless you're a reality.

947
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:16,493
Speaker 0: that's one advantage like.

948
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:16,834
Speaker 0: I hate.

949
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:19,509
Speaker 0: it's sort of like one of those things I hate and I like right.

950
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:21,642
Speaker 0: there are games that have annoyances.

951
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:33,304
Speaker 0: there's a lot of games that just have annoyances and there are bonuses you can get in those games that do nothing but remove the Annoyance, they don't actually give you a bonus to winning like in those Final Fantasy 6 wearing the item That doesn't give you a bonus.

952
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:34,468
Speaker 1: It just lets you walk fast.

953
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:36,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right?

954
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:37,820
Speaker 1: It's like a bike in Pokemon.

955
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:44,240
Speaker 0: This doesn't actually Give you any power in terms of winning and losing or any victory points or anything like that.

956
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:46,796
Speaker 0: All it does is make the game more convenient to play.

957
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,819
Speaker 0: It's like You should just give that for free to everybody.

958
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:54,800
Speaker 0: Oh the game will be a lot more convenient if you didn't have to click this checkbox every turn.

959
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:55,283
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna.

960
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:57,840
Speaker 0: here's a bonus that takes this annoyance away.

961
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:01,900
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't how everyone has the ability to click the checkbox every turn.

962
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,200
Speaker 0: Everyone's gonna do it to make sure that they win but one guy just doesn't have to remember to click.

963
01:02:07,626 --> 01:02:08,579
Speaker 0: It's bullshit, right?

964
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:16,877
Speaker 1: That you should not be things like that Game at all like the the the stuff not moving military units through city-states without pissing them off.

965
01:02:16,957 --> 01:02:17,900
Speaker 1: I like that mechanic.

966
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:22,680
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but Alexander the Great has this thing where it's basically like oh, yeah be him.

967
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:32,280
Speaker 0: So you don't do what you can just set your guys on auto-explore and not have to worry about them trespassing and everybody Yeah, but then everyone else has to manually move all the units.

968
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,206
Speaker 0: that power really is.

969
01:02:33,226 --> 01:02:39,920
Speaker 1: I Also, once I've paid a city-state they stay mine for a long freaking time.

970
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:41,987
Speaker 0: No, there's two different powers.

971
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,110
Speaker 0: They're the same power.

972
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:46,100
Speaker 0: No, he has a separate power, which is he can't trespass.

973
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,297
Speaker 1: now They're under the same power.

974
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:57,217
Speaker 1: There are two separate effects of you know, plus it's not that the trespassing doesn't happen It's that the problems caused by go back to normal at a rate.

975
01:02:57,258 --> 01:02:58,584
Speaker 0: That's faster Oh, I thought.

976
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:00,596
Speaker 0: I thought it was that trust you just didn't no one cared.

977
01:03:00,637 --> 01:03:05,500
Speaker 1: if you dress bad You move towards zero faster from negative and towards zero slower from positive.

978
01:03:06,142 --> 01:03:09,752
Speaker 0: I thought that was what you get if you actually use the the social.

979
01:03:09,892 --> 01:03:15,449
Speaker 0: Oh, man, that's something I like a lot the friggin social Stuff that what you use your culture points to buy.

980
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:19,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, the policies cuz frickin it It's all the other sieve games.

981
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:28,600
Speaker 0: You had to change your governments and your religion and all that stuff and you had to go into Anarchy to do it and that was just so fiddly and bleh, but now the social policies.

982
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:29,302
Speaker 0: It's like.

983
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:30,045
Speaker 0: it's like.

984
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:30,306
Speaker 0: just.

985
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:34,800
Speaker 1: however, I did enjoy the mix-and-match nature of Civ 4.

986
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:40,020
Speaker 1: We're like, I'm this but I'm also this and in Civ 5 is definitely more of a progressive thing.

987
01:03:40,662 --> 01:03:42,849
Speaker 1: It's more like an alternate additional tech tree.

988
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,171
Speaker 1: Yeah.

989
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:43,933
Speaker 0: Well, it's like getting.

990
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:45,739
Speaker 0: it's like building buildings in Puerto Rico.

991
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:47,289
Speaker 0: Yeah It's so board gamey.

992
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:47,772
Speaker 0: I love that.

993
01:03:47,793 --> 01:03:48,779
Speaker 1: I do enjoy it.

994
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,240
Speaker 0: I just I feel like they can expand upon it and it's so much easier to handle and it's so much easier to think about.

995
01:03:54,441 --> 01:04:02,043
Speaker 0: The user interface of the screen it lets you pick is so much more obvious what each one does and why you know, yeah It's good stuff.

996
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:03,971
Speaker 1: We should probably wrap this up it.

997
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:07,966
Speaker 0: I suffice it to say if you're not playing Civ 5 What the fuck the game is awesome.

998
01:04:08,047 --> 01:04:08,850
Speaker 1: It is fantastic.

999
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,580
Speaker 1: It's not a Civ 4 replacement, but it is a game for all time.

1000
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:12,665
Speaker 1: I love it.

1001
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:14,534
Speaker 1: Single-player is a joke.

1002
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:16,902
Speaker 1: Don't think that that will prepare Multiplayer.

1003
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,732
Speaker 0: problem is if you put single-player on hard, right?

1004
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:20,876
Speaker 1: It's not that the AI is good.

1005
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:21,780
Speaker 1: is that the edge cheats?

1006
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:22,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, the AI.

1007
01:04:22,704 --> 01:04:22,865
Speaker 0: just.

1008
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:26,843
Speaker 0: basically though if you put it on the hardest mode they start with like Extra war.

1009
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:31,900
Speaker 0: they start with like three settlers five workers and you know, it's like they just start with a huge head start.

1010
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:34,529
Speaker 0: It's not fair And they don't.

1011
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,860
Speaker 0: the AI is not any better.

1012
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:41,140
Speaker 0: So if you actually manage to catch up to their head start with your military, you just conquer them just as easily.

1013
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,266
Speaker 0: They're not any smarter at it.

1014
01:04:42,286 --> 01:04:43,996
Speaker 0: They just have more big head start.

1015
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:52,545
Speaker 1: Yep, and I look forward to playing with all of you because multiplayer games in this because everyone's trying to win really hard and because you Can't have the chump.

1016
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:53,451
Speaker 1: Oh, I lost my city.

1017
01:04:53,914 --> 01:05:06,410
Speaker 1: They're actually really fun if you get past these shit that code the simultaneous turn bullshit and The fact that is randomly gonna crash or like move Scott City one tile to the left Even though I don't really know it moved it really.

1018
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,917
Speaker 1: I don't know if that happened or not.

1019
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:10,625
Speaker 0: I swear to god I'm lying to you.

1020
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:11,388
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1021
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:13,014
Speaker 0: Why would I lie about that?

1022
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:22,780
Speaker 1: I don't know but it seems Literally all of a sudden Scott's like my city moved It's all the way over there now and my guy moved too and all of us are fine.

1023
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,720
Speaker 1: We're like, what the fuck Scott it moved.

1024
01:05:25,642 --> 01:05:27,619
