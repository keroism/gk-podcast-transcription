1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,951
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday July 28th 2020.

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,939
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:21,060
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about exercise games like ring fit adventure or the NES power pad.

4
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:23,433
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:39,262
Speaker 1: so uh Despite the fact that we want to play a lot of tabletop games online because trapped at home It's actually weirdly hard to get people to play a tabletop game online for a lot of reasons like it's not just a problem We're having.

6
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:47,290
Speaker 0: like man a listener emailed me and was like, hey you want to play Y&Y and I'm like, yeah I got the app I buy pre-ordered that game.

7
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,353
Speaker 0: Let's play.

8
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:49,377
Speaker 0: come to our discord.

9
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,180
Speaker 0: come to our forum.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,106
Speaker 0: Let's set a game up.

11
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:51,710
Speaker 0: Let's go.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,132
Speaker 0: He's like.

13
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:53,320
Speaker 0: he's like I'll gift you a copy.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,284
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know, I got a gift.

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,509
Speaker 0: be a copy coffee.

16
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:57,297
Speaker 0: It's like let's play that Y&Y.

17
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:57,940
Speaker 0: I haven't heard back.

18
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,133
Speaker 1: I feel like half the time when I try to start an online game.

19
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,756
Speaker 1: It's for people all saying yes Let's play and then the game never started.

20
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:07,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that just seems like a thing.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:20,980
Speaker 1: so lately what Scott and I and few of our friends have been into is playing these 18xx games primarily because That 18xx dot games website has a really really good implementation of a bunch of these games.

22
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:24,390
Speaker 1: That makes it really easy to play them completely async.

23
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,060
Speaker 1: It's like play by mail, but it updates in real time.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:36,037
Speaker 1: So like if I'm actually looking at the game and Scott's taking his turn I'll see him like laying track and doing his turn literally live.

25
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:39,350
Speaker 0: but well I mean they're using the way the website works is it's?

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,651
Speaker 0: it's?

27
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:52,065
Speaker 0: you know, there have been other implementations of web-based Asynchronous board game app before like that play that that thing we used to play hacienda on on like Feel by web.

28
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,333
Speaker 0: There's other like Brett spiel welt.

29
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:58,229
Speaker 0: I think there's like been a bunch of them But a lot of them are really bad interfaces.

30
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:05,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of them were just not great But with what's really made it not suck is the invention of web sockets, right?

31
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:10,503
Speaker 0: So basically You know then, you know A WebSocket

32
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:22,159
Speaker 1: for you not nerds is a way for a website to make a web request to a web server But what that does is open basically a socket or a connection for the web server to just stream data back to you.

33
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:42,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's instead of you know, making HTTP requests like get posts right and getting responses for each one You are instead, you know constantly sending data back and forth freely as if it was, you know On any old TCP IP connection, but not just that but also just the advancement and fanciness of JavaScript.

34
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:45,551
Speaker 0: these days You know, you're allowed to make a single page app.

35
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,515
Speaker 0: So you're load the game.

36
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:47,520
Speaker 0: It's in a single page.

37
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,464
Speaker 0: You're not shit.

38
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,716
Speaker 0: You're reloading the page every time you do something.

39
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:55,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You're just clicking and it feels like it's in your browser, but you're playing a game.

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,760
Speaker 0: It works on iPad works on your phone kinda the screens kind of small on the phone.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've done.

42
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:01,389
Speaker 1: I've done a few turns on my phone though.

43
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:05,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the implementation is just really good You can.

44
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 0: you know, they're constantly, you know, they set up deployment.

45
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:13,640
Speaker 0: So we're like, you know The the app will just sort of like you'll reload and you'll like there'll be improvements to the app because it's a web app.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,512
Speaker 0: You don't need to like download patches or anything.

47
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,720
Speaker 0: It's just constantly improving.

48
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:19,946
Speaker 0: And yeah, you can just play these games.

49
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,756
Speaker 0: We did, you know several 18xx shows.

50
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:28,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's since those shows We played more of them that we're not reviewing because we don't want this just to turn into train nights.

51
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:34,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we just keep playing these games because it's so easy to do and it's one of the only ones that we can actually Get people to play.

52
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:37,880
Speaker 1: We just played like three in a row like rapid fire.

53
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:49,826
Speaker 1: Yep It's funny because when he plays this in a packs It's like a three ish hour experience when we know what we're doing and it's not 2038 computer makes it a lot faster Yep, the computer also the computer.

54
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:57,088
Speaker 1: I can do things like make her out make another route the games just calculating like everything just moves faster Yep, so I turn every way.

55
00:03:57,268 --> 00:04:06,331
Speaker 1: if you've always wanted to play one of these train games that we've talked about like we've reviewed a bunch of them recently on geek nights 18xx dot games you can just play them if any.

56
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,878
Speaker 0: if any listener wants to learn to play a train game They look scary.

57
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,772
Speaker 0: They look like the kind of game that you know, only some expert gamer can play.

58
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:18,880
Speaker 0: but trust me the games are not any more Complicated than you know any other board game.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,524
Speaker 1: You know all the rules.

60
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:21,308
Speaker 1: to Dune.

61
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,040
Speaker 1: this games will actually feel really soon is maybe not a great example.

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,699
Speaker 1: Well, cuz Dune has all these fiddly rules that no one remembers and I have to reteach literally every time we play.

63
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,873
Speaker 0: But you know, I mean games like, you know, a settlers or a carcass.

64
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,977
Speaker 0: It's not a complicated game.

65
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:38,706
Speaker 1: It's complicated - it's it's hard to be good.

66
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,160
Speaker 1: It's like the rules of go are extremely simple.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,760
Speaker 1: We can teach you go in like two minutes, but good luck winning a game of go, right?

68
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:54,577
Speaker 0: But yeah, we We've been talking about him a lot on the show since we've been trapped inside because that's the games are playing.

69
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:58,836
Speaker 1: since trapped inside It's gonna say out of the last three games are three player games.

70
00:04:58,957 --> 00:04:59,640
Speaker 1: I won two of them.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,687
Speaker 1: I'm feeling pretty good about that.

72
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,460
Speaker 0: I mean I won one.

73
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:13,839
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's you know We used to talk a lot in our talks at cons around the three player games problem that in almost any Interactive three player game there are vanishingly few exceptions to this.

74
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:35,598
Speaker 1: Generally what will happen no matter what the rules of the game are if the players can interact with each other at all and it's Not just like Yahtzee then two of the players either two of the players will get way ahead and the third player is just eliminated immediately have no chance of winning or One player will run away with the game and the other two players are just tied for last place forever.

75
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:36,240
Speaker 1: The game's over.

76
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:40,719
Speaker 1: There's almost no exception to this among skilled players in any three player game on earth.

77
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,418
Speaker 1: And so far the data I have from us playing three player train games.

78
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,705
Speaker 1: Pretty it's happening that way.

79
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:57,300
Speaker 0: I think actually though if you look at it, right what every game we've played We're three player is two players have like strong starts.

80
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:03,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, one person has like a weak start because there's not another like option for a strong start.

81
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,452
Speaker 1: Well, look at Tigger's new for eighties.

82
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:14,095
Speaker 1: the same thing happens If it's you me and Joey Jojo I get on the good spots you get on some good spots and Joey Jojo is looking at The board where there's all these leaders everywhere trying to figure out like where can I what if

83
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:15,300
Speaker 0: you just made a game?

84
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,285
Speaker 0: Where there's more good spots?

85
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:24,350
Speaker 0: if there were three good spots and everyone and the game is more open and less tight Which obviously would make it less fun and lame.

86
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,360
Speaker 1: Yeah turns it more into some city.

87
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,954
Speaker 1: It's like playing Civ 6 with a big world but a small number of players, right?

88
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:31,596
Speaker 0: Exactly.

89
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:32,720
Speaker 0: It's just like oh everyone.

90
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,033
Speaker 0: Oh, everyone has an awesome, you know, oh, yeah Awesome time and then we'll see what the game will be decided in.

91
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:43,300
Speaker 0: the late game is set in the early game But anyway, there's actually huge gaming news.

92
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,307
Speaker 1: If you have not seen this it's actually like.

93
00:06:45,347 --> 00:07:00,626
Speaker 1: this is such a big deal that it's gonna be another several weeks before the world of games journalism and games Enthusiasts has fully unpacked this and started to like delve into the secrets that have been not only the unpacking of it itself But also the.

94
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,649
Speaker 0: there's several several indirect Consequences going on.

95
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,801
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah and side and side effects Right.

96
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:13,479
Speaker 0: So the news is is this thing that has been called by the community the giga league the giga leak?

97
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:28,264
Speaker 0: someone somehow got a bunch of materials that are 99% definitely legitimate material development materials from inside Nintendo like SNES era Onward.

98
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:34,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking, you know, not just but like SNES and 64 Like.

99
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:47,151
Speaker 0: yeah, we're talking like just rough drafts, you know stuff that Nintendo game developers worked on artists worked on right Prototypes, you know other design documents and things like.

100
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:50,600
Speaker 1: here's the level like if you're a nerd that's between developers.

101
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:56,494
Speaker 1: Yeah like raw source code comments and commentary development tools that people have been able to like already.

102
00:07:56,795 --> 00:07:59,088
Speaker 1: someone compiled one of these developer tools and Ran it.

103
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:06,156
Speaker 0: I saw Yep, it's just the amount and varied it'd be the the stuff that's in here being possible to fake right.

104
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:07,139
Speaker 0: so it lends all of it.

105
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,182
Speaker 0: So it's so much.

106
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:21,519
Speaker 1: legitimacy like this ranges from high quality voice samples in Star Fox 64 that we never heard because they couldn't put them in the game to Confirmation that there was a 3d Luigi in Super Mario 64 that they didn't use.

107
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:29,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know just the amount of stuff is absolutely crazy unused Pokemon unused Star Fox 2 characters.

108
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,344
Speaker 0: Right, you can't even begin To like.

109
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:36,799
Speaker 0: it would be the job for a Nintendo podcast to go through and talk about the significance of each lead.

110
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,345
Speaker 1: You could make a podcast.

111
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:42,720
Speaker 1: you can make a brand new podcast that is just about the giga leak and have years of shows.

112
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:46,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just every single item in the giga leak you do one show on like.

113
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,320
Speaker 0: oh look what we found.

114
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,344
Speaker 0: Let's talk about this right.

115
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:52,320
Speaker 1: there is probably more fodder for this than there was from the entirety of the run of Firefly.

116
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,019
Speaker 0: Sure, so but I'd like to talk about the meta on this.

117
00:08:56,501 --> 00:09:00,110
Speaker 0: Meta is you know a is this cool right?

118
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,714
Speaker 0: It's on the one hand, right?

119
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:06,085
Speaker 0: This is good for games History preservation.

120
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:06,547
Speaker 1: Yep.

121
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:13,757
Speaker 0: This is the kind of stuff that needs to be in museums exactly and the fact that it's still this material survived is good.

122
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:19,240
Speaker 0: and But the fact that it's like well, I guess Nintendo was keeping it, right?

123
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,057
Speaker 0: So they were doing a good job of keeping it because it hasn't been lost.

124
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:30,980
Speaker 1: Yep I mean I've worked at companies that lost things within like five years of creating them Right, and we've seen for example the Nintendo store.

125
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:38,056
Speaker 0: They've showed they've put on display Like, you know old like papers from drawing the original Super Mario Brothers levels and stuff.

126
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,520
Speaker 0: So Nintendo definitely keeps archives.

127
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:50,119
Speaker 0: So, you know at least in this particular case I don't know how justified it is for a historical preservation perspective because Nintendo seems to do a good job with that But they're not sharing it.

128
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,465
Speaker 0: So it's like you're not sharing it.

129
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:56,262
Speaker 1: how useful is feeling Nintendo would have never shared a lot of this Exactly.

130
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaker 0: So it's like if you're a private company that has Intellectual properties that you develop but you're and even if you're preserving them, right if you're keeping them internally, right?

131
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:14,080
Speaker 0: So think of like a music company, right and they've got songs and those songs have entered the public domain, right?

132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Speaker 0: They're so old right, but the record company is the only one who has the original recording.

133
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,051
Speaker 0: It's just not a recording that's out in the world yet.

134
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,800
Speaker 0: It hasn't been digitized, right?

135
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:31,815
Speaker 0: They have a vinyl record somewhere in a vault or a DAT tape in a vault or something That recordings in the public domain, but they just don't put it out there.

136
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:32,920
Speaker 0: They're just holding on to it.

137
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

138
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:44,036
Speaker 0: I think there should you know, if I was in charge of the world, I'd be like no You are compelled by law to release all arts that are public domain for the good of the world.

139
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, right too bad.

140
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:56,523
Speaker 0: So this stuff is not old enough to be legally public domain, but If I had to say 14 or years or less will be public domain This stuff is.

141
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,650
Speaker 0: is this less than 14 years old?

142
00:10:59,011 --> 00:10:59,553
Speaker 0: Yeah.

143
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:00,496
Speaker 0: Yeah it is.

144
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:05,647
Speaker 0: Okay, so I Got no problems with that morally speaking.

145
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:05,948
Speaker 1: Yep.

146
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,740
Speaker 1: I've seen the people who are come the people who are mad about this.

147
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,567
Speaker 1: They're obviously like Nintendo executives.

148
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,234
Speaker 0: Well, Nintendo executives are mad.

149
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:20,820
Speaker 1: What's weird though is I see multiple Commentaries from non Nintendo people saying that this is bad for Nintendo or hurts Nintendo in some way or hurts fans in some way.

150
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:22,139
Speaker 0: I don't think it hurts.

151
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:36,354
Speaker 0: I think the the legitimate complaint that I saw from non Nintendo game developers is like hey, you know Imagine if you were like, you know Pretty much in any industry right and your your rough drafts, right?

152
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,240
Speaker 0: We're like revealed to the world.

153
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:45,070
Speaker 0: It's like well I could give you a bad Reputation Theoretically except we already get this from a lot of authors.

154
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,093
Speaker 1: how many authors die?

155
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:50,290
Speaker 1: and then all their drafts and notes that they told Their family to burn upon their death are published it.

156
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,120
Speaker 0: Well, that's after this after they're dead, right?

157
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,639
Speaker 0: It's like developers like still alive and like you see their shitty work and it's like you really think that some it's like.

158
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:58,763
Speaker 1: But it also.

159
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,772
Speaker 1: I'd have my kind of thing that actually happens.

160
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:08,020
Speaker 1: I think that's like a hyper Yeah, but I'm saying that you can even argue against the hypothetical seeing the shitty work in the rough drafts.

161
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,665
Speaker 1: That's how things get made.

162
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:14,580
Speaker 1: a lot of people younger people today don't understand that you make a lot of shit to make something good.

163
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:15,921
Speaker 1: Like.

164
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,050
Speaker 1: look at the earliest prototypes of overwatch.

165
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:23,753
Speaker 1: It's gray boxes one character playing a shitty Look at FPS with each other.

166
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:25,989
Speaker 0: So I do think.

167
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,035
Speaker 0: there however is you know?

168
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:33,372
Speaker 0: Some people like hey, well, you know regardless of this particular leak, right?

169
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,280
Speaker 0: They're like oh leaks in general are bad, right?

170
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:50,571
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, like the people like was at certain conventions would like steal USB sticks from boots and stuff Right that that's happened a few times right, um But honestly, you know, just my personal opinion is like.

171
00:12:50,651 --> 00:13:01,519
Speaker 1: I think actually if you're a company who's making any art It's like I can't be out of if you're big enough because small companies that tends to be extremely personal information.

172
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:05,391
Speaker 0: Right, well there is personal information in this leak.

173
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:05,832
Speaker 0: like.

174
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:06,254
Speaker 0: it's like.

175
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,382
Speaker 0: there's like chats between developers It's not.

176
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:19,560
Speaker 0: that contains a lot of you know non game related stuff Which I think is not the things we were looking for right and are not particularly relevant to the game's history, right?

177
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:19,962
Speaker 0: It's like.

178
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,108
Speaker 0: it's like okay.

179
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,536
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you want to see all the work.

180
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:23,320
Speaker 0: I'm doing at work.

181
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,680
Speaker 0: It's like okay go ahead right, but it's like you see my chats from the co-workers.

182
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,616
Speaker 0: Well, they're boring because my chats with co-workers aren't inappropriate.

183
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:45,383
Speaker 1: now being public you might see like me talking to like head of development division a about X and then telling someone else a very different story like someone could piece together narratives right, but there could also be like HR talks.

184
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:50,080
Speaker 0: right now, you know, obviously I wouldn't be talking at work with like, you know telling HR actual stuff.

185
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:53,640
Speaker 0: But there might be like hey, you know, you might see a message from me to HR.

186
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,239
Speaker 0: That's like hey, can I come see you and it's like oh it's got had to go to HR.

187
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:05,968
Speaker 1: Journalists though usually try to handle this well in the sense that and this isn't journalist This is just a leak right into the internet.

188
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:15,376
Speaker 1: Yep, but the leak happen anyway, but the journalists responsibility is to focus on the interesting notable things about the industry at the production, but they're not.

189
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,465
Speaker 0: journalists is everyday people you can just download.

190
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:24,039
Speaker 0: this whole thing is looking through it yourself to try to find good stuff and it's so big that Not everyone's found all the good stuff yet.

191
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:38,895
Speaker 1: Yep But I'm saying most people won't and if most of the people who do deep dives in it Just sidestep talking about things that aren't interesting or relevant and are just personal That will prevent a lot of the possible harms of this kind of leak.

192
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,889
Speaker 1: because the reality is Leaks like this are going to happen.

193
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:47,199
Speaker 1: They can't be stopped and once the information is out there I feel like you're obligated to use it for the good of all.

194
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:52,560
Speaker 0: I think you're actually you know, I think the argument that I was actually making was like yeah people are you know?

195
00:14:52,640 --> 00:15:04,965
Speaker 0: there may be some consequences from leaks, but in my the way I see things is like a Companies rarely have anything to lose and usually have something to gain by being more open than they are right.

196
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:16,600
Speaker 0: and companies are Overly the end of the government also are more secretive than necessary and that extra secrecy actually causes harm Even though that's the you know, the people doing the secrecy are looking to prevent.

197
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:26,204
Speaker 0: Also believe that it's morally justified to undo that secrecy when you know Appropriate which is a lot.

198
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:36,555
Speaker 1: Here's a really prosaic example a lot of angry neckbeard gamer nerds who harass game developers Literally like think that it is easy and fast to make triple-a games.

199
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:47,589
Speaker 1: like they think that Developers are like screwing them over by not introducing this feature that they demanded on the internet because they literally have no idea What it actually like how much it actually cost to make a game.

200
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,780
Speaker 1: or look at how many small-time studios did a Kickstarter?

201
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:59,755
Speaker 1: Got more money than they expected like expected a million got 10 million only to discover that the game they wanted to make will cost 400 million to make

202
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:01,004
Speaker 0: Mmm,

203
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:07,959
Speaker 1: like this kind of information will probably Honestly help the game industry in the long run far more than will harm it.

204
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:14,880
Speaker 0: Well, I think the one the most interesting story I saw is actually if a very interest like something you wouldn't think about.

205
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Speaker 0: But so there was a. I forget the name of the online community and I don't have it on my screen right now.

206
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,849
Speaker 0: So, of course, I'm not gonna remember.

207
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,900
Speaker 0: I don't even know what to Google for to find this story.

208
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,130
Speaker 0: But there was an online community that was dedicated.

209
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,475
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember it was there.

210
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:33,426
Speaker 0: They were dedicated to finding Like reverse engineering.

211
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,319
Speaker 0: I think it was Pokemon and like finding glitches and stuff, right?

212
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:41,825
Speaker 0: But apparently now that is is leaked Right.

213
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:50,700
Speaker 0: There's no There's no point anymore in reverse engineering and trying to find, you know, see what you can figure out from the game.

214
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,660
Speaker 0: You know the binary of the game because it's all just out there.

215
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,000
Speaker 0: So any help that that community receives in the future could be tainted because that could be coming from a leaker, right?

216
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, which then it would be a reverse engineer.

217
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a technical argument to be made there.

218
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,200
Speaker 1: That's similar to what happened with all those Java lawsuits that I do not want to try to explain to all of you right now But go google like IBM Java API lawsuits.

219
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:23,959
Speaker 0: It's like if you have a. it's like if you're playing a game of clue Right and everyone's playing clue and then someone just comes opens the envelope and throw it shows everyone the cards.

220
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,166
Speaker 0: Yep It's like alright.

221
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:35,760
Speaker 1: Well, there's no point in playing clue anymore But if your hobby is to explore something that could theoretically be explored or solved You have to be ready for the fact that your hobby might end one day it did.

222
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,946
Speaker 0: So that's exactly what happened.

223
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,917
Speaker 0: is this community just they called it quits.

224
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,147
Speaker 0: They're like, yep We're done as of right now.

225
00:17:41,288 --> 00:18:04,689
Speaker 0: if someone else wants to carry on doing this stuff, you know Acknowledging that your work will be you know, not the same as the work we've been doing you can go right ahead and do that, but we this weird basically stopping and archiving at this point right now and Anything in the future will be someone else, you know you can free to take our work as a starting point for your new work, right, but We're done here over right?

226
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:11,051
Speaker 1: I feel like if it weren't for the pandemic Magfest would have at least one or two panels going deep on this stuff.

227
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,860
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe they'll have them in an online form.

228
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:33,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd be interested to see if this you know, because I have seen a lot of anti, you know Leak tweeters out there, you know reasonable, you know, not like, you know Nintendo employees but like, you know people in the game dev industry And I'd really love to have someone come and defend Unnecessary secrecy.

229
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:34,229
Speaker 0: like.

230
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:42,436
Speaker 1: there's one guy Mike not gonna hide my own opinion I want to argue against this Ars Technica article as one guy Mike Mika He says the Nintendo leak is bad on so many levels.

231
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:52,074
Speaker 1: that hurts them It hurts fans and it turns the topic of preservation into a topic of security and tightening the grip on intellectual property Regardless of its historical or educational value history.

232
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:53,400
Speaker 0: I do think that that is true.

233
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,859
Speaker 0: Is that after because this leak happened and companies just don't like leaks they're going to make it harder to leak?

234
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:06,420
Speaker 0: Right, it's like okay, there's been a leak So now companies are gonna tighten it to make it harder for there to be another leak.

235
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:06,883
Speaker 0: It's like.

236
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:09,358
Speaker 0: well, at least the first leak was a big one.

237
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:18,330
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is interesting though is leaks of more like recent games like modern games at least for me personally Just as a fan level are not at all interesting.

238
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,679
Speaker 1: I'm really only interested in leaks of old weird stuff.

239
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:21,343
Speaker 0: I'm late.

240
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:24,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to see leaks of old weird unseen stuff?

241
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,110
Speaker 0: You don't want to see stuff like a leak of like here's.

242
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,059
Speaker 1: how did its load balancing like?

243
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,168
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm an IT professional like that's not.

244
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,260
Speaker 1: none of that is particularly interesting to me, right?

245
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,960
Speaker 0: But you look at like, you know, especially a lot of the YouTube channels out.

246
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:42,920
Speaker 1: Why is there a sprite of Luigi flipping off Bowser right like retro game mechanics explained?

247
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,351
Speaker 0: He's like showing you how they did Pokemon sprite compression.

248
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:46,175
Speaker 0: It's like well that dude.

249
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,300
Speaker 0: It's like that's an awesome channel.

250
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, that dude had to figure that out, right?

251
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,920
Speaker 0: It's like well, what if they just told us how they did it?

252
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:54,768
Speaker 0: That'll be awesome.

253
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, we wouldn't have to waste our time.

254
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:03,560
Speaker 1: Anyway, yep, I generally are toward more information being better, but obviously there are caveats and exceptions to their internet.

255
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:19,540
Speaker 0: They're definitely exceptions, but I'm just saying in general and also but yeah if any Apple employees if any You know video game industry people want to come and defend the unnecessary secrecy and have a little you know Good faith debate on it, right?

256
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,806
Speaker 0: And I already see it in advance.

257
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:24,999
Speaker 0: There are definitely circumstances in which the secrecy is necessary.

258
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:28,958
Speaker 0: Yep I just think it's way less than every company in the whole world.

259
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:32,717
Speaker 0: All I think a lot of their fears are unfounded.

260
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:36,820
Speaker 1: Yep So in some other news you may have seen rumblings of this.

261
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,709
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on here and it's we're not gonna get into like all the ethical Questions around this because that would be an entire show and then some.

262
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,277
Speaker 1: but basically if you weren't aware the United States Army had a twitch channel.

263
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:54,056
Speaker 0: The army has the military has been recruiting, you know kids forever.

264
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:57,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a volunteer Military or America's Army.

265
00:20:57,204 --> 00:21:02,920
Speaker 1: the the military has especially decided that going after gamers is a very good approach for a lot of reasons.

266
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:09,348
Speaker 0: Yep, so I mean this is you know, since I guess when we were in college They've been doing this and doing it more and more and more.

267
00:21:09,428 --> 00:21:10,291
Speaker 0: you see them whenever.

268
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:16,572
Speaker 0: whenever we go to any gaming convention There is almost always some sort of military ish presence there with.

269
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:20,929
Speaker 1: I know a bunch of those guys because the same guys Their job at the army is to go around.

270
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:21,270
Speaker 1: I like.

271
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:24,462
Speaker 1: I got them to present a kinetic on a bunch of times Right.

272
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:27,493
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and then they try to recruit people to.

273
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:28,517
Speaker 0: you know, who gamers?

274
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,340
Speaker 0: it's a game convention.

275
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,889
Speaker 0: Everyone there's a gamer they try to recruit people into now.

276
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:35,140
Speaker 1: This isn't just like Oh trick some gamer nerd in the joint in the army.

277
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:49,044
Speaker 1: it's also Literally Enders game style like people who are good at certain kinds of kinds of games are Good at certain kinds of military things that people need to do like the skills Literally do transfer.

278
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,309
Speaker 1: good at certain kinds of flight sims.

279
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,638
Speaker 1: You're gonna be good at flying drones like literally.

280
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,085
Speaker 1: no joke No exaggeration.

281
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:57,708
Speaker 0: Oh, you're good at.

282
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:58,932
Speaker 0: you're good at driving a car.

283
00:21:58,972 --> 00:21:59,374
Speaker 0: Guess what?

284
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:01,020
Speaker 0: The military has a lot of drivers.

285
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot.

286
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:06,360
Speaker 0: There's a lot of whose job whose job in the military is drive a truck.

287
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:13,560
Speaker 1: so basically their twitch stream like they're trying to get into eSports and Talk about eSports use this as recruiting tools.

288
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,700
Speaker 1: They have a twitch screen there's a stream and they have this sergeant just like do any sports stuff online.

289
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:26,700
Speaker 1: The problem for them is that people on the internet have a rightly nuanced opinion of the United States military.

290
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,717
Speaker 1: So people kept coming into the switch channel and being like, what about the war crimes war crime me daddy.

291
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:33,660
Speaker 1: Can I war crime?

292
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,300
Speaker 0: Yep, so, you know you most of the military's recruiting in the past via video games and like we said it goes way back.

293
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,185
Speaker 0: Remember that there was.

294
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,520
Speaker 0: I just remembered there was that America's Army FPS.

295
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,616
Speaker 0: They actually made an FPS right out to try to recruit people way back.

296
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,806
Speaker 1: people made fun of it But I saw what was coming.

297
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:50,308
Speaker 1: I saw that.

298
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:52,259
Speaker 1: I saw how legitimate that was as a tool.

299
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:56,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, America's Army Unreal Engine 3 from 2002.

300
00:22:56,226 --> 00:23:02,531
Speaker 0: So in 2002 it came out and in I guess 2013 was the last version.

301
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,780
Speaker 0: the point is this they have a single they have an FPS.

302
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:07,520
Speaker 0: That is the actual official US Army FPS.

303
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:13,981
Speaker 1: So anyway, because of the point is the twin the army twist channel started banning these people like you do Like.

304
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:16,157
Speaker 1: if someone comes into our channel and fucks around we'll ban them.

305
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,563
Speaker 0: That's trying to make.

306
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:23,379
Speaker 0: is that all the previous video game recruiting methods they used were one directional, right?

307
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:23,660
Speaker 0: It was.

308
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:27,329
Speaker 0: It was like oh, here's we're releasing this video game.

309
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,513
Speaker 0: You can play it right.

310
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:32,160
Speaker 0: you can come and meet us Right at a booth.

311
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:35,060
Speaker 0: It's like are you gonna go up to a booth with some army dude?

312
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:37,473
Speaker 0: Standing there and be like war criminal.

313
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:39,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like.

314
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,131
Speaker 0: that's a kind of thing a hippie does right?

315
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:45,098
Speaker 0: is they throw some paint on the person outside the Right, and then they run away.

316
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:46,090
Speaker 0: It's like.

317
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:46,880
Speaker 0: no it you know.

318
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:51,794
Speaker 0: Even people who are like, you know We're like war crimes aren't gonna walk up to a dude and be like war crimes.

319
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:54,387
Speaker 0: The dude will be like, yeah So go away.

320
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,259
Speaker 0: Okay, like leave me alone, bro.

321
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:58,739
Speaker 1: So a bunch happened here.

322
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:10,593
Speaker 1: They started banning people from their channel for bringing up war crimes But a bunch of lawyers immediately jumped in and pointed out that for once This is a free speech issue because this is the literal US military.

323
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:17,134
Speaker 0: They cannot restrict your speech Exactly, so they can't ban actual censorship.

324
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,619
Speaker 0: for once the government is doing it.

325
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:22,634
Speaker 1: So last I checked they have stopped streaming on Twitch like they is.

326
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:23,497
Speaker 0: that is correct.

327
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:24,260
Speaker 0: That is what happened.

328
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it was.

329
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:32,531
Speaker 0: it was the first time that they tried to recruit in a forum in which you know There was some sort of chat room and people could talk back at them.

330
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:38,232
Speaker 0: and people talked back because it wasn't just Pete It wasn't just an opportunity for them to get their message out.

331
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:38,533
Speaker 0: It was.

332
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:52,440
Speaker 0: it was like if you tweet at them It's like okay, whoever's following the person who tweeted will see that right, but it's not in this forum of A chat room next to a person who's seeing the chat room right where they're like inundated and had enforced to respond.

333
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:54,910
Speaker 0: They usually don't put themselves in that sort of position.

334
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,220
Speaker 0: And as soon as they do it didn't work.

335
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,857
Speaker 1: Yep, the main thing people doing to troll them is just asking the same question over and over again.

336
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,363
Speaker 1: What's your favorite u.s War crime.

337
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:05,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good question.

338
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:07,100
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of other stuff going on.

339
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,773
Speaker 1: They were doing contests on their stream But apparently they weren't even giving out the prizes.

340
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:13,563
Speaker 1: like there's another scandal I heard with.

341
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:14,848
Speaker 0: I heard rumors about that.

342
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,920
Speaker 0: that part is just weird because they definitely have the money to give out the prizes.

343
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:20,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, why would you not just give out the prizes?

344
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:20,578
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

345
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:22,589
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of biz going on.

346
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:24,620
Speaker 0: if you go see them at a booth, right?

347
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:26,747
Speaker 0: You know want to get recruited or whatever.

348
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,674
Speaker 0: like they give you med swag, it's not fake.

349
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:29,115
Speaker 0: It's like.

350
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:30,480
Speaker 0: I don't got a fake the swag.

351
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,496
Speaker 1: I do remember when I was in high school.

352
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:40,999
Speaker 1: the The Marines and the Air Force came to our high school and they really were going after the band kids like way hard.

353
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you're already good at marching and push-ups and all the shit.

354
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:45,880
Speaker 0: I didn't do made me not do marching band.

355
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,132
Speaker 1: Yep, so I remember I actually went into the marine office.

356
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,678
Speaker 1: I was like, I'll talk to you guys.

357
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,852
Speaker 1: I'm curious Let's go and I took their stupid test.

358
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:54,000
Speaker 1: I got a perfect scar on it.

359
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,300
Speaker 1: They're like and the guy literally just straight-up lied to me because I knew the deal.

360
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,052
Speaker 1: Like I wasn't gonna sign up for the Marines, but the dude was literally telling me Yeah, we can get you out of basic early.

361
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:10,797
Speaker 1: You won't have to do any of that stuff You'll just join the band immediately and you'll just be a professional trumpet player for the US Marine Corps like he.

362
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,294
Speaker 1: He made this direct promise.

363
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,565
Speaker 1: That was Definitely a lie.

364
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:18,775
Speaker 0: I mean when I was younger and more naive I did.

365
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:23,520
Speaker 0: I did say things like oh, yeah I'll join the military as long as I don't have to do one push-up ever.

366
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:30,046
Speaker 0: I never have to shoot anyone or be shot at and I could do exactly the job I want and I'm in charge of that Job, and no one can tell me what to do.

367
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:32,056
Speaker 0: And of course that is not a possibility.

368
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:37,718
Speaker 0: Yep, but this Was unless I'm immediately promoted to like I don't know.

369
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:48,639
Speaker 1: president I uh, he did start screaming at me though and it ended prematurely because when he asked me to sign up I basically said no I was already accepted RIT And then he got mad at me for wasting his time.

370
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,802
Speaker 1: So there's a lot going on here and you can read the link to a way for article that covers the important part about the First Amendment.

371
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:07,700
Speaker 1: pretty well all you nerds who complain about free speech because some twitch channel bans you for saying racist shit This is the only time free speech has actually for real been an issue.

372
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:09,427
Speaker 1: That's aiming space.

373
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,520
Speaker 0: So I just end this conversation with an interesting question.

374
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,807
Speaker 0: Oh, so you you go into the.

375
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,600
Speaker 0: if it still existed you go into the army chat on twitch, right?

376
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:25,040
Speaker 0: And it we've already determined that they can't ban you from that chat because that would be actual government censorship, right?

377
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,900
Speaker 0: What if someone were to go into that chat and instead of asking for a favorite war crimes said a bunch of racist shit?

378
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:33,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is that's real tough.

379
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,995
Speaker 0: Is it now impossible?

380
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:37,560
Speaker 0: is the can the government now?

381
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:48,340
Speaker 0: you can be banned from every twitch channel except no matter how horrible or racist or sexist or Disgusting shit you say in the are and the government twitch channel.

382
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:52,824
Speaker 0: You can't be blocked banned kicked or so There is the except the.

383
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:57,999
Speaker 1: these the proper exceptions to free speech that are generally constitutionally agreed upon in the?

384
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,636
Speaker 1: u.s Still apply me including that vague obscenity piece mmm.

385
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,396
Speaker 1: Non-informational obscenity could theoretically be used in that case as could incitement to violence.

386
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:11,178
Speaker 1: That's another one.

387
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:14,800
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's one You know and it's actually pretty easy.

388
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,402
Speaker 0: What if the shit?

389
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:15,824
Speaker 0: what if that?

390
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:20,020
Speaker 0: what if the government opens up a slack chat or discord and I can post photos and I?

391
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,385
Speaker 0: start posting porn, uh You're probably okay.

392
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,353
Speaker 1: This is the government really like can't get into this space.

393
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:27,176
Speaker 1: is the moral.

394
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:37,323
Speaker 0: I know right anyway Yeah, let's just leave that one be because it's time for the Things of the day.

395
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:37,827
Speaker 1: What do you got?

396
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:41,170
Speaker 0: What do I have seed?

397
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:49,967
Speaker 0: All right, so This video started out in a very sad way for me because they're like hey is the Minecraft title screen?

398
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:56,470
Speaker 0: you open up Minecraft You see all those you know the main menu right which says you know start Minecraft multiplayer settings quick game, right?

399
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,921
Speaker 0: You know all the terms and conditions.

400
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:04,683
Speaker 0: button right whatever and You know in the corner it tells you what version of Minecraft you have.

401
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:06,030
Speaker 0: you're running right here.

402
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,010
Speaker 0: You're looking at that title screen, and they're like for most of Minecraft's life.

403
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:13,630
Speaker 0: This is the title screen that most players know and I'm like I don't know that title screen.

404
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:14,634
Speaker 0: And then they're like.

405
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:18,410
Speaker 0: originally the title screen was a wall of bricks, and I'm like that's a title screen.

406
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,644
Speaker 1: I remember all the bricks is the only title screen I ever knew of until I saw this video.

407
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:25,574
Speaker 0: apparently wall of bricks is Ridiculously old.

408
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:26,879
Speaker 1: you know wall of bricks is for us.

409
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,047
Speaker 1: It's fallen empires in magic.

410
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:37,670
Speaker 0: exactly This is the title screen that is apparently existed for most of Minecraft's existence And I played Minecraft so briefly and so long ago that I don't know this one.

411
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,995
Speaker 0: I know the free the older one.

412
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:43,150
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about playing Minecraft again because of the VR, but that's a separate conversation.

413
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,373
Speaker 0: No, that's not the worst.

414
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:48,425
Speaker 1: exploring someone's world in VR seems super fun but anyway.

415
00:29:48,970 --> 00:30:03,110
Speaker 0: So the the title screen that they're referring to is basically the same menu of buttons right and on a. you know before you start Playing Minecraft and in the background is a blurry image of a Minecraft world right just one.

416
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:08,687
Speaker 0: You know it looks like someone's playing Minecraft and took a screenshot and made it blurry and put it behind the buttons.

417
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:11,737
Speaker 1: a normal person Would just not ever think about that.

418
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,222
Speaker 0: no, but the play.

419
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:34,394
Speaker 0: the Minecraft nerds of the universe said hey That photo is clearly somebody at Minecraft right must have taken Minecraft started a new game right walked around to find a good-looking spot yeah took a screenshot and Blurred it and saved it and made that Title screen on purpose.

420
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:35,598
Speaker 0: a game developer did that?

421
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:38,910
Speaker 1: yep the only alternative is some concept artist just drew it from scratch.

422
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,629
Speaker 1: But that seems highly unlikely seems highly unlikely so.

423
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:44,090
Speaker 0: Minecraft's are procedurally generated worlds.

424
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:57,427
Speaker 0: It should be possible to figure out the exact seed that was used to generate that world and then Generate that seed and then you should be able to play Minecraft in the same world that the home.

425
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,357
Speaker 0: the title screen Screenshot was taken from.

426
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,630
Speaker 1: that is the plot to a sci-fi movie.

427
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:05,357
Speaker 0: But how would you ever find this seed?

428
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:13,545
Speaker 0: There's so many like you know the orders of magnitude numbers of Possible Minecraft worlds as like more than atoms in the universe.

429
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:14,850
Speaker 0: It's one of those enormous numbers, right?

430
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,689
Speaker 0: How could you ever figure it out the exact one?

431
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,664
Speaker 0: Somehow they figured out the exact one because otherwise it wouldn't be a thing of the day.

432
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:25,917
Speaker 0: and how they figured it out I'm not going to explain to you.

433
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,805
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to watch the video.

434
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:28,950
Speaker 1: It is only eight minutes long.

435
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:29,695
Speaker 1: You can watch it.

436
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:39,926
Speaker 0: It is a fascinating piece of Detective computer digital detective work that is maybe one of the best I've seen.

437
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:42,217
Speaker 0: so Check this out.

438
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,113
Speaker 0: Even if you don't care about Minecraft It's also good if you care about computers and don't care about video games at all is Awesome biz.

439
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,763
Speaker 1: so my thing is pretty simple now.

440
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:57,341
Speaker 1: I'll admit the guy who runs this channel This is not my style like this guy's a little annoying.

441
00:31:57,422 --> 00:31:59,190
Speaker 1: I hate it's just a personal pet peeve.

442
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,318
Speaker 1: I'm not impinging upon this 50.

443
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:09,232
Speaker 0: I saw this video also and yeah This is the editing in this video and the voice narration in this video is a very annoying YouTube internet guy And I'm not.

444
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:10,578
Speaker 1: there's a specific thing like.

445
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:11,883
Speaker 1: I don't mind this content.

446
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:13,490
Speaker 0: He is presenting is excellent.

447
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,562
Speaker 1: I don't mind the shake it off because everyone's got a station format irks me.

448
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:20,150
Speaker 1: What bothers me is jump cut audio editing.

449
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:22,358
Speaker 1: I'd say this is like a pet on the side.

450
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:27,863
Speaker 1: most of the content on the internet made by amateurs is like this But I can't listen to anything that does this.

451
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:35,910
Speaker 1: it's when If you can't read a script in one go and you also can't just extemporaneously speak like Scott and I do

452
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:36,736
Speaker 0: the

453
00:32:36,797 --> 00:32:48,563
Speaker 1: third way to go is You just fumble through what you're gonna say and then you just edit it together into something sensible later And you can tell because the audio will jump constantly like.

454
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,630
Speaker 1: they'll say three words you hear an edit.

455
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:52,337
Speaker 1: They'll say another word you hear an edit.

456
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:53,140
Speaker 1: They say two more words.

457
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:54,325
Speaker 1: You can hear an edit.

458
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:55,470
Speaker 1: it like jumps a lot.

459
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:58,649
Speaker 1: It's even worse if they do it while their face is on video.

460
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:03,185
Speaker 1: I see people do that, but I cannot listen to anything that does that.

461
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:12,377
Speaker 1: the other complaint about this video But I promise the video like what the video is is still good is that it explains something far less Complicated than Scott's thing of the day.

462
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:14,405
Speaker 1: yet Scott's thing of the day was an 8 minute and 23 second video.

463
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:28,090
Speaker 1: This is a 40 minute and 19 second video Explaining something that I could explain in maybe 8 to 10 minutes If I were to fast fast forward through his many many stolen stock photo images.

464
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,957
Speaker 1: Yep, but they might be purchased.

465
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:31,422
Speaker 1: I buy stock images.

466
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,068
Speaker 0: The watermarks are still on all of them.

467
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,769
Speaker 1: Oh I Didn't notice that because I skipped around.

468
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:40,503
Speaker 0: Anyway, I noticed that every stock photo has this giant watermark all over.

469
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,650
Speaker 1: civilization 6 is a pretty good is a very good game.

470
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:55,287
Speaker 1: we play it multiplayer like we have a good time with it, but civilization 6 single-player is not actually that fun because the AI's are Just really really stupid and broken and like the single-player game is not that fun.

471
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,050
Speaker 1: as a result, right?

472
00:33:56,392 --> 00:34:19,230
Speaker 0: I have not personally figured out You know bothered to learn how the AI's behave because it's too much work for not really a lot of payoff I have I have But I have determined that many many many other people are basically able to mind read the AI and manipulate them into making the game Trivially easy even on the hardest difficulties because they can just get the AI to do whatever they want.

473
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:25,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically Civ 5 is a is honestly with the AI is a more satisfying single-player experience still than Civ 6.

474
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:29,228
Speaker 1: I think Civ 6 is just too complex for there to be a good AI yet.

475
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,409
Speaker 1: Maybe so, but so we play Civ 6 with people like humans.

476
00:34:34,312 --> 00:34:36,221
Speaker 1: This video is not gonna work against humans.

477
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,628
Speaker 1: So do not even think you can try it.

478
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:55,710
Speaker 1: However People talk about in a lot of games like in Pokemon the Nuzlocke challenge or whatever like people like to make their own hard modes of video games, so This is a video of a hard mode challenge in civilization 6 but the hard mode is quote No city win challenge.

479
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,456
Speaker 0: Literally game.

480
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:59,890
Speaker 0: Yes without building any cities.

481
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,914
Speaker 0: You not your first one.

482
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,801
Speaker 0: you first settler and you don't.

483
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:06,616
Speaker 0: you never build a city with that settler But you somehow win the game.

484
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,650
Speaker 0: and this video is legit, you know anything about civilization.

485
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:10,651
Speaker 0: That's insane like.

486
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,697
Speaker 1: that's like trying to even sieve five.

487
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:15,104
Speaker 1: there's one civilization Venice where their whole shick is.

488
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,979
Speaker 1: you can only ever have one city and It's almost impossible to win the game with that sieve.

489
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:22,410
Speaker 1: but and against humans it is impossible.

490
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:26,541
Speaker 1: you're just done, but This video he does it.

491
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:28,449
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny how he does it.

492
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:33,406
Speaker 1: It's actually worth watching just to see like how this comes together.

493
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,590
Speaker 1: It is impressive.

494
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,470
Speaker 1: My head is off to you the sniffing bread for beating Civ 6 without ever building a city.

495
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:41,797
Speaker 0: Yep, just legit.

496
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:42,179
Speaker 0: No cheat.

497
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:42,621
Speaker 0: No cheating.

498
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:44,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, so good stuff.

499
00:35:44,772 --> 00:35:46,177
Speaker 1: Just I'll buy it.

500
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:51,476
Speaker 1: like if you see this if you listen to this podcast and you email me I will mail you a teleprompter.

501
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:52,880
Speaker 1: I have an extra one.

502
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,024
Speaker 1: I'll mail it to you.

503
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,529
Speaker 1: Just so you don't have to jump at it.

504
00:35:57,411 --> 00:35:59,170
Speaker 1: Anyway in a moment, we're stuck inside.

505
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,853
Speaker 1: We can't do much.

506
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:04,050
Speaker 1: stay tuned as we keep trying to make stuff as we try to figure out how to record.

507
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:06,357
Speaker 1: Don't like six or seven panels.

508
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:10,930
Speaker 1: We're gonna be doing across a bunch of conventions in the early fall that are all going online.

509
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:14,693
Speaker 1: That is more of a challenge than we expected for a lot of reasons so stay tuned on that.

510
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:24,445
Speaker 1: that is consuming a lot of my time as I figure out the logistics of this and also Every convention that does panel submissions is doing things very differently now because it's a weird world.

511
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:32,677
Speaker 1: So the producers stuff I normally do for geek nights is involving a lot more emails and conversations Where previously it was.

512
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,330
Speaker 1: someone would email me once saying what do you want to do this year?

513
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,097
Speaker 1: And I respond back with a list of things.

514
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:38,886
Speaker 1: I actually have to do a lot for once.

515
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:39,770
Speaker 1: It's kind of a pain.

516
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:42,770
Speaker 1: Yep, what else we got going on?

517
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,250
Speaker 0: The club book is still the tale of Genji.

518
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:52,210
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not reading it until it's cold outside because every time I'm not doing this said he wouldn't read till it's warm outside.

519
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,590
Speaker 0: now You're not reading till it's cold outside because what is warm outside?

520
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:07,250
Speaker 1: I thought I would be have time outside To read like at the beach like if I could change one thing and it couldn't be a material thing Like if I couldn't fix the world, but I could make one immaterial change to the world.

521
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:13,283
Speaker 1: I would swap the weather of last summer and this summer Because last summer we had a lottery weekends couldn't go to the beach that much.

522
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:18,101
Speaker 1: this summer has been 99% perfect beach weekends that I can't go to the beach.

523
00:37:18,623 --> 00:37:22,196
Speaker 1: if this summer had been last summer We would have read like 10 more books.

524
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,890
Speaker 0: Well, some people are going to the beach, but it's like I'm not going to the beach.

525
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:27,335
Speaker 0: I'm not going either.

526
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:31,700
Speaker 1: You know, I'll go to a beach if I can get to a beach by myself and there's no one there but me.

527
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:39,256
Speaker 0: Well, I was thinking we could like find a house that has its own private beach like on the beach As long as you don't own the house.

528
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:44,736
Speaker 0: who cares if that house has a risk of being blown away at a tropical storm as Long as we're not in it when the tropical storm comes?

529
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:49,470
Speaker 0: and then we could get to that house by a teleportation or boat or something.

530
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:54,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, and only truly like mutually quarantining people are allowed to go to this house, right?

531
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:01,047
Speaker 0: And then we just you know Quit our jobs and stay at that house and then come back before it's cold and then give.

532
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:02,534
Speaker 1: actually I could work From.

533
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:03,661
Speaker 1: I can work from anywhere.

534
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,010
Speaker 1: It's not like I have to go to an office for that.

535
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:07,381
Speaker 0: But what would such a beach house have?

536
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:08,709
Speaker 0: internet and would I want to work?

537
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is I wouldn't want to work.

538
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least now I kind of like work.

539
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,770
Speaker 1: I don't think I would work if I was just at the beach right there would not be working.

540
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:19,516
Speaker 1: I would be quitting.

541
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:21,289
Speaker 0: the only other met a moment I have is again.

542
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:28,770
Speaker 0: You should come to all the places that we exist on the internet like our website and our discord and we have Twitter's and YouTube's.

Speaker 0: I don't know how you found this podcast if you didn't find any of those other things.

545
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:43,292
Speaker 0: Yeah You should check all those things out and If you want to learn how to play a train game because you need something to occupy You know all the spare time in your life I will.

546
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:47,726
Speaker 0: any of us will be glad to teach anyone to play train games.

547
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:49,874
Speaker 0: It is not that hard You know, we should do.

548
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,149
Speaker 0: just come to our discord and I can teach you train games for free.

549
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,509
Speaker 0: I will do this as a free service.

550
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,418
Speaker 0: We can slip this on game teaching.

551
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:57,980
Speaker 1: like you.

552
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,490
Speaker 1: take out an 18 Chesapeake and I'll take 18 46.

553
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:07,617
Speaker 1: We could just make one-off panel videos just like we do, you know all the learn and win X. we can make a learn and we're not.

554
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:14,590
Speaker 0: I could definitely make one better than the other people who have made them already because I've Seen some of the ones out there and some of them are good, but none of them are like amazing.

555
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:18,541
Speaker 0: I feel like I could do better But I still feel like a personal teaching is the best.

556
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,450
Speaker 0: that includes like answering your question true.

557
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:25,890
Speaker 1: That's why as much as like playing well, that's why even though we have video of like our learning win, Puerto Rico.

558
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:32,038
Speaker 1: I love running that panel because I love sitting down with a bunch of people and like teaching them Directly how to play.

559
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:32,702
Speaker 1: it's like you said.

560
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:34,976
Speaker 0: if you want to know how to play Contact us.

561
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:37,269
Speaker 0: and if you want to play I don't know happen to that listener who?

562
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,681
Speaker 0: emailed me and never emailed me a second time after I replied.

563
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:44,340
Speaker 0: but if you want to play there is a digital app for yellow and Yanksy on Steam.

564
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,389
Speaker 0: it's not free.

565
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:53,189
Speaker 0: But if you have that app and you want to play multiplayer yellow and Yanksy Contact us via any mechanism.

566
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:54,662
Speaker 0: Let's play.

567
00:39:54,846 --> 00:39:58,876
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, so I guess we'll get into it.

568
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:00,803
Speaker 1: a ring vid adventure is.

569
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:02,890
Speaker 1: we're not gonna review ring vid adventure in depth.

570
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,614
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about it.

571
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:06,007
Speaker 1: I've got it played it once and that's I played it a bit.

572
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:06,430
Speaker 1: I like it.

573
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,072
Speaker 1: I like it a lot.

574
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:15,296
Speaker 1: But basically we want to talk about these kinds like this concept of Exercise games in general.

575
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:19,890
Speaker 0: because well, we got to narrow this down because technically every sport is an exercise game.

576
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:33,000
Speaker 1: Well, yeah and also like I realized already it's even worse than that because there are a lot of games and physical exertion or physical skill But they are not necessarily exercise in any meaningful way.

577
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:42,649
Speaker 1: case in point that arm wrestling arcade game that we keep talking about That is not an exercise game because you don't play it long enough to exercise and nor would any reasonable person do so.

578
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:44,644
Speaker 0: That is true.

579
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:56,921
Speaker 0: However I think if you try to narrow it down by like something that's trying to make you exercise as your as your criteria Right, you're gonna start including a lot of things like every sport ever.

580
00:40:56,941 --> 00:41:00,290
Speaker 0: Hey, well, it's like you're exercising if you just play basketball.

581
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:05,874
Speaker 1: I think the difference is let's let's narrow it down to video games because that makes it a lot easier Right.

582
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:25,270
Speaker 0: I think what we really I think we do want to talk about that include the box, you know, the the arm wrestling thing because the way I see it is we're talking about You know sports right where they with a physical With a with a software digital component to them, right?

583
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,350
Speaker 0: But that would include things like Formula One or any car racing where the car has software, right true.

584
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,616
Speaker 0: So I don't want to include that.

585
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:39,350
Speaker 0: what I want to include is basically any Sport where there's a digital video game component, right?

586
00:41:40,050 --> 00:42:02,352
Speaker 0: but the basically, I don't know how to word this correctly, but where the software is Basically doing all of the scoring and judging like the whole point of the thing is that you the human being do physical activity, right and You the physical activity is then measured by software.

587
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:05,700
Speaker 0: that then or that then tells you how well you have done.

588
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:11,453
Speaker 1: I want to go in a much more different direction Based on rings of adventure and focus on game.

589
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:11,935
Speaker 0: well ring fit.

590
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:12,960
Speaker 0: adventure fits that cat.

591
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:25,090
Speaker 1: It does fit that category, but my category is more games where if it if an average normal gamer plays a normal Expected reasonable amount of this game like one play session.

592
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:35,760
Speaker 1: They will have gotten what the government would consider a workout Like a game has caused you to work out regardless of if you would have otherwise.

593
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,920
Speaker 0: But that's basketball.

594
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,085
Speaker 1: Well video game we're just.

595
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:41,089
Speaker 1: we're talking about video games here.

596
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:49,368
Speaker 0: so it has to be a video game and you would have gotten a workout Cuz yeah if we did because yeah But the nature of playing basketball.

597
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:52,980
Speaker 1: you will you will definitely get a workout if you try to play basketball at all.

598
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:57,027
Speaker 1: We can talk about the other kind you could have.

599
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,957
Speaker 0: you could have a very advanced flight simulator.

600
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:00,700
Speaker 0: that's like for real.

601
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,439
Speaker 0: That'll be a kind of a workout, right?

602
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:09,340
Speaker 1: No, because the usually the formal definitions of this involve things like heart rate elevated above a certain amount for a certain heart.

603
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,274
Speaker 0: It's not gonna elevate if I put you in like some crazy s flight cement.

604
00:43:12,315 --> 00:43:13,360
Speaker 0: It's moving you all around.

605
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:15,408
Speaker 1: I've flown planes before not at all.

606
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:19,544
Speaker 1: Maybe if it was an f-16 simulator, but not like a Like it's.

607
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:20,566
Speaker 0: you know, it's really.

608
00:43:20,747 --> 00:43:21,509
Speaker 0: it's really pushing you.

609
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:23,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not pushing your muscles.

610
00:43:23,194 --> 00:43:24,738
Speaker 1: Really you're wearing a flight suit.

611
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:26,990
Speaker 1: So And you're like Anna.

612
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,440
Speaker 1: you're strapped into a chair Maybe your neck a bit, but you're not gonna get a workout.

613
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,768
Speaker 0: I don't think it could be a racing simulator.

614
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:42,480
Speaker 0: We're lazy simulator would count driving an f1 car with a hundred percent Whole bunch right, you know, especially if it's simulating any amount of g-forces on your body.

615
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you need the g-forces though It definitely doesn't count.

616
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:48,980
Speaker 1: but I want to take an aside before we get into that and talk about these arm wrestling arcade.

617
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,840
Speaker 0: But if someone's real weak and just like pushing the a buttons a workout for them?

618
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:54,206
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah That line is different for all sorts of people.

619
00:43:54,246 --> 00:44:00,190
Speaker 1: like what constitutes physical activity in a workout actually is a really big sliding scale depending on Your goals, right?

620
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:12,140
Speaker 0: You could also have a game like Maybe pop and music right and someone could play pop and music in a way where they're like And it's really like an are a tiring arm workout for them, but someone else could play it with like their fingers.

621
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,032
Speaker 1: He's like, well look at that with DDR.

622
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:15,420
Speaker 0: That's like they would be a thing.

623
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:16,899
Speaker 0: It would be a finger workout.

624
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:29,921
Speaker 1: I guess the fanboy playing DDR with their arms on the bar doing the fanboy pump gets way less Effective exercise than someone doing the exact same song but actually dancing and not holding the bar Hmm.

625
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:37,647
Speaker 0: That's why I think the my criteria of just the games where you're just being measured on Assuming you play it in good faith, right?

626
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:52,840
Speaker 0: You're being measured based on some sort of you know Some sort of aspect of your physical bodies exertions, right and not just on something like timing of button presses Which I guess is still your physical exertions, but you you know, there's still some sort of line there.

627
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,380
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's definitely like if we were gonna do a panel on this.

628
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:58,100
Speaker 1: I feel like these would be like two different sections of the right.

629
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:07,998
Speaker 0: It would be like, you know if you if you the human being are stronger right you will get a higher score at arm-wrestle the robot or hit the hammer on the thing and make it hit the bell.

630
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:12,539
Speaker 0: or You know DDR if you're better at cardio, you'll be better at DDO.

631
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,595
Speaker 1: There are very much two sides of this.

632
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:27,040
Speaker 1: it's the Games that ortho games that judge your skill in the manner you described or games that Trick or enable you into doing a traditional workout.

633
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,920
Speaker 0: But I don't think there's that many games that trick you into doing a traditional workout.

634
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,680
Speaker 0: There's a lot that have tried but a lot of them are just sort of failure.

635
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:36,824
Speaker 1: Yeah I feel like ring fit.

636
00:45:36,844 --> 00:45:45,560
Speaker 0: adventure and DDR are like the height of that right now like literally Right, if you look on like the Wii and Wii U it's like when after the Wii fit the original Wii fit came.

637
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,026
Speaker 0: There was like a bunch of clones.

638
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:48,412
Speaker 0: It was like an EA fit.

639
00:45:48,453 --> 00:45:50,080
Speaker 1: None of them did well as far as I could tell.

640
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,582
Speaker 0: It's like yeah.

641
00:45:50,683 --> 00:45:54,460
Speaker 0: No, there's like the place, you know, the PlayStation ones you use for Johan Sebastian Jones.

642
00:45:54,621 --> 00:46:00,080
Speaker 0: Oh, I think there's a lot of games that attempt to use those for various fitness things that are all just shovelware.

643
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:01,539
Speaker 0: There's like tons and tons of shovelware.

644
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:07,417
Speaker 0: There's other games though that are like could be fitness II but maybe aren't trying to be like this.

645
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:08,600
Speaker 0: the Just Dance game.

646
00:46:08,781 --> 00:46:11,088
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know you're like.

647
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:11,751
Speaker 0: I think the wasn't.

648
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,560
Speaker 1: the DVR was originally intended to be more dancing.

649
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,736
Speaker 1: But you notice in recent DDR machines, they show you calories and really focus on the fitness aspect.

650
00:46:20,439 --> 00:46:20,840
Speaker 0: That's true.

651
00:46:21,704 --> 00:46:29,780
Speaker 0: dance rush a little bit You know depending on how you play it because like you can you can sort of still play dance rush in good faith without exercising.

652
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:33,279
Speaker 1: Yeah But like ring fit adventure you'd like that.

653
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:34,263
Speaker 1: That's probably.

654
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:42,140
Speaker 1: I think it's the height of that genre because ring fit adventure really does make you do like a real broad spectrum cardio workout.

655
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:43,482
Speaker 0: Right, it's like.

656
00:46:43,522 --> 00:46:44,465
Speaker 0: it also gamifies.

657
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:50,200
Speaker 1: it like a peloton would count technically because they like gamifies a little bit and shows you a terrain.

658
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,525
Speaker 1: But it's not a fun game.

659
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:53,352
Speaker 1: ring fit adventure is like a real game.

660
00:46:53,392 --> 00:46:53,995
Speaker 0: fight the monster.

661
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:55,320
Speaker 0: No, but you know about Swift?

662
00:46:56,561 --> 00:47:02,420
Speaker 0: No, I can guess with what it is Swift is basically you get yourself a bike trainer, right any kind?

663
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,709
Speaker 1: Oh and it shows the course and you're racing someone

664
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:25,760
Speaker 0: you put your you put your bike on it and you put this TV in Front of you and it shows you like a little avatar on a bicycle and you basically load in a real course from the real world and then depending on how much equipment you have hooked up to your trainer like you could have it Automatically make pedaling easier and harder or elevate the front of your bike as you're going up or down hills, right?

665
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can also do it multiplayer so you can it.

666
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,320
Speaker 0: you know You can see other your friends like we could go and like race each other up some mountain in France.

667
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,537
Speaker 1: Yep, and while that is a game and serves all these purposes to your point.

668
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:39,140
Speaker 1: I see where you're going.

669
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:41,187
Speaker 1: It's not that old.

670
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:45,220
Speaker 1: that basically is motivation for someone who is already doing that kind of activity in the real world.

671
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:49,464
Speaker 1: It's it ranges into like Existing right.

672
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:49,826
Speaker 0: It's like.

673
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:54,367
Speaker 0: it's like the virtual golf right where like you do indoor golf It's you hit a ball to a screen.

674
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:57,240
Speaker 0: It's like you're training to do indoor golf or whatever.

675
00:47:58,461 --> 00:47:58,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, ring fit.

676
00:47:58,984 --> 00:47:59,688
Speaker 1: adventure is more.

677
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:00,472
Speaker 0: Hey nerd.

678
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:01,980
Speaker 1: It's like you want to beat this dragon.

679
00:48:02,222 --> 00:48:02,826
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

680
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,620
Speaker 1: Your abs are gonna get real strong by accident.

681
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:19,080
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, if you actually do the workouts, but maybe my aside here is on this website I found which I'll link to because I was trying to like learn about that arm wrestling game because we We were weirdly obsessed with that back in the day in Wildwood.

682
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,736
Speaker 1: But I saw a line here that said the game was distributed to 150 arcades across Japan.

683
00:48:24,162 --> 00:48:29,020
Speaker 1: It was recalled less than one month later due to reports of three players breaking their arms.

684
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:36,979
Speaker 1: three players Mm-hmm the apparently Atlas made this game like the Atlas ATL us the Atlas you all know.

685
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:44,359
Speaker 1: Okay, so I wondered is that true or is that just this person with a blog like making something up?

686
00:48:45,481 --> 00:48:50,380
Speaker 1: So I go in and I look and I trust another two blogs said it must be true.

687
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:53,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, no, so I tried to find like a real news reporting on this.

688
00:48:54,421 --> 00:49:03,158
Speaker 1: Okay, and the news report I found is an article from August 22nd 2007 and CBS quote headline arm-wrestling machine breaks arms.

689
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,626
Speaker 1: Lose the game of chess to a good arm.

690
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:08,674
Speaker 0: wrestled a robot and my arm broke.

691
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:10,260
Speaker 1: lose the game of chess to a computer.

692
00:49:10,401 --> 00:49:13,814
Speaker 1: You could bruise your ego lose an arm wrestling match to a Japanese arcade game.

693
00:49:13,895 --> 00:49:14,979
Speaker 1: It could break your arm.

694
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,260
Speaker 1: distributor Atlas Co says it will remove all 150 arm spirit wrestling games from our Japanese arcades.

695
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:21,989
Speaker 1: So that story did happen.

696
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,920
Speaker 1: However, I found yet another rabbit hole.

697
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:33,520
Speaker 1: Uh Atlas issued a really sexist official statement in response to this like publicly not that long ago.

698
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:39,747
Speaker 1: This is 2007 thought the basically and it was a lot older than 2007. know that into.

699
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:41,916
Speaker 1: the game you're thinking of is a different arcade game.

700
00:49:41,976 --> 00:49:44,866
Speaker 1: This is an Atlas Equivalent of that game.

701
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:47,420
Speaker 0: Okay, so that it's not the original arm wrestling.

702
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,271
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to talk about the original arm wrestling game.

703
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:52,380
Speaker 1: those goes go back to the electromechanical era.

704
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:53,710
Speaker 0: That's what I'm talking about.

705
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:59,500
Speaker 1: like 20s era There are 1920s arm wrestling machines that probably did break a lot of people's arms.

706
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:06,808
Speaker 1: The one we played a lot was called arm champs or arm champs, too Okay, but the Atlas one.

707
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:19,600
Speaker 1: when it broke all these arms this Atlas spokesperson Ayano is sakeyama said Officially and I'm quoting here the machine isn't that strong much less so than a muscular man.

708
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:24,850
Speaker 1: Even women should be able to beat it Mm-hmm, and he went on to say that there were cut.

709
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:29,839
Speaker 1: they were recalling the game as a precaution But not because they thought the game was actually dangerous.

710
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:33,412
Speaker 0: You're correct arm champs is definitely the one that we played.

711
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:35,300
Speaker 0: I guess I'll chance wasn't breaking anyone's arm.

712
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:40,280
Speaker 1: No, because it's bad much better controls, I guess they also went on to say that quote.

713
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:45,319
Speaker 1: We think that maybe some players get overexcited and twist their arms in an unnatural way.

714
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:49,999
Speaker 0: Say though, it's been a long time since I've looked at or played an arm champs.

715
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,454
Speaker 0: If you look at arm champs, it is hella racist.

716
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:58,929
Speaker 0: Yep Like what a racist game this.

717
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:07,200
Speaker 1: take Mike Tyson's punch out and like Way worse death it up quite a bit Like there's a lot of rabbit holes going down.

718
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,613
Speaker 1: So then I wondered how cuz I like.

719
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:18,984
Speaker 1: arm wrestling is not a sport Enjoy and I always had a perception that was dangerous because I had seen videos that Scott many other people probably saw in the pre YouTube days of the internet.

720
00:51:19,225 --> 00:51:23,320
Speaker 1: there's one video that made the rounds of someone's arm breaking badly arm wrestling.

721
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:25,850
Speaker 1: But I wondered how common is that really?

722
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:33,239
Speaker 1: so I tried to Google for it and Google immediately suggested to search results.

723
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:39,460
Speaker 1: Can you break your arm arm wrestling and how do you stop your arm from breaking during arm wrestling?

724
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:43,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently arm wrestling is super fucking dangerous.

725
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:44,039
Speaker 1: You should never do it.

726
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:49,799
Speaker 1: It is not a sport that is safe to do and people who try to get good at it are really prone to hurting themselves badly.

727
00:51:50,681 --> 00:51:51,042
Speaker 0: Okay.

728
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:52,667
Speaker 0: Well, I wasn't any good at it to begin with

729
00:51:52,968 --> 00:52:09,018
Speaker 1: I know because we discovered that our friend a friend of ours Was able to play this game in a Wildwood and she was able to exert exactly 40 pounds of force because the game told you how many pounds of force you actually exerted in the end and Then I remember that she proceeded to beat you.

730
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely can't exert 40 pounds.

731
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:13,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's.

732
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:18,059
Speaker 1: uh, Scott has a lot of power below the waist, but your arms are basically just sticks.

733
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:19,546
Speaker 1: You're like a rabbit.

734
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:21,820
Speaker 1: You got a stick leg and a jump leg and really nothing to tell it.

735
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,062
Speaker 1: There's.

736
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:24,439
Speaker 1: no there's a stick leg and a jump leg and nothing else.

737
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:27,358
Speaker 1: The jump leg is big and muscly and the stick leg is the literal stick.

738
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:38,138
Speaker 1: Mmm, I'm getting pretty close to that myself though, cuz I'm running a lot and not doing a lot of house lately I Push up I can't.

739
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I could do one I could try.

740
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:45,940
Speaker 0: I could try to do one and then do two and then do three can't Do is if you could do zero you're in a little trouble.

741
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:49,760
Speaker 1: So I guess what I like about ring fit adventure because we've already gone on for over an hour.

742
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:50,635
Speaker 1: I guess it was a good show.

743
00:52:51,081 --> 00:53:00,474
Speaker 1: but I really like ring fit adventure because Most games I see that try to do this feel like corporate gamification bullshit.

744
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,537
Speaker 1: Like they're not fun.

745
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,009
Speaker 1: It's clearly We turn this thing.

746
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:06,542
Speaker 1: You don't want to do into a game Like.

747
00:53:06,623 --> 00:53:10,079
Speaker 1: it just feels really low effort and like not fun.

748
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,660
Speaker 1: This feels like a real game like you want to level up to beat that thing.

749
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,732
Speaker 1: Well, you're gonna be doing this particular kind of crunch because it's more powerful.

750
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:27,559
Speaker 1: the specific little thing I liked is that it makes you squeeze the thing every time you want to basically press a And that actually gets moderately tiring as the game goes on.

751
00:53:28,061 --> 00:53:32,740
Speaker 0: Well, actually what you know, even if you play in good faith, right, you're not trying to trick the game.

752
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, letting you do less exercise.

753
00:53:34,862 --> 00:53:38,204
Speaker 0: You don't need to squeeze very much when you're just like in the menus You can just sort of tap it.

754
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:40,334
Speaker 0: true and that's and that's it only does seems to.

755
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:43,059
Speaker 1: I didn't confirm this 100% But I looked at some profile stuff.

756
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:47,875
Speaker 1: It seems to calibrate how much it makes you do it based on that initial set up.

757
00:53:47,896 --> 00:53:49,240
Speaker 0: for the menus though, right?

758
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for all the other stuff in the game.

759
00:53:51,211 --> 00:54:00,151
Speaker 0: Yes for all the other stuff in the game It does calibrate to your strengths assuming that you honestly, you know in player I did the calibration process yesterday.

760
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:04,759
Speaker 1: I did the setup and I maxed it out with both pull and push.

761
00:54:05,723 --> 00:54:08,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought I think pull I only got to 90.

762
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:08,835
Speaker 0: I don't know.

763
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:17,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is Sorry, so if you if you play honestly right a the game makes you run in place

764
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:21,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it notices if you slack off like pretty well, actually

765
00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:29,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it does this because you have a weeb Thing strapped to your leg, right and it's pretty good at telling when you're running or doing any other leg movement.

766
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:34,739
Speaker 0: Yeah and The thing is is normally if I go outside and run it sucks.

767
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:39,897
Speaker 0: The thing here that it does it doesn't make running not suck.

768
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,767
Speaker 0: It distracts you.

769
00:54:41,807 --> 00:54:49,244
Speaker 0: you're running but you're Looking at the screen to do other shit and you forget that you're running Right.

770
00:54:49,686 --> 00:55:00,220
Speaker 0: So you're basically it's sort of like when you're in pain in the hospital You're playing you're reading a newspaper and you forget about the pain and then you stop reading the paper and you're like hurts.

771
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,513
Speaker 1: I can see that because I see a lot of people fail it like regular exercise.

772
00:55:03,573 --> 00:55:06,585
Speaker 1: because like I run a lot Running outside is fun.

773
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:07,448
Speaker 1: I do it because it's fun.

774
00:55:07,729 --> 00:55:09,275
Speaker 1: running on a treadmill sucks ass.

775
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,364
Speaker 1: I hate every second of it I'm looking.

776
00:55:11,384 --> 00:55:14,740
Speaker 1: I'm desperate for anything to distract me from the fact that I'm on a treadmill.

777
00:55:15,624 --> 00:55:18,164
Speaker 0: Yeah So yeah, it does that.

778
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:19,147
Speaker 0: secondly, right?

779
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:23,120
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, you're squeezing the thing, but it's not just like congrats you squeezed, right?

780
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:33,940
Speaker 0: It's like while you're running you're trying to shoot these boxes and stuff on the side of the track Right and it's like basically you're playing a sort of an actual video game like there's an obstacle course.

781
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:37,580
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, yeah jump higher and you'll grab all those coins, right?

782
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:42,656
Speaker 0: You know be running faster when you jump to go further and skip more of the track.

783
00:55:42,716 --> 00:55:43,920
Speaker 1: and one thing I'll say it gave me.

784
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,998
Speaker 1: It gives you a little bit of the same flow state that a serious athlete gets doing the activity where they are an expert.

785
00:55:50,018 --> 00:55:54,919
Speaker 1: like, you know Video games People who work out a lot get a flow state in physical activities, too.

786
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:57,989
Speaker 1: This gives a lot of people who may not have experienced that.

787
00:55:58,009 --> 00:56:10,338
Speaker 0: with a lot of physical activities that like body mind as one flow State right much like with DDR You're not attempting to exercise and then there's a thing that's measuring you right.

788
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,172
Speaker 0: instead You're trying to play a video game.

789
00:56:13,393 --> 00:56:14,620
Speaker 0: It's an actual video game.

790
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:21,520
Speaker 0: You're trying to beat the game and get a high score and it just so happens that the inputs for the video game Happened to be exercise.

791
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:25,837
Speaker 0: So it's like you're playing this video game and then when you're done, it's like, oh, oops.

792
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:28,868
Speaker 0: I exercised Yep, and the game is actually fun.

793
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:30,734
Speaker 1: Like that's that's the biggest it's not.

794
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:33,485
Speaker 0: it's not like the most fun game ever But it's not bad.

795
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:35,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've enjoyed playing it.

796
00:56:35,294 --> 00:56:36,360
Speaker 1: I'm gonna continue playing it.

797
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,946
Speaker 0: It's you, you know.

798
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:42,140
Speaker 0: run through a track right collect coins and stuff.

799
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:47,259
Speaker 0: Fight a fight a boss with it are you know, try to eliminate its HP down to zero.

800
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:53,260
Speaker 0: The ring that talks to you is super annoying no matter which of the two voice options you pick for it.

801
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:54,311
Speaker 1: I kind of like that.

802
00:56:54,351 --> 00:56:55,039
Speaker 1: It's annoying though.

803
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:58,269
Speaker 0: Yeah The boss is actually way cooler than the.

804
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,959
Speaker 0: I would rather be on the side of the dragon than the side of the row.

805
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:02,243
Speaker 1: the buff Dragon is the best.

806
00:57:02,263 --> 00:57:14,144
Speaker 1: did you see I see a lot of people on the internet have played this game and in Realized midway through how weirdly hot and buff that hot buff dragon is Extremely hot and buff.

807
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:15,974
Speaker 0: Yep, and then there's a whole bunch of saw.

808
00:57:15,994 --> 00:57:18,244
Speaker 0: I haven't played any of the side games I just played the main.

809
00:57:18,465 --> 00:57:19,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't touched any.

810
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,494
Speaker 1: there's other modes.

811
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:21,298
Speaker 1: There's a rhythm game.

812
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:22,744
Speaker 1: There's all the stuff I haven't even touched yet.

813
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:24,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like.

814
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:31,018
Speaker 0: yeah, but if you just play that main game, I think like frequently I think that's more exercise than most people get.

815
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:37,720
Speaker 0: yeah So like and as long as I play it honestly instead of like trying to trick it into thinking that you've played right?

816
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,420
Speaker 0: Yep, looking at you power kind of hard to trick it though, right?

817
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:47,614
Speaker 0: It's like you could put the leg one in your hand and sort of shake it a lot I guess but you're working out your arm then.

818
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you can.

819
00:57:50,322 --> 00:57:53,132
Speaker 0: it's harder to trick it with the ring because the switch would know.

820
00:57:53,553 --> 00:58:00,120
Speaker 0: if this if the we if the if the Joy con you could use Arduinos and servos to build two robots to control.

821
00:58:01,163 --> 00:58:03,651
Speaker 0: You could basically make fake joy cons to get.

822
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:06,200
Speaker 0: that are specifically made for cheating at this game.

823
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,818
Speaker 1: What I want to see an SGD Q is some speed runs of this game, though

824
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:20,836
Speaker 0: Another interesting thing is they have this sort of lazy mode where it's like you basically turn your switch off And you just hold the ring and you like watch a movie on Netflix or something.

825
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:21,860
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a great.

826
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,446
Speaker 1: That's I used like when I was a kid.

827
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:33,280
Speaker 1: what I would do when I was watching movies like or just watching TV or like Watching stuff on the internet is I just sit there lifting weights the whole time while I was watching stuff Just like right like here poking, right?

828
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:39,399
Speaker 0: So you basically that has this mode AFK mode or whatever where you I forget what it's actually called It might be called AFK mode where?

829
00:58:40,861 --> 00:58:48,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just do something else and take the ring with you and squeeze the ring a bunch and then when you go back It'll be like hey you squeeze the ring.

830
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:49,950
Speaker 0: this much Good job.

831
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:53,919
Speaker 1: Yeah Squeezing the rings pretty good exercise to the rings pretty durable.

832
00:58:55,142 --> 00:59:03,820
Speaker 0: And the most clever thing I think is the use of the infrared sensor on the front of the joy To measure your heart rates moderately accurately.

833
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:06,383
Speaker 0: That's not too bad.

834
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:13,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'd like honestly I'd recommend if you got a switch like this is a pretty good game to get And it's starting to be back in stock.

835
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,659
Speaker 1: It's easier to get than it was a month ago.

836
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:22,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you have a switch if you want to exercise if you don't have you if video games motivate you to do things.

837
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:27,300
