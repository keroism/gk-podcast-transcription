1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,439
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 20th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:12,940
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,802
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:15,545
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:17,550
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Trigger!

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,634
Speaker 0: And the Bobo.

7
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:21,657
Speaker 0: Bobo.

8
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:22,781
Speaker 0: Bobo.

9
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:23,442
Speaker 0: Bobo.

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,104
Speaker 0: Bobo.

11
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:25,890
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,396
Speaker 0: So I realize there might not be a big overlap here.

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:34,189
Speaker 0: So all you video game kids, there's an anime called Bobobo.

14
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:35,773
Speaker 0: It's Bobobo.

15
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:36,395
Speaker 0: Bobobo.

16
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,298
Speaker 1: No, you spelled it wrong.

17
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:38,542
Speaker 1: It's Bobobo.

18
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:39,525
Speaker 1: Bobobo.

19
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,066
Speaker 1: I'm 100% correct.

20
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,098
Speaker 0: The important part is, there's seven bows.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm 100% confident that that is the correct way to say it.

22
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,706
Speaker 0: So, a Bobo is a character, and you guys know all that.

23
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,790
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that at the meet.

24
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,138
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna... It's got smat when I blow my load early.

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,190
Speaker 0: So I'll wait while we're talking about Bobo's big adventure.

26
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,195
Speaker 1: It's too late.

27
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:00,719
Speaker 1: It's too late.

28
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:01,242
Speaker 1: You're done.

29
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:02,270
Speaker 1: You need some faggers.

30
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:06,796
Speaker 0: But yeah, PAX is coming.

31
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,070
Speaker 0: I haven't really been paying attention to video game news or any of that stuff.

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,055
Speaker 1: Pretty much paying attention to nothing but PAX.

33
00:01:12,677 --> 00:01:14,020
Speaker 0: And it's gaming season.

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,610
Speaker 0: I've been playing more PC games and more board games than anything lately.

35
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:26,370
Speaker 1: It's definitely game season, and it's also warm, so it's biking season, so it's pretty much biking, gaming, PAXing, eating, sleeping, showering.

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,012
Speaker 0: Good times.

37
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:27,615
Speaker 1: That's it.

38
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:33,469
Speaker 0: So I have a little bit of news here, but I guess I'll let Scott go first, because my news is actually really little, so I got a bunch of them.

39
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:41,250
Speaker 1: So my news is actually something I don't personally really care about, but I know that every nerd in the universe does care about it, right?

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,805
Speaker 1: So many nerdy people who are very popular amongst the nerds, but are not popular amongst me, such as Wil Wheaton.

41
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:54,609
Speaker 0: I believe you mean Wil Wheaton.

42
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,433
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever.

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,750
Speaker 1: And who's that other girl?

44
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,788
Speaker 0: I think the point is made.

45
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,149
Speaker 1: Felicia Day.

46
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,048
Speaker 0: I think.

47
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,810
Speaker 1: The people that I know, they're nerdy famous people, right?

48
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,669
Speaker 0: At least you recognize them as nerdy famous people.

49
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,298
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, when you're in the middle of nerd town, right?

50
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:16,950
Speaker 1: It's like, you know the nerdy things you don't like, you know that they exist, right?

51
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,270
Speaker 0: As an exercise to our listeners, I'm going to ask Scott one question, one question only.

52
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:29,610
Speaker 0: Name any actor from Friends, Mad About You, Cheers, or Seinfeld other than Jerry Seinfeld.

53
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,059
Speaker 1: Oh, I can do Seinfeld, right?

54
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,426
Speaker 1: Kramer's name is Mike Richards or something?

55
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,067
Speaker 1: Is that correct?

56
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,225
Speaker 1: Costanza is Alexander something?

57
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,310
Speaker 1: No, Jason Alexander.

58
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:44,490
Speaker 1: And Elaine is...

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,830
Speaker 0: So outside of Seinfeld.

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,495
Speaker 1: Outside of Seinfeld?

61
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,210
Speaker 1: I don't know any one of those other shows at all.

62
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:51,223
Speaker 0: So Felicia Day should feel honored.

63
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:51,967
Speaker 0: Anyway.

64
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,250
Speaker 1: So anyway, so they're basically making a show that's sort of like celebrity poker, right?

65
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,630
Speaker 1: Where they basically, they get together at a table and play poker and you know, you're entertained because they chat while playing, right?

66
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:10,750
Speaker 1: But instead of playing poker, the show is called Tabletop and they're going to play tabletop games.

67
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:18,350
Speaker 1: We're not exactly sure what games they're going to play, if it's going to be RPGs or board games or if they're going to play hardcore games or less core, I don't know.

68
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:23,010
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they're going to play real board games because they're going to be switching up the people.

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,460
Speaker 1: So I don't think RPGs are really going to be how it's done.

70
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,128
Speaker 1: Maybe one shot RPGs?

71
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:27,670
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

72
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,543
Speaker 1: But that's what they're going to do, which is a pretty interesting idea.

73
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:31,609
Speaker 1: I wish I had thought of it.

74
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,248
Speaker 1: And yeah, I'm sure nerds all over the place will be like, "Oh my God, this is the

75
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,550
Speaker 1: best.".

76
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,670
Speaker 1: And they'll watch every episode and be crazy obsessed with it and I won't give a shit, but that's okay.

77
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,056
Speaker 0: We'll see.

78
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:42,629
Speaker 0: Could be good.

79
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even if it's good, I don't really care about any of these people, right?

80
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't have to care about the people.

81
00:03:48,298 --> 00:03:50,610
Speaker 0: I mean, you started caring about the people in Running Man.

82
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,710
Speaker 0: You didn't know who they were ahead of time, except for the girls.

83
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,168
Speaker 1: But the thing is, I've seen these people before and I'm not a fan, right?

84
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,410
Speaker 1: It's not like these are new people I haven't seen.

85
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,510
Speaker 0: Ah, but you mostly have seen them in their element, which is an element you don't like.

86
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,410
Speaker 0: What if they're in some other element that you like?

87
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,183
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll watch an episode.

88
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,010
Speaker 1: We'll see how it goes.

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,961
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a show.

90
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:11,570
Speaker 1: We'll review it.

91
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,270
Speaker 1: We're not going to knock it if we haven't watched it, right?

92
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,769
Speaker 0: If we review it, then the nerds will come out of the woodwork and put the hate on.

93
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,430
Speaker 0: I mean, the hate I got, even for asking what Homestuck was about, I still don't know what Homestuck is about.

94
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,710
Speaker 1: I researched it even more and still don't know.

95
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,730
Speaker 0: Oh my god, yesterday we were trying to figure it out again, so we were reading the official wiki.

96
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,183
Speaker 0: I guess the unofficial wiki?

97
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:31,548
Speaker 0: I don't know.

98
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,310
Speaker 1: Any webcomic that needs a wiki, there's a problem.

99
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,690
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the more I read the wiki, the less I understood.

100
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,890
Speaker 1: Yep, absolutely.

101
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,263
Speaker 0: And someone explained what it was.

102
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,027
Speaker 0: I was like, "Oh, that makes

103
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:44,269
Speaker 0: sense.".

104
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,510
Speaker 0: But then I read the wiki, and that didn't in any way relate to what that other guy said.

105
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,559
Speaker 1: That's how it goes.

106
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,630
Speaker 1: That's what I've noticed.

107
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,250
Speaker 1: I think it's a big elaborate hoax or something.

108
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,220
Speaker 0: Except I read it.

109
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,785
Speaker 0: It's real.

110
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,310
Speaker 0: It's there.

111
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,728
Speaker 1: Who knows?

112
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:11,901
Speaker 0: So, many of you may know, I've talked about this in the past, but not recently, but the Game Boy was pretty much the biggest, most popular... It was THE handheld console.

113
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,430
Speaker 0: It was the first viable handheld console.

114
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,230
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, and if you combine all the Game Boys together, right?

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,610
Speaker 1: Advanced, color, you know, everything.

116
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:23,130
Speaker 1: And even without including DS's, it's pretty much the number one console, period.

117
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,290
Speaker 1: If you include the DS's, forget about it.

118
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,124
Speaker 0: This is why it was such amazing news that the PSP was even a fraction of the market.

119
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,750
Speaker 1: Everyone has tried Game Gear's Neo Geo Pocket colors and all sorts of...

120
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,994
Speaker 0: The Lynx?

121
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:37,568
Speaker 0: Remember the Lynx?

122
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lynx.

123
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,709
Speaker 0: I wanted a Lynx so bad.

124
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,515
Speaker 1: What's it called?

125
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,845
Speaker 1: Wonderswan, right?

126
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:43,530
Speaker 1: All sorts of things.

127
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:44,470
Speaker 0: That wasn't really in the US.

128
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,253
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

129
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,110
Speaker 1: All these things were tried and failed.

130
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,529
Speaker 1: Back to the PSP, it didn't succeed stunningly.

131
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,369
Speaker 0: But it didn't die.

132
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,494
Speaker 1: It didn't die.

133
00:05:54,514 --> 00:05:57,710
Speaker 1: And now there's even a new PSP, like the PSP Vita, right?

134
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,648
Speaker 1: Or something like that, yeah.

135
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,130
Speaker 0: So, back in the day, you know, we actually... I got a Game Gear.

136
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,890
Speaker 0: Saved up money, allowances forever for that thing.

137
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,048
Speaker 1: I just played other people's Game Gear's.

138
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I actually had a Game Gear and we also had a Game Boy.

139
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,030
Speaker 0: And my brother mostly played the Game Boy and I mostly played the Game Gear.

140
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,750
Speaker 0: And to this day, I'm actually kind of amazed.

141
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:20,110
Speaker 0: The Game Gear, for its time, looked amazing graphics-wise.

142
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,847
Speaker 0: Granted, the battery lasted like 10 minutes, but...

143
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you play a Game Gear today and you're not emulating the game, it's pretty awful because the screen has the worst ghosting in the universe.

144
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,830
Speaker 0: But the games got around that.

145
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,370
Speaker 0: The games were designed where that wouldn't be a problem.

146
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:40,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but... The thing is, there were some Game Boy games that today I would go back and play.

147
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,831
Speaker 1: Like, Kirby's Dream Land 1.

148
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:44,407
Speaker 0: Ah, there are Game Gear games I would go back and play.

149
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:44,669
Speaker 1: Not many.

150
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:45,947
Speaker 1: I can't even think of one.

151
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,330
Speaker 0: The Sonic on the Game Gear was different from every other Sonic.

152
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,849
Speaker 1: It was different, but it wasn't... It was good.

153
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:55,926
Speaker 1: It was good for a Game Gear game, but it wasn't good.

154
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,270
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go back and play it, right?

155
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,283
Speaker 0: So, how about Dragon Crystal?

156
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,310
Speaker 0: Do you know what Dragon Crystal is?

157
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,608
Speaker 1: You and your Dragon Crystal and your Gemfire... What is Dragon Crystal?

158
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,695
Speaker 0: And Scott, no.

159
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,010
Speaker 0: Me and my Dragon Crystal, you're thinking of Crystal Warriors.

160
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,600
Speaker 1: No, I'm thinking of... This is your Gemfire bullshit.

161
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,130
Speaker 1: A little turn-based wizard moving.

162
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,512
Speaker 1: No.

163
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:11,824
Speaker 1: Not at all.

164
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:12,527
Speaker 1: No?

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,754
Speaker 1: No.

166
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:13,930
Speaker 1: Okay.

167
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:19,810
Speaker 0: Like I said, the one you're thinking of is Crystal Warriors, which is basically proto-Advance Wars.

168
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,630
Speaker 0: Dragon Crystal is NetHack.

169
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,630
Speaker 0: And Dragon Crystal was on the Game Gear.

170
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:32,370
Speaker 0: And the reason I bring this up is because... You know what's coming now to the Nintendo 3DS download library?

171
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,129
Speaker 0: Dragon Crystal?

172
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,009
Speaker 0: The Game Gear library.

173
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:36,109
Speaker 1: Great.

174
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,170
Speaker 0: The Game Gear was important for one big reason.

175
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,921
Speaker 1: But you're not gonna buy a 3DS.

176
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,081
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

177
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:40,350
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

178
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,670
Speaker 1: Nor are you gonna pay to download a game for it that you could just play in a Game Gear emulator for free.

179
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:45,750
Speaker 1: I own a Game Gear.

180
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:48,470
Speaker 1: You could probably play them on a DS Lite with a cart.

181
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,949
Speaker 0: I own a Game Gear.

182
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,248
Speaker 0: Where is it?

183
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,813
Speaker 0: It still works.

184
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,190
Speaker 0: I also own every good game on the Game Gear.

185
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, where is it?

186
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:56,210
Speaker 0: I don't know, in a box somewhere?

187
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not in your possession.

188
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,519
Speaker 0: There's a mod you can do where.

189
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,288
Speaker 0: if you put two different kinds of batteries... I don't want to talk about the Game Gear, but anyway...

190
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,550
Speaker 1: Because one side runs down fast on the other side.

191
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like two of the batteries were for the screen and the other four were for the Game Gear.

192
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:09,869
Speaker 1: Exactly.

193
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,830
Speaker 0: And yet the screen needed so much power that it would drain those two batteries like that.

194
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,110
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you rotate the batteries and then you're...

195
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,449
Speaker 0: I had this like pound and a half gigantic... Like it looked like one of those satellite phones from an 80s movie.

196
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,805
Speaker 0: And it was a battery pack for the Game Gear.

197
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:25,839
Speaker 1: Yep.

198
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:30,685
Speaker 0: Seriously, the Game Gear, you know, when it came out... You look at it now, you're like,

199
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:30,930
Speaker 0: "Whatever.".

200
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,730
Speaker 0: Look at when it came out and look at the Game Boy and just look at that screen.

201
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,129
Speaker 0: That was some amazing shit.

202
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:37,544
Speaker 1: Whatever.

203
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

204
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,670
Speaker 0: But the fact that these games are coming back... And it's funny, the article mentioned Shinobi, Sonic, and Dragon Crystal.

205
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,890
Speaker 0: I can only name like four other Game Gear games that were actually really good.

206
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:51,450
Speaker 1: Name another Game Gear game that was...

207
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,226
Speaker 0: Crystal Warriors.

208
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,289
Speaker 1: I can't name one.

209
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:58,042
Speaker 0: There was also a pretty good RPG that was set in the... Like it was an Arabian theme.

210
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:58,790
Speaker 0: I forget what it was called.

211
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna go look up Top Game Gear Games.

212
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,186
Speaker 0: Haley Wars was an okay shmup in the like... Kinda like... Here we go.

213
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,450
Speaker 1: Top 10 Game Gear games according to vgcharts.com.

214
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,849
Speaker 1: Shining Force, that's an RPG.

215
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:14,650
Speaker 1: Sonic 2, of course.

216
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:14,905
Speaker 1: Yep.

217
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,930
Speaker 1: We mentioned that already.

218
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,869
Speaker 1: Shining Force again.

219
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:21,110
Speaker 1: And Shinobi 2.

220
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,220
Speaker 0: Yep.

221
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:22,990
Speaker 1: And Lion King.

222
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:25,790
Speaker 1: Oh, there was an Aladdin for the Game Gear, I think.

223
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,170
Speaker 1: You know, it was that side-scrolling Aladdin.

224
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a lot.

225
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,630
Speaker 1: Shinobi 1.

226
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,090
Speaker 0: I didn't own the Aladdin, but it was a lot like the one on the Genesis.

227
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,689
Speaker 1: Power Rangers game.

228
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,730
Speaker 1: Sonic Triple Trouble.

229
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,550
Speaker 1: I never played that one.

230
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,969
Speaker 1: I didn't play that.

231
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,641
Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like Sonic Chaos.

232
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,990
Speaker 1: I never played that one either.

233
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,028
Speaker 1: And Columns.

234
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,130
Speaker 1: Alright, Columns was like the Tetris equivalent.

235
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:46,750
Speaker 0: I hated Columns.

236
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:47,929
Speaker 1: No, Columns is not good.

237
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:48,910
Speaker 1: Battle Balls is better.

238
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,143
Speaker 1: Anyway.

239
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:49,500
Speaker 0: Yep.

240
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,068
Speaker 0: So I got one more little news, just because.

241
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:59,609
Speaker 0: So Nintendo, you might have noticed that in the Icarus game, they've changed their nomenclature for- The new 3DS one?

242
00:09:59,852 --> 00:09:59,941
Speaker 0: Yeah.

243
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,229
Speaker 0: For local multiplayer.

244
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,910
Speaker 0: So instead of calling it multiplayer, they call it together.

245
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,927
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,049
Speaker 0: So solo or together are the modes.

247
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,928
Speaker 0: And the interesting thing is, instead of saying, like, Wi-Fi or network or, you know, they've all had all these different terms, now they call it far away or nearby.

248
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,429
Speaker 1: No, that's not bad.

249
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:17,748
Speaker 0: I know.

250
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,150
Speaker 0: Now, nerds are flipping their shit and complaining.

251
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:20,830
Speaker 0: Who cares?

252
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,429
Speaker 0: These nerds, seriously, nobody knows what ad hoc networking is but you.

253
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,550
Speaker 1: What the fuck, does it matter what word they use?

254
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:27,863
Speaker 1: Yeah.

255
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,850
Speaker 1: Do they have the feature?

256
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:29,569
Speaker 1: Does it work?

257
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
Speaker 1: Now, of course it doesn't work.

258
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:38,449
Speaker 0: Nintendo, I don't trust to do multiplayer on anything but a console connected to my PC for the life of me.

259
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:39,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

260
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,630
Speaker 0: But that aside, the kind of meta controversy about this among nerds is bullshit.

261
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,230
Speaker 0: Gaming has to be accessible, and I see no reason- I don't care what word they use.

262
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,650
Speaker 1: They could use, they could call it like, you know, mode A and mode B like in Gyromite.

263
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,063
Speaker 1: We had no idea which mode went.

264
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:57,710
Speaker 1: what, right?

265
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,469
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter to me what they call it.

266
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,190
Speaker 1: All that matters is, do they have the multiplayer?

267
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,569
Speaker 1: Does it work?

268
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:03,749
Speaker 1: And the question, does it work?

269
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:04,630
Speaker 0: We don't know.

270
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,449
Speaker 0: The game didn't come out yet.

271
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:06,030
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

272
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:08,010
Speaker 0: It comes out in three days, in fact.

273
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:08,670
Speaker 1: All right.

274
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,810
Speaker 0: But I got these pictures here and it'll be interesting to see.

275
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:12,930
Speaker 0: I don't know.

276
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,910
Speaker 0: I haven't kept up on how much they're still using friend codes.

277
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,570
Speaker 0: I think they've changed a lot of that, but I don't know.

278
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,230
Speaker 0: It's weird.

279
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,089
Speaker 0: Look at Geek Nights five years ago.

280
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,848
Speaker 0: What would we say?

281
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,269
Speaker 0: Nintendo is winning.

282
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:24,309
Speaker 0: DS is best.

283
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,004
Speaker 1: Well, the earliest Nintendo, the earliest Geek Nights from like '05, '06 were like, "Oh my god, PC gaming is to

284
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:30,429
Speaker 1: dead.".

285
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,629
Speaker 0: Now, you might say we were wrong.

286
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:33,750
Speaker 0: That's not true.

287
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,350
Speaker 0: Back then, PC gaming was fucking dead.

288
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:35,888
Speaker 1: It was.

289
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,629
Speaker 1: Steam was only two years old.

290
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,250
Speaker 1: It was at the point where I- There wasn't any Minecraft.

291
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,799
Speaker 0: I bought a Mac Mini as my primary PC because I decided, "Eh, I don't need to play games online

292
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,147
Speaker 0: anymore.".

293
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:46,376
Speaker 0: Yeah.

294
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,729
Speaker 0: And PC gaming's coming back?

295
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,269
Speaker 1: Well, it's already back.

296
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still coming though because NS2 is not there yet.

297
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,610
Speaker 1: But there's three possible FPSs that can bring back the silver age of FPS.

298
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,790
Speaker 1: That's Counter-Strike GO.

299
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:00,468
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

300
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,407
Speaker 1: Tactical- Insertion.

301
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,310
Speaker 1: Infiltration.

302
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,547
Speaker 1: Whatever it is.

303
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,469
Speaker 0: Wasn't it Insertion?

304
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:06,087
Speaker 1: I don't know.

305
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:07,070
Speaker 1: I haven't.

306
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,589
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

307
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:08,454
Speaker 1: And TI.

308
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,406
Speaker 1: And NS2.

309
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,789
Speaker 1: One of those three.

310
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:18,289
Speaker 1: And, you know, Tribes, whatever, Tribes Ascend would have been on the list if it wasn't all micro bullshit.

311
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:18,859
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:31,900
Speaker 0: I really just want to play Tribes to... But anyway, things of the day.

313
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,759
Speaker 0: So, friends Pete and Neri were over and they brought me a book that I'd seen people talking about and mashing up on the internet.

314
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,039
Speaker 1: I hadn't seen it before ever.

315
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,416
Speaker 0: But I hadn't paid attention to it.

316
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,452
Speaker 0: So, we read the book aloud and doing the teacher thing where you turn and show that it's a page.

317
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:47,940
Speaker 1: It's a children's book.

318
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:58,119
Speaker 0: Called I Want My Hat Back by John Classen and this is on the level of the greatest children's books ever written.

319
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you think of the greatest children's books.

320
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,479
Speaker 0: It's like the monster at the end of the book.

321
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,704
Speaker 1: Or like you got the Dr.

322
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:12,240
Speaker 1: Seusses, you got, you know, Hungry Hungry Caterpillar, you got Goodnight Moon, you got, right, let me think of another one.

323
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 1: Like, Midnight, what's the train?

324
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,959
Speaker 1: The snow train, the Christmas train.

325
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:15,535
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

326
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,360
Speaker 0: What's it called?

327
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,060
Speaker 1: I forget, something express.

328
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,419
Speaker 1: Polar Express.

329
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,339
Speaker 0: But there's a good list of kids books.

330
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's, you know, there's Richard Scarry, right, Busytown.

331
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,300
Speaker 0: And then there's the kind of modern kids books like Go to Fuck to Sleep that's like almost there.

332
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

333
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,540
Speaker 1: But the point is, those books, it's like those are so old, those books.

334
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,260
Speaker 1: But they are so timeless and perfect forever.

335
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,820
Speaker 1: What's the one that Christopher Walken read?

336
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:38,300
Speaker 1: Where the Wild Things Are, right?

337
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,240
Speaker 1: These books are so timeless and perfect, you can't imagine that there would be another entry into that category.

338
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,900
Speaker 0: You think every story like that has been told.

339
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,280
Speaker 1: Right, it's like our whole lives, there hasn't been a new one of those.

340
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,320
Speaker 1: All the ones that I read in elementary school are still the ones.

341
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,980
Speaker 1: There aren't any newer ones that are in that quality level.

342
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:01,759
Speaker 1: Like, you just sort of accept it.

343
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,020
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess it's not possible to write the new classic children's book.

344
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,438
Speaker 0: But then, out of nowhere, John Classen writes one of the greatest children's books of all time.

345
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,939
Speaker 1: It is on the same level as all those greats.

346
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,400
Speaker 0: The reason it is good is, one, you have to read it, the bear's voice, "My hat is gone.

347
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:21,339
Speaker 0: I want it back.

348
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,217
Speaker 0: Have you seen my

349
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:23,480
Speaker 0: hat?".

350
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:24,627
Speaker 1: No.

351
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,820
Speaker 0: And it's got the classic, the page where you figure out who stole the hat, the kids you're reading it to will be like, "Oh, my God, that's the fucking head.

352
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,780
Speaker 0: Why doesn't the bear fucking do something?

353
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:37,145
Speaker 0: Ah!".

354
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,560
Speaker 0: And then it just got requested.

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,740
Speaker 1: I don't think the kids will say fucking unless they're awesome.

356
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:43,040
Speaker 0: Well, society's changing.

357
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,983
Speaker 0: You know, when you translate a kid's thoughts, the kid is not thinking, "Oh, the fucking blah,".

358
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,300
Speaker 0: but that's what it translates into.

359
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole class is like, "This is it.

360
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,372
Speaker 0: This is it.

361
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:52,897
Speaker 0: I see it.

362
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:53,878
Speaker 0: The rabbit has it.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,122
Speaker 0: Oh, my

364
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:54,347
Speaker 0: God.".

365
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,455
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

366
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:57,600
Speaker 1: I'm not going to spoil it.

367
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,357
Speaker 1: The rabbit has the hat.

368
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,719
Speaker 0: There is a page that when I turn to it, I could do nothing but hear the Kill Bill music in my head.

369
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,520
Speaker 0: This is one of the greatest illustrations in any book ever.

370
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,339
Speaker 0: This book is great, and you have to read it.

371
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,199
Speaker 1: This is the best book.

372
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,299
Speaker 1: You know, I don't even want to say it's a kid's book.

373
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:20,240
Speaker 1: All-ages book.

374
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Speaker 0: Someone already mashed it up with Madoka Magica on YouTube.

375
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,158
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

376
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:27,000
Speaker 1: I want to see a lot more mashups of this style.

377
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:27,640
Speaker 0: Guys, ponies.

378
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,840
Speaker 0: It's so easy.

379
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:29,318
Speaker 1: I know.

380
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:36,300
Speaker 1: I was surprised there wasn't already a pony who stole my hat going on, especially since you could use Applejack's hat so easily.

381
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,819
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

382
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,039
Speaker 1: And you could have Angel Bunny steal it, right?

383
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,820
Speaker 0: Because Angel is a jerk, as we just learned.

384
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,000
Speaker 1: And it's a bunny in both situations.

385
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,098
Speaker 0: The rabbit kind of deserved it.

386
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:46,278
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

388
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:49,140
Speaker 0: That's okay.

389
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,079
Speaker 1: So, my thing of the day.

390
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,119
Speaker 1: So, I don't forget it like I did in a previous show.

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:02,980
Speaker 1: I got two recipes here because it's sunny out and it's warm, which means you can grill, and it means you can walk to the grocery store without putting on a coat, so you're more likely to get some groceries and ingredients.

392
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:03,399
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

393
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,220
Speaker 0: I smelled on the way home yesterday from work every grill in the world.

394
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,180
Speaker 1: I know, right?

395
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:08,840
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,297
Speaker 0: I want to eat.

397
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,700
Speaker 1: It's RIT frisbee day anyway.

398
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,520
Speaker 1: So, I found these two awesome recipes, right?

399
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,860
Speaker 1: So, one of them is onion rings sunny side up eggs.

400
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,179
Speaker 1: The way you do this is real simple.

401
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 1: You take the onion and you go chop, chop, chop so that you get rings.

402
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,040
Speaker 1: Onion, you know, just onion rings.

403
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,060
Speaker 0: Not onion rings.

404
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,900
Speaker 1: Not onion rings like you order at the diner.

405
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:28,438
Speaker 1: Just, you know, they're rings of onion.

406
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,558
Speaker 0: Not chicken rings.

407
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:30,280
Speaker 1: Exactly.

408
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,959
Speaker 1: They're not fried yet or anything like that.

409
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,096
Speaker 1: You put the rings on the hot, you know, pan.

410
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:40,200
Speaker 1: Then you put the egg inside the ring and you can cook the egg any style you want.

411
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,560
Speaker 1: Cook it inside the ring.

412
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,740
Speaker 1: It's the same way as Girl Scouts.

413
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,920
Speaker 1: They cut out the middle of the bread and they put the egg in the middle.

414
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,659
Speaker 1: So, what I want to do.

415
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,340
Speaker 1: Instead of using bread, use the onion.

416
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:48,880
Speaker 0: I'm going to cut a hole in the bread.

417
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:49,520
Speaker 0: Or use a pepper.

418
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,840
Speaker 0: Put the onion hole in the bread.

419
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:52,758
Speaker 0: You could do that.

420
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,120
Speaker 1: Or you could cut open a pepper and get sort of like that flower shape of, you know, because the pepper's hollow, right?

421
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,365
Speaker 1: So, cut like a pepper slice.

422
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,077
Speaker 1: that's, you know, a complete circle with, you know, bumps on the sides.

423
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,560
Speaker 1: Put the egg in that mother and it'll actually be thinner because the pepper's probably a little bit bigger and it might be cooked faster.

424
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,359
Speaker 1: And you know, you do whatever style you want.

425
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,299
Speaker 1: If you want to do sunny side up, you know, try to keep the yolk together and then cover it with a lid and put some steam in there so it gets nice and cooked.

426
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:20,489
Speaker 1: Or maybe, you know, scramble them up and then pour them in there and then do a flip of the onion.

427
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,980
Speaker 1: You know, you can try to mix it up and do whatever you want.

428
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,738
Speaker 0: It's a good idea.

429
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,369
Speaker 1: Yup.

430
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,659
Speaker 1: Alright, so second recipe.

431
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:27,579
Speaker 1: This one's definitely for the grilling.

432
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,218
Speaker 1: Take a banana.

433
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,058
Speaker 1: Don't peel the banana.

434
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:34,500
Speaker 1: Take a knife and stab the banana and cut a line all the way down with the peel on.

435
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,698
Speaker 1: Not, you know, like with the banana split, you're going to open the banana and cut it in half.

436
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,180
Speaker 1: Do not actually, you know, remove the peel.

437
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,731
Speaker 1: Just put a slit in the banana.

438
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:43,760
Speaker 1: so now it's sort of like a vagina.

439
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,380
Speaker 0: Peel it?

440
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,298
Speaker 1: Then sort of squeeze it open.

441
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,819
Speaker 1: And then stuff it full of good stuff.

442
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:54,519
Speaker 0: I'll let that go.

443
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,299
Speaker 1: This is a show.

444
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Speaker 1: We have to entertain the peoples.

445
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:57,820
Speaker 1: So, right?

446
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,100
Speaker 1: And stuff it full of good stuff.

447
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:00,980
Speaker 1: By good stuff, I mean anything.

448
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,340
Speaker 1: Like chocolate chips or, you know, whipped cream probably wouldn't be good to put in first.

449
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
Speaker 1: You put the whipped cream on afterwards, right?

450
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:11,459
Speaker 0: I guess that's at the end.

451
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:12,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

452
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:16,860
Speaker 1: But, you know, you might want to put some like butterscotch in there or chocolate syrup.

453
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,100
Speaker 0: How are you going to clean it though?

454
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:19,798
Speaker 1: Don't worry about that.

455
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,600
Speaker 0: Or do you just eat the entire thing?

456
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,380
Speaker 1: If you're a heathen, you can put some coconut in there or something like that.

457
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,420
Speaker 1: Any sort of topping that can handle cooking.

458
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:28,860
Speaker 1: Then you wrap that mother in tinfoil.

459
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,936
Speaker 1: Peel and all.

460
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:31,160
Speaker 1: Pack it in tight.

461
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:33,860
Speaker 1: And then put that mother on the grill.

462
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,220
Speaker 0: What's with you and saying "that mother" on this show?

463
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,100
Speaker 1: That mother because it's a mother.

464
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:39,999
Speaker 1: You put it on the grill, right?

465
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,160
Speaker 0: Actually it's not because Cavendish bananas are nothing but clones.

466
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,500
Speaker 1: I know.

467
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,196
Speaker 1: You wait for it to melt and all the goodies inside to sort of melt into the banana and for the banana meat itself to sort of get mushy.

468
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 1: Then you take that off the grill, open up the tinfoils, and then you would apply whipped cream or other non-cookable toppings.

469
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,379
Speaker 0: Scott, I'm so hungry.

470
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,559
Speaker 1: And then you take the peel off and go om nom nom nom nom.

471
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,620
Speaker 0: So what, pray tell, is this mystical dish called?

472
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,539
Speaker 1: It's called a banana boat.

473
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,580
Speaker 0: You may recall the last time we talked about a banana recipe was in fact monkey business.

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Speaker 0: The summary of that one is basically take French toast but make the French toast out of banana bread.

475
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, it works.

476
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,673
Speaker 1: The problem is...

477
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,620
Speaker 0: It's too much.

478
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,437
Speaker 1: You have to cut it.

479
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,013
Speaker 1: The secret is cut it thinner, right?

480
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,380
Speaker 1: This is why we failed on monkey bread.

481
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,860
Speaker 1: We used too much egg and we had too thick banana bread.

482
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,480
Speaker 1: Cut the banana bread thinner, use less egg, and make sure the egg is nicely watered and orange juiced so that it's, you know, more dilute.

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:35,997
Speaker 1: Then it works.

484
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,330
Speaker 1: Yep.

485
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,340
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, of course we're going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo East.

486
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,620
Speaker 0: And we are either in, involved with, or have very close friends and associates who are doing many events on Friday.

487
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:51,639
Speaker 0: What is Burning Wheel?

488
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,239
Speaker 0: Luke Crane.

489
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,560
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights Board Game Workshop.

490
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,219
Speaker 0: That's us.

491
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:55,834
Speaker 0: 6 to 8 p.m.

492
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,839
Speaker 1: That's going to be the best.

493
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,300
Speaker 0: In the Tabletop Workshop Theater.

494
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,860
Speaker 0: We are teaching the audience in the Tabletop Workshop, which is basically a classroom with tables and everything.

495
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's going to be all these panel rooms, right?

496
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,760
Speaker 1: But it's like, okay, you know, panels are mostly good, sometimes not so good, right?

497
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,880
Speaker 1: The Tabletop Workshop room is going to be the awesomest room.

498
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:19,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, we tried this out and they did it at PAX Prime and it was a huge success.

499
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:21,180
Speaker 1: It was a tiny room.

500
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, they tested it.

501
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,877
Speaker 0: It worked really well.

502
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,180
Speaker 1: But it just didn't get enough attention on it.

503
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,453
Speaker 0: It has many more rooms, so they made a real panel room.

504
00:20:28,473 --> 00:20:30,538
Speaker 0: that's just for these kinds of workshops.

505
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:39,480
Speaker 0: So we're in there for two hours teaching everyone how to play and win Carcassonne and Agricola and a secret game and we'll do some other fun things.

506
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:50,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're basically going to teach you how to play, if you've never played it before, and even if you have played it before, we'll teach you how to win or at least the best strategies that we know so that you'll start off playing.

507
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,420
Speaker 1: You won't just have to derp your way through a whole bunch of games.

508
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,100
Speaker 1: You'll only have to derp your way through one or two games.

509
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,040
Speaker 0: Then that evening, Lauren Green, her documentary, Going Cardboard, will be screening.

510
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,259
Speaker 1: If you don't already have the DVD.

511
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,700
Speaker 0: And we should, at least one of us, or both of us, will be around because she's going to do a Q&A afterward and there's going to be some fun stuff.

512
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:16,400
Speaker 0: She'll also be in the Kickstarter room doing another screening and I imagine if you want to talk to her about the documentary, she'll be really accessible.

513
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,580
Speaker 1: That's pretty much all she'll be doing.

514
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:28,100
Speaker 0: Saturday, Jared of Soren Crane, Parsley, Spooky Manor, Jungle Adventure, Action Castle fame will be doing Spooky Manor and Jungle Adventure.

515
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,759
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought he was doing one on Friday also.

516
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,740
Speaker 0: He's not doing one on Friday, but Saturday he's doing Spooky Manor and Jungle Adventure and on Sunday he's doing Z Ward.

517
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,380
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought it was one each day, but I guess it's two Saturday, one Sunday.

518
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Speaker 0: And at 4.30 PM in the Cat Theater, we're doing Let's Play Money Making Game.

519
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:57,837
Speaker 0: And that evening, and I want to go to this, at 6 o'clock in the Tabletop Workshop, Luke Crane is talking about how, he calls this panel the D&D.

520
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:58,440
Speaker 0: you never knew.

521
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,579
Speaker 0: And the premise of it is pretty cool.

522
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,699
Speaker 0: He is going to talk about how we rail on Dungeons & Dragons for being a bad role-playing game, but it's bad because we try to use it to do things it's not good at.

523
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:16,540
Speaker 0: He talks about old-school, hardcore, dungeon-crawl D&D and how if you play that game as it's written, it's amazing.

524
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,100
Speaker 1: Well, it is amazing, but it is also a dungeon-crawl.

525
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:21,180
Speaker 1: It's like Descent or HeroQuest.

526
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't fault D&D, like old-school D&D, for not being a burning wheel, of course not.

527
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,160
Speaker 0: In the same way that I can't fault Doom for not having interspecies sex a la Mass Effect.

528
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,260
Speaker 1: I mean, do you want to play D&D first, Ed?

529
00:22:36,643 --> 00:22:38,280
Speaker 1: You know, I have the three color boxes.

530
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 1: The red, green, blue.

531
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 1: We can just play it, walk around dungeons, hit things with no expectation of role-playing.

532
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,417
Speaker 0: I think it'll be an interesting panel.

533
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,259
Speaker 0: I want to see exactly what he has to say.

534
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,813
Speaker 1: I do, too.

535
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,660
Speaker 0: So PAX is going to be goddamn rockin', independent of Anime Boston on the same weekend?

537
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,080
Speaker 1: You could say it's a mother.

538
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,559
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is The Hunger Games.

539
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,580
Speaker 0: You know, the movie's coming.

540
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,740
Speaker 0: Everyone's going apeshit about this book, so I figure we should review it.

541
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:21,259
Speaker 1: From what I've heard, I haven't read it yet, so I'm not going to say, but what I've heard is basically, even people I follow and such who are not nerdy, were like, "Huh, everything seems to suggest that it's some sort of combination of Arnold Schwarzenegger running man and Battle

542
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:21,740
Speaker 1: Royale.".

543
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Speaker 0: Oh, it is, but there's a third element.

544
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:24,900
Speaker 1: A third element, huh?

545
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:26,858
Speaker 1: Okay.

546
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,262
Speaker 1: Like, straight up, 1984.

547
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:30,860
Speaker 1: Well, the Battle Royale has 1984, so that's not a new element.

548
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,360
Speaker 0: It does, but the Battle Royale 1984 is a little far-fetched, the way it's presented, and a little superficial.

549
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,697
Speaker 1: I think it just doesn't come across to the foreign audiences as well.

550
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,880
Speaker 0: I know that Battle Royale focuses mostly on the kids fighting.

551
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,319
Speaker 1: The movie, at least.

552
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,643
Speaker 1: Yes.

553
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,120
Speaker 0: I haven't read the book, so I don't know.

554
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,703
Speaker 1: The book is gigantic.

555
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:53,620
Speaker 1: I can't imagine that the book doesn't have more than the movie.

556
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,300
Speaker 0: The Hunger Games starts quite a bit before and ends quite a bit after the actual fights.

557
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:02,640
Speaker 0: I liked it, but we'll save that for the review.

558
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,139
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

559
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:04,508
Speaker 0: We've got internet stuff.

560
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,039
Speaker 0: We've got a YouTube channel, Geeknight Stream.

561
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,427
Speaker 0: We've got an awesome forum.

562
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,272
Speaker 0: We've got a Twitter.

563
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,480
Speaker 0: We've got a bunch of Twitters.

564
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,040
Speaker 1: Facebook, Google Plus, whatever it is that you like.

565
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,080
Speaker 1: I think you should connect with us in the way that you please.

566
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,480
Speaker 0: And I will have a link to it, because as you know, we run the panels and workshops department of Kineticon.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,265
Speaker 0: Submissions are open.

568
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:25,900
Speaker 0: The forum still has a little bit of funkiness because it's on the new website.

569
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,372
Speaker 0: And we did not write the forum.

570
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,680
Speaker 0: Don't complain about the forum to me.

571
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,566
Speaker 1: That has nothing to do with us.

572
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,555
Speaker 1: Complain to Kineticon.

573
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:32,099
Speaker 1: We didn't do it.

574
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,505
Speaker 0: But the forum is up.

575
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,228
Speaker 0: You can submit your panels.

576
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,059
Speaker 0: The people who approve panels are me and Scott.

577
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:50,680
Speaker 1: If there are weird fields on the forum that you don't know what to type in them, either type "nothing" or type "garble garble" and it won't even matter.

578
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,240
Speaker 0: Unless that field is relevant to your thing.

579
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,146
Speaker 1: Such as title or description.

580
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:59,000
Speaker 1: The point is, if you don't know what it is, then it's probably not for you.

581
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:07,280
Speaker 0: But really, guys, you listeners, the people we know, you guys are the ones that are our go-to for good content at Kineticon.

582
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:14,040
Speaker 0: Because historically, the people we know through Geek Nights who submit panels do some of the best panels we got.

583
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:23,600
Speaker 0: So if you want to submit and you're a Geek Nights listener, there's a good chance, unless your panel looks really shit, that we're going to put it in the schedule and get you a free badge or two.

584
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:25,839
Speaker 0: Anything else?

585
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:27,159
Speaker 1: No, let's do the show.

586
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,741
Speaker 1: Alright.

587
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:31,432
Speaker 0: So Spotted was the sleeper hit of PAX.

588
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:32,816
Speaker 0: We were PAX East last year.

589
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:33,960
Speaker 0: We were jumping all over this game.

590
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,420
Speaker 1: We can call this past year the year of Spotted.

591
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,340
Speaker 0: I own like three... Well, I have owned...

592
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,820
Speaker 1: In fact, I think Spotted is probably the tabletop game of the year.

593
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,840
Speaker 0: I have owned like five Spotted sets because I keep buying it and giving it to people as gifts.

594
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:52,140
Speaker 0: In fact, I gave the first Spotted set I bought that unfortunately has a "For Rectal Use Only" sticker on it to Robert Koo.

595
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,120
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean fortunately.

596
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,699
Speaker 0: I'm curious to see if he has played that Spotted or if he has in fact not opened it for fear.

597
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,699
Speaker 1: Well, if he has the Koo and A, you can go and ask him.

598
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,185
Speaker 0: I will.

599
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,480
Speaker 0: It's at midnight on Friday.

600
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:03,894
Speaker 1: I know.

601
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,934
Speaker 0: So, Blue Orange Games made Spotted and they made another game.

602
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,800
Speaker 0: They have a lot of games that they've made.

603
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,760
Speaker 1: I think they have an excess in their warehouse of circular cards and metal tins.

604
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,906
Speaker 0: So Trigger is a newer game they made.

605
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,330
Speaker 0: that looks a lot like Spotted.

606
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,780
Speaker 0: Little tin, circular cards, all that stuff.

607
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,659
Speaker 0: And the way Trigger works... I'm going to spoil the review right now.

608
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:31,720
Speaker 0: It's a great concept and it was fun to play once.

609
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,008
Speaker 1: Kind of.

610
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,459
Speaker 1: Have fun.

611
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:37,700
Speaker 0: No, I would argue we had fun because of all the arguing and problems we had.

612
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,403
Speaker 1: Sometimes it was fun.

613
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:42,000
Speaker 1: It's like part of the time we were playing was fun and part of the time we were playing was not fun.

614
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,917
Speaker 0: You got to admit, when my question to all of you was, "The state we are in, ends in A,

615
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 0: constant.".

616
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,240
Speaker 1: That was the fun part.

617
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:59,579
Speaker 0: So the way the game works is you have a card with a question on it or a statement like, "Your first name has an even number of

618
00:26:59,639 --> 00:26:59,920
Speaker 0: letters."

619
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:00,863
Speaker 0: Or, "I have

620
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:01,365
Speaker 0: children."

621
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,473
Speaker 0: Or, "The answer is

622
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:03,935
Speaker 0: false.".

623
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:05,180
Speaker 0: Something like that.

624
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,500
Speaker 0: You can whistle your own national anthem.

625
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,260
Speaker 0: Everyone slams down either the right hand or the left hand on the trigger, which is the little foam pad.

626
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,300
Speaker 0: The right hand, you slam down if the statement is true.

627
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,280
Speaker 0: Now if the statement says "you," then it means you personally.

628
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,548
Speaker 0: So it's like, "You are wearing pink

629
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,050
Speaker 0: shoes.".

630
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,620
Speaker 0: Then if you are wearing pink shoes, you say true.

631
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:33,060
Speaker 0: But if the person says, "I am wearing pink shoes," it's as if the person who said the thing on the card is wearing pink shoes.

632
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,500
Speaker 1: So if it's a "you" question, then people might have to give different answers.

633
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,120
Speaker 1: Let's say I'm wearing shoes and the guy next to me isn't.

634
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,465
Speaker 1: It says, "You are wearing

635
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:41,767
Speaker 1: shoes.".

636
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,660
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to put down the true hand and he's going to put down the false hand.

637
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:55,440
Speaker 1: But if it's a question where it's a "my" question, then it's a question about the question asker, in which case everyone has the same answer as is the correct answer.

638
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,591
Speaker 0: You put your left hand down for false.

639
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,099
Speaker 0: Then we sort it out.

640
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,860
Speaker 0: Whoever put the correct answer down first gets to keep the card and they're the reader next.

641
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,880
Speaker 0: Whoever put the first wrong answer down, if there is a wrong answer, gives up a card.

642
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Speaker 0: And then, based on the color of the back of the card, the person who won the point is now the new reader.

643
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,700
Speaker 0: You go through until someone runs out of cards.

644
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,560
Speaker 1: Right, so basically winning doesn't actually get you anything because you then have to read a new card.

645
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:30,800
Speaker 1: But it helps you because when you're reading a card, there's no chance you can lose one in that round.

646
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:37,059
Speaker 1: So if you win every round, there's basically no chance of you ever losing a card because you're reading questions the whole time.

647
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,060
Speaker 1: But, so what the game comes down to is who can hold out the longest without losing all their cards.

648
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,332
Speaker 1: So the game could go on forever.

649
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:47,520
Speaker 1: if everyone plays perfectly.

650
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,319
Speaker 1: Unlike spot it, which is sort of like, it's gonna end.

651
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,720
Speaker 0: Now, the concept is great and we know it is because when we played, some of the questions, like everyone would be like, ugh.

652
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:01,029
Speaker 0: Just like spot it, your brain would freeze.

653
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,160
Speaker 0: Your adult brain would say, wait a minute, I'm actually a baby.

654
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,467
Speaker 0: And that part is really fun.

655
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,960
Speaker 0: Like you get questions like, what's a really good one?

656
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,859
Speaker 0: Because some of the questions are kind of dumb.

657
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,400
Speaker 1: The ones that have a lot of double negatives.

658
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,149
Speaker 0: Yep.

659
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,459
Speaker 1: Stuff like that.

660
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:15,819
Speaker 0: The opposite of false is true.

661
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,120
Speaker 0: At least two players are wearing shoes with no laces.

662
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,119
Speaker 0: I'm reading the card in English.

663
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,140
Speaker 0: The table we are playing on is round.

664
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,640
Speaker 0: Ah, now that's where the problems begin.

665
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,160
Speaker 1: Right, a lot of these questions have assumptions built into them.

666
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,520
Speaker 1: We weren't playing on a table, we were playing on the floor.

667
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,120
Speaker 1: So what does that question even, you know, should it be, you know, obviously it's not true because we're not playing on a table.

668
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,960
Speaker 1: But it's not false either.

669
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,240
Speaker 0: Well it is because logically the statement is false because one portion of it is false.

670
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's tough though.

671
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,040
Speaker 0: However, that's fine because that we could argue.

672
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,200
Speaker 0: But some of the questions have a problem that they will specify what the actual answer is.

673
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,840
Speaker 0: They'll put a little T or a little F next to it.

674
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,940
Speaker 1: Because they think, the people who made this game, that no matter what that question will always be true or always be false.

675
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,660
Speaker 1: Sometimes this is the case.

676
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,799
Speaker 1: Sometimes it is actually not.

677
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,940
Speaker 0: For example, green is made by mixing blue and yellow.

678
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:16,160
Speaker 0: They say this is always true, but wait a minute.

679
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:16,933
Speaker 1: Not if it's light.

680
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,808
Speaker 0: Are we talking about pigments?

681
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:18,740
Speaker 0: Are we talking about light?

682
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,860
Speaker 1: Exactly, we're too smart so that we know better that, you know, you can make a really good argument.

683
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,420
Speaker 1: And basically it's a bullshit question.

684
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,380
Speaker 0: Or at this table, alright, we already don't have a table.

685
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:31,080
Speaker 0: There are as many mouths as there are noses.

686
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,260
Speaker 0: What if someone lost their nose in NOM?

687
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,220
Speaker 0: Now what game?

688
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:34,999
Speaker 1: Exactly.

689
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,519
Speaker 1: What if someone has two noses?

690
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:44,340
Speaker 1: What if there's like, you know, one of those funny glasses with the nose built onto it sitting on the table?

691
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,880
Speaker 1: That's an extra nose.

692
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,920
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a good one though.

693
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
Speaker 0: This is not the first half of the year.

694
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,480
Speaker 0: And the first letter of the state we are in is in the first ten letters of the alphabet.

695
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:57,440
Speaker 1: See, those are good ones, right?

696
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,480
Speaker 1: Ones where there's no ambiguity, there's no argument to be made.

697
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Speaker 1: It's true or false.

698
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,980
Speaker 1: Some of these, right, there was one that wasn't even true or false.

699
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:06,360
Speaker 1: It was like a command.

700
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like slam both your hands down at the same time.

701
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,520
Speaker 1: Well it's like, well wait a minute, that's not a true or false statement.

702
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,718
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

703
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,100
Speaker 0: Also, some of them are predicated upon the future.

704
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,900
Speaker 0: So I realized that I could retroactively change the result of the game.

705
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,740
Speaker 0: One of them was, you are sleeping here tonight.

706
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:23,398
Speaker 1: Yep.

707
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,780
Speaker 0: So we had some friends who were actually sleeping over, but Scott wasn't sleeping over.

708
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,540
Speaker 0: But he could have said true and then said, alright, yeah, I am going to stay the night.

709
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,200
Speaker 0: Or, what if I didn't let him stay the night?

710
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:36,895
Speaker 1: Or, what if something happened later and people weren't able to sleep there?

711
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,780
Speaker 1: You know, you never know what's going to happen.

712
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,880
Speaker 1: So you can't make true or false statements about the future unless, you know, psychic powers are real.

713
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,340
Speaker 0: Now the other trouble is that the way the game is written, it doesn't have all the game modes like Spot It did.

714
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,840
Speaker 0: So the game kind of peters out and then you're going to rapidly have the same questions over and over again as the game goes towards its conclusion.

715
00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:58,319
Speaker 1: Well that's another flaw in the game, right?

716
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:06,440
Speaker 1: Everyone's dealt these cards at the beginning of the game and you cycle through those cards and each card does have five questions, but you don't choose which question to ask.

717
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,700
Speaker 1: It's determined by the color of the previous card.

718
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:18,960
Speaker 1: So if you keep playing and you don't suck, right, then what happens is you keep asking the same questions over and over again and you don't draw any new cards.

719
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:29,340
Speaker 1: To get new questions, you would have to play again a new game with new cards or bring in some sort of house rule where you can throw away cards you have already and draw new ones and stuff like that.

720
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:37,320
Speaker 1: But it's not in the official rules, so yeah, the rules are flawed in that you don't get fresh questions and eventually you're doing the same things over and over again.

721
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:48,100
Speaker 0: Which is actually, you know, apples to apples has a similar problem that everyone uses their good cards and then if the game goes on too long, everyone has nothing but a bunch of shit proper nouns and everyone's just bored and waiting for the game to end.

722
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,995
Speaker 1: That's why you get to get so many expansions, but even if you get so many expansions, it's not like they're all good cards in there.

723
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,440
Speaker 1: You still get a handful of crap cards.

724
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Speaker 0: The real answer is you gotta make your own apples to apples.

725
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

726
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:04,439
Speaker 0: But the other problem with the rules is that the way it works, you can't really get ahead, you can basically just hold out.

727
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,479
Speaker 1: Already discussed that, yeah.

728
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,700
Speaker 0: But there's a way around that in that maybe you just don't answer any questions, then you can never fall behind.

729
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,660
Speaker 1: Well, I think, see the way I interpret it is that you have to put a hand down, right?

730
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,121
Speaker 1: It

731
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:21,598
Speaker 0: doesn't specify a time limit, so I can just wait until everyone's done, sit there, fully consider the question, then very slowly go,

732
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:21,979
Speaker 0: "Eh."

733
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:33,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm fine with that, but I feel like you have to put a hand down because let's say everyone puts a correct hand down, no one's saying anything, you still have to think about it and decide if it's right hand or what to do.

734
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,740
Speaker 0: But the way the questions are, given 30 seconds to think, you're guaranteed to not fuck it up.

735
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,213
Speaker 1: I know.

736
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,660
Speaker 1: So... Unless it's one of those stupid ambiguous questions.

737
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,958
Speaker 0: What this game is, if I had to encapsulate it in a word, is lazy.

738
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,460
Speaker 0: Not broken, I'm gonna say lazy.

739
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,158
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say broken.

740
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:53,380
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it is broken, but it's only broken due to laziness.

741
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:04,920
Speaker 0: The concept is really solid, and it could have been great, they just didn't even put half a fucking ass into the questions they put on it, and they didn't actually think about the mechanics.

742
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,860
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't actually playtest this game.

743
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,860
Speaker 0: I cannot imagine adults playing this game for more than two seconds without running into a question they can't answer from the rules.

744
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:28,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could take this exact same ruleset, add a rule for maybe switching cards out or drawing cards or something like that, like when you win you draw a card or who knows, and then clarify the rule about do you have to answer or not.

745
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,378
Speaker 0: Maybe do something like...

746
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,139
Speaker 1: And then get rid of any ambiguous question and only put in the good questions.

747
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:38,940
Speaker 0: Yep, like one way, maybe you make a rule like the last person to put their hand down gets some penalty to force people to move quickly.

748
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:43,030
Speaker 1: The game could be fixed with a significant effort.

749
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,292
Speaker 1: It could be an okay game.

750
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:47,500
Speaker 1: It still wouldn't be as good as Spotted though, even if all those problems are solved.

751
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,960
Speaker 0: I don't know, I think it could be because the few rounds where the question was good and there was no ambiguity had the exact same brainfeel as Spotted.

752
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think Spotted is just... you can't compete with Spotted.

753
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:01,542
Speaker 0: I think you could.

754
00:35:01,562 --> 00:35:06,570
Speaker 0: Like I said, this game is broken, but it's broken due to nothing more than laziness.

755
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:12,840
Speaker 0: This could have easily been a really fun game, but instead, as it is, I would not buy this game if I were you.

756
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,460
Speaker 1: No, we're not going to be having ten copies giving them away.

757
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,739
Speaker 0: I'm going to try to fix it.

758
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:18,840
Speaker 1: You had to make all new cards.

759
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,300
Speaker 0: No, I can't fix the questions, but I'm going to try to figure out a way to at least fix the mechanics, because I think the concept is solid.

760
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,329
Speaker 0: Maybe I swap it instead of putting your hands down.

761
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,151
Speaker 0: There's a totem.

762
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,975
Speaker 0: I don't know, I'll come up with something.

763
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:33,960
Speaker 0: I'll make like a trigger mod.

764
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:34,773
Speaker 1: Sure.

765
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,100
Speaker 0: So the other game we'll talk about, because Scott finally beat it so we can talk about it, is Bobo.

766
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,666
Speaker 1: Bobo's Big Adventure.

767
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:43,512
Speaker 1: It's a Flash game.

768
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,439
Speaker 1: You can play it for free.

769
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,820
Speaker 1: So basically, we saw a trailer for this game, and I didn't realize it was a Flash game at the time.

770
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,960
Speaker 0: I was so pumped when I saw that trailer.

771
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the trailer, it's basically this incredibly crazy homage to the old NES games, right?

772
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:01,420
Speaker 1: And each level is an homage to a different game.

773
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,700
Speaker 1: So there's a balloon fighter level, there's a double dragon level, a Zelda level, a Mega Man level.

774
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:18,780
Speaker 1: There's all these levels, and each level, urban champion level, each one is modeled after an old NES game, and each one also includes a bunch of elements from other NES games.

775
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,518
Speaker 1: So in the double dragon level, you're walking down, there's a Goomba, and you kick it.

776
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,940
Speaker 1: Or like, you know, in the swimming Mario level, there's also that Ninja Turtle, you know, electric seaweed shit going on.

777
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:33,579
Speaker 0: And a door that takes you to a room, all Goonies 2 style, where the mermaid is there.

778
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like every- And all I have to say is, Scott, you should have picked "Mate" as the option.

779
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:41,094
Speaker 1: I did the second time I played it.

780
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:41,959
Speaker 1: Because you told me.

781
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,735
Speaker 0: See how she makes a good face, like after that?

782
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:45,440
Speaker 1: Like it's a funny face.

783
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's like, "Hey,

784
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:46,397
Speaker 1: baby.".

785
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:55,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in terms of the theme, right, the game is just really fun, because it somehow manages to throw in all this stuff just blatantly.

786
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:10,960
Speaker 1: And usually that comes off as fanboyish and amateurish, but they manage to have it come off as like clever and quality, partly because just, you know, the way they put the pixel art in there is just really, you know, well done and professional, and it's not just sort of like slapped together like a crappy sprite comic.

787
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,680
Speaker 0: Well, I like when you're brawling, how the guy actually can't hurt you.

788
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,086
Speaker 0: Yeah.

789
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,879
Speaker 0: Like he just sucks and you can just kill him.

790
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:25,698
Speaker 0: There's so many, like it's clever, and the second, it's very well constructed, the very second one of the jokes gets old, you're already moving on to the next thing.

791
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:28,373
Speaker 0: Like right when you're like, "Okay, I get it.

792
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:28,917
Speaker 0: Oh, there's something

793
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:29,058
Speaker 0: new.".

794
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:41,960
Speaker 0: The only problem with it was, and it's not really a problem for everyone, so I can't really hold it against the game, and it's also a good thing, it gives you the feel for like what Nintendo hard was like, but it's not really a Nintendo hard by any means.

795
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:45,700
Speaker 0: I beat it in basically one go, like it was super easy.

796
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:56,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the first time I tried to play it, I was using, you know, I just couldn't get past the electric water part, but then, you know, Rym told me to use the mate option instead of the other option, so the second time I played it, I was pretty much able to beat it.

797
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,280
Speaker 1: You gotta continue sometimes, they give you plenty of continues.

798
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, well once you put in the Konami code, you're pretty much set.

799
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:22,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and it's just, actually I accidentally enabled in the Contra level, I accidentally enabled two player mode, which basically doesn't work, because they switch all the controls on you, so I sort of had to die on purpose to then, because I couldn't shoot, because I couldn't figure out what button did the shooting, because the screen that tells you the controls for two player mode disappeared, and I didn't have a second player,

800
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,524
Speaker 0: so I had to

801
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:28,460
Speaker 1: die on purpose and continue, and then use Konami code single player, so I could shoot everybody.

802
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:41,160
Speaker 0: But my complaint is just that the game was actually really too easy, and when I saw the trailer, I thought, I'm going to play that game and beat it, like I'm going to hard card, and it wasn't really hard card.

803
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, beat it in like an hour, once I actually put the effort in to try to beat it.

804
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:55,700
Speaker 0: It's more like a sort of comedy homage that has gameplay to remind you what that gameplay is like, but it's not a hard game, you should totally, everyone should just play it.

805
00:38:56,641 --> 00:39:06,200
Speaker 0: If you're even reasonably skilled at games, you'll beat it pretty easily, not in one go, but without too much, you're not going to bang your head against the wall, there's no Super Meat Boy.

806
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,118
Speaker 1: There were some things that bothered me, for example...

807
00:39:08,421 --> 00:39:10,360
Speaker 0: No secrets in the Zelda level really pissed me off.

808
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:18,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was, what's it called, in the Balloon Fighter level, the controls were tight, felt like Balloon Fighter, exactly, right?

809
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,240
Speaker 1: Zelda level, even though there were no secrets, the controls were exactly like Zelda, perfect, right?

810
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:26,179
Speaker 1: But the Mega Man level, the controls are way off, right?

811
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:43,140
Speaker 1: It's like you put the effort in to get those other levels to match the original games, but Mega Man's all loosey-goosey, you can't even, and they put the Piranha Plant bad guy there, you couldn't possibly, and then the Gizmo Duck, it's like you can't kill him before he hits you, and there's nowhere to stand, it's like, why did you design it like that?

812
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,140
Speaker 1: You should have just moved him back like a square or two, it would have been just fine.

813
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the hallmark of Mega Man games is that you can avoid everything unless you suck.

814
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 1: Right, so that Mega Man level had a couple poor design problems in it.

815
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Speaker 0: It made up for it by being really derpy easy.

816
00:39:57,321 --> 00:40:01,580
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I mean, it was still just annoying that it's like, oh, you kind of screwed this up, guys.

817
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:16,528
Speaker 0: I was very pleased, spoilers, but whatever, that at the end, it was, you know, Little Mac was the bad guy, like he was the square boss, and the fact that then you fight him, and you're the bad guy in the perspective, and you're playing, like, you're playing

818
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:17,030
Speaker 0: Punch-Out!,

819
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,680
Speaker 0: but you're controlling the big guy on the other side.

820
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just- That was great.

821
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,860
Speaker 1: That was genius.

822
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,860
Speaker 1: You know, that's the kind of thing where it's one of those, like, why doesn't the Pokémon MMO exist?

823
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:28,653
Speaker 1: Why isn't there a game where it's Punch-Out!

824
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:29,700
Speaker 1: and you're the bad guy, right?

825
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:29,955
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,273
Speaker 1: There it is, there's a game where it's Punch-Out!

827
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:31,920
Speaker 1: and you're the bad guy.

828
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,856
Speaker 1: I almost wish they would make an entire game a Punch-Out!

829
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,520
Speaker 1: where you're the bad guy.

830
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,499
Speaker 0: That'd be really fun.

831
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:37,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be the greatest.

832
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,338
Speaker 0: Really fun.

833
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,680
Speaker 1: And you could choose different guys, different moves, and all kinds of stuff.

834
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,160
Speaker 0: But Abobo was, the one thing is, like, you play this whole game and Abobo's a fucker the whole way, he's murdering kids and killing people.

835
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,580
Speaker 1: Right, he's a bad guy, he's a bad guy from Double Dragon.

836
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:02,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but toward the end, the game kind of lulled me into the sense of, like, you know, I'm playing Abobo, I'm the hero, and then at the end, it's actually kind of a gross cutscene, but you get this cutscene where they just go apeshit and kill everybody.

837
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you're the bad guy, you're the bad guy just won.

838
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, Abobo is a horrible person.

839
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Speaker 1: But then again, Little Mac was also a horrible person.

840
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, so two horrible people fought, and the more horrible one, won.

841
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:13,616
Speaker 1: Sure.

842
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,440
Speaker 0: Because Abobo is the most horrible.

843
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,036
Speaker 0: He is.

844
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:17,819
Speaker 0: But it was super fun.

845
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,760
Speaker 0: The thing is, I thought I was going to buy the NES, like, controller thing to play Abobo.

846
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:24,239
Speaker 1: I have it, I used it.

847
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,439
Speaker 0: But you can totally just beat it with the keyboard, because it's not that hard.

848
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:27,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

849
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:30,720
Speaker 1: And the Joy 2 Key is such bullshit.

850
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,520
Speaker 0: Fuck Joy 2 Key.

851
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,879
Speaker 1: I mean, that thing's such a piece of shit.

852
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:33,720
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

853
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,477
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to try to write a replacement for Joy 2 Key.

854
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,060
Speaker 1: that doesn't suck.

855
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,899
Speaker 1: Because it's awful.

856
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,259
Speaker 1: It should die in a fire.

857
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,644
Speaker 1: Yup.

858
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,019
Speaker 1: It's an open source too, so you can trust it.

859
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,416
Speaker 1: Yeah.

860
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:44,698
Speaker 0: But not for Macs.

861
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,060
Speaker 1: So if you're an NES fan, you know, go back and play Abobo.

862
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,380
Speaker 1: If you're not an NES type of person, I actually think you probably shouldn't play it.

863
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,240
Speaker 0: It won't make any sense.

864
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,659
Speaker 0: It won't make any sense.

865
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,060
Speaker 0: It would be like watching Excel Saga if you'd never seen anime before.

866
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:06,320
Speaker 1: Right, so what you should do instead is you should, you know, get the list of, like, the 9 or 10 games that are, you know, homaged.

867
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,179
Speaker 1: Mostly, like, the big ones that are homaged.

868
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,200
Speaker 0: Mega Man, Balloon Fighter.

869
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,360
Speaker 1: Mega Man, Balloon Fighter, Zelda, Double Dragon.

870
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,440
Speaker 0: That wrestling game.

871
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:20,781
Speaker 1: Urban Champion, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1.

872
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:21,678
Speaker 1: What are the other ones?

873
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:22,979
Speaker 0: Uh, that's enough.

874
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,040
Speaker 1: I mean, uh, DuckTales, whatever.

875
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,692
Speaker 1: You know, just play those, and Mario 2, right?

876
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,360
Speaker 1: Play those, Mario 3.

877
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,740
Speaker 0: Oh, speaking of which, that aside, play DuckTales on the NES.

878
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,000
Speaker 0: That's one of the greatest games ever.

879
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,880
Speaker 0: Mario 1.

880
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,060
Speaker 1: Play all those games, you know, learn, you know, just get the feel for them, beat Mario 3, or else what the hell, and Mega Man 2.

881
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,518
Speaker 1: And then play Abobo and you'll be able to appreciate it.

882
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:48,799
Speaker 1: I wish they would have made a Metroid level.

883
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:49,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

884
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,779
Speaker 1: Well, there were a lot of things done.

885
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,319
Speaker 1: Castlevania level.

886
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,660
Speaker 0: I wish they'd done, but they had homage to a lot of those things.

887
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,420
Speaker 1: They did, but they didn't have levels for them.

888
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:56,939
Speaker 1: Metal Gear level.

889
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,759
Speaker 0: Did you find the SNM torture porn room?

890
00:43:00,502 --> 00:43:01,440
Speaker 1: Uh, don't, maybe.

891
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,319
Speaker 1: I don't know.

892
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,180
Speaker 1: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

893
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,940
Speaker 0: The room where, like, Luigi's in there, and the princess, and the girls with whips from Double Dragon.

894
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:07,597
Speaker 1: No.

895
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:08,259
Speaker 0: Really?

896
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,337
Speaker 0: So, remember in Double Dragon, in the first level, there's that place where you can walk up the wall?

897
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:13,939
Speaker 0: Yes.

898
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:15,679
Speaker 0: If you walk all the way up the wall, it's up there.

899
00:43:16,484 --> 00:43:16,527
Speaker 1: Oh.

900
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:25,520
Speaker 0: That was great, because the fact that they had that walk up the wall, that glitchy bullshit there, and that they did a thing in there, that was brilliant.

901
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:27,959
Speaker 1: Okay.

902
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,358
Speaker 1: Alright.

903
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,036
