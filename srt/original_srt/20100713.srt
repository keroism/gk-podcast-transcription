1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,145
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 13th.

2
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:12,668
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,480
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight a new game the legend of Zelda.

4
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,396

5
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,509
Speaker 0: Sweet Jesus, we're back from Kinetic on.

6
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:34,070
Speaker 0: Yep, that was a. you know it's one thing to do like eight or nine panels at a con.

7
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:38,070
Speaker 0: It's another thing to take over an entire panel room for an entire con.

8
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:42,409
Speaker 0: It is yet another thing to be the heads of panels for an entire time.

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:50,578
Speaker 1: Usually the heads of panels are don't actually do any panels so having to do panels and be the head of panels was quite Well actually wouldn't have been so bad.

10
00:00:50,618 --> 00:01:03,650
Speaker 0: the only trouble we ran into which will be rectified for next year Is that we had to deal with all situations and be doing panels which meant I had an earpiece on while I was doing panels And periodically I would be interrupted and have to go respond to something.

11
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to do something about that.

12
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:06,660

32
00:01:54,893 --> 00:02:01,270
Speaker 1: So I was gonna do it last night Fascinating yeah, so I go down to do some laundry and I put in one of the laundry machines.

33
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,829
Speaker 0: They have a screen that tells you this is really you're gonna keep going with this.

34
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay They have a screen that tells you how much money you got to put in.

35
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,297
Speaker 1: so I go to the first one and the screen Is off.

36
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:11,967
Speaker 1: which is we?

37
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,385
Speaker 1: So I put a money in and it says okay add another dollar.

38
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:23,202
Speaker 1: so I put in a second money Nothing happens, and then it resets and is like yeah, give me a dollar 25.

39
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:27,928
Speaker 1: I'm like what I'm like pushing the coin return nothing.

40
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:31,965
Speaker 1: I Already put my clothes and detergent in there by the way all right so it was detergent.

41
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,250
Speaker 0: because there's two situations.

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,562
Speaker 0: Situation one you put the clothes in put the detergent in the top.

43
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:38,029
Speaker 0: if you fail you pull the clothes out.

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,517
Speaker 0: Situation to certain kinds of washers.

45
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,766
Speaker 0: detergent is already leaking out of the clothes.

46
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:43,850
Speaker 1: detergent is not leaking up.

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,517
Speaker 0: It is past the point of no return.

48
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,943
Speaker 0: you son are fucked.

49
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:48,470
Speaker 1: now the detergent is not on the clothes.

50
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:49,922
Speaker 0: I did that once not that long ago.

51
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:53,154
Speaker 1: So anyway I Know.

52
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:58,306
Speaker 1: I go again and I go to the second washer which looks like it which the screen was on.

53
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,110
Speaker 1: it was looking normal.

54
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,749
Speaker 1: I put a quarter and nothing happens.

55
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,959
Speaker 1: Like how could both washers be broken?

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,929
Speaker 1: so I called the super today, and he said he was gonna fix the why.

57
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:12,482
Speaker 1: you know Some of the guy was coming to fix the washers today, so I'll do laundry when I get home tonight, but Here's the thing that happened.

58
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,384
Speaker 1: all right I bring the baskets back upstairs, and I just put them on the floor.

59
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:23,439
Speaker 1: cuz I'm gonna drag them back downstairs You know as soon as they're fixed or maybe to a laundry batter who knows usually I'll just leave my stuff down in the laundry room.

60
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,775
Speaker 0: if like all the washers are all being used yeah There's only two in my you know.

61
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,161
Speaker 1: so I bring it back upstairs anyway.

62
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,470
Speaker 1: You know I go to live in bed.

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,936
Speaker 1: I'm reading some stuff.

64
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,000
Speaker 1: You know I get up.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,888
Speaker 1: I go to the bathroom, and I notice that the The detergent bottle is upside out in the laundry basket, so I'm like oh, I better turn it upside right.

66
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:44,429
Speaker 1: you know It was not a complete disaster.

67
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,659
Speaker 1: Cuz it is a big thing of detergent.

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,487
Speaker 1: if the whole thing were to spill out.

69
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,129
Speaker 1: It would be doom.

70
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,766
Speaker 0: What's tough is what are you gonna clean that up with?

71
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:53,410
Speaker 0: I mean water?

72
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was basically like it was in the basket.

73
00:03:56,992 --> 00:04:00,832
Speaker 0: I spilled a bit of detergent in the trunk of that Sun fire I used to have.

74
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:03,784
Speaker 0: it was there until the day I got rid of that car.

75
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,295
Speaker 1: It is basically a millimeter You know detergent.

76
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,962
Speaker 1: It was only a little bit like less than a cup.

77
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:14,829
Speaker 1: You know, but you know I I basically had to take all the clothes that got detergent on them out.

78
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:22,370
Speaker 1: I put them in this I cleaned out the kitchen sink And then I pretty much watered them in the kitchen sink until they were detergent bliss.

79
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:33,278
Speaker 0: I don't know if we've just been doing gig nights so long that it's just like a job or what but That was perhaps the most mundane Anecdote we have ever had on this show.

80
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:33,900
Speaker 1: What's Monday?

81
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:34,784

00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,204
Speaker 0: usually we got things like and it exploded or a hobo came in.

85
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:47,809
Speaker 1: there was a hobo hanging out Hung up my show about living in the washer.

86
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:55,550
Speaker 1: I hung them all up to dry in the in the bathroom And then I put the laundry basket in the sink to clean the detergent out of it.

87
00:04:56,871 --> 00:05:00,730
Speaker 1: Still going yeah, and now I got to go home and see what the situation is.

119
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,979
Speaker 0: How long could that possibly have taken?

120
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,366
Speaker 1: it took a while dirt.

121
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,170
Speaker 1: it doesn't come out easy.

122
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it takes a lot of water.

123
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,490
Speaker 0: so you got any gaming news, I don't know.

124
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:16,055
Speaker 1: There's no gaming news But I do there is some gaming news.

125
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:17,178
Speaker 0: Pax West.

126
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,150
Speaker 0: Pax Prime is pretty much gonna be sold out any minute.

127
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:26,030
Speaker 0: So if you haven't bought your passes and you want to go why probably too late?

128
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,510
Speaker 1: Why didn't you buy the pass when they originally went on sale also?

129
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,490
Speaker 0: I'll point out if you bought your passes, but you haven't like done your travel arrangements yet.

130
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:38,925
Speaker 0: It's about the time when like doing flight arrangements around now is not so bad like that.

131
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,310
Speaker 0: That's perfectly reasonable.

132
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,515
Speaker 0: There's only one hotel left.

133
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:47,270
Speaker 0: cuz I just logged in to change something to my hotel reservation and there's one hotel left.

134
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why people wait so long.

135
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:51,562
Speaker 1: It's like it's a. you know, it's.

136
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:52,084
Speaker 1: so it's.

137
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,468
Speaker 1: it's what?

138
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,669
Speaker 1: two months or now Less than two months, right?

139
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:00,910
Speaker 1: This like, you know when they announce the dates for the convention?

140
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:05,363
Speaker 0: That's the day now like only if the hotel blocks are set up.

141
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:12,694
Speaker 1: you want but I'm just saying you buy the badge at least Right, you don't don't wait if you decided to go Decide to go and go.

142
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:15,986
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't actually decide to go until later.

143
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,230
Speaker 1: or they say you don't decide Yes, right away.

144
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,496
Speaker 1: The answer is no no.

145
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:23,837
Speaker 0: or they say I will go but and then there's some sort of Precondition that they can't decide.

146
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:28,019
Speaker 1: right if you have a precondition the answer is no you're not going to make it someone else is gonna make.

147
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:34,030
Speaker 0: what it really comes down to is and What I'm about to say all of you out there could easily just come back and say no room.

148
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,235
Speaker 0: This is just because you have a ton of money.

149
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:39,250
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't have the money to pre-register right away.

150
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,215
Speaker 0: What's the one kid in the forum?

151
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,486
Speaker 0: He was like, yeah, I don't get paid until Thursday.

152
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,928
Speaker 1: Oh crap Why don't you have a credit card?

153
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:46,595
Speaker 0: Not get into that.

154
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:51,314
Speaker 0: a lot of people just reading kind of the Otacon forms and everything They do like.

155
00:08:51,354 --> 00:09:00,363
Speaker 0: their primary concern is they don't have enough money to actually get the badge Early enough if you don't have up if you don't have that much money don't go.

156
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:01,347
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

157
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,169
Speaker 0: No, that's not it.

158
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:13,276
Speaker 0: You do have that much money because I used to be so poor I couldn't even really afford to eat an anime conventions and I and I with no money and basically nothing to my name Because I wanted it.

159
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:15,487
Speaker 0: I got that money for the Otacon badge.

160
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:18,688
Speaker 0: somehow Somehow man, I actually didn't pay rent that month.

161
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,450
Speaker 0: Literally, I didn't pay rent and I had money to go to Otacon as a result.

162
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,750
Speaker 1: The point is is that if you know don't listen to rim, right?

163
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:39,783
Speaker 1: You just listen to me the reasonable first university if you are if you're in a situation Where like 50 bucks which is usually like, you know, a pretty high price for a con badge Usually if you order them early enough, it's 30 40 ish, right?

164
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,350
Speaker 1: If 50 bucks is like an amount of money that you have to like, you know, tear yourself over like you're not confident.

165
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,896
Speaker 1: You know, you don't just have 50 bucks.

166
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,886
Speaker 1: You probably shouldn't be spending your money on a convention.

167
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,835
Speaker 1: That's probably an irresponsible This thing to do.

168
00:09:54,855 --> 00:10:01,369
Speaker 1: you should probably be using your money for food and rent Being you know several hundred dollars.

169
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:07,290
Speaker 0: But remember the old days when we were poor all like, you know people in the crew were various levels of porn.

170
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,910
Speaker 0: Is we'd go to Otacon and I remember we calculated if you stay in the Renaissance eight people can sleep in each room.

171
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:21,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cheap to go to a con if you crime eight people in and you basically eat nothing but garbage for the entire Weekend.

172
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:31,090
Speaker 1: the point is is that if you know if 50 bucks is is tight for you Conventions are not the thing you should be doing unless it happens to be like in your town or something like that.

173
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,444
Speaker 0: You know see I still say 50 bucks.

174
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,907
Speaker 0: You should forego more important things and go to the con if you want it.

175
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:37,550
Speaker 0: that badly.

176
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,270
Speaker 0: I wanted Otacon more than I wanted to continue to have an apartment.

177
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:51,829
Speaker 1: Eating well is and you know sleeping in a comfortable warm sheltered place is more important than going to a convention of which there Will be one for every year the rest of your life.

178
00:10:52,051 --> 00:11:07,570
Speaker 0: So Scott if you had to face some some sort of small period of homelessness at some point in your past But as a result would have had gone to all the paxes as opposed to just the ones we went to What if you would have had even homeless for a month while you're at RIT and then for that?

179
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,576
Speaker 0: You went to every pax up to that point.

180
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:10,017
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,522
Speaker 1: No, I would not be homeless now.

182
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,427
Speaker 0: No, why not understand someone's couch?

183
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,968
Speaker 1: Oh I was talking about sleeping out in the woods.

184
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:22,674
Speaker 0: That's more my side of the mountain Or Sleeping on the street.

185
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,585
Speaker 1: I mean if I'm on someone's couch and not really homeless Emma.

186
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,428
Speaker 0: So no gaming news.

187
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:26,870

00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,919
Speaker 1: No, I have a non gaming news.

189
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:30,827
Speaker 1: It is a huge news.

Speaker 1: You ready for this?

191
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:31,933
Speaker 1: I don't know.

192
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,969
Speaker 1: I I don't know why you didn't think this is your news.

193
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,742
Speaker 1: You obviously probably didn't go and look at any headlines.

194
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:37,485
Speaker 0: All right.

195
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,610
Speaker 0: I know a lot about news.

196
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,267
Speaker 0: You know part of my job is to know what's going on.

197
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:46,950
Speaker 1: All right This is a huge news because this is this is almost the level of partying news.

198
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,387
Speaker 1: It is almost level of DMCA struck down parting news.

199
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:50,889
Speaker 1: It is like one.

200
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,350
Speaker 0: Oh, you're talking about the FCC is one level under that news.

201
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,517
Speaker 0: You're talking about Massachusetts and the FCC thing.

202
00:11:56,698 --> 00:12:00,410
Speaker 1: FCC indecency rules struck down by appeals court.

203
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,136
Speaker 0: How about which?

204
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:02,004
Speaker 0: which courts got?

205
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:02,609
Speaker 0: is it my man?

206
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:04,960
Speaker 1: Let us go and see what.

207
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,470
Speaker 0: why is it the Ninth Circuit Court?

208
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,210
Speaker 1: Oh the Ninth Circuit Court actually did a dick move the other did the dick move on the on the first sale, right?

209
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,437
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm not talking about that.

210
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:15,060
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

211
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,998
Speaker 1: it doesn't say let's see US Circuit Court Judge Rosemary Pooler, I don't know who that is.

212
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,190
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is either she but I know that she's a US Circuit Judge.

213
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:33,307
Speaker 0: I remember it slashed out actually that an article that talked about that and the Massachusetts law that basically says Anything that could be harmful to minors and this vague description of it can't be on the internet if minors could ever see it.

214
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:40,677
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm well, anyway, basically They said hey, look, this is so vague, right?

215
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,702
Speaker 1: The big problem with it was the vagueness, right?

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:55,146
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's okay to do this but 75% or more of a nipple from a front on to 30-degree angle that we need.

217
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,550
Speaker 0: we need laws like that.

218
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so basically they were like look this is too vague side nipples.

219
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:09,241
Speaker 1: It has a. it is a let's see ruling that the policy was quote Unconstitutionally vague and created a quote chilling effect.

220
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:10,986
Speaker 0: Well, fuck chilling effect.

221
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,090
Speaker 1: I'm constantly vague.

222
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,710
Speaker 1: Get it out of here now, can we please get some other thing now, you know, this is great.

223
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,583
Speaker 1: I mean, how often is it that we actually get rid of one of these shitty laws?

224
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:20,668
Speaker 0: Well, well, well, it's gonna.

225
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:21,612
Speaker 1: well It's not even.

226
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:22,596
Speaker 1: it's not even a law.

227
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,404
Speaker 1: It's it's a. it's a regulation.

228
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:28,350
Speaker 1: It's gonna get appealed Of course, of course, but this was an appeal.

229
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,136
Speaker 1: So we'll see what they said.

230
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:32,143
Speaker 1: they said they they felt confident.

231
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,210
Speaker 1: the Supreme Court would you know?

232
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,393
Speaker 0: I'm confident.

233
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:39,609
Speaker 0: the Supreme Court is going to do whatever causes the least change.

234
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,626
Speaker 0: The Supreme Court has really been balls-less for the last like 15 years.

235
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty sad.

236
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:57,550
Speaker 1: It's like whenever anything if you look like lately whenever anything goes to the Supreme Court They'll basically like here's an opportunity to make a big, you know to make a big ruling that will set a good precedent.

237
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,170
Speaker 1: We're gonna do as little as possible.

238
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,073
Speaker 1: You know, there'd be a case about like, you know that some guy with like Miranda rights or whatever and they'll be like, yeah He's guilty.

239
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,225
Speaker 0: Okay, where's John Marshall when we need him?

240
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,230
Speaker 0: I don't know.

241
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,313
Speaker 0: I would give anything to bring John Marshall back from the dead and just throw him in the court me like hey fix everything He's dead.

242
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, we gotta get him back somehow.

243
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,441
Speaker 1: Well, we should just have John Marshall the second right.

244
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,736
Speaker 0: So I was hanging out in the.

245
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:22,398
Speaker 0: I guess we should.

246
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:26,755
Speaker 0: we'll have to hold out and see what happens with this because if it Makes it all the way and we win.

247
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,527
Speaker 0: I think it deserves an entire show the whole show.

248
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:45,910
Speaker 1: I think so The show will just be vuvuzela's and me going Your mom Hopefully, I mean, I hope this means that we can like they'll be swearing on TV tomorrow.

249
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,641
Speaker 1: Right, it's our park gonna say fuck in the next episode.

250
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,335
Speaker 0: I mean that Park isn't going on even right now I don't know.

251
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,410
Speaker 0: I don't think there's been an episode since the whole Muhammad thing.

252
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,334
Speaker 1: How did a?

253
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:54,856
Speaker 1: I don't know.

254
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:58,550
Speaker 0: by the way, if you guys didn't realize the the little geek nights guy, you know our logo.

255
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,649
Speaker 0: He is actually a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad of the Islam faith.

256
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,195
Speaker 1: You Just decided that right now.

257
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:10,430
Speaker 0: so I was in the the panel ops room.

258
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,329
Speaker 0: well, really the con ops room of kinetic on right and Scott was up dealing with some crisis and I'm working on something.

259
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,890
Speaker 0: and One of the ops people who's like monitoring all the computers.

260
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,863
Speaker 0: He's also got Firefox open because there's not you know fires to put out all the time.

261
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,569
Speaker 0: He says, huh?

262
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:30,106
Speaker 0: Civ 5 deluxe box a hundred bucks and they're like eight staffers in the room.

263
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,739
Speaker 0: We all same Simultaneously say shit.

264
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:42,810
Speaker 0: I already pre-ordered And then we all walk over and see and yeah sure enough There's a hundred dollar like Civ 5 awesome box and I didn't think I'd want it.

265
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,572
Speaker 0: But now that I'm looking at a picture of it this art deco kind of like aesthetic that it's got going I don't.

266
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,937
Speaker 1: I don't see this on steam.

267
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,776
Speaker 0: It's it's not on steam as far as I can tell not yet I don't even know if it's available to purchase.

268
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,863
Speaker 1: Well, if it's not the steam one, why do I want it?

269
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:11,669
Speaker 0: Basically, it's $100 and It comes with a big art book like a hardcover art book five pewter or some sort of metal like casts of Military units from the game and the soundtrack and I think that's all it up.

270
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:18,358
Speaker 0: I think there's a DVD behind-the-scenes thing too, and that's it All right big deal and it cost double.

271
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, not worth it.

272
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,130
Speaker 1: I just want the game is the same, right?

273
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game is the same.

274
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,384
Speaker 0: So what would have made the hundred dollar bonus pack worth it?

275
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,832
Speaker 0: You also get civilization six I don't know.

276
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:35,947
Speaker 0: I just want a wall size poster of Washington from the art in the game.

277
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,934
Speaker 1: Just print one out Wall size.

278
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,702
Speaker 0: I need a high-resolution copy.

279
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,730
Speaker 1: go down to any of those printing guys in the city.

280
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:49,501
Speaker 0: No, I need a high-resolution master or you can't just blow stuff up Scott You can just get it right out of the game Depends on how high-resolution it is.

281
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,910
Speaker 1: usually like civilization.

282
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:58,679
Speaker 1: Actually, the games have a tendency like the game itself obviously is an open source But usually like all this like the resources in the game.

283
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:06,210
Speaker 1: I'll be like odd audio or Python, you know Six foot tall poster, right?

284
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,712
Speaker 1: So you would get the 3d model out of the game Which would probably.

285
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:13,067
Speaker 1: you could probably load it into something and then you know, just render it out.

286
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:13,868
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

287
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,753
Speaker 1: It is hard to say.

288
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:23,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, but maybe if it imagine if it came with a six-foot poster of Like your choice five of the leaders from the game.

289
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,801
Speaker 0: I just love that Washington so much.

290
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,130
Speaker 0: I want him to tuck me in at night.

291
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:30,869
Speaker 0: I want him like glaring at me while I'm asleep keeping the British away.

292
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:54,390
Speaker 0: So things of the day I'll often cop out with the College Humor because they're you know Pretty much it's a. there's always something worth seeing every day on the College Humor videos But that's kind of lame, but you know smart listeners know to just go to College Humor and watch that stuff.

293
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,238
Speaker 0: So yeah, and I did.

294
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,519
Speaker 0: the secret secret is that when I need something on a cop-out I just go to BB spot because no one goes to.

295
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:12,759
Speaker 0: because he goes the old websites of a decade ago like Slashdot and BB spot and me because no one goes there and BB spot like within a given week There'll be one thing on BB spot.

296
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:13,824
Speaker 0: That wasn't everywhere else.

297
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,090
Speaker 1: I can't believe the site still updates.

298
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,389
Speaker 0: I know what kind of traffic who goes to BB spot you do, you know, it doesn't update me.

299
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:27,528
Speaker 0: pool Yeah, people's been definitely what I like to mean pool back in the day It was kind of a weird and eclectic thing, but I think that whole idea is obsolete.

300
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:38,228
Speaker 0: But anyway This is a is an odyssey through what happens when you look something up on Wikipedia and You start following the links on Wikipedia to other links.

301
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:40,377
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna tell you a short story.

302
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,789
Speaker 0: It's the the melancholy of Peter Puck.

303
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,596
Speaker 0: Okay, you know who Peter Puck is?

304
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:47,901
Speaker 1: His last name is Puck.

305
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:48,463
Speaker 1: That's pretty.

306
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,189
Speaker 0: no his last name is not Puck.

307
00:18:51,431 --> 00:19:06,973
Speaker 0: His name is Peter Pocklington, okay, so I'll preface this by saying there's only one person one name on The Stanley Cup, you know Lord Stanley's Cup that was after the fact X'd out.

308
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,639
Speaker 0: there are X's engraved over.

309
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,622
Speaker 1: why don't they just?

310
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,890
Speaker 1: why don't they just sort of you know smooth it?

311
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,955
Speaker 0: I really can't do that.

312
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:13,599
Speaker 1: Why not?

313
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,370
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into the details.

314
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:16,655
Speaker 0: They can't do that.

315
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:20,250
Speaker 1: Well, you may get some heat and you melt this little bit of silver.

316
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're ruining the Stanley Cup and then you polish it and you know get some sanding in there.

317
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,372
Speaker 0: You know anything about silversmithing buffing Uh-huh.

318
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:32,339
Speaker 0: Now it's engraved pretty deeply.

319
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,523
Speaker 0: Have you seen the Stanley Cup?

320
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,186
Speaker 1: Give me a Dremel.

321
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:34,888
Speaker 1: I'll take it out.

322
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:41,650
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, there is an X engraved into every single letter of one and only one name.

323
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:45,250
Speaker 1: So they put an X over each letter instead of just a line through the whole thing.

324
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,197
Speaker 0: Yes, they really wanted to get rid of it.

325
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:52,090
Speaker 0: Okay, and There are like 12 or 13 other like tiny typos all over it.

326
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,037
Speaker 0: There's a whole history of like all the different things.

327
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,462
Speaker 1: They just fucking fix it.

328
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,590
Speaker 1: Well, I don't make a mistake in the first play.

329
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:58,612
Speaker 0: well There's.

330
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:06,744
Speaker 0: it's not easy to get rid of these mistakes and also since they've been there and since the replicas are replicas of it You know, it's like kind of like the history like this is this mistake.

331
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,790
Speaker 0: This is when this happened.

332
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:14,696
Speaker 1: This is this guy and I'm sure if a guy makes a mistake to get a new fucking jeweler I mean, you know actually there's been a lot of.

333
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:21,488
Speaker 0: there's whole stories about like how they couldn't afford to get another band Once they filled up the first band back in the day.

334
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:25,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, the story of the Stanley Cup is crazy.

335
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,142
Speaker 1: They have enough money.

336
00:20:26,162 --> 00:20:27,325
Speaker 0: No, they didn't.

337
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,390
Speaker 0: and you know what when there was the strike.

338
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,799
Speaker 0: There's actually a space where they engraved.

339
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,316
Speaker 0: no one won because there was the strike No one played hockey.

340
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,210
Speaker 1: I thought that they just sort of didn't put anything.

341
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,041
Speaker 0: No, there's this hole because they write every time they add.

342
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,811
Speaker 1: if they add a new one they add they write the year on it Right.

343
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it should just be like, you know, 2000 whatever and then if it's the there's no.

344
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:52,474
Speaker 0: actually says You know there was nothing this year like they made a point of being like look you assholes Look what you did.

345
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:53,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, they cuz remember.

346
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,584
Speaker 0: it's kind of a record.

347
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,830
Speaker 0: It's like an engraving.

348
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,350
Speaker 0: This is the record of the Lords of the realm or at least the Lords of hockey.

349
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,585
Speaker 1: So why doesn't you just have my name every time like you can't even skate.

350
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,190
Speaker 1: I'm the Lord of the realm though.

351
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,123
Speaker 0: So if you look at the names on the Stanley Cup, there is crazy stuff.

352
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:23,250
Speaker 0: They're like, they're the first woman My name is 8 equals equals equals D. Marguerite Norris was the president of the Detroit Red Wings in 1954 and 1955 and they happen to win the Stanley Cup both those years.

353
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:27,790
Speaker 0: So she was the first woman to have her name on the Stanley Cup and she got it on there twice.

354
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,602
Speaker 0: One guy has his name on it 17 times.

355
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,049
Speaker 0: Did he win 17 John Beliveau?

356
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,097
Speaker 1: He just kept switching the teams that won.

357
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:44,743
Speaker 0: no ten is a player and then seven is management Trickery and also a Vladimir Konstantinov also on the Red Wings.

358
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:52,630
Speaker 0: if you read through a Surprising number of the like weird stories about the Stanley Cup our destroyed Red Wings, you know six and everything.

359
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean an original six teams are going to have.

360
00:21:55,485 --> 00:22:01,148
Speaker 1: you know the predominant You know coverage on the Stanley Cup because other teams weren't even around on the early rings.

362
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,972
Speaker 0: they're like there's engravings inside the bowl of the original cup because ran out of room and people didn't know what To do.

363
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:18,371
Speaker 0: one team that won a whole bunch of times never engraved their name on it Konstantinov who was on the Troy Red Wings Red Wings and they won the Stanley Cup after the huge drought in 1997.

364
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:32,010
Speaker 0: He didn't play the full 40 games because he was horribly crippled in a limousine accident during the season Mm-hmm, but they went on to win and the NHL basically said while he didn't play 40 games He is going to get a special dispensation and his name is on there.

365
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,533
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah and brought him out in a wheelchair and he held it up and it was kind of a. it was a really emotional moment For the team.

00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:08,697
Speaker 0: No clue.

397
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:11,205
Speaker 0: It was a pretty important labor prop.

398
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:11,606
Speaker 0: Basically.

399
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:12,550
Speaker 0: He was on the bad team.

400
00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:18,990
Speaker 0: Okay, but all this aside Peter Pocklington's name is not on Lord Stanley's Cup.

401
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:26,540
Speaker 0: His father's name basil Pocklington Mysteriously appeared on the Stanley Cup.

402
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,749
Speaker 0: How good it when he you know, his name was supposed to.

403
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,868
Speaker 0: you know He was supposed to go in the cup and he submitted the list.

404
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:41,006
Speaker 0: Well, so he was the manager of a team and the team submitted the list And he just put his dad's name in with all the players and no one noticed.

405
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:41,669
Speaker 0: and it was there.

406
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:49,443
Speaker 0: When the NHL find I found out they were like, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no exes exes for you.

407
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:53,039
Speaker 1: So wait, so they caught it before.

408
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,642
Speaker 1: it's the way they.

409
00:24:53,943 --> 00:24:55,530
Speaker 1: they caught it when it was already engraved.

410
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,052
Speaker 0: It was done.

411
00:24:56,393 --> 00:25:01,629
Speaker 0: So they went back and they engraved exes into every letter of basil Pocklington's name.

412
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:05,502
Speaker 0: He's the only person ever redacted from the Stanley Cup.

413
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:07,709
Speaker 1: So then his name was Peter Pocklington.

414
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,537
Speaker 1: Yes He never got his name on.

415
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:10,481
Speaker 0: no, he was just.

416
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:11,988
Speaker 0: he was the one who tricked any lie.

417
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,183
Speaker 0: He was like, I don't know how my dad's name got on the list.

418
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,570
Speaker 0: The engraver must have made a mistake.

419
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:17,636
Speaker 1: So they just never.

420
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,850
Speaker 1: so he's got his dad's name on there.

421
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,082
Speaker 1: His dad's name got ex off, but then they didn't put his name on there either.

422
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:23,986
Speaker 0: His name's on there.

423
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:24,548
Speaker 1: Oh, is it?

424
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:27,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay He should have been on there.

00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:29,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you don't want you don't want him on there.

426
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,479
Speaker 1: I figured they could have kept him off cuz he was a jerk.

427
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's also beloved at least according to Wikipedia.

428
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,973
Speaker 0: Right Beloved by who?

436
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:06,170
Speaker 1: My thing today is perhaps the I don't know the most divisive video ever posted on the Internet's.

437
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,040
Speaker 0: Had a tax kid, but it no.

438
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,429
Speaker 1: but it is so epic.

439
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:16,770
Speaker 1: Right, they're like, I don't even know what to make of it, but it's got eight and a half million views on YouTube.

440
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,758
Speaker 1: I think it needs Yakujo.

441
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:19,605
Speaker 1: No, I know it doesn't.

442
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,435
Speaker 1: it has 345,000 views.

443
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:24,081
Speaker 1: it needs eight and a half million views.

444
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:24,403
Speaker 0: Wait.

445
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:26,170
Speaker 0: So where did you just make that number up?

446
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:29,433
Speaker 1: No, I was looking at the wrong video, uh-huh So what video has?

447
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,456
Speaker 0: eight and a half million views.

448
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:34,630
Speaker 1: just the actual video for I will survive the song.

449
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,036
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, but this is a video.

450
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:39,162
Speaker 1: obviously using the song I will survive.

451
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:50,235
Speaker 1: but in the video there is a man his daughter and his three grandchildren and they are dancing and The I will survive.

452
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,530
Speaker 1: song is playing and they dance in front of many locations.

453
00:26:53,530 --> 00:27:04,144
Speaker 1: It's one of those, you know multiple location videos like, you know, when Luke Burge does the juggling in many locations I saw or when the guy was dancing in multiple locations around the world.

454
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,127
Speaker 0: nothing controversial.

455
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:05,990
Speaker 0: Nothing interesting.

456
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:14,670
Speaker 1: all of the locations are either Nazi concentration camps or you know memorials or other such places.

457
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:19,003
Speaker 1: Alright, but the man is a holocaust survivor.

458
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:21,470
Speaker 1: So it's like whoa, so epic win.

459
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:22,754
Speaker 0: What else can I say?

460
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:27,830
Speaker 1: but half the internet is like, I don't know if this is offensive or awesome.

461
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:30,436
Speaker 1: They can't tell.

462
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:33,589
Speaker 0: I don't know about half the internet cuz I had no idea this was going on.

463
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's pretty much what it is.

464
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,142
Speaker 0: So so apparently 350,000 people have their opinions on this.

465
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:42,364
Speaker 1: Yeah so there's gonna be.

466
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait, is it the original song or the cake version?

467
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:48,868
Speaker 1: No, it's it's the original.

468
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:51,885
Speaker 0: Okay All right now Scott's playing it.

469
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:55,037
Speaker 0: So the meta moment.

470
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:57,706
Speaker 0: if you can tell we're kind of dragging here, you know, we're.

471
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:58,990
Speaker 0: we just got back from kinetic on.

472
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,493
Speaker 0: We're a little.

473
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:00,944
Speaker 0: we're a little wrecked.

474
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:04,209
Speaker 0: I'm still right This is definitely cut one of those crab people shows.

475
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:08,830
Speaker 0: But the meta moment the book club book is the lies of Locke Lamora, which was also recommended to be ready.

476
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,533
Speaker 0: I think it's Lamora.

477
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:10,356
Speaker 1: I think it's Lamora.

478
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,610
Speaker 0: I don't Lamora sounds because it flows with the lies of Locke Lamora.

479
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:15,119
Speaker 1: I think it's lies of like Lamora.

480
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:15,783
Speaker 1: sound is better.

481
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:16,850
Speaker 1: I'm better in the mouth.

482
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:20,522
Speaker 0: It's weird because he doesn't really lie that much except in specific cons.

483
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,750
Speaker 0: He's actually a hundred percent truthful all the rest of the time.

484
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:23,909
Speaker 1: That's why it's awesome.

485
00:28:26,113 --> 00:28:29,902
Speaker 0: We're going to be at the penny arcade expo Labor Day weekend 2010 in Seattle.

486
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:36,770
Speaker 0: We cannot announce all of the programming we're doing because it is not better than we can announce any program.

487
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can't because now we've officially two of our panels are already set.

488
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:47,319
Speaker 0: We are going to be doing a panel called egregiously unrealized potential Right, which I think you can get.

489
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,370
Speaker 0: that I call that x-rays or the panel.

490
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,210
Speaker 0: Okay, and we're doing game mechanics and mechanism design.

491
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:58,492
Speaker 0: basically every panel we've done up at this point has in gaming has been kind of a like.

492
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:06,266
Speaker 0: we talked about some topic and we always come back to like game mechanics and Mechanism design and every time all the feedback we get basically comes down to yep.

493
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,270
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

494
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,635
Speaker 0: But could you go into more detail?

495
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:12,169
Speaker 0: or we're just gonna go hardcore and see if packs can handle it.

496
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:13,795
Speaker 1: We'll find out.

497
00:29:14,437 --> 00:29:21,901
Speaker 0: and other programming is of course TBA, but we got one or two more things in the hopper alrighty packs East.

498
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:24,493
Speaker 0: we're gonna be doing stuff at anime.

499
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:28,304
Speaker 0: Boston New York Comic Con New York anime festival and the burning wheel.

Speaker 1: It's on Kotaku.

511
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:00,116
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

512
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,204
Speaker 1: It seems pretty interesting as ten bucks is downtown.

513
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:03,826
Speaker 1: Why not?

514
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,983
Speaker 1: I Think that's enough meta.

515
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:07,232
Speaker 0: Yes I think.

516
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,124
Speaker 0: so energy levels are low.

517
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:14,829
Speaker 0: We got to bring him back up uh-huh, so Why everybody old man attack?

518
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,861
Speaker 1: I am giving the secret but you still try old man attack gonna do a show on high space.

519
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,184
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

520
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,556
Speaker 0: I Wonder if it's updated.

521
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:29,114
Speaker 1: it's it's not updated but it still exists All right.

522
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,282
Speaker 1: This was Scott's idea.

523
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:32,515
Speaker 1: Oh So you just like I say anything.

524
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,590
Speaker 1: no, no, no, no, no, but basically I was like I went through it.

525
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,950
Speaker 1: I'm like why do we need something to do a show on that?

526
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,818
Speaker 1: We've played and we haven't played anything recently.

527
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,369
Speaker 1: So it's got to be you know, something old.

528
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:45,063
Speaker 0: I've been playing Counter-Strike almost every day.

529
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,249
Speaker 1: We've done a show on that though.

530
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:48,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it has to be something we haven't done a show on.

531
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:54,679
Speaker 1: actually I was playing on militia and I bought a new board game But rim hasn't played II and I only played the solitaire version of it.

532
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,545
Speaker 0: So basically Yahtzee.

533
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,552
Speaker 1: You don't know that you it's good Trust me.

534
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,266
Speaker 0: I know but I read the board game geek reviews and people like yeah, it's Yahtzee.

535
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:01,709
Speaker 0: Where's then?

536
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:03,674
Speaker 1: It doesn't wear thin.

537
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,961
Speaker 1: Oh, it was pretty good even by myself.

538
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:06,463
Speaker 1: It was fun.

539
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:06,884
Speaker 1: We'll see.

540
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:11,075
Speaker 1: anyway the Yah, right.

541
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:17,348
Speaker 1: So I'm like, hey, what about like the Absolute basics like have we done a show on fucking like, you know, Zelda 1?

542
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:20,723
Speaker 1: and sure enough We had done a show on four swords and that is it.

543
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,612
Speaker 1: We had never done a show on Zelda 1.

544
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:32,830
Speaker 0: So what's interesting is that alright finally, you know geek knives We're gonna have this show on the Legend of Zelda straight up and we start talking about the game More than halfway through this show.

545
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:34,673
Speaker 1: That's fine.

546
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,008
Speaker 0: I'm surprised you're all even still listening at this point or you're just anticipating.

547
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:38,390
Speaker 0: you're waiting.

548
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:38,853
Speaker 0: You want us?

549
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:39,800
Speaker 0: What are you gonna say?

550
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,009
Speaker 0: get that you get the Triforce?

551
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,530
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you saw that you get it twice.

552
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,017
Speaker 1: Anyway, no, so I got you know.

553
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,743
Speaker 1: thing is Zelda 1 like?

554
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:52,790
Speaker 1: I still think it is the best Zelda.

555
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:56,989
Speaker 0: No one else does but I I still think Zelda 2 is well.

556
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,017
Speaker 1: No one agrees.

557
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:59,789
Speaker 1: even less people agree with you than agree with me.

558
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:03,926
Speaker 0: Of course They're in different genres like Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 fought like they were.

559
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:14,424
Speaker 0: they were different Genres from the control and from a lot of aspects, but in many ways They're also the same genre of you know Explore this world get the Triforce pieces or something of that ilk.

560
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:17,535
Speaker 0: go save the princess in some manner Bosses along the way.

561
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:23,570
Speaker 1: most people will say that ocarina of time or link to the past is the best one But I think they're almost they're in a different genre.

562
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,353
Speaker 0: They were.

563
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:27,826
Speaker 0: they opened up this whole different idea of what a Zelda game would be.

564
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:42,650
Speaker 1: hmm I think that what's makes all the one simultaneously great but also so painful for anyone who's never played it before to play it now is that it really Doesn't give you like the helping hints so much as are you kidding?

565
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,688
Speaker 0: It as a full-color instruction book with a comic in it.

566
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:55,302
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I mean most people who play it today are not gonna get those things Right, like when I got Zelda 1. first of all I had some extra knowledge because I had watched other people play on their Nintendo's.

567
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:56,627
Speaker 1: so I had that hid.

568
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,530
Speaker 1: I had those secrets.

569
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:58,830
Speaker 0: I started from nothing.

570
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:03,380
Speaker 1: I also had you know It came with a map of like the beginning area of the game.

571
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,344
Speaker 1: that helped me out a lot.

572
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:08,641
Speaker 1: it came with you know all this stuff and Came with an instruction book.

573
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:09,750
Speaker 1: that it all sorts of information.

574
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,570
Speaker 0: You might not recall this but remember the beauty of the Legend of Zelda.

575
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:19,449
Speaker 0: The map that came in the instruction book showed you where you start and it showed you where level 1 is.

576
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,535
Speaker 1: Right, it even shows you.

577
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:21,600
Speaker 1: I think we're level 2 and 3 were.

578
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:28,232
Speaker 0: it shows you where level 2 is But it does not show you how to get to the spot to get into level 2.

579
00:33:28,232 --> 00:33:30,142
Speaker 0: So you have to go around outside of this map.

580
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:30,806
Speaker 0: They've given you.

581
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:32,394
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean check that out.

582
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:37,783
Speaker 0: That is some good like give the kid a hint but then make oh no No, no, that's the map that's in the book.

583
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:38,910
Speaker 0: That's what I said.

584
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:44,690
Speaker 1: Mine I had that - mine came with a separate map that was on its own piece of paper.

585
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:49,707
Speaker 1: That was quite impressive and it showed you like the location of certain things like the.

586
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:51,738
Speaker 1: the power bracelet I think was even on that map.

587
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,569
Speaker 1: It was a very high quality map.

588
00:33:53,831 --> 00:34:00,702
Speaker 0: But what people also forget is that if you look at the story in the beginning of the book There is in fact a map of the entire game right there.

589
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:05,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is not a Detailed enough map but it is a. it is a high quality map.

590
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,553
Speaker 0: Actually them if you look at it the map is detailed enough to figure out how to get to anywhere in the game Really?

591
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:13,610
Speaker 0: It even shows you where that secret shit is way off on the right.

592
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:21,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is right is that if you look at a modern Zelda game say for example Twilight Princess right you get the hookshot.

593
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:26,030
Speaker 1: every place that you can use the hookshot like clearly has like a hookshot thing.

594
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,040
Speaker 1: It's like here you can hookshot right to this spot.

595
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,884
Speaker 1: It's like they don't make.

596
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:30,070
Speaker 1: keep any secrets about it.

597
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,429
Speaker 1: You know, it's not like you have to experiment hookshotting.

598
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:36,329
Speaker 1: You just have to look around and you'll be able to see any hookshot able spots.

599
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,295
Speaker 1: You know It's the same thing with the bow and arrow like.

600
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:41,190
Speaker 1: there'll be a fucking eyeball if you can shoot it with the bow and arrow.

601
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,257
Speaker 1: In Zelda 1.

602
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:47,813
Speaker 1: I mean occasionally they might put some cracks in the walls where you could bomb But that they.

603
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:51,250
Speaker 1: there are plenty of places you could bomb that look just like every other wall.

604
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,221
Speaker 1: They didn't stand out in any way shape or form.

605
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,750
Speaker 0: you don't forget the second quest.

606
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:56,621
Speaker 0: We could also just walk through certain walls.

607
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just walk right through the wall.

608
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,164
Speaker 1: So you have to try to walk through every single wall that you come across.

609
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:02,310
Speaker 1: that isn't already.

610
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:07,750
Speaker 1: You know that walks into the black part of the map just to make sure that there isn't like a secret room back.

611
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:13,578
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of it is that the for us at least for the generation that played Zelda 1 There was nothing to compete with it.

612
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,710
Speaker 0: I mean every other game like there was no game.

613
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,499
Speaker 0: There's nothing even close to this and it really you know Even the creator like it was.

614
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:25,350
Speaker 0: the idea was you're exploring like though like you're in a kit You're a kid in the woods and you're exploring with a ton of free time.

615
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:25,671
Speaker 1: This

616
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:48,010
Speaker 0: is a game to explore but while it seems so like opaque and obtuse to a lot of modern gamers This instruction book like you read it and it gives you all these kind of Oblique hints like it doesn't tell you straight up where to find the bosses and all the dungeons But it names all the dungeons and it shows you the shape of like a monster or a thing.

617
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:53,330
Speaker 0: And if you explore these dungeons you start to realize that they all follow the shapes intuitively.

618
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:59,689
Speaker 1: yeah, most of the dungeons like the bad guy is in the nose or the eyeball.

619
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,421
Speaker 0: or Do you remember the names of all the dungeons?

620
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,250
Speaker 1: I don't remember the names of the dungeons.

621
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,198
Speaker 1: I could say the names of the bosses all of them.

622
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:06,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

623
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,683
Speaker 0: All right, let's go.

624
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:10,732
Speaker 1: All right level one Aquamentous.

625
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,443
Speaker 1: quite level two dodongo.

626
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,310
Speaker 1: All right level three.

627
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,474
Speaker 1: Oh god, I know it.

628
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:19,998
Speaker 0: You're forgetting Mon, Hanla.

629
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:20,419
Speaker 1: Yes.

630
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:21,121
Speaker 1: Damn it.

631
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,084
Speaker 1: I knew it, but I didn't.

632
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:22,826
Speaker 1: I didn't know it.

633
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:31,691
Speaker 1: No anyway Level four is the hydra and his name is Gula.

634
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,055
Speaker 1: Oh glia.

635
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,521
Speaker 1: Yeah level five is dig dagger.

636
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:38,770
Speaker 1: Yeah level six is gliok with an extra.

637
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,820
Speaker 1: Level seven is Aquamentous again.

638
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,246
Speaker 0: Oh shit level eight.

639
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:44,627
Speaker 1: No.

640
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:45,974
Speaker 1: No level six I got it wrong.

641
00:36:45,994 --> 00:36:49,170
Speaker 1: level six does have a gliok with an extra head, but the boss is red Goma.

642
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:50,473
Speaker 1: I was wrong.

643
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:51,235
Speaker 0: I go.

644
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:55,445
Speaker 1: level eight also has a gliok with an extra head and his blue Goma.

645
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,450
Speaker 1: and then level nine has Ganon.

646
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,258
Speaker 0: Don't remember the names of dungeons do ya know?

647
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:01,619
Speaker 1: not at all.

648
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,264
Speaker 0: Eagle moon manji snake lizard dragon demon Lion, and then just death mountain.

649
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:08,410
Speaker 1: Well, I could have told you death mountain.

650
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, but note the death mountain.

651
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:15,030
Speaker 0: the skull is shaped like the rock that you have to bomb.

652
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:16,838
Speaker 1: Not really.

653
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,509
Speaker 1: I mean kind of not so much.

654
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:24,520
Speaker 0: I'm on the instruction book and All these little hints that some of them weren't even relevant to us as kids.

655
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,857
Speaker 0: like Paul's voice it says in this instruction book a ghost With big ears and a weak point.

656
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:33,790
Speaker 0: He hates loud noise and I remember as a kid There's a million of them in the room try to whistle.

657
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:37,150
Speaker 0: I tried the whistle and do anything and the sword didn't hurt him.

658
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:43,446
Speaker 1: But the arrows hurt him just fine because the Famicom had microphones in the controller Yeah, but the NES did not and they didn't change it.

659
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:47,145
Speaker 1: So yeah, you would shoot the arrow and it would.

660
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:48,090
Speaker 1: that was the way to kill him.

661
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:58,010
Speaker 0: But there's so many just like hints and things to where a kid, you know You read this book and puzzle over it and the book was really part of the game And a lot of people kind of forget the instruction book.

662
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:05,570
Speaker 0: This game was sort of a puzzle and the book and the game together Guided a young kid's mind through this exploration.

663
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:13,330
Speaker 1: I think that what really makes the game is just that you know when you're still Discovering it when you're still a kid and you've never played it before and you don't know the map.

664
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:15,537
Speaker 1: Everything just feels so mystical.

665
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,564
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god the graveyard.

666
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:18,166
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

667
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:19,370
Speaker 1: There's a fucking oh my god.

668
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,030
Speaker 1: Look at this and it's all like woo the graveyard.

669
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,043
Speaker 0: That whole upper left area of the map scares me to this day a little bit.

670
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know you shouldn't be up there.

671
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,608
Speaker 0: There's nothing over there.

672
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:34,473
Speaker 1: It's like you uncover all these things and it's so like it just has this feel to it Like you're.

673
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:36,470
Speaker 1: you have uncovered something mystical.

674
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:38,799
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is, but it just did.

675
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:41,747
Speaker 1: no other game has really pulled that off so much You know.

676
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:48,332
Speaker 1: I think it's a combination of like just the way The areas are presented to you and the way you're well Very like.

677
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,975
Speaker 0: every region kind of has this feeling.

678
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:52,120
Speaker 0: every dungeon has its own like aesthetic to it.

679
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like there's no one.

680
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,142
Speaker 1: there's no one really out there.

681
00:38:56,202 --> 00:39:03,490
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like you can talk to people But you know old man and old woman, but that's pretty much it and they don't really help you that much.

682
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:03,912
Speaker 1: They're.

683
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:07,210
Speaker 1: so, you know, they speak in sort of rhymes and stuff.

684
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:12,548
Speaker 1: It's almost like a more like a labyrinth II kind of thing than a Metroid kind of thing, you know, I'll buy something.

685
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:12,789
Speaker 0: Will ya?

686
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,065
Speaker 1: All right, that's not old man or old woman.

687
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:20,076
Speaker 1: That's fat guy merchant fat merchant Yeah, and then it's like you.

688
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:25,137
Speaker 1: just you sort of like discover these things that like the game didn't tell you about them But you discover them on your own.

689
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,790
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you just find this power bracelet out there.

690
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,075
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit power brace.

691
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:30,622
Speaker 0: Let's remember there's never again.

692
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,590
Speaker 1: You find like the secret shortcuts under the rocks.

693
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:33,294
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit.

694
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:34,442
Speaker 1: The game didn't tell me about this.

695
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:35,790
Speaker 0: You just discovered the whole game.

696
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:40,010
Speaker 0: You're playing around keep seeing these like docks and you try to walk on them and nothing happens.

697
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:45,370
Speaker 0: And then later in the game you find a raft and you run around all these docks and there's crazy shit out there.

698
00:39:45,712 --> 00:39:48,030
Speaker 1: Like you go to the east and there's just a hard container sitting out there.

699
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,947
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, you're looking at you're trying to hit it with the boomerang.

700
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:54,540
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's just crazy stuff.

701
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,550
Speaker 1: and like you can just walk through walls and there's a hundred coins and all these.

702
00:39:57,751 --> 00:40:02,690
Speaker 1: There's just so many things in the game that you'll stumble across that the game didn't tell you about.

703
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:04,750
Speaker 1: So you feel like you really discovered something?

704
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:13,704
Speaker 1: It's not like Metroid where you found a secret that you sort of had to find or they there's like, you know Basically big glaring shiny things that say secret here.

705
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:14,949
Speaker 1: You need an item to get it.

706
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,270
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you actually discovering like these completely hidden things.

707
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,670
Speaker 1: It's like the same kind of feeling you get if you get the minus world and Mario Brothers.

708
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:27,169
Speaker 1: It's like that's the feeling you get all over Zelda 1 no matter where you are.

709
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:28,550
Speaker 1: It's like you get a red ring.

710
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,710
Speaker 1: They didn't even tell you there was a fucking red ring, but you get it and you turn red.

711
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:33,570
Speaker 1: It's like holy shit.

712
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:36,440
Speaker 1: He turned red and now things barely hurt.

713
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,266
Speaker 0: me though little known secret.

714
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,938
Speaker 0: you get the red ring And that's why Zelda has a red dress on.

715
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,547
Speaker 0: she'll be whatever color your ring is.

716
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:47,625
Speaker 1: Yep Well, whatever color link is she'll match you right because there's only so many.

717
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,950
Speaker 0: you must have a green ring on.

718
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,916
Speaker 0: There's only have a red sword.

719
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:54,890
Speaker 1: There's only so many colors in the in the palette, you know, it's kind of had an argument.

720
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:01,459
Speaker 0: this is one of the epic arguments of the front row crew hanging out in colony back at RIT and You swore it was the wooden sword.

721
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,510
Speaker 0: I did and I knew it was the red sword.

722
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,018
Speaker 0: No, you didn't and we argued forever.

723
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:14,610
Speaker 0: and finally I realized no we're arguing the whole front row crews there Yelling and we're kind of splitting the two camps red sword versus wood sword.

724
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:20,250
Speaker 0: And finally, I remembered that I had the instruction book and I got it and I opened up to the page.

725
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,680
Speaker 1: Could I just check the internet - and uh back then?

726
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,990
Speaker 0: Yeah as we could have I think we poked around.

727
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,953
Speaker 0: We didn't see anything obvious.

728
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:26,555
Speaker 0: Thanks.

729
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,101
Speaker 0: We didn't trust the game facts.

730
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,927
Speaker 0: We needed like a definitive source.

731
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,881
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And it's not the master sword.

732
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:33,966
Speaker 0: It's the magical sword.

733
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:39,225
Speaker 1: I knew that Yep, and then the white sword which is just the white sword is basically the master.

734
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:40,730
Speaker 0: So and then it's just sword.

735
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,177
Speaker 1: Well, it's sword white sword magical.

736
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:44,438
Speaker 0: Yes.

737
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,121
Speaker 0: I've never.

738
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:54,648
Speaker 1: that was one of the most anticlimactic moments of my life You know, what always bothered me is how the magic sword It always it looked like a diagonal kind of thing right in the picture up top.

739
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:58,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when you actually used it in game, it just stab straight.

740
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:02,265
Speaker 1: It didn't stab in any particular, you know, it wasn't diagonal like it was.

741
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:02,486
Speaker 1: it was.

742
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,539
Speaker 0: it was longer Made it look cool and mystical.

743
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,136
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever it was weird but yeah Zelda 1 is is totally sweet.

744
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:16,616
Speaker 1: and then it has a fucking second quest that the game doesn't tell you about and where everything is Totally fucked up and even more mystical.

745
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:17,759
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

746
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,485
Speaker 0: The second quest is actually really fun.

747
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:25,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I got about One tenth of the way through Zelda see before I gave up.

748
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:26,187
Speaker 1: Oh fuck Zelda.

749
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,358
Speaker 1: see, you know I never beat the second question.

750
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:31,698
Speaker 1: I was a kid because we could never find level 8 and You know what.

751
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,530
Speaker 0: now I wrote a letter to Nintendo power.

752
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:37,890
Speaker 1: Now that I know we're level 8 in the second quest is it's bullshit?

753
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,990
Speaker 0: I beat the second quest legitimately.

754
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:47,112
Speaker 0: The only thing that I didn't figure out was I actually couldn't find the fucking silver arrows in death mountain Really?

755
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:50,061
Speaker 0: So I sent a letter to Nintendo power.

756
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,024
Speaker 1: Did you find level 8?

757
00:42:51,024 --> 00:42:56,098
Speaker 1: level 8 is like there's no way you could find Nerd, I'd spent a lot of time playing.

758
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:57,263
Speaker 1: There was no way.

759
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:59,533
Speaker 1: level 8 is just oh my gosh The scariest.

760
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:03,251
Speaker 1: I found level 9 but I couldn't get in cuz I didn't have the fragment from level 8.

761
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:07,063
Speaker 0: You'd be easy to find later dungeons and hard to find earlier dungeons.

762
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,350
Speaker 0: You go into later dungeons whiz robes ever that everywhere.

763
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,541
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

764
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:15,903
Speaker 1: Oh good But you go into a dungeon just like 10 mummies and you don't have anything.

765
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:17,768
Speaker 1: give dough to stab gibdo like 20 times.

766
00:43:19,274 --> 00:43:20,961
Speaker 0: I always loved the gibdo who's got the key and him.

767
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:25,782
Speaker 0: you're like, all right, but the bombs in him Yeah, suicide bombing mommy gibdo except he didn't light it.

768
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,088
Speaker 1: I know you put him in.

769
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:27,590
Speaker 0: he wrapped up.

770
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,960
Speaker 1: She should have lit it and jumped and just followed you.

771
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,196
Speaker 1: really if any bad guy actually good AI and followed you and had a Bomb in them watch out.

772
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,060
Speaker 0: I don't know.

773
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,365
Speaker 0: some of the the Knights were.

774
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,530
Speaker 0: the dark nights were a little hard to get.

775
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:46,841
Speaker 0: The whistle felt so like powerful and the magic wand like.

776
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:51,316
Speaker 0: I was so crazy excited to get it till I realized it was basically Just a white sword.

777
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:56,343
Speaker 0: Well, no what the magical wand allows you to do is a white sword And once you get the book it says the fire.

778
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:59,818
Speaker 1: that's right It sets fire but it's like you won't use yours.

779
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:09,669
Speaker 1: if you wanted projectiles without having to be fightful health Yeah, if these arrows which cost money, but if you have the magic wand, you can have a projectile at any time.

780
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,845
Speaker 0: It's only a white sword projectile.

781
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:18,909
Speaker 1: That's true But it doesn't matter because you know It's still a projectile when you don't have full health and doesn't cost money like the arrow does.

782
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:20,436
Speaker 1: So that's a good deal.

783
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,730
Speaker 0: I just always laugh as a kid about pee hats.

784
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:32,063
Speaker 1: You know painting for the door charge Laughed at that.

785
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,688
Speaker 1: painting for the door pair.

786
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:35,293
Speaker 0: Don't laugh at that cuz you're a kid.

787
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:36,658
Speaker 0: I got my like 300 rupees.

788
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,100
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy that white ringer in the white ring the blue ring that door charge.

789
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,320
Speaker 1: I swear to God know cuz he had a system as soon as you had enough for the blue ring you buy it.

790
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,991
Speaker 1: You don't stop anywhere cuz you know, the door charge might be lurking.

791
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:49,958
Speaker 0: I didn't know I'd never run into it.

792
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:51,684
Speaker 0: Think about it.

793
00:44:51,704 --> 00:44:52,127
Speaker 0: You don't know.

794
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,460
Speaker 0: there's no way for you to know if you've never found it.

795
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:57,720
Speaker 1: I guess there was a time when I got fucked by it.

796
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,160
Speaker 1: But you know what?

797
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,756
Speaker 1: You can just push the reset button and you go back to you save and you're good now.

798
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:02,560
Speaker 0: now you don't do that.

799
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:02,987
Speaker 1: Why not?

800
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:03,660
Speaker 0: you don't do that?

801
00:45:06,362 --> 00:45:08,753
Speaker 1: You got to do that especially in a game that's a jerk like this.

802
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:14,574
Speaker 1: if you don't know what you're doing I mean you got to use every advantage you can get to uncover the secrets.

803
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:16,399
Speaker 0: I do feel like they're.

804
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:19,037
Speaker 0: you know Flipping through this instruction book that I'm holding my hands yet again.

805
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:24,659
Speaker 0: Anyone who's gonna play Zelda 1 today read the instruction book like literally read every.

806
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:34,520
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you don't want to use game facts because that ruins all the mystical parts because you basically know you would already know Everything and I guess you kind of don't want to spend time burning every bush like I did.

807
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,250
Speaker 0: But I guess you don't need to burn every bush because you can.

808
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:44,420
Speaker 0: that the bushes that have stuff that really matters They're the bushes that are kind of standing out like a sore thumb.

809
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, like oh I went on this screen and there's a bunch of bushes and there's one bush out on its own.

810
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:49,239
Speaker 1: Huh?

811
00:45:50,062 --> 00:45:54,600
Speaker 1: And make sure you get the red candle so you can actually burn that's way later in the game and I don't wanted money now.

812
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:58,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the if you use the blue candle you're gonna be walking back and forth.

813
00:45:58,453 --> 00:45:59,858
Speaker 1: burn a bush didn't do anything.

814
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:01,686
Speaker 1: leave the screen Come back burn a bush.

815
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:02,390
Speaker 0: It was worth it.

816
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:03,395
Speaker 0: I found that money.

817
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:06,004
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, you gotta.

818
00:46:06,025 --> 00:46:09,300
Speaker 1: you gotta have at least some hints which are the hints that the book provides for you.

819
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,072
Speaker 1: You know the beginning map area location of level one, right.

820
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,700
Speaker 1: without that you're and you just try to play from nothing.

821
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:18,633
Speaker 1: It's gonna be pretty impossible and frustrating.

822
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:25,792
Speaker 0: but if you have the book I mean the one thing I will say is as a kid I beat this game Like not that without that man.

823
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:33,128
Speaker 1: when I beat this game was so epic Like I had some friends were over and they were watching and the first time I beat it I thought that you had to use the silver arrow only.

824
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,056
Speaker 1: so I beat Gannon using only silver arrow.

825
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,743
Speaker 0: and no so really I did The same thing.

826
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:43,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then later it was like no dude, you can just use sword You only to use silver arrow after he turns red Spoiler.

827
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:45,809
Speaker 0: I guess I don't think there's spoilers for that.

828
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:46,832
Speaker 1: You don't think so.

829
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:50,000
Speaker 1: Nah, I wonder is Gannon any harder in the second quest?

830
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:50,867
Speaker 0: I don't know.

831
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:52,620
Speaker 0: I got the once I got the silver arrows.

832
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,389
Speaker 0: The only thing that really Gannon was a lot easier.

833
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:00,425
Speaker 0: those fucking petros all over death mountain petros are easy, dude Not in the second quest.

834
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:01,650
Speaker 0: other different their heart.

835
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,433
Speaker 0: They take more hits.

836
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:03,337
Speaker 1: Oh fucker.

837
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:06,289
Speaker 0: Yeah Plus petro with wiz robes in the room.

838
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,277
Speaker 0: Oh god, fuck that blue ones.

839
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:11,351
Speaker 1: Oh Nothing's harder than blue wiz robe.

840
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:12,360
Speaker 0: fucking blue wiz robe.

841
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,868
Speaker 1: I mean people are complaining about like blue night.

842
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,138
Speaker 1: You can be blue night with friggin magic sword and bomb.

843
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:18,860
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

844
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:40,600
Speaker 0: I remember you can get into like the back way of the later dungeon to get the book But I would always bust into like a later dungeon to get the magic key and I'd go in there with like a white sword Maybe not even the white sword and just like try desperately to get through the game to get the magic key Never to deal with bullshit getting keys for the whole rest of the game.

845
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,360
Speaker 1: I like how like there are things that are not, you know, they're optional items, you know.

846
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,271
Speaker 1: It's not like you need to get the item to beat the level.

847
00:47:47,311 --> 00:48:03,041
Speaker 1: nowadays right the way the Zelda games are structured It's like you got to get the item and without that item There is no way you can get the big key and you need the big key to go to the boss in the old Zelda's like you just go straight to the boss Kill him with the red sword, you know kill him with the arrow, you know You don't.

848
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:04,489
Speaker 1: even you could do the the sword list.

849
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,520
Speaker 0: I kill a lot of the Knights with bombs.

850
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:07,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

851
00:48:07,663 --> 00:48:09,272
Speaker 1: It's like you can just do your own thing.

852
00:48:09,594 --> 00:48:10,740
Speaker 1: You don't need to get the items.

853
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:14,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know like you need the raft you need the ladder to get to some you could.

854
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:17,418
Speaker 1: you could neglect to get the bow in level one.

855
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:24,668
Speaker 1: Go all the way to the end of the game get the silver arrow go to Ganon and then be unable to kill him Because you don't you cannot have the bow.

856
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:26,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need the magic boomerang.

857
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:27,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love that magic.

858
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,872
Speaker 1: You don't need the regular boomerang.

859
00:48:28,892 --> 00:48:29,578
Speaker 1: You can just skip it.

860
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:37,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only things that you need to the compasses in the maps and the letter to the little old lady Yeah, it actually says letter to little old lady.

861
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,947
Speaker 1: in the book you could you could basically Ignore.

862
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:54,464
Speaker 1: like the vast majority of the game all you need to do to actually make it through the game is kill the bosses somehow with bomb, you know with something see or well, and you get the Triforce pieces behind them and That's it.

863
00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:57,500
Speaker 0: I mean, well, I mean I bet you'd like to carry more bombs.

864
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:58,464
Speaker 1: I bet you would.

865
00:48:58,484 --> 00:49:00,191
Speaker 0: you're gonna give up a heart container.

866
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,280
Speaker 1: No, that's that man.

867
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:03,345
Speaker 1: Take anyone.

868
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:04,953
Speaker 1: you want red potion heart container.

869
00:49:04,973 --> 00:49:08,485
Speaker 1: I mean seriously Seriously, what kid?

870
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:12,540
Speaker 0: I watched my friend Joe fucking Ogilvy take the red boat.

871
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,485
Speaker 0: He took the red potion.

872
00:49:13,525 --> 00:49:14,309
Speaker 1: just punch him in the face.

873
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,200
Speaker 0: I was like what is wrong with you?

874
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,247
Speaker 0: He's like red potion takes a lot of money.

875
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:19,994
Speaker 0: and I was like I was like.

876
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:22,760
Speaker 0: you realize there's no other way to get that heart container ever.

877
00:49:23,642 --> 00:49:24,689
Speaker 0: You just fucked it.

878
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:27,285
Speaker 0: I Don't think I said fucked it.

879
00:49:27,386 --> 00:49:30,000
Speaker 1: He's obviously that person is not going far in life.

880
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,813
Speaker 0: I don't know what I knew him when I was in like.

881
00:49:33,255 --> 00:49:34,280
Speaker 1: he's working a gas station.

882
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,704
Speaker 0: That's why I went to Catholic school.

883
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,107
Speaker 0: We lived in downtown Detroit.

884
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:39,914
Speaker 1: people with full heart containers get get salaried real jobs.

885
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,988
Speaker 0: I Would often beat the game without full heart containers.

886
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:46,600
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess early on, you know.

887
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,853
Speaker 1: But now I know where they're all are.

888
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,785
Speaker 0: So Would you play Zelda like?

889
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:51,433
Speaker 0: do you feel like you should play Zelda 1 again?

890
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:52,015
Speaker 0: Like now?

891
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:54,887
Speaker 1: I've played it recently How recently pretty reason.

892
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:55,570
Speaker 1: less than a year ago.

893
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:57,317
Speaker 0: I burned through Zelda 2 not that long ago.

894
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,705
Speaker 0: I burned through Zelda 3 recently.

895
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:02,069
Speaker 1: Zelda 2 is a little more painful.

896
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:04,176
Speaker 0: I like Zelda 2 a lot.

897
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:05,600
Speaker 1: You're the only one good game.

898
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,324
Speaker 1: It's all that he sucks But it doesn't suck.

899
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:15,107
Speaker 1: but it's you know one thing so much more painful than any of the others one thing Zelda 1 Does not have.

900
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:23,840
Speaker 0: that is good that Zelda 2 has The epic the single epic journey to get that motherfucking hammer good.

901
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:31,819
Speaker 0: Just the feeling everyone every kid I knew Like everyone had gotten to the point of I gotta go get the hammer and no one could get it.

902
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,484
Speaker 0: Do you believe tonight?

903
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:34,648
Speaker 0: I got a plan.

904
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,716
Speaker 0: I think I know where the hammer is.

905
00:50:36,736 --> 00:50:37,900
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try and get it.

906
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,197
Speaker 0: There was no game facts back then.

907
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:43,737
Speaker 1: No You need you need a little map to get through all those caves and every cave you go in.

908
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:50,342
Speaker 1: that's unnecessary Cost you health and you got to use the magic and no kid was gonna tell anyone else the pads He'd found.

909
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:53,800
Speaker 0: that got him closer to the hammer because he wanted to get it before everybody else got it.

910
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,928
Speaker 1: Yep And the thing is the thing that always hurt me is I would.

911
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:03,160
Speaker 1: I played these Zelda games at other people's systems with other people's Carches before I played them on my own system.

912
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:19,139
Speaker 1: So what happened was I would I would always like have the hammer already or have stuff already and I wouldn't really know You know where to go or what to do next because I was in the middle of someone else's game And it wasn't until I got them on my own that I really knew what was going on.

913
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,700
Speaker 1: I mean the game even had a mystical quality in the gold cartridge, right?

914
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were only two gold cartridges and one silver cartridge.

915
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,839
Speaker 0: Zelda and Zelda 2 were the gold ones.

916
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:33,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like no other game had that.

917
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:39,845
Speaker 1: so it's like it felt like some sort of magical and special game and it kind of was Probably still the best game.

918
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:43,080
Speaker 1: I know it was the best game ever, but it's definitely one of the best games ever.

919
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,127
Speaker 0: It's an important game.

920
00:51:44,228 --> 00:51:46,000
Speaker 0: I feel like there's still a lot to learn from Zelda.

921
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,912
Speaker 0: I feel like it for someone who's never played it before.

922
00:51:48,932 --> 00:51:51,000
Speaker 0: it is well worth playing.

923
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:53,320
Speaker 0: Of course Emily now is going through that transition.

924
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,692
Speaker 0: I mean she's playing it, you know, she's played the new Zelda plays.

925
00:51:55,772 --> 00:51:58,424
Speaker 1: I'm like she played Zelda 1 not yet But she's playing Zelda 3.

926
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:01,695
Speaker 0: All right, cuz that's that's a more accessible Zelda.

927
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:07,052
Speaker 0: I think than Zelda 1. definitely It's easy to forget how balls hard that game is.

928
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:14,160
Speaker 0: if you were not awesome at video games Super Nintendo Zelda is not really that hard for someone who's not awesome at video games.

929
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:15,808
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome video games.

930
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:16,994
Speaker 1: Mario one's gonna be hard.

931
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:19,787
Speaker 0: I mean, come on How many people have beaten Mario 1?

932
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:22,660
Speaker 0: I'll bet if we go to PAX and we're like how many people in this room have?

933
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:32,837
Speaker 0: Actually beaten Mario 1 maybe sadly surprised The same number of people who watched Evangelion at the anime convention or people who hadn't seen Star Wars.

934
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,924
Speaker 1: Yeah God, we're old Yeah, but actually it's like I'd.

935
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:44,803
Speaker 1: you know what I bet most people at a gaming at any convention have not played Zelda 1.

936
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:45,286
Speaker 1: I'm beating it.

937
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:51,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess even I guess Zelda 2 until RIT when I announced it.

938
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,880
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you said that you beat it before that you're just beating again at RIT.

939
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,475
Speaker 0: No, I'd gotten up to the Thunderbird not past.

940
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:00,984
Speaker 1: Oh Well, then How about that?

941
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:02,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd ever beat it.

942
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:11,454
Speaker 0: I beat it when I forget, uh-huh You fight the shadow link and then you wait All right, who else is standing on the screen after you fight the shadow link?

943
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:12,218
Speaker 0: like who talks to you?

944
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,187
Speaker 0: I Think we're petering out here.

945
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:22,574
Speaker 0: This is kind of a lazy show.

946
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:23,700
Speaker 0: I'll be honest.

947
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:28,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point is that Zelda 1 is awesome and like if you haven't played Zelda 1 seriously what?

948
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:36,836
Speaker 1: and plus I because I just know in my heart that a Scarily small number of people have played Zelda 1 and a scarily even smaller number have beaten it.

949
00:53:36,896 --> 00:53:38,301
Speaker 0: go find a scan to the instruction Book.

950
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:41,435
Speaker 0: scout look at this cute link just kind of standing there like the instruction book.

951
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:42,380
Speaker 1: art was so great.

952
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:48,960
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh, and if only there had been a Zelda anime that was just the anime looking art from this book.

953
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,158
Speaker 0: Excuse me artist.
