1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,517
Speaker 0: It's Monday June 12th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:18,239
Speaker 0: tonight We continue our series on how computers work with part 2 binary logic and logic gates.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,485
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:22,091
Speaker 0: You know I don't think we're ever gonna.

5
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:26,687
Speaker 0: Have a free weekend again in the rest of our lives According to Google the Google Calendar.

6
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:32,874
Speaker 1: We're not gonna be free for a month, but the weeks preceding Otacon We don't have anything yet.

7
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:44,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway for anyone who didn't listen to Thursday's episode when we decided to do this We had her friend Yuko come over this weekend, and then we went to the mocha art festival in the city hooray.

8
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:53,893
Speaker 0: and now someone in the forums posted after our Philly wizard world coverage and he had kind of a scathing rebuttal which I kind of disagree with.

9
00:00:53,953 --> 00:01:09,540
Speaker 0: well actually I really disagree with and All I really want to say now is that the mocha art festival was a complete 180 from Philly wizard world and We'll talk about this more on Wednesday when we cover that convention and all the fun things we did there and all the awesome.

10
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,529
Speaker 0: Not really a convention.

11
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:11,680
Speaker 1: It's more of an arts festival.

12
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,652
Speaker 0: Imagine a comic convention that is nothing but an artist alley.

13
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:15,913
Speaker 0: Yes.

14
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,900
Speaker 1: It was not a superhero to be seen.

15
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,084
Speaker 0: There were a few.

16
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,754
Speaker 0: there was one guy drawing some Colossus things.

17
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,597
Speaker 1: Well was there?

18
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:25,520
Speaker 0: I didn't say yeah He had an area where he was drawing like Marvel sketches.

19
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:31,560
Speaker 1: It was mostly artists who don't really work for the big comic companies showing off their stuff.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:42,473
Speaker 1: I mean you saw stuff ranging from a guy made some copies of a stick figure at Kinko's literally To you know Scott Pilgrim type stuff.

21
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:43,717
Speaker 0: Scott Pilgrim is awesome.

22
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:52,419
Speaker 0: the owly guy Ollie is also awesome and awesome web comics of awesome, but suffice to say it was awesome.

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,469
Speaker 0: and I really the only comic culture.

24
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,618
Speaker 0: I seem to dislike is the underwear pervert culture.

25
00:01:58,565 --> 00:01:59,999
Speaker 1: Everyone's ever know about underwear perverts.

26
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:11,940
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a. this is a joke from the website Boing Boing Where there was a news story that DC and Marvel had sort of trademarked the word superhero and super hyphen hero.

27
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,336
Speaker 1: And this actually was a news story from like the 70s.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,460
Speaker 1: But it was rediscovered recently and spread around the internet.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,885
Speaker 1: So it became common knowledge.

30
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,173
Speaker 1: and when Boing Boing found out about it.

31
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:23,856
Speaker 1: They said fine.

32
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:29,040
Speaker 1: We won't say superhero We're gonna say underwear pervert and it really stuck with us.

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just keep saying underwear pervert on that website.

34
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,740
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna say underwear pervert instead of superhero.

35
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:42,119
Speaker 0: Now, of course some superheroes do not fall into the underwear pervert category like the guy at Ex Machina or the watchmen.

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,646
Speaker 1: Yep, they're all.

37
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,274
Speaker 1: some of the watchmen are underwear perverts.

38
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:45,917
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

39
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:51,311
Speaker 0: Yeah But in a more literal sense, yes, yes very much so.

40
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:57,167
Speaker 0: anyway, we'll ever coverage of that on Wednesday plus Manga is not without its underwear perverts.

41
00:02:57,488 --> 00:03:01,460
Speaker 1: No, it is actually mega Tokyo, which is hardly about underwear perverts.

42
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used the words in both meanings.

43
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,379
Speaker 0: We have quite a pile of swag.

44
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,182
Speaker 0: We.

45
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:16,900
Speaker 0: I didn't actually do any interviews at the convent at the art festival mostly loud and too crowded.

46
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:25,629
Speaker 0: It was loud and crowded and the funny thing is unlike Philly wizard world where no one would interview with me People were practically begging me to be interviewed.

47
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,893
Speaker 0: They'd be like, let's do it now.

48
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:27,556
Speaker 0: Let's do it now.

49
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:28,579
Speaker 0: I can't.

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,724
Speaker 0: Oh, let's just do it now.

51
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:30,006
Speaker 0: Come on.

52
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,557
Speaker 0: Let me say something, but it's not that day.

53
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:33,180
Speaker 0: So we'll hold off.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,964
Speaker 0: I mean it's tech day.

55
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:35,413
Speaker 1: I got so much news.

56
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,479
Speaker 1: I don't know which news to do.

57
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,668
Speaker 1: So we might be loaded for a few weeks.

58
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:41,480
Speaker 1: Hopefully nothing will happen in the upcoming days.

59
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be able to unload all this news.

60
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:44,372
Speaker 1: the news.

61
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:51,232
Speaker 1: I want to talk about today has to do with Apple iTunes and Northern Europe.

62
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:56,734
Speaker 1: ah Northern Europe that bastion of freedom, you know Sweden Denmark Norway mostly those three.

63
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't being sarcastic.

64
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:09,100
Speaker 1: Yep apparently the iTunes agreement, you know the thing that says I agree You know the EULA and user license agreement.

65
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing you click on every time you install software that none of you read and no one cares about.

66
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:27,244
Speaker 1: Apparently the people are arguing that the end-user license agreement of iTunes and the iTunes music store is illegal in Norway Sweden Denmark.

67
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:28,748
Speaker 0: now why Scott is that?

68
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:35,766
Speaker 1: well as you know some contract there are some things people cannot legally Contractually agree to do.

69
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:43,520
Speaker 1: I could not write a contract that says rim agrees to be my slave and if rim signs it He doesn't become my slave because it's illegal to hold a slave.

70
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:54,559
Speaker 1: in the same way These people are arguing that in these countries it is okay to circumvent DRM in the way that the D the DMCA prevents.

71
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:00,280
Speaker 1: and The iTunes music store says you agree not to circumvent the DRM.

72
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:07,158
Speaker 1: So you cannot legally agree to give up, you know something you can legally do.

73
00:05:07,178 --> 00:05:10,171
Speaker 0: now I don't know how the legal system works over there.

74
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:12,240
Speaker 1: I think it's a professional judge type of thing.

75
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:14,899
Speaker 0: Well, I'm just saying in terms of contract law here in the u.s.

76
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,020
Speaker 0: It is not illegal to enter into an illegal contract.

77
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:27,580
Speaker 0: The way it works is if you sign a contract that violates your rights as the signer It is illegal to enforce the contract.

78
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:34,960
Speaker 0: So basically if you know a contract is illegal and you go ahead and sign it They can't really do anything to you and they can't enact the contract.

79
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:48,904
Speaker 0: So if say there were a EULA situation where the EULA was illegal here, you know Say we got rid of the DMCA and we had some right to DRM breaking Then iTunes wouldn't be in any trouble because they can have that EULA and you're free to agree to it But they can't enforce it.

80
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,297
Speaker 0: I don't know what the situation is over there, but it looks bad.

81
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,000
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

82
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,700
Speaker 1: I could probably go to crock-law and find all out all about it, but I'm not going to bother.

83
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,159
Speaker 1: The point is is that they might everyone basically the way it's happening.

84
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,804
Speaker 1: first They tried in France and they failed.

85
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:13,871
Speaker 1: what people are trying to do is they're trying to find some country in which the iTunes DRM And is crap and that way they can force.

86
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:27,675
Speaker 1: they can either force Apple to stop doing business in that country Or they can force Apple to disclose the DRM or Have an iTunes music store in one country that doesn't have DRM.

87
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:38,120
Speaker 1: and as soon as they do that We can all get Denmarkian credit cards and start using iTunes Denmark and get music that way Yep, which would probably not technically be illegal.

88
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:42,740
Speaker 1: So any of those results is a good one because they can force Apple out of a country.

89
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:52,870
Speaker 1: they can keep forcing Apple out of other countries until Apple either gets rid of the DRM or Is forced to disclose the DRM to some country.

90
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,540
Speaker 1: because soon as they disclose it to one country they disclose it to everyone.

91
00:06:55,842 --> 00:07:05,940
Speaker 0: Yep, and even if it remains illegal to break it in countries like the United States I can guarantee that there would be a website in whatever country said it was legal that would have everything you need to break it.

92
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,329
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean, it's already kind of broken.

93
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:21,565
Speaker 1: But the point is is you know, maybe in that country they'll sell iPods that don't have DRM and then they'll someone will take the firmware and put it online and we can all flash our iPods so that they don't do the DRM thing and There's all kinds of stuff.

94
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,588
Speaker 0: Yep, of course in addition to that while we were in the city We didn't actually go to see it.

95
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:30,780
Speaker 0: But apparently there were protests about DRM and Apple and everything.

96
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:40,040
Speaker 1: Yeah there was a. it was like countrywide protests at all the Apple stores and Someone lied to me and told me that I knew was on Fifth Avenue because it's the Fifth Avenue Apple store.

97
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,284
Speaker 1: Someone lied.

98
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:45,560
Speaker 1: I don't know where or who and they told me it was near the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue.

99
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,428
Speaker 1: Well, they were wrong.

100
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:47,660
Speaker 1: It's on 5th and 59th.

101
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,901
Speaker 0: So on Friday Microsoft announced that they are prematurely dropping support for Windows 98.

102
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,145
Speaker 1: Well, when were they supposed to do that?

103
00:07:56,366 --> 00:08:00,320
Speaker 0: I don't actually know but technically Windows 98 and Windows Millennium are still supported.

104
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,683
Speaker 1: Alright

105
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:17,161
Speaker 0: now apparently one of the recent vulnerabilities that's come out I forget exactly which one and I'm not gonna bother look it up because none of you care but Microsoft basically said that it would be not worthwhile for them to go through the effort of rewriting extensive amounts of code in order to Fix it.

106
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:22,300
Speaker 0: Therefore as of Friday Windows 98 is permanently and irrevocably insecure.

107
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,940
Speaker 1: Well, I mean isn't Windows 2000 already in that situation?

108
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:27,063
Speaker 0: Not really.

109
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,569
Speaker 0: There are still updates coming for Windows 2000.

110
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:33,681
Speaker 0: Oh not full updates not but there are still patches available for Windows 2000.

111
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,500
Speaker 1: I thought the Windows 1000 was no longer supported.

112
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,912
Speaker 0: Well, remember there's different levels of support with Microsoft.

113
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:45,041
Speaker 0: like Windows XP is fully supported There are companies that are still getting support for Windows 2000 Uh-huh.

114
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:52,015
Speaker 0: In fact like IBM was in that situation until very recently there was still support for OS 2 And now there's not.

115
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,262
Speaker 0: but Windows 98 is done.

116
00:08:53,303 --> 00:09:03,149
Speaker 0: now I Urge anyone out there who is using Windows 98 to get off of it because there is no way to protect yourself from future vulnerabilities at all.

117
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:10,295
Speaker 1: Well, the only thing I can say is if you want to you the only use I see for Windows 98 and it really only Has one use DOS gaming.

118
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:15,279
Speaker 1: No DOS gaming can be done with free DOS or something like that or DOS box Which is almost perfect.

119
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:15,824
Speaker 0: All right, then.

120
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:16,248
Speaker 0: What do you got?

121
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:22,449
Speaker 1: There are old games Windows games that really only work in Windows 98. there aren't many but there are some.

122
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:27,690
Speaker 0: Though I will note that almost any program that just works in Windows 98 natively will probably work.

123
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,781
Speaker 1: Okay, and why most of them work?

124
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,390
Speaker 1: Okay in wine most of them work.

125
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,939
Speaker 1: Okay in XP, but there are some that very few.

126
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,884
Speaker 1: but there's some that really only work in 98 95 a lot of times.

127
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:46,430
Speaker 1: They're ones that really work in Windows 3.1 And the Windows 98 is really good at playing those even if they can also work in wine or something.

128
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,965
Speaker 1: If you're doing that don't plug that computer into a network.

129
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:54,361
Speaker 1: Yeah, good God Just just have a little Windows 98 computer to play your games.

130
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,385
Speaker 1: Don't plug it into anything.

131
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:00,849
Speaker 0: and on a broader level I just want to note to people that this will always happen to Microsoft products.

132
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:12,281
Speaker 0: Yeah you will always reach a point in which the operating system you're using is not easily upgradable or if it might even be impossible to upgrade and It will no longer be secure or supported.

133
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,030
Speaker 0: and there's really no way around that.

134
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:22,390
Speaker 0: I mean there are Linux distros that died or that don't get their own updates anymore But theoretically you could find someone to write them for you or write them yourself.

135
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,944
Speaker 0: There's absolutely no way to do that with Windows.

136
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:33,990
Speaker 1: for an example the new Ubuntu dapper Drake Will be supported for five years on the server and three years on the desktop after its release.

137
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,150
Speaker 1: That means if you set up an Ubuntu server right now.

138
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:42,170
Speaker 1: Well, I guess since a few weeks ago when dapper Drake was released.

139
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:49,879
Speaker 1: So in 2011 there will still be updates for security on Ubuntu dapper Drake.

140
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,289
Speaker 0: not only that but every version of Ubuntu Ubuntu.

141
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,550
Speaker 0: now Ubuntu Ubuntu Will is always upgradable to the next version.

142
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:13,250
Speaker 1: Yes but the point is is that if you set up a system on a Server with Ubuntu dapper Drake Ubuntu Ubuntu dapper Drake you can stick with dapper Drake and have a stable Unchanging platform for five years with no worries.

143
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:19,550
Speaker 1: Previous versions of Ubuntu had a much shorter time of where there would be updates.

144
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:24,569
Speaker 1: Even the new Ubuntu desktop has three years of updates coming to it.

145
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:37,344
Speaker 1: And of course, you can always just upgrade to the next version beyond dapper Drake, which would probably be like, I don't know easy Something and then furry ficus ficus.

146
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:45,798
Speaker 1: I don't know can't be a tree I don't know what they are, but I could go look up what they're gonna be Something that begins with E and then something begins with F.

147
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,870
Speaker 0: but also the upgrade chain for will be mostly indefinite.

148
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,160
Speaker 0: I mean Windows.

149
00:11:51,523 --> 00:12:03,590
Speaker 0: say you had Windows 98 your Windows 95 and you can upgrade to Windows 98 and you can theoretically upgrade that to Windows 2000. and You can theoretically maybe upgrade that to XP or not XP or Vista.

150
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,298
Speaker 1: I dare you to just take a clean computer.

151
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:11,180
Speaker 1: install Windows 95 use it with 98 upgrade CD Then use a 2000 upgrade CD.

152
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:12,792
Speaker 0: You know what?

153
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:13,314
Speaker 0: not even that.

154
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:17,350
Speaker 0: take a Windows 98 computer and upgrade it to Windows 2000 and see what happens.

155
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:21,669
Speaker 0: Many of you out there are younger and didn't live through that but it didn't work.

156
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:23,115
Speaker 1: No, not really.

157
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:27,230
Speaker 1: He's you're switching from the win 32 kernel to the NT kernel.

158
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:31,150
Speaker 0: It just didn't work at all and things broke and it just made a mess.

159
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:38,028
Speaker 1: I mean the one that works best is upgrading a 2000 to an XP and even that's kind of crappy really crappy.

160
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:40,734
Speaker 1: Yeah It really just sucks.

161
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:45,248
Speaker 1: if you want to upgrade let's say you were using what was it the breezy badger.

162
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,809
Speaker 1: Yep If you want to upgrade that to the dapper Drake you type what one thing.

163
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:55,150
Speaker 1: well You might be like very few things and it just kind of happens and then you reboot the computer.

164
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,920
Speaker 0: Of course if you're using like a gen 2 Linux you just compile stuff.

165
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,550
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah gen 2 is basically updates for all eternity.

166
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,070
Speaker 0: Yep, it's not really versioned or anything.

167
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:16,954
Speaker 0: You just keep adding updates and there if you install it at a certain date and then a year later If you keep doing the updates, you'll have the same thing that someone who just installed it will have For the most part

168
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:17,656
Speaker 1: theoretically,

169
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,867
Speaker 0: yeah theoretically every now and then things change, but that's how there's

170
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:21,910
Speaker 1: some stuff with profiles.

171
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:30,381
Speaker 0: But I want to get into that Yeah, and we won't get into how Macs work other than the fact that Yeah, I'm probably going to buy one right after the show.

172
00:13:30,702 --> 00:13:31,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

173
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:32,469
Speaker 0: We'll see.

174
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,910
Speaker 0: Yeah Well coincidentally the main reason I was holding off is that until recently I was not terribly financially secure.

175
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,729
Speaker 1: So you mean something changed between yesterday and today?

176
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:58,170
Speaker 0: Well, I did something change that I didn't realize changed when I looked and noticed that my car is pretty much paid off which means my insurance is gonna go away and Coincidentally two days ago I won got a new credit card and to my old credit card doubled my limit randomly because they saw that I'm being prosperous.

177
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:09,170
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and all of those factors could together Really are pushing rim toward buying all the gadgets He hasn't bought for a while because he was trying to be responsible and was for some reason talking in the third person.

178
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:15,009
Speaker 1: And it has nothing to do with you know, the the intensive peer pressure campaign camp, you know.

179
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:23,497
Speaker 0: It also has something to do with the fact that of my computers for USB ports One of them is still functioning.

180
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,963
Speaker 1: What happened to mister?

181
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:27,050
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use this computer till it dies.

182
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,431
Speaker 0: You know what?

183
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,366
Speaker 0: I am I'm turning this computer into a Windows terminal server, but that's beside the point.

184
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:32,109
Speaker 1: what happened to?

185
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:35,469
Speaker 1: As long as this thing works, I'll use it no matter what.

186
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:40,010
Speaker 1: Why should I buy a Mac when I could get a fast enough computer for less?

187
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,376
Speaker 0: well, here's the other thing.

188
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,258
Speaker 0: the Mac is real cheap and I can run GarageBand.

189
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:57,626
Speaker 0: and one thing that really got me was I wanted to buy an on mp3 player because it's about time for me to get one and The only advantage the iPod has is that it works cool with iTunes.

190
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,569
Speaker 0: does all that fun stuff?

191
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:03,742
Speaker 0: If I'm running Linux, there's no way to access any of that stuff.

192
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:05,969
Speaker 0: So I might as well buy some cheapo mp3 player.

193
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,119
Speaker 1: But then I happen to I'm gonna switch to Windows.

194
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:09,921
Speaker 1: screw Linux.

195
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I've switched back and forth a bunch of times.

196
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, why is that?

197
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:15,659
Speaker 0: because I waffle a lot.

198
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,537
Speaker 0: no waffler because I take my time making decisions And I'm always my own devil's advocate.

199
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,070
Speaker 1: I see I see we just got you would to admit to the waffling.

200
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm a waffle and you know what?

201
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:25,501
Speaker 0: I like waffle.

202
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:25,903
Speaker 1: You know what?

203
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:26,687
Speaker 1: I'm a pancake.

204
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,129
Speaker 1: So fuck you.

205
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,239
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's a distinct possibility.

206
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,047
Speaker 0: by next week we'll be doing this on a Mac.

207
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,429
Speaker 1: hooray I didn't have to pay for it.

208
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:40,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that means you don't get to play with it either.

209
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,050
Speaker 1: I don't need to play with it.

210
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,075
Speaker 0: You can just buy one too.

211
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:44,984
Speaker 0: You kind of need a new computer.

212
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:45,587
Speaker 0: They're real cheap.

213
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:46,190
Speaker 0: We could buy two.

214
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:46,875
Speaker 1: There's that.

215
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:48,568
Speaker 1: my computer has nothing wrong with it.

216
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:50,873
Speaker 0: It's slow.

217
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:52,479
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

218
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,426
Speaker 1: It plays half-life 2 fine.

219
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,510
Speaker 0: You can't use garage band.

220
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:57,642
Speaker 1: I don't need garage band if you have it.

221
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:58,185
Speaker 0: Why not?

222
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,049
Speaker 0: We can both have it.

223
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,336
Speaker 1: What am I gonna do with it?

224
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,709
Speaker 0: You could sometimes do the post-production when I go to bed.

225
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,014
Speaker 1: No, yeah How can I do that?

226
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:07,537
Speaker 0: Why not?

227
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:08,360
Speaker 0: Just learn how to do it.

228
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,710
Speaker 1: Why should I spend my time doing that shit?

229
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,674
Speaker 1: Busy playing half-life 2.

230
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, my perfectly working computer.

231
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:16,121
Speaker 1: Yeah.

232
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,809
Speaker 0: Well, I saw that fan that wasn't spinning started spinning again.

233
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:21,529
Speaker 1: Yeah My computer is getting better not worse.

234
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:32,603
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, my computer a while ago the case fan started making noise and I solved that pretty quickly by unplugging the case fan Good job, and my Northbridge fan started making some noise.

235
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:34,129
Speaker 0: So I solved that in the same way.

236
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:40,340
Speaker 0: Computers still okay mostly because I have an air conditioner, but Which isn't on.

237
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:41,610
Speaker 0: well cuz it's kind of nice.

238
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,318
Speaker 1: It's your computer's surviving.

239
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,568
Speaker 1: cuz you took the panel off the side of the case.

240
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:46,432
Speaker 0: Yep Let's see.

241
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:50,269
Speaker 0: The live drive is dead because the cable inside drive has been dead for years.

242
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:51,014
Speaker 0: Yes It has.

243
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:54,517
Speaker 0: the zip drive is dead Which is also been dead for years.

244
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:55,761
Speaker 0: the zip drive it ever used.

245
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,628
Speaker 0: the D the CD burner.

246
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:04,329
Speaker 0: now I bought a Plextorp SCSI CD burner before CD RW was available to the public.

247
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:08,510
Speaker 0: This burner is old as shit and it doesn't work anymore.

248
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:11,180
Speaker 0: My DVD ROM is so old.

249
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,930
Speaker 0: It can't read dual layer DVDs.

250
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,256
Speaker 0: It also cost me a lot of money.

251
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:18,720
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

252
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:22,349
Speaker 0: And of course, I'm running an overheating old Thunderbird gigahertz.

253
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:26,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love this computer.

254
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,027
Speaker 0: forget the Mac.

255
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:28,690
Speaker 0: I'll just keep this.

256
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:39,495
Speaker 0: I Talk Cola Suey.

257
00:17:39,716 --> 00:17:41,743
Speaker 1: Gee, I don't know if you said that right at all.

258
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,028
Speaker 0: It sounded about right.

259
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:43,670
Speaker 1: It's close.

260
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,695
Speaker 1: It sounds close enough.

261
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:45,057
Speaker 1: I don't know.

262
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,122
Speaker 1: I probably isn't right.

263
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:48,275
Speaker 1: It's probably horribly mangled For all we know.

264
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 1: you could have just said something like I rate babies.

265
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:51,950
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I got all the syllables, right?

266
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:59,510
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is a video of a whole bunch of Rube Goldberg machines from a Japanese children's show.

267
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,410
Speaker 0: They are of the highest quality And apparently they've been on the net for a while.

268
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:10,069
Speaker 0: But this weekend you go one freaked out when she realized that we hadn't seen them and then showed them to us.

269
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:19,029
Speaker 1: it really reminds me of The PBS kid shows that I watch and I was a little kid Like not the PBS shit they have on now.

270
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,729
Speaker 1: But old school says the stuff that would be in between the Sesame Street stuff on the old Sesame Street.

271
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:30,110
Speaker 0: You know now this may be a kid show but these Rube Goldberg devices are of the highest quality.

272
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:40,411
Speaker 1: Okay, so the security consulting company Which means what they do is if you have a business and you have computers and you don't know if they're secure you hire the consulting Company.

273
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:48,429
Speaker 1: they come and try to hack into you and they tell you what they did and if they succeeded and then they fix the Holes for you or at least tell you how to fix the holes.

274
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:56,948
Speaker 1: So one security consulting company was going to test I think a bank I don't know for social engineering weaknesses.

275
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,758
Speaker 0: now That is my favorite kind of hacking.

276
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,870
Speaker 0: that doesn't require any technical skill at all.

277
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,526
Speaker 0: That is when you convince other people to give you what you want.

278
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:09,825
Speaker 1: Yep So the company went to all the employees and said we're the security consultants.

279
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:15,282
Speaker 1: sometime soon We are going to socially engineer you be on the lookout.

280
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:20,222
Speaker 1: So now not only so that way You know, it's not just stupid easy.

281
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:27,635
Speaker 1: They're they're fixing the real Obvious gaping holes that prepared employees You know will fail.

282
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:31,849
Speaker 0: because usually when they do these tests they don't warn anyone and then they find out.

283
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:38,564
Speaker 0: you know They just basically do a secret sudden test to figure out who's stupid and who's smart Yeah, or figure out where the holes are and generally everyone's stupid.

284
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:44,084
Speaker 1: when you do that here They were trying to say alright if people are won't know we're coming.

285
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,388
Speaker 1: How are we gonna get in?

286
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,265
Speaker 1: Well, the answer is just as easily.

287
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:51,780
Speaker 1: Yeah Hey made it not any more difficult to get in.

288
00:19:52,282 --> 00:20:00,787
Speaker 1: what they did is they took some USB drives and they put some software on the USB drives and they just kind of let him scatter on the parking lot and whatnot.

289
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,492
Speaker 1: and Sure enough.

290
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:15,162
Speaker 0: Most of those USB drives ended up in company computers rather quickly where they then immediately installed their virus payload And it will Trojan payload Yeah And sent all the personal data from the PC back to the security company.

291
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:15,723
Speaker 0: then laughs.

292
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:28,126
Speaker 1: so you put the thumb drive in the computer And immediately there's now a key logger and all kinds of evil shits and everything The person types is going to the guy who made the thumb drive, you know, and and that's it.

293
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:28,688
Speaker 1: You're done now.

294
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,085
Speaker 0: This is really I mean, it's a problem with people not realizing the security implications of doing things.

295
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:43,930
Speaker 0: It's also a problem with Windows Mmm, because if in Linux or even in Macs, I'm pretty sure if you just stick a thumb drive in it's not going to execute anything.

296
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:49,024
Speaker 1: No, but in Windows you can make an autorun boot or a thumb drive.

297
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:59,490
Speaker 0: that'll autorun yep like an autorun CD and Administrators often don't disable autorun and all the computers and in fact most people who are running a Windows computer are running it as administrator.

298
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,862
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the Trojan now has full access to everything on the PC.

299
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:04,107
Speaker 1: thumb dumb dumb.

300
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,238
Speaker 1: in Linux You would have to put the thumb drive in Manually run the program.

301
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,738
Speaker 1: you would see that it was still running After you closed it.

302
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, and after it does its fake thing.

303
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:23,650
Speaker 0: Well, unless you ran it as root and it set up a root kit Yeah, but if you run a strange file as root you get what you deserve.

304
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:33,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if you're if you run the strange file executable as user All it can really do is mangle your user stuff which screws that user and no one else and that's really easy.

305
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:40,990
Speaker 1: Supposedly the company secrets would not be in the users my documents folder and they would be in some database where they would be well protected.

306
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:50,118
Speaker 0: But social engineering is the biggest danger to security and it's also the one that gets the least press and most people don't really realize It gets plenty of press.

307
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:51,929
Speaker 1: It's just people don't understand it.

308
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,859
Speaker 0: Well, they hear the word But they don't realize that.

309
00:21:54,899 --> 00:22:00,289
Speaker 0: that means the guy calling on the phone Saying it's an emergency and he needs the password because the boss is pissed.

310
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:10,290
Speaker 1: social engineering means someone just walks into your company and asked for the password and Idiots just tell him everything he wants to know and you don't actually have to do any hacking.

311
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:20,150
Speaker 0: Yep or like dressing up as the janitor or dressing up as an IT guy Walking in saying you're with the support group and you got a call that there's something wrong with their computer or you detect it.

312
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,746
Speaker 0: There's a virus on their computer and you need your password so you can sit down and fix it.

313
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,247
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Mm-hmm and people just fall for it.

314
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:34,028
Speaker 0: Yep in fact when I worked for ITS information technology services at our IT which was the tech support and IT maintenance for the campus.

315
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:39,346
Speaker 0: We had badges that we were required to make a point of showing them to.

316
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:52,608
Speaker 0: the people were working on saying yes I am legitimate because apparently not too long before I was hired two kids walked into an office at our IT Said they were working for ITS walked off with a bunch of computers and disappeared.

317
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,838
Speaker 0: One props to them and two god damn.

318
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:57,400
Speaker 1: Yep.

319
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:57,961
Speaker 1: Yep.

320
00:22:58,182 --> 00:22:58,403
Speaker 1: Yep.

321
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,810
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's really the weakest link in security.

322
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,750
Speaker 0: No matter how secure anything you make ever is you really can't account for the stupidity ignorance and most importantly just people not caring.

323
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:13,062
Speaker 1: If you're paying someone about trust, you can't trust idiots.

324
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:16,914
Speaker 1: This is why users must be given nothing Not even just idiots.

325
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,230
Speaker 0: say you you trust someone they're a smart person, but you're paying them seven fifty an hour.

326
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:25,149
Speaker 0: They're not gonna care so much about the security of whatever they're working on.

327
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,538
Speaker 1: Well, then you don't really trust them do you know?

328
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:31,030
Speaker 0: or you you trust them to be content with seven fifty an hour.

329
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, you deserve those bad trusting.

330
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,490
Speaker 1: you got to be good about trusting and you got to not have idiots.

331
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:49,394
Speaker 0: but anyway We would like today to continue our ongoing series on how computers work from the barest of bits to the highest end Complexities of awesome.

332
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:52,990
Speaker 1: now a lot of people gave us some useful feedback saying we went too fast.

333
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,474
Speaker 1: So we're gonna review.

334
00:23:54,915 --> 00:24:03,630
Speaker 0: yes now in essence all we really explained on our previous segment of this This is segment number two is that computers are deterministic?

335
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, I that well eg that they are predictable.

336
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:08,139
Speaker 1: Yes.

337
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:08,700
Speaker 0: No.

338
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, ie ie not eg ie.

339
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:14,695
Speaker 1: a computer is input Processing and output.

340
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:19,050
Speaker 1: the same input will always result in the same output with the same computer.

341
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:26,908
Speaker 0: If a simple computer only had one thing in it You could either you'd either push a button or not push a button and if you push a button a light comes on.

342
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:28,888
Speaker 0: if you Don't push a button the light doesn't come on.

343
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:32,424
Speaker 0: You know that anytime you push that button it will always come on.

344
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:33,769
Speaker 0: the light will always come on.

345
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:37,762
Speaker 0: The computer is the same way just has a lot more buttons and a lot more lights.

346
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:40,210
Speaker 1: now this has broad implications.

347
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:46,682
Speaker 1: Not only is it mathematically significant But it's also significant all the way up to the user level.

348
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:55,090
Speaker 1: if there is something wrong with the computer It is your fault because the computer will always do the same thing with the same input.

349
00:24:55,434 --> 00:25:02,150
Speaker 0: So if it is not your fault Then it is the fault of whoever wrote the software or the computer is because the software is also input.

350
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:02,976
Speaker 1: But it will get to that.

351
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:09,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a computer is The same thing no matter what it doesn't change unless it's broken.

352
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:11,175
Speaker 1: it could be a broken computer.

353
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:15,915
Speaker 0: if you want some interesting reading try reading about Turing machines or Which.

354
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,849
Speaker 1: we will explain at some point in the future.

355
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:21,889
Speaker 0: Yes I was going to read a nice excerpt from diamond age that actually goes over it pretty well.

356
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,330
Speaker 0: But apparently Scott lent my copy of diamond age to our friend Kate.

357
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:28,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, I told you I was letting her borrow it and I totally forgot.

358
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:33,864
Speaker 1: and then you forgot and I also forgot Yeah, so luckily she reminded us in the forums yep, but that's fine.

359
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:34,566
Speaker 0: That's fine.

360
00:25:34,747 --> 00:25:35,670
Speaker 1: We will get it later.

361
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:36,934
Speaker 1: It's a really good book.

362
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:41,990
Speaker 1: if you didn't read diamond age by Neal Stephenson read that yes, and snow crash also.

363
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:43,754
Speaker 1: Yes Require those are.

364
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,243
Speaker 1: those are the textbooks for rim and Scott's how to computers work.

365
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:49,610
Speaker 1: the textbooks are snow crash and diamond age.

366
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,896
Speaker 0: Yes, and every.

367
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,490
Speaker 0: let's see everything by Neal Stephenson everything by William Gibson.

368
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:55,098
Speaker 1: No, no, oh.

369
00:25:55,118 --> 00:26:01,270
Speaker 1: the only other textbook besides those two is C programming by Richie.

370
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah No, don't bother with that unless you want to learn how to write C.

371
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:12,693
Speaker 0: But anyway, and then we talked about how input in a computer I mean everyone.

372
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:13,255
Speaker 0: it's binary.

373
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:18,454
Speaker 0: It's ones and zeros true and false yes or no on or off They're all the same thing.

374
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:25,359
Speaker 0: electricity or not electricity or some variation therein Mm-hmm, but it is all just yeses and noes.

375
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,370
Speaker 0: a whole ton billions and billions of yeses and noes.

376
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:29,976
Speaker 0: That's it.

377
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:31,429
Speaker 0: That's all that goes on in there.

378
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:33,926
Speaker 1: Yeses come in knows come out.

379
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,290
Speaker 1: Who knows?

380
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:46,107
Speaker 0: Now The way that these yeses and noes become output or at least usable output deterministic output is by applying logic to them.

381
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:59,152
Speaker 0: We talked briefly about the transistor and now all that does is you can now use an electrical signal a yes or no in Order to determine whether or not a different electrical signal will be a yes or no Mm-hmm.

382
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:10,188
Speaker 0: so you can look at one bit or one piece of information or one wire and Based on what's on that wire you have a thing that says if there's something on that wire Then I will put something on this wire, too Yep.

383
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:19,843
Speaker 1: So there's a little transistor and it's got wires coming in and out of it and it looks at the wires coming in To see if they have electricity or if they don't have electricity.

384
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:26,062
Speaker 1: and if they do have electricity Then on the out wire it either sends electricity or doesn't depending.

385
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:30,458
Speaker 1: and if they don't have electricity it either sends Electricity or not depending.

386
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:37,363
Speaker 0: now if we break this down to the simplest form Imagine that on that you have two inputs two wires.

387
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:41,156
Speaker 0: each can have either yes or no Electricity or not electricity.

388
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:43,944
Speaker 0: from now on we'll always refer to them as one or zero.

389
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,750
Speaker 0: Yes, because that makes it easier.

390
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:51,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, just remember that one is not a thing one is just a word that we use to mean electricity.

391
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:54,944
Speaker 1: Yes, there are not little magic ones and zeros floating around in there.

392
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:56,270
Speaker 1: I think I explained that last time.

393
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,970
Speaker 1: Yes, but reiteration is always good, especially when people think you're moving too fast.

394
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:03,761
Speaker 0: Now these say we have two inputs two wires.

395
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:06,589
Speaker 0: either of them can have a one or a zero.

396
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,225
Speaker 1: Now that's four combinations total.

397
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:26,905
Speaker 0: now you can have logic there say we have a little back a magic box and the two wires come in and one wire comes out and say for every combination of Ones and zeros they can go in the two inputs a different output comes out or an output that we can determine.

398
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:27,527
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

399
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:39,265
Speaker 0: That is logic No, but if if you say whenever both of the inputs are one Then the output will be one no matter what then that is Deterministic and it will always be one if the two inputs are one.

400
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:39,868
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

401
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:47,270
Speaker 1: Now there are many different logical operators you can use and those are all the different boxes or gates that you can use.

402
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:54,390
Speaker 0: Yep I mean a computer has Countless inputs and more inputs than you can fathom and more outputs you can fathom and we'll explain that in the future.

403
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,841
Speaker 0: I mean for the sense of scale.

404
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:58,290
Speaker 0: look at your computer monitor You see all those pixels.

405
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:02,050
Speaker 0: Imagine that each one of those is one output.

406
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:04,209
Speaker 0: It's actually more complicated than that.

407
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:13,910
Speaker 0: Every one of those pixels is a whole ton of outputs from a whole ton of Logical little boxes with little wires coming in millions and millions and millions and millions of millions.

408
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:14,953
Speaker 0: They just keep going.

409
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:20,250
Speaker 1: There's so many of them in there, but the basic unit is one single digital logic operator.

410
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:33,188
Speaker 0: Yep, because it turns out that despite the millions and countless infinite combinations of inputs that can produce different outputs You can break them all down into a tiny set of little two input logical magic boxes.

411
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:38,250
Speaker 0: that Combining these in various ways can create any logic you could ever imagine.

412
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:41,159
Speaker 1: Except you need one more thing which we'll talk about later.

413
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,223
Speaker 0: Yes, but in terms.

414
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:49,066
Speaker 0: well in terms of a one-step operator Yes one step in terms of one input one output in any given time.

415
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,230
Speaker 1: Well two inputs one output.

416
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:52,642
Speaker 0: Well one set of input one set of output, right?

417
00:29:53,085 --> 00:30:01,715
Speaker 0: You can create any Boolean logic any logic in the world just from this small subset of gates Mm-hmm logic gates.

418
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:02,538
Speaker 1: Yep.

419
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:05,168
Speaker 0: The logic gate is just the magic box that I described.

420
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,669
Speaker 1: Yep Now let's talk about the different boxes.

421
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:11,788
Speaker 1: The simplest box to understand is the AND gate.

422
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:18,249
Speaker 1: The AND gate has of course two wires coming in and one wire going out.

423
00:30:19,313 --> 00:30:37,440
Speaker 1: The one wire going out will never have electricity on it except if the two wires coming in both have electricity, so if input one if input a is one and Input B is also one.

424
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:45,323
Speaker 1: So if input, you know, it's one and one Then a one will come out see and gate one and one.

425
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:45,845
Speaker 0: Yep.

426
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:57,520
Speaker 1: The names are very descriptive Mm-hmm, so if let's say the two inputs to an AND gate where one and zero or zero and zero or zero and one Which is pretty much the only other three combinations you can have.

427
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,781
Speaker 0: Yep.

428
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:05,649
Speaker 1: A zero will come out of that AND gate But if two ones come into the AND gate then a one will come out.

429
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,569
Speaker 1: That is an AND gate.

430
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,290
Speaker 1: That is very simple.

431
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:17,130
Speaker 0: I've linked to in the post a nice probably Wikipedia description of All these gates with pictures and diagrams and all sorts of things.

432
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:23,030
Speaker 0: So I highly encourage you if you're listening at a computer to look over those diagrams while we speak.

433
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,237
Speaker 0: It'll make it a lot easier.

434
00:31:24,377 --> 00:31:26,710
Speaker 1: There are also symbols for each gate.

435
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,382
Speaker 1: I think an AND gate is sort of a square with this rounded.

436
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:34,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think trying to describe them over a podcast That's not gonna work now.

437
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,906
Speaker 1: But there is a different symbol for each gate and they're pretty simple and learning them will help you.

438
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,974
Speaker 0: now in terms of Understanding these gates.

439
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,467
Speaker 0: keep in mind that there's only two inputs to each one with one special exception.

440
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:44,969
Speaker 0: We'll get to that.

441
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:51,708
Speaker 0: Yep, therefore, there are only four possible inputs Total four possible combinations of input for each one.

442
00:31:51,909 --> 00:32:08,024
Speaker 0: Yep So if you want to get them straight and learn them and understand them You can make what's called a truth table Where you list the four possible inputs on one side across the bottom and then across the top and a little square you list the possible outputs and then you can make a little grid and and the link.

443
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:15,529
Speaker 0: it shows exactly what these look like and You can use that if you don't remember what a gate does to figure out exactly how the gate works.

444
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:25,297
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I just want I can't reiterate enough that everything your computer does with one time with one exception that we'll talk about another day It's just combinations of these gates.

445
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:25,940
Speaker 1: Yep.

446
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:28,770
Speaker 1: So the next gate we'll talk about the OR gate.

447
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:39,710
Speaker 1: now the OR gate will only put out a one if Either input A is one or if input B is one or if they're both one.

448
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,299
Speaker 1: Yep, it's an OR gate.

449
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:54,220
Speaker 1: So the only time so an OR gate pretty much always has like a one coming out of the one output except if Both of the inputs to the OR gate are zero.

450
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,810
Speaker 1: then and only then will the OR gate output zero.

451
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:06,785
Speaker 0: now see it seems very intuitive and if if A and B are true then C is true or if A or B is true then C is true.

452
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:17,726
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm These are just electrical representations of Boolean logic Which you can read up on Boolean logic in great detail online or you can take a discrete math course in school And then you'll learn to hate it.

453
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:20,779
Speaker 1: Now here's the real simple one is the NOT gate.

454
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,870
Speaker 1: the NOT gate actually only has one input and one output.

455
00:33:24,412 --> 00:33:27,685
Speaker 1: What it does is it outputs the exact opposite of the input.

456
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,269
Speaker 0: It's often called an inverter Yep.

457
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,923
Speaker 0: Now the reason it's called NOT is you say is the input not one?

458
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,450
Speaker 0: if the answer is yes, then a one comes out.

459
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,838
Speaker 0: Yep, so if the input is not one, what is it?

460
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:39,541
Speaker 0: It's zero.

461
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:41,950
Speaker 0: And if the input is zero, then the output is one.

462
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:45,384
Speaker 1: Yep, the output is always the opposite of the input.

463
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:50,650
Speaker 1: zero comes in one comes out It inverses the signal zeros come out it flips the signal it reverses the signal.

464
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,879
Speaker 0: However, you want to think about it and it all it's the only.

465
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,370
Speaker 1: it's the only gate that has only one input.

466
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,289
Speaker 1: It doesn't have two inputs like the other gates.

467
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,019
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about the NAND gate.

468
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,110
Speaker 0: Yeah with the basic gates NOT and or yes.

469
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,229
Speaker 0: Well, there's also one more kind of basic gate.

470
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:08,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we'll talk about that.

471
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:08,731
Speaker 0: All right.

472
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:18,869
Speaker 0: Now you can combine NOT gates with AND or OR gates to make two cool kind of gates Mm-hmm NAND and NOR NOT AND NOT OR.

473
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:32,350
Speaker 1: So it N N A N D NOT AND It basically is the same thing as an AND gate only it takes the output and puts it through a NOT gate.

474
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:42,467
Speaker 0: So imagine it in English if it is not and If the if it is not true in an AND gate then it is true here And if it is true in an AND gate then it is false here.

475
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:44,155
Speaker 0: So it only.

476
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:47,848
Speaker 0: it outputs a one as long as the two inputs are not both.

477
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:53,905
Speaker 1: one You don't remember an AND gate only puts out a one if both inputs are one.

478
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:57,689
Speaker 1: on a NAND gate It always outputs a one.

479
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:02,259
Speaker 1: Unless Both inputs are one then it will output a zero.

480
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:07,544
Speaker 0: now trivia with a NAND gate and I know someone answered in the forums Which I'm very happy and we talked about it last time too.

481
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,430
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it again.

482
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,086
Speaker 0: The NAND gate just happens to be electrically the simplest gate to make.

483
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:14,310
Speaker 1: it just happens.

484
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:22,510
Speaker 0: It is very very simple And in fact with nothing but the electronics from NAND gates you can create every other gate that exists.

485
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:29,461
Speaker 0: And part of that is because if you take the two inputs of a NAND gate and short them together It becomes a NOT gate.

486
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:32,034
Speaker 0: because think about it Say you have one input.

487
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:35,143
Speaker 0: that then splits into the two inputs of a NAND gate.

488
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:43,650
Speaker 0: if you put a one into that one wire No matter what a one goes into both sides Which then makes it false which does the same thing as a NOT gate.

489
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:44,474
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

490
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:45,720
Speaker 0: That might make more sense.

491
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,765
Speaker 0: If you look at a picture of it.

492
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,896
Speaker 1: Yep There's also the NOR gate.

493
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:53,685
Speaker 0: not or it follows the same trend as the NAND gate.

494
00:35:53,746 --> 00:35:55,110
Speaker 0: it's a NOT or gate.

495
00:35:55,551 --> 00:36:00,770
Speaker 1: So if an OR gate would output a one the NOR gate outputs a zero and vice versa.

496
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:07,489
Speaker 1: So pretty much a NOR gate always puts out a zero unless both inputs are zero in which case it outputs a one.

497
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:12,161
Speaker 0: Now or for now has been either or or both.

498
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,532
Speaker 0: It's been an inclusive or when in doubt It's included.

499
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:22,603
Speaker 0: XOR is another gate where the X stands for exclusive meaning it'll only output a one.

500
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:27,821
Speaker 0: a true if One of the inputs is true one and one of the inputs is false.

501
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:33,337
Speaker 1: Yeah XOR is a tricky gate and It's like the advanced gate.

502
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:38,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know if you're programming stuff and you're using XORs It's like ooh, you were smart enough to use XOR.

503
00:36:39,104 --> 00:36:40,270
Speaker 0: think of it like a radio button.

504
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:45,290
Speaker 1: Not really, but I mean any any programmer worth a shit knows when to use XOR.

505
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, but think of it like a radio button.

506
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:51,803
Speaker 0: You can only select one at a time It'll only be true if only one of the inputs is selected.

507
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,150
Speaker 0: if only one of the inputs is true.

508
00:36:53,772 --> 00:36:56,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, so imagine you have there are two inputs.

509
00:36:56,721 --> 00:37:00,810
Speaker 1: if both of them are the same then nothing comes out but if they're different.

510
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:11,830
Speaker 1: so if one in if input a is one and input B is zero or if Input a is one and input B is zero then and only then will you get a one to come out of the output?

511
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,890
Speaker 0: So you can think of it as a. are they not the same gate?

512
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,633
Speaker 1: Yep, an XOR is if the inputs are not the same Output a one.

513
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,621
Speaker 1: if the inputs are the same output is zero.

514
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:27,190
Speaker 0: now, of course, there is a an XOR gate.

515
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,715
Speaker 1: Well, it's an X nor.

516
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:29,116
Speaker 1: Yeah.

517
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:29,638
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,189
Speaker 0: I just wanted to make it easy because you know and and or and X or

519
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:39,230
Speaker 1: yep The X nor gate or the NX or gate the not X or gate if you will

520
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:40,494
Speaker 0: It will

521
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:45,410
Speaker 1: all put a one if both gates it if the inputs are the same as each other.

522
00:37:45,612 --> 00:37:47,029
Speaker 0: So it's a check for sameness.

523
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:50,018
Speaker 1: Yeah If both inputs are zero a one comes out.

524
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:53,429
Speaker 1: and if the inputs are different a zero comes out.

525
00:37:54,033 --> 00:38:05,950
Speaker 0: and if both inputs are one a one comes out and Of course your computer is just for each step that your computer does because you know You have a processor and it works, you know, a megahertz a number of times per second.

526
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,673
Speaker 0: It does something.

527
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,680
Speaker 0: every time it does something.

528
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,410
Speaker 0: It's just a crazy combination of all these gates.

529
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,449
Speaker 1: Well, that'll be more relevant when we talk about stuff next week

530
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:26,870
Speaker 0: true But just try to get it in your heads and remember that your computer is only doing and each iteration every time it does something It's just following a complex set of one of these gates of all these gates and then an output comes out.

531
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:34,134
Speaker 1: There are lots and lots of inputs to your computer from all over the place and they some of them are more than just one Bit or a couple bits.

532
00:38:34,434 --> 00:39:04,060
Speaker 1: there are many many bits and bytes and megabits and gigabytes and there's a million inputs And it goes into all of them at once and there's a bunch of gates all linked up to each other and then at the end there's a whole mess of outputs all over the place and it's just this Sea of gates all linked up to each other all over the place crazy like and a mess of inputs and a mess of outputs and If you give it the same input you'll always get the same output every single time.

533
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:12,830
Speaker 0: and if you have a computer running by itself with Absolutely, no input from any source anywhere then it can never ever change what it's doing.

534
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:18,289
Speaker 0: Nope, unless it was coded to do so in which case it's not actually changing because it's doing exactly what it was told to do.

535
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:21,910
Speaker 1: Yep, the program is an input to the computer.

536
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:31,890
Speaker 0: Remember that if you tell a computer to add one and one and then subtract one in one and do that over and over and Over again, it'll never stop until someone unplugs it or stops it or it breaks.

537
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:35,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it didn't do that, then it would not be in fact a computer.

538
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:42,929
Speaker 1: All right, I'll ask the trivia question this time All right There is something we left out that we said we were gonna talk about next time and we will.

539
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:50,930
Speaker 1: Now you might have noticed that with this lot these gates we're talking about There isn't a way for a computer to remember something.

540
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you haven't.

541
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:57,902
Speaker 0: well if you have an input coming in then an output is coming out But as soon as you change the input the output changes.

542
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:06,449
Speaker 1: Yep now Nor if you just use these logical things you can only make a computer that does something.

543
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:13,270
Speaker 1: right now You can't make a computer that does something when there are many inputs in a different order.

544
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:23,249
Speaker 1: so let's say I had a computer and I inputted, you know, one two three and Then I had a computer and I inputted one three two.

545
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:30,630
Speaker 1: Do you see how the order of the inputs when there are many inputs in an order sequential input makes a difference?

546
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:40,310
Speaker 1: well in order for that to happen The computer would have to be able to remember a bit from before or many bits from before.

547
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,356
Speaker 0: It would have to remember if something was true or false.

548
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,622
Speaker 1: It has to store a bit.

549
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:56,037
Speaker 1: It has to take a bit of Information and hold on to it and not let it go so that when the inputs come through again That it'll be different.

550
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:56,439
Speaker 0: Now.

551
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:58,890
Speaker 0: How do you do that when a bit is just electricity?

552
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,736
Speaker 1: Yep, how do you do that?

553
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:04,670
Speaker 0: Well, that's our trivia question and it's once again, you won't win anything.

554
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:08,827
Speaker 0: It is just a way to prepare yourself for the next segment of how computers work.

555
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:16,559
Speaker 1: Yep there are actually many ways to store information, but there is a Most basic one to store a single bit.

556
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:23,701
Speaker 1: that is the simplest electronic way to do so and don't just say RAM or a hard drive.

557
00:41:23,802 --> 00:41:28,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, or a CD or a floppy disk We're talking about on the lowest lowest electronic level.

558
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:32,529
Speaker 0: if you were soldering a bunch of things together, how would you store something there?

559
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:41,990
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, if you were making a chip like a Pentium chip, what electronic thing would you put on the chip to store a bit?

560
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,593
Speaker 0: Now we announced last week.

561
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:59,390
Speaker 0: We're done with the computer segment for now that we were finishing up the logo contest and what I can say now is that we have Started and then ended a different contest the banner contest for the top of the website.

562
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,870
Speaker 1: Well, it's not really so much a banner contest as in make the website look a little better contest.

563
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:04,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

564
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:09,454
Speaker 0: I'm sure you all saw classic brah's Submission in the forum.

565
00:42:09,936 --> 00:42:14,652
Speaker 0: if you haven't you should go to the forum because the website is probably going to be looking like that in Short order.

566
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:17,403
Speaker 0: he is one and we're going to do something awesome for him in return.

567
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:22,990
Speaker 1: Yes now His submission did not really include a logo.

568
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:35,138
Speaker 1: we are going to need to do some work on our end to select a logo and Incorporate it into our you know and feed images and mp3 images I mean basically and image.

569
00:42:35,258 --> 00:42:37,990
Speaker 0: we we started the logo contest and we were real vague about it.

570
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:44,620
Speaker 0: And now especially now that we've talked to more people who know more about this than us We've realized that we wanted art for the website.

571
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,890
Speaker 0: That's really cool that you know, this is geek nights.

572
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:55,390
Speaker 0: But we then I mean that has to be something somewhat complex something that'll look good on the site We still need the logo which has to be simple.

573
00:42:55,852 --> 00:43:01,050
Speaker 0: It has to be like almost as almost a gestalt a thing that you'd look at and it's that is geek nights.

574
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,561
Speaker 0: It's very simple very compact like the logo of a company.

575
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:06,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, like McDonald's golden arches We've got it.

576
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:10,005
Speaker 0: We've gotten a bunch of awesome submissions, obviously, and we'd like to have more.

577
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:15,009
Speaker 0: we're gonna extend the contest But we do no longer really need art for the website itself.

578
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:17,338
Speaker 0: Yep, so think simple.

579
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,667
Speaker 1: It's not gonna go on much longer though.

580
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:20,310
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

581
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:24,424
Speaker 0: I mean, you should see how many submissions we got right after we said the contest is almost over.

582
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:27,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's get you got Two weeks.

583
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:29,179
Speaker 0: I was about to say two weeks.

584
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,224
Speaker 0: So that's your weeks is good.

585
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:34,279
Speaker 0: into within two weeks We will have decided on a geek night's logo.

586
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,005
Speaker 0: So once again think simple.

587
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:38,133
Speaker 0: if you can't draw I don't know.

588
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,667
Speaker 0: just make a mock-up what you think it should look like and then someone else will dry like.

589
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:43,131
Speaker 0: don't even worry about Coloring it.

590
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:46,476
Speaker 0: just come up with the idea and I'm sure we can cover the rest.
