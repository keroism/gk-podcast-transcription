00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:32,876
Speaker 1: So I was down in the Bronx as I often am working on stuff every day.

6
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,279
Speaker 1: I'm not every bit.

7
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:40,920
Speaker 1: a lot of days I'm just in Yonkers but I'm actually down in the Bronx and I finish up my work a little bit early.

8
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:46,140
Speaker 1: I'm really fucking hungry But I don't want to stay where I'm parked because the parking right there is like five dollars a second.

9
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:47,447
Speaker 1: So I get out.

10
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:49,960
Speaker 1: I'm driving around and thinking what am I gonna eat?

11
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,372
Speaker 1: I'll just stop somewhere on the way, you know park in the street.

12
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:54,436
Speaker 1: Whatever food looks good.

13
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:57,812
Speaker 1: I'm in no hurry and I passed by a white castle.

14
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:02,310
Speaker 1: Oh man's I Can't eat most fast food.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,297
Speaker 1: I can Scott either.

16
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:03,720
Speaker 1: we can.

17
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:07,494
Speaker 1: The thought of eating McDonald's hamburger makes me a little nauseous.

18
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 0: I don't even know what they taste like anymore.

19
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:10,090
Speaker 1: I know what they taste like.

20
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:16,338
Speaker 1: it tastes like nausea Uh-huh, but well, actually they used to taste delicious before I realized that it was just chemicals.

21
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,920
Speaker 1: All right Yeah, but anyway, I get like I can't eat that crap.

22
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:23,275
Speaker 1: The only exceptions are I can eat Taco Bell pretty much any time.

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,805
Speaker 0: Oh, that's I go bells disgusting While Taco Bell.

24
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:31,320
Speaker 1: what you get is not Mexican food and I would not call it a taco.

25
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:34,130
Speaker 1: What it is is good, but it is disgusting.

26
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:35,997
Speaker 1: It's better than the tacos.

27
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:36,920
Speaker 1: You got in like high school.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,763
Speaker 1: It's better than the tacos.

29
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:38,968
Speaker 1: you get it like a college.

30
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,555
Speaker 0: It's not saying much it tastes.

31
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:41,800
Speaker 0: I don't eat those tacos either.

32
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,065
Speaker 0: I have a high standard.

00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:43,667
Speaker 0: It's either good.

34
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:44,430
Speaker 1: No, you don't.

35
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,457
Speaker 1: those tacos taste about the same as the tacos.

36
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,100
Speaker 1: We make at home.

37
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:47,928
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

38
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,079
Speaker 1: Yes, they know.

39
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:50,927
Speaker 1: Anyway, and White Castle?

40
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,694
Speaker 1: because White Castle is the bomb.

41
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,340
Speaker 0: diggity castle is so bad.

42
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,279
Speaker 1: Where else can I get four burgers for two dollars and twelve cents?

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,526
Speaker 0: Nowhere and there's a reason for that.

44
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,460
Speaker 1: You also got a fifth burger, but it was a jalapeno cheeseburger.

45
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:05,209
Speaker 0: And how big was it?

46
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,539
Speaker 0: like an inch wide?

47
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,848
Speaker 1: You know how big a White Castle is.

48
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,133
Speaker 1: like that big it's tiny.

49
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,037
Speaker 1: It's not that time.

50
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:11,780
Speaker 0: It's pretty tiny.

51
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,131
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's like a bite.

52
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:28,608
Speaker 1: as I'm walking in I see these a bunch of signs all around the White Castle and there's a bunch of video cameras and a bunch of like metal speakers and the sign says you're being watched 24/7 by the police and blah blah blah blah.

53
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,195
Speaker 1: two-way communication something blah blah blah.

54
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,178
Speaker 1: Don't do anything stupid.

55
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,185
Speaker 0: No loitering Uh-huh, huh?

56
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,691
Speaker 1: All right, so I go inside.

57
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,438
Speaker 1: more signs the same.

58
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:37,900
Speaker 1: apparently.

59
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:44,175
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's a White Castle thing or a just a thing But it looks like this is a company that does this and inside the place.

60
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,058
Speaker 1: There's a million more of them.

61
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:55,199
Speaker 1: While I was sitting in this White Castle One person was arrested and two more people were forced to leave and told that the police were on route.

62
00:02:56,521 --> 00:03:01,860
Speaker 1: These people were related to each other in any capacity and none of these incidents were related to each other in any capacity.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,622
Speaker 0: What do they do?

64
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:08,000
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm sitting there and it's next to a high school in the Bronx and it's around lunchtime.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:19,020
Speaker 1: So there's some girl and her two girlfriends like talking to each other and they're yelling and loud and you know what punk kids do and One of them's really loud and eventually suddenly I hear this announcement.

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,460
Speaker 1: It's like will the girl in the blue sweater be quiet or else we will be forced to call the police.

67
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:29,116
Speaker 0: It's not illegal to be loud, but you could just ask them to leave.

68
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:29,760
Speaker 0: That's all you can do.

69
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:40,394
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, and and the girls looking around like what all right, and then the cameras like look up at the camera I'm watching you be quiet or you'll be forced to leave and she's like whatever.

70
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:42,461
Speaker 1: and then he says I Can't.

71
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:46,154
Speaker 1: I heard that I am calling the police if you do not leave immediately.

72
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:47,498
Speaker 0: Oh if you don't leave.

73
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,763
Speaker 0: Oh, it's fine Yeah, all right.

74
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,472
Speaker 1: So she's like what what what the fuck.

75
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,917
Speaker 1: and she just leaves good.

76
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:53,258
Speaker 0: That's it.

77
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:53,620
Speaker 0: All right.

78
00:03:53,923 --> 00:04:00,272
Speaker 1: So like five minutes later I'm sitting there and suddenly a different voice comes on and says Well, the gentleman in the purple shirt leave immediately.

79
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,704
Speaker 1: the police have already been called What.

80
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:06,140
Speaker 0: and I'm like, I can't call the police and someone didn't do anything yet.

81
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,488
Speaker 1: Well, you can call the police and say someone's on my property.

82
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,431
Speaker 1: I'm asking them to leave.

83
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,900
Speaker 1: Please come in case they don't I guess.

84
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:15,013
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I don't know if they actually call the police.

85
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:21,478
Speaker 1: They kept threatening to call the police Constantly to various people and the second guy is like what I do.

86
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:28,152
Speaker 1: Cuz he's sitting there with his friends and they were being really quiet and they're like You're eating non White Castle food on our premises.

87
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,096
Speaker 1: you're trespassing.

88
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:29,980
Speaker 1: leave immediately.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,409
Speaker 1: He's like I came in with my friends.

90
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,677
Speaker 1: It's some fries from the McDonald's next door.

91
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,440
Speaker 1: What the hell dude?

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,865
Speaker 1: He's like don't swear at me.

93
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:38,607
Speaker 1: get the hell out.

94
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:39,410
Speaker 1: The police are coming.

95
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:43,003
Speaker 0: So there's some Nazi who owns a White Castle, basically No, it's not.

96
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,469
Speaker 1: I don't think it's the White Castle.

97
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,260
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure those people weren't physically in the White Castle.

98
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,474
Speaker 1: It looks like I took a picture of it.

99
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:50,420
Speaker 1: I got a look at this sign.

100
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:58,654
Speaker 1: There's a company that businesses in cities can hire that will set up cameras and Basically yell at punk kids and threaten to call the police.

101
00:04:58,714 --> 00:05:00,705
Speaker 1: so you don't have to confront them They just have.

102
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,119
Speaker 0: why do the people watching it just Nazis?

103
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:06,880
Speaker 0: It's like how is that good for business if you just keep kicking everyone out?

104
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:07,361
Speaker 1: You know how.

105
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:13,080
Speaker 1: it's probably good for business because there's an infinite number of punk kids and the place will be full no matter what.

106
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaker 1: They could kick out everyone and the place would be full ten minutes later.

107
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,222
Speaker 1: It's just.

108
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:22,200
Speaker 0: I was kind of weird and you know what I would do though if I was a punk kid.

109
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,627
Speaker 0: I would totally throw rocks at that place every night.

110
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is it's open 24/7.

111
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,902
Speaker 1: It's surveilled 24/7.

112
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:29,425
Speaker 0: Oh, it's surveilled.

113
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:31,239
Speaker 0: looks like the inside and the outside.

114
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:35,559
Speaker 1: While I was outside they kept yelling at kids to move along or the police would be called.

115
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,991
Speaker 0: We move along at the other on the sidewalk.

116
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,920
Speaker 1: They were in the property barely.

117
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:44,556
Speaker 1: It's like they'd walk in the property or start to cut through or like stop.

118
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,420
Speaker 1: real close to the phrase.

119
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,710
Speaker 1: You're like move along.

120
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,019
Speaker 1: police are on their way.

121
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:51,586
Speaker 1: The guys always just saying the police are on their way But the police only showed up once.

122
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,800
Speaker 0: is it against the law to say the police are on their way if you didn't call them?

123
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:55,784
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

124
00:05:55,844 --> 00:06:00,002
Speaker 1: I did that remember when that stupid guy tried to attack me while I was riding my bike Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:03,277
Speaker 1: I was basically I didn't call the police, but I had my cell phone out.

126
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,713
Speaker 1: I'm like, dude I already called 9-1-1. the police are on their way.

127
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:07,980
Speaker 1: You sure you want to stick around?

128
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:13,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course that didn't work because his response was I know all the police they won't do anything to me.

129
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,338
Speaker 1: Come here so I can kick your ass.

130
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,771
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, it's just a weird Nazi kind of.

131
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:21,513
Speaker 0: I get your a lot.

132
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,957
Speaker 0: not it didn't sound like anything.

133
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 0: they did was illegal.

134
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,639
Speaker 0: Definitely wouldn't go there if I knew the place was like that.

135
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only if I approached the place and I said wow the person here is being a Nazi.

136
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,760
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go and shop there.

137
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,500
Speaker 1: The only reason I went is because I fucking love White Castle and I wanted to eat a White Castle.

138
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,475
Speaker 0: White Castle sucks and that place is like the worst White Castle ever.

139
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,129
Speaker 1: It sounds like well The thing is the White Castle food was okay.

140
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,295
Speaker 1: It wasn't the best White Castle.

141
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,039
Speaker 1: I've ever eaten at.

142
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,234
Speaker 1: the Cheesesteaks were a little dry.

143
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:53,239
Speaker 0: What I would have done is I would have gone in and like You know talk to the the guy who you know, there's no one to talk to.

144
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,050
Speaker 0: There's the guy who serves your burgers.

145
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,499
Speaker 1: Those people didn't speak English.

146
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,234
Speaker 1: those people didn't?

147
00:06:58,537 --> 00:06:58,679
Speaker 1: they?

148
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:04,740
Speaker 1: Those people did not interact with you in any capacity and they were behind to tell them what you wanted.

149
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,935
Speaker 1: They were behind bulletproof glass and there's no door to get to where they were.

150
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:10,180
Speaker 0: Did you have to tell them what you wanted?

151
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, couldn't you talk to them through that?

152
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 1: that I don't think they would respond.

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,806
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they don't speak English.

154
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,838
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone in that establishment spoke English.

155
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,291
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, what if you went into the into the restaurant?

156
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,314
Speaker 0: and what the White Castle?

157
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:24,635
Speaker 0: and you?

158
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,157
Speaker 0: you didn't.

159
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:25,980
Speaker 0: let's say you're Chinese.

160
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:29,570
Speaker 0: You only spoke Chinese But you knew how to order White Castles and that was it.

161
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:33,540
Speaker 0: and you sat down eating your White Castle and they said leave Leave and you're like what?

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,034
Speaker 1: I think that would be the same Situation as if a police officer tells you to do something and you don't understand what he says.

163
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:40,680
Speaker 1: not all police officers speak Mandarin.

164
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:41,888
Speaker 0: I guess so.

165
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they doing that situation?

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,664
Speaker 1: I don't think is it kind of worked?

167
00:07:45,745 --> 00:08:06,857
Speaker 1: because despite the fact that there were with no exaggeration at least four or five Hundred punk high school kids like in a mess around the property of this White Castle just cuz it was lunchtime next to a high school I think that that system was the only thing keeping that White Castle from being just a madhouse of death and carnage.

168
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:14,833
Speaker 0: see the thing is Though if I own the White Castle, I would let it be a madhouse cuz I would make so much money All those burger sales.

169
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:15,437
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

170
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,767
Speaker 0: in fact I wouldn't even I would have that be.

171
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:21,440
Speaker 0: the way I would set up the White Castle is where no one could actually come inside.

172
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,320
Speaker 1: There was graffiti in the White Castle.

173
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:29,300
Speaker 0: I know I would set up the White Castle in such a way that it was just not drive-throughs.

174
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,158
Speaker 0: Maybe one drive-through lane, but you couldn't actually get in.

175
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,626
Speaker 0: It was just a building and you would come up to the edge of the building and do a window where someone would give you White Castles.

176
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:46,523
Speaker 0: in the middle would just be a kitchen Yeah, and then when it got crowded around by a thousand high school kids I just throw burgers out and take money in Constantly.

177
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:49,180
Speaker 0: if they graffitied the outside who gives a shit?

178
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,249
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the problem is that White Castles are not the classiest places And that's why who cares if it gets graffitied.

179
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,012
Speaker 0: It's a White Castle.

180
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:56,855
Speaker 0: It's not like.

181
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,280
Speaker 0: it's not like it's a French restaurant.

182
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,960
Speaker 1: It's one thing to go into a building somewhere in the Bronx and there's graffiti on the outside.

183
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:15,400
Speaker 1: But when there is graffiti on my table and on the floor and on the wall and on the security glass and everywhere in that building I just I Felt really out of place too because it's all punk kids and really scuzzy looking people.

184
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,716
Speaker 1: I'm there in like a pair of chinos and a dress shirt with a Cisco book.

185
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:22,611
Speaker 0: Yeah Hey, you didn't get asked to leave did you know?

186
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:28,737
Speaker 1: but I got the hell out of there pretty quick cuz I was kind of Afraid they were gonna yell at me for violating the can't be in the restaurant for more than 10 minutes rule.

187
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:34,517
Speaker 0: really Yeah, I would have been like on my way out I would just given a finger to the camera.

188
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:37,591
Speaker 0: no that way That way they couldn't ask me to leave.

189
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:38,680
Speaker 0: I was on my way out already.

190
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,485
Speaker 0: What were they gonna do?

191
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:41,760
Speaker 0: and all I did was give him the finger not illegal.

192
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:46,297
Speaker 0: So an awesome game that has been out for quite a few years now, I guess.

193
00:09:46,317 --> 00:10:00,360
Speaker 0: yeah a couple years I guess that we love and most gamers seem to love is the guitar heroes and guitar hero 1 & 2 are out and available on Definitely the PlayStation 2 and I think some other systems.

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,782
Speaker 0: Maybe.

195
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:07,248
Speaker 0: I think the Xbox 360 has guitar hero 2 and whatever and they're good games And you should get them if you can.

196
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:13,073
Speaker 0: and the rock band is also coming But I know less about that other than it will have more instruments than just the guitar.

197
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:14,900
Speaker 0: which guitar hero only has the guitar?

198
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:27,374
Speaker 0: But anyway, they have announced that in guitar hero 3 Legends of rock which has a really good song lineup just as good as the old guitar heroes All of the guitars are gonna be wireless.

199
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:28,400
Speaker 0: it's about time.

200
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:34,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it was so annoying with the freaking wire You'd always have to like get it around your body in the right direction and pain in the ass.

201
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:39,800
Speaker 0: Guitar hero guitar is gonna be wireless and they should be so awesome awesome all around.

202
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,748
Speaker 0: The thing is from what I can see here.

203
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,825
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like the guitars are gonna be Cross-platform compatible.

204
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,937
Speaker 0: I mean the Wii guitar is white and has a hole in it for you to put your Wiimote in.

205
00:10:53,419 --> 00:11:04,517
Speaker 0: the Xbox 360 and ps3 Guitars look exactly the same from the outside But there is no information assuring me that the ps3 guitar will work with the 360 or vice versa.

206
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,420
Speaker 1: I'd be almost certain they wouldn't and I never really expected them to actually work in any way like that.

207
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,219
Speaker 0: Oh, I never expected it either.

208
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:24,460
Speaker 0: However, I want to point out that as someone who currently owns no guitar heroes But would like to own guitar heroes and only has a Wii I kind of want to own If I'm gonna start buying guitars, right?

209
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:39,788
Speaker 0: I don't want to get you know guitar hero for the Wii if I'm not sure that I'll be able to get you know Future guitar heroes for the Wii or that you know The Wii is gonna be the platform of choice for guitar hero and rock band for all my friends and you know We kind of want to all.

210
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:41,459
Speaker 0: you want to get the most?

211
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,780
Speaker 0: Guitar hero you can on one system with buying the fewest plastic instruments as possible.

212
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,240
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it starts to become really cost prohibitive.

213
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:02,174
Speaker 0: I mean if I want to play guitar hero 1 2 & 3 I gotta buy a PS 2 PS 2 guitars a Wii Wii guitars and then maybe like rock band won't even be on the Wii.

214
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:02,856
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

215
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:06,851
Speaker 0: I'll have to get a 360 and then some 360 guitars and instruments.

216
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,200
Speaker 0: I only want to get one set.

217
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,187
Speaker 0: I shouldn't have to buy more than one set.

218
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:20,116
Speaker 0: and if they're gonna force me to buy more than one set of plastic instruments I'm just not gonna buy any plastic instruments and I'm gonna stick to playing this at conventions of my friends houses.

219
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:23,473
Speaker 1: Honestly screw it I'll be I'll admit this.

220
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,980
Speaker 1: I'm sure I'll get some Ravel from our friends, but I've kind of soured on guitar hero as a whole.

221
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,351
Speaker 1: Like it was really fun when it came out because it was new.

222
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,740
Speaker 1: but now I mean even in Wildwood We don't get to play it all the time.

223
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,520
Speaker 1: It's not like I could get sick of it But anytime I played it I kind of thought to myself if I could play this or DDR.

224
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,223
Speaker 1: What would I do?

225
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:41,772
Speaker 1: and the answer was always DDR?

226
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:42,375
Speaker 1: Yep.

227
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:42,858
Speaker 0: Yep.

228
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:48,452
Speaker 1: Yep Guitar heroes fun, but in the end it's not really anything.

229
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,080
Speaker 1: at least DDR is really freakin good exercise.

230
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:55,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, you know guitar hero is still I think it's still pretty fun.

231
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:59,030
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not like holy crap You know, it's like any game when it's brand new.

232
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,369
Speaker 0: It's all the crap and when you've played it or more It's less.

233
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,759
Speaker 1: Holy crap I just feel like it didn't have the staying power with me like if I'd owned it.

234
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,968
Speaker 0: I definitely did have less staying power than DDR.

235
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:07,691
Speaker 0: I mean DDR.

236
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,840
Speaker 0: how many years and it still has staying power.

237
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:17,744
Speaker 1: I remember when we like every day we'd just kind of look around and search and call just to find out if there were DDR machines within.

238
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,269
Speaker 1: I don't know 40 miles of yeah.

239
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:36,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean despite the lack of staying power compared to DDR You know, it's every a new release of guitar Hill were sort of reinvigorated, you know I'm sure when I play guitar hero 3 with all those new songs I'm gonna be all like all man's and it'll be like a refresher, you know, like a little bump, you know It goes up because

240
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,320
Speaker 1: I just I feel like I'll always play it in that way.

241
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,900
Speaker 1: But I almost think that if I actually owned it it would stop being fun because then I'd play it.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,490
Speaker 0: I do think that if I did own it that it would.

243
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,140
Speaker 0: the fun would decrease more rapidly over time with my increased play.

244
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:58,080
Speaker 0: however, there is also the added miss of Added miss that if I owned it, I would actually be able to get good enough to play the expert songs.

245
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:01,835
Speaker 0: So it would also simultaneously unlock a new fun you sing.

246
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

247
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,866
Speaker 1: I just maybe just cuz.

248
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,540
Speaker 1: I don't have so much time to video games.

249
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:11,540
Speaker 1: Those sorts of games are low on the list also because there's no clear-cut winner in terms of what console to buy.

250
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,324
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

251
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:17,745
Speaker 0: They're also gonna come out like a PC version and have some USB Guitars, I mean think that we haven't.

252
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:22,240
Speaker 1: we have yet to buy a ps2 and it's still not worth it money-wise.

253
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:25,150
Speaker 1: As far as I can see there's still 130 bucks ps2s.

254
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,920
Speaker 1: Yeah until the five games I want maybe six.

255
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:28,943
Speaker 0: Well, there's more.

256
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:31,612
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of ps2 games that like non-obvious that you like.

257
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,463
Speaker 1: what I mean what I want to play the Kingdom Hearts games.

258
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:37,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I want to play the Guitar Heroes.

259
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:40,952
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of ps2 games.

260
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:44,091
Speaker 1: You just don't realize I'm just not interested in a lot of them.

261
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just don't know them.

262
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,186
Speaker 0: It's like, you know you go because there's so many.

263
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:47,989
Speaker 0: I'm not.

264
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:51,338
Speaker 1: I haven't been much of a console gamer since I don't know the Super Nintendo.

265
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, the Wii is what brought me back in the DS.

266
00:14:54,862 --> 00:15:09,319
Speaker 0: the point is is that if they don't make it economical to purchase only a Bare minimum number of plastic instruments and use them for as long as these kind of games that continue to exist I'm just not gonna buy any because it's totally not worth it.

267
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:18,839
Speaker 0: it's worth it for me to buy a plastic guitar that I can use now and use on the ps2 and use in the future and Use forever and never have to buy a new one unless I break it.

268
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:29,420
Speaker 0: It's not worth it for me to have to buy one now and then replace it when the new console comes out and then replace It three years from then and then replace it three years from then and then have to buy one to play at my friend.

269
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:37,246
Speaker 1: The thing is my two sets of drums who aren't us and people who actually are into the game will do that Thus generating more income for them.

270
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:42,686
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean look they're releasing this game on whatever consoles or platforms They can because they're just.

271
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:43,449
Speaker 1: they're trying to sell.

272
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:46,260
Speaker 0: it is good that they are letting it go on all platforms.

273
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:47,287
Speaker 0: That is a good decision.

274
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:51,234
Speaker 1: instead of forcing it because they'll make a ton of money They're trying to hit the broadest audience.

275
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:55,634
Speaker 0: boss that is true But they should have made their guitars cross platform.

276
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,060
Speaker 1: The people who want this game will buy it.

277
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,304
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're what I think.

278
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:03,479
Speaker 1: we're some of the few people who have the money and like the game but did not buy it.

279
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:07,280
Speaker 1: Probably and all those people will just keep buying guitars till the end.

280
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaker 0: I guess I guess what it is is that I sort of demand that if I'm gonna buy You know a plastic instrument like this that I get the most use out of it.

281
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,980
Speaker 1: It can possibly give you mean like with our $30 plastic DDR pads that broke in a month and we just kept buying them.

282
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:22,360
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly You know.

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,860
Speaker 0: I demand that if I'm gonna buy a plastic instrument or something that I'm gonna be able to you know, use it.

284
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about it.

285
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:31,820
Speaker 0: It's like why should I buy these useless piece of plastic, you know?

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,311
Speaker 0: It feels really bad to spend like 50 bucks on a plastic guitar.

287
00:16:35,612 --> 00:16:36,535
Speaker 0: that like only works.

288
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,920
Speaker 0: like one game or something.

289
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:41,111
Speaker 1: I'd be much more inclined to buy the drums to rock band.

290
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:43,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those better be freaking cross-platform.

291
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,820
Speaker 0: No one's gonna be like having ps3 drums and Xbox 360 drums and a Wii drums and ps2 drums.

292
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,789
Speaker 0: That's just not gonna happen.

293
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 1: I'm at another game.

294
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,999
Speaker 1: I think we missed a good bullet on and now that I think about it was Donkey Konga.

295
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,959
Speaker 1: That would have been really fun for like an hour.

296
00:16:57,472 --> 00:17:00,100
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a. I mean that game, you know.

297
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:13,599
Speaker 0: While originally cool and probably a blast to play with your friends from what I hear I seen videos on YouTube of a guy Strapping four bongo sets together to make a big quad bongo set because the game it was too easy.

298
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:19,569
Speaker 0: So he had to play all four parts at once on his own to make it interesting And even then it didn't look that hard.

299
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,976
Speaker 0: no, it didn't look that hard.

300
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:21,358
Speaker 0: it looked like.

301
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:22,944
Speaker 0: with some practice I could have done it right.

302
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:26,444
Speaker 1: So instead of a news, I got a gig back here All right.

303
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:30,906
Speaker 1: So this is posted in our forums by Shane Four one two one six two.

304
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:34,420
Speaker 0: Why do people put numbers in their names when there's no competition?

305
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:49,165
Speaker 1: The only possible rationale I could see is if someone used that name on like AOL instant messenger back in the day Because you know you had to to get a name in most cases and now they continue to use that name just because it's a I guess.

306
00:17:49,225 --> 00:18:00,740
Speaker 0: but I mean if I go and log into like Facebook and someone already took Scott so I have to take Scott 32 I'll take Scott 32, but if I go somewhere else, I'm not gonna try Scott 32 before I try Scott again.

307
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,600
Speaker 1: Well, it depends what if you were Scott 32?

308
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,142
Speaker 1: Everywhere.

309
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:12,348
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be because I would only be it in the places that forced me to what if you were Jean Valjean I'd be Jean Valjean two four six.

310
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:12,769
Speaker 1: Oh one.

311
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I got hopefully wouldn't be in jail anymore.

312
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:19,626
Speaker 1: You stole a loaf of bread Right.

313
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:20,191
Speaker 1: I ate it.

314
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:26,336
Speaker 1: So anyway Right now it is 148 here in California and I just got back from a halo 3 release event.

315
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:27,460
Speaker 1: washing the crowd.

316
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,295
Speaker 1: I noticed a good percentage of people open their games before leaving the mall and wouldn't you know it?

317
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:33,800
Speaker 1: most of them were scratched.

318
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:36,008
Speaker 1: Well the news here.

319
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,959
Speaker 1: I'm not really a new but I'll mention it.

320
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:47,160
Speaker 1: It turns out that the collectors box whatever of the game Had a problem and scratched the ever-living shit out of the discs in it and I say you deserve it.

321
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,220
Speaker 0: What the how stupid were you to buy the collector's edition?

322
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,694
Speaker 0: Is that is the game somehow better if it comes in a metal tin?

323
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,020
Speaker 0: is that metal tin?

324
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,046
Speaker 0: You'd be worth something.

325
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:56,812
Speaker 0: there was a time

326
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:01,110
Speaker 1: when I felt that back there was a time in my life like maybe a four month span

327
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:01,752
Speaker 0: where

328
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:10,754
Speaker 1: if there was a box set of anime and Another box set that was the same anime, but also had a little piece of plastic I probably would get the little piece of plastic version.

329
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:14,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Anyone intelligent realizes?

330
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:18,120
Speaker 0: Hey, all they're doing is charging you extra money for the special edition.

331
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,469
Speaker 1: That is not different in any way other than the word Like a little Master Chief helmet or something.

332
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,657
Speaker 0: Oh man, the Master Chief helmet that I don't think about this.

333
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:34,020
Speaker 1: when you were young Imagine if someone gave you the opportunity to get a Darth Vader mask a real one.

334
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:35,419
Speaker 0: You can get them at Toys R Us.

335
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,840
Speaker 1: No, I mean I were like a movie prop one like a super quality one.

336
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,660
Speaker 0: It's no better than the one at Toys R Us for my purposes.

337
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:45,939
Speaker 1: I'm just saying what if you were a little kid and someone like gave you Darth Vader's mask you'd freak out about it.

338
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,500
Speaker 0: You can't really that when you're all right, you'd be too big and it wouldn't fit.

339
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,933
Speaker 0: I'd be much happier with a little kid version for Toys R Us.

340
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:53,280
Speaker 0: that makes me talk like Darth Vader.

341
00:19:53,623 --> 00:20:08,940
Speaker 1: All right, so you're just a jaded weirdo anyway Even though you won't be all right Right now for most of the people who are eager to get this game my advice to you would be to wait until December to get it Even though you won't be the first wave of people to play it.

342
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,182
Speaker 1: Trust me when I say that right now the only people you would deal with are assholes and those people who like to scream fag While playing.

343
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,810
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna rest of it, but

344
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:20,920
Speaker 0: I would like to know funny even though I've read it before that

345
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:34,057
Speaker 1: if you believe that the Percentage of Assholes and idiots on any game that has any sort of multiplayer is going to go down as the game is out longer You are sadly mistaken.

346
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,442
Speaker 0: I mean come on counter-strike.

347
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,286
Speaker 0: How long's it been out?

348
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,149
Speaker 0: seven years?

349
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,418
Speaker 0: Six years a long time.

350
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,482
Speaker 0: Guess what?

351
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,130
Speaker 0: It hasn't gone down.

352
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,670
Speaker 0: What makes you think that the number of people calling you a faggot in Halo 3 is gonna go down in two months?

353
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:53,870
Speaker 1: Chances zero and the price isn't gonna come down and they've already figured out the whole scratch thing.

354
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,847
Speaker 0: So pretty much if you're a Halo 3 fan and you want the game go by the normal edition.

355
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:02,764
Speaker 1: right now There's a game that you really care about getting out.

356
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:03,750
Speaker 1: get it on opening day.

357
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:08,830
Speaker 1: You're not gonna lose anything for getting it on opening day unless they charge more for as long as you don't wait in a line.

358
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,498
Speaker 1: Even then it might be worth it.

359
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:13,633
Speaker 1: I would have waited in one hell of a line to get tribes to the day It came out.

360
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't know until after though.

361
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:21,910
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't buy it right away was I didn't have any money back then you did buy it right away.

362
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,779
Speaker 0: I told you to go buy me a copy.

363
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,186
Speaker 0: You bought two copies on the internet.

364
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:25,970
Speaker 0: They came in the mail.

365
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,419
Speaker 0: No, I didn't and then I gave you cash for it.

366
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,566
Speaker 1: Not for no not for team.

367
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:41,390
Speaker 1: not team fortress Not for that game tribes - yeah, no No, I went to the store and bought it like three days later because I didn't have money when it came out.

368
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:44,690
Speaker 0: Oh, but you did buy a copy on the internet and then gave it to me and I gave you money.

369
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:49,289
Speaker 1: I went to the store and bought it with cash cuz my credit card was maxed out.

370
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:50,933
Speaker 0: That's not what I remember.

371
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,337
Speaker 1: I couldn't buy anything online.

372
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,490
Speaker 1: My credit card was totally maxed out at like a couple thousand dollars.

373
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,990
Speaker 0: That's not what I remember, but I had no money at all.

374
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:01,660
Speaker 1: I've got some money and I went to the store.

375
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,210
Speaker 1: I think it was media play and I bought the physical box.

376
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:05,744
Speaker 0: That's not what I remember.

377
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:09,280
Speaker 1: But okay That's a really weird thing to make up Scott.

378
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:10,104
Speaker 0: That's how I remember.

379
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:13,503
Speaker 0: it is cuz I remember I Wanted it, but I couldn't go get it for some reason.

380
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:22,459
Speaker 0: I told you to get it things of the day.

381
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:26,713
Speaker 0: So rim yesterday that don't tase me bro with the Emperor.

382
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:27,776
Speaker 0: You thought that was pretty funny.

383
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:28,820
Speaker 1: I thought that was pretty funny.

384
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:31,830
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I got something more funny than that.

385
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:34,820
Speaker 1: Ah, you apply thinks I've seen this already.

386
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:37,917
Speaker 1: I think Scott has played ace to my queen in the Trump.

387
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:38,520
Speaker 0: perhaps.

388
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:45,060
Speaker 0: So, you know the end of Star Wars Episode six where Luke takes off Darth Vader's helmet and he's like you were right.

389
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,544
Speaker 0: Right that scene.

390
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:52,920
Speaker 0: well in that scene after he takes Darth Vader's helmet off it looks like he has a harmonica.

391
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:55,147
Speaker 0: we just it was.

392
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:59,327
Speaker 0: you start watching this video right and Luke takes his helmet off.

393
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,980
Speaker 0: It takes Darth Vader's helmet off and It it's the same scene is just right from the movie.

394
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,225
Speaker 0: No editing and rim.

395
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:12,775
Speaker 0: we're watching it together and rim says harmonica and I just kind of nod in agreement Like yeah, it's the harmonic is always a lot of lead-up.

396
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:13,740
Speaker 1: like it shows the whole scene.

397
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,979
Speaker 1: so, you know, we see we know it's a funny video something.

398
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,274
Speaker 1: but After a few, you know, I'm watching and watching.

399
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:25,220
Speaker 1: I kind of forget that This is supposed to be some funny video and all I'm thinking is man Star Wars is awesome.

400
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:26,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, man, the scene was awesome.

401
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:31,664
Speaker 1: And then I say out loud, you know, I always think whenever I see the scene He's got.

402
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:34,380
Speaker 0: I think you just said the word harmonica, but I said something like that.

403
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I nodded in knowing agreement like it looks like harmonica.

404
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,740
Speaker 0: Everyone always thinks it looks like a harmonica.

405
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,755
Speaker 1: I think the prop might have been a harmonica, but I digress.

406
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:43,358
Speaker 0: it could have been.

407
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:46,330
Speaker 0: they could have harmonica in that in that costume there.

408
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:53,069
Speaker 0: and then the video happens and We lulled quite a bit perhaps even rofl.

409
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,080
Speaker 1: it caught me off guard and that's kind of surprising.

410
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:59,880
Speaker 0: Yep, even though we should have read the title of the video would have given it away.

411
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:02,260
Speaker 1: I did and I just didn't put two and two together.

412
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,968
Speaker 0: I didn't put two and two together till it happened.

413
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:06,318
Speaker 1: then I was like and I almost fell over laughing.

414
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:08,044
Speaker 1: Yes It's wonderful.

415
00:24:08,265 --> 00:24:09,308
Speaker 0: It is quite see I think.

416
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:09,810
Speaker 0: let.

417
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,780
Speaker 0: yesterday you had a. you had an example of the lateral thinking humor.

418
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,780
Speaker 0: You take one thing you find another thing that matches and you put them together in a mash-up or remix.

419
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,167
Speaker 0: What this is?

420
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:32,080
Speaker 0: this is sort of like an inner thinking Discovery or realization sort of like an epiphany Humor in where you find something that everyone thinks in their mind, you know, everyone watching this.

421
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,924
Speaker 0: Thanks harmonica.

422
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:36,040
Speaker 0: when they see that, you know, that's what they think but no one says it.

423
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,000
Speaker 0: It's not really like, you know, something that's loud and about but it's it's something everyone thinks when they see something deep inside of them.

424
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,126
Speaker 0: This is what's on their mind.

425
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:45,480
Speaker 0: So you take what's deep inside people's minds?

426
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:57,972
Speaker 0: You know when they see something and you make it a reality and you put it right in their face Right up there into the conscious area right up front and when that happens people like oh my god That guy thinks the same thing.

427
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:05,540
Speaker 0: I thought oh And then if a lot of people think that same thing that you think deep inside and you bring it you bring it out.

428
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:06,687
Speaker 0: That's a big hit.

429
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,659
Speaker 0: So it's a way to make the funnies happen.

430
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,480
Speaker 0: Yep, and you don't see it too often because it takes a lot of cleverness and a lot of trickiness.

431
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,820
Speaker 1: So I found this a while ago and I honestly couldn't find anything worthwhile today.

432
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,059
Speaker 1: So this was kind of a backup thing of the day.

433
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:26,966
Speaker 1: It's not the best thing in the world and mostly I make it my thing today cuz the goddamn song gets stuck in my head Anytime I hear it.

434
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,195
Speaker 0: It's not even the best song.

435
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:28,840
Speaker 0: It's okay.

436
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:37,875
Speaker 1: Well thing is this is one of those things that it's a really good concept and it's executed really well Except for a few critical areas where it kind of falls short.

437
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:38,900
Speaker 1: the shitty animation.

438
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,426
Speaker 1: The animation is not that bad like.

439
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:47,473
Speaker 1: parts of it are really dumb and parts of it are really really funny and awesome And it's kind of hard to place how good this thing is overall.

440
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:49,280
Speaker 0: It's it's slightly above average.

441
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,093
Speaker 0: You won't be like saying wow, this is crap and not worth looking at but it's not like some amazing thing Like oh man's like - yeah

442
00:25:56,442 --> 00:26:06,300
Speaker 1: Though the song is pretty catchy and the only problem with it is that they needed someone who was better at mixing I think to make all the different tracks sit volume wise relative to each other better.

443
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:07,983
Speaker 0: But yeah There's definitely like.

444
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:12,362
Speaker 0: you can't hear what the people are saying because the music is louder than the talk that the vocals and they got to Make.

445
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:13,197
Speaker 0: they got to figure that out.

446
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:26,737
Speaker 1: Also, it's one of those things where if you've played the game and while I haven't I am in tune enough with digi game culture to know to what they're referring and I get the impression that if you have played this game the reference they are making is one of those.

447
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,224
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I Remember that.

448
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:31,430
Speaker 1: it's so true.

449
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:33,239
Speaker 0: I can't believe you haven't played Super Mario RPG.

450
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,146
Speaker 1: I remember once the Super Nintendo was kind of in his waning years I gave up console gaming.

451
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:40,571
Speaker 1: a hundred percent didn't even bother with.

452
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:44,805
Speaker 0: the n64 was a game that came out late in the Super Nintendo Is life but it is.

453
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:50,365
Speaker 0: Pratt is like the only game made by Nintendo and Square together and it is an awesome game I don't doubt it.

454
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:59,900
Speaker 0: I all the other games likes Paper Mario and Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga and all those games spawn from Mario RPG.

455
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,150
Speaker 0: Originally, this is the first one.

456
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,160
Speaker 1: It's just by the time that game came out.

457
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,419
Speaker 1: I was playing PC games a hundred percent all the time.

458
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:10,500
Speaker 0: No, you got to be got to be going back to play the Mario RPG, right?

459
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:24,320
Speaker 1: So speaking of playing computer games all the time There's one game that we talk about every now and then called tribes 2 which I'm of the opinion was the best Multiplayer first-person shooter experience the world has ever seen.

460
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:30,600
Speaker 0: Yeah The unmodified tribes 2 in the early days of its release before it got fucked over which we'll talk about.

461
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:38,562
Speaker 0: Finally the whole details of if we haven't talked about it before Was perhaps the most fun most amazing FPS.

462
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:44,200
Speaker 1: it was a game where the skill cap was beyond what many humans could achieve.

463
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:50,240
Speaker 1: The strategy cap was to the point of rivaling actual real-world strategy.

464
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:55,042
Speaker 1: Yep, the the scale of the game the number of players per team It was.

465
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:58,257
Speaker 1: it was everything that planetside should have been.

466
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:01,590
Speaker 0: yeah Basically, the only problems with the game is number.

467
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:06,820
Speaker 0: besides, you know before it got fucked up Was that it was pretty hard to play for nubs.

468
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,960
Speaker 0: You mean if you're a nub this game is pretty complicated and you were gonna have a hard time figuring it out.

469
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,680
Speaker 1: Oh, if you had never played an FPS You couldn't play this game and not even if you had played net.

470
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:22,200
Speaker 1: Never played a complicated FPS like weapons factory or one of those team fortresses you probably couldn't play this game.

471
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:26,560
Speaker 0: Yep, but yeah other than that this game was pretty awesome.

472
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:36,863
Speaker 0: I mean there are a few Deficiencies and like the way the vehicles worked that that games now like actually halo and unreal tournament have fixed the vehicles and those Games work.

473
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:42,560
Speaker 0: the way vehicles should work in FPS is a half-life 2 also, but other than that tribes to the bomb.

474
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:50,086
Speaker 1: So the game was awesome and pretty much from when it came out Until the thing happened.

475
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,535
Speaker 1: I played that game more than I did anything else in my life.

476
00:28:53,716 --> 00:29:01,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, come home and play it Every day for our play between our asses and our skip classes to keep playing.

477
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:15,680
Speaker 1: Yep And like I'd come home from a class and Scott was already home skipping playing the game and I just without a word I'd sit down at my computer drone every server He was on and start setting up a remote base for him to stop at before he throws the satchel charge in the generator.

478
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:16,760
Speaker 0: Oh my sassle charges.

479
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:22,495
Speaker 0: Alright, but anyway The game had one other interesting thing that not too many games before it had.

480
00:29:22,535 --> 00:29:31,569
Speaker 0: I think it might actually been the first game to Have this in which you know how you have a get a get you get a multiplayer game and in the multiplayer game There's an interface that allows you to find servers to play on.

481
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,134
Speaker 0: Okay tribes to had that.

482
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:36,846
Speaker 0: they also had forums Built into the game.

483
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:40,379
Speaker 0: counter-strike had forums, but the counter-strike forums are at counter - strike net.

484
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,269
Speaker 0: So not everyone who played counter-strike was on the forums.

485
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the.

486
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:46,540
Speaker 1: everything was integrated into the game.

487
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,706
Speaker 1: You had your own little world.

488
00:29:47,867 --> 00:29:50,500
Speaker 1: You can make lanes were integrated into the game.

489
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,226
Speaker 0: You can make clans in the game.

490
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:56,520
Speaker 0: You could email other players within the game with your special tribes to email.

491
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:57,142
Speaker 0: It was.

492
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:02,317
Speaker 0: it was a. you could customize your guy and a whole bunch of other stuff from within the game.

493
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:07,476
Speaker 0: and that When I first installed the game and I saw that I said wow, that's freaking awesome.

494
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:08,560
Speaker 0: That is freaking awesome.

495
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,082
Speaker 0: I love that.

496
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:18,959
Speaker 1: now here is what happened to tribes - So they had all this setup and people are playing the game and the game was stupid popular for obvious reasons.

497
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:19,823
Speaker 0: I mean tribes.

498
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:20,366
Speaker 0: one was stupid.

499
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:25,999
Speaker 0: popular tribes - came out and sold out and People are playing it like crazy and people playing it like crazy.

500
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:31,120
Speaker 1: Yeah This is one of the a PC game before you know steam really took off where it kept selling out.

501
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,932
Speaker 1: You couldn't buy it in a lot of places for a while.

502
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:38,360
Speaker 1: Yep, at least a short while a few weeks Yeah, but that was a while in the span of this game.

503
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,180
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but as time went on the developers actually kept a close eye on the community.

504
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:47,120
Speaker 0: Well, the community was sort of you know on their servers in their game.

505
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,690
Speaker 0: So they they paid attention to what went on in those forums.

506
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:50,675
Speaker 0: They moderated them.

507
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:51,980
Speaker 0: They talked to people.

508
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:54,980
Speaker 0: They they were all out and about within the game, which is pretty cool.

509
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,399
Speaker 1: You want the developers to be close to the community like every game out there that has any sort of community about it.

510
00:31:01,142 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 1: Certain percentage of the people who play the game bitch about various aspects of it.

511
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,390
Speaker 0: Oh, man, it's been fused to shoots too slow.

512
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,700
Speaker 0: Oh, man, the heavy could go a little faster.

513
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,499
Speaker 0: Oh, man, the one of the vehicles work this way.

514
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:14,989
Speaker 0: Why doesn't that work this way in every multiplayer game?

515
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,751
Speaker 1: The world is seen.

516
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:21,484
Speaker 0: since internet communities came about I have isn't any multiplayer game Requiring skill.

517
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,793
Speaker 0: I think I think there are some multiplayer games.

518
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,360
Speaker 1: It also happens in World of Warcraft.

519
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:31,048
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is that it all it does happen in games that don't require skill But you won't get this kind of bitching in some other.

520
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,258
Speaker 0: there are some multiplayer games where you won't get bitching.

521
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:37,109
Speaker 0: No one complains about how pac-man verse works.

522
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,195
Speaker 1: I'll bet there are people who already are.

523
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:40,600
Speaker 1: really I'll bet there.

524
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:41,424
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

525
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:45,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, so they watched this community.

526
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:51,540
Speaker 1: Hey, well first I should say that I'd say about a quarter of these sort of bitchy complaints are probably kind of valid.

527
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,645
Speaker 0: I mean there were.

528
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,580
Speaker 0: the game wasn't perfect and there were some valid.

529
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:58,940
Speaker 0: You know things you could have done to the game to make it even better.

530
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:04,187
Speaker 1: but in any game the majority of the complaints about a game are Really not legitimate.

531
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:06,420
Speaker 1: and you might say but rim it's a subjective thing.

532
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:10,873
Speaker 1: If someone likes X in a game Then they could complain about X being not the way they want it to be.

533
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:22,259
Speaker 1: and while that would be true I think the fundamental problem here is that a lot of people in all seriousness Don't actually understand what they want and what they think they want is not fun for them.

534
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:31,815
Speaker 0: Yep, for example, you got someone right who's playing Counter-strike, right and they say take out the AWP.

535
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,060
Speaker 0: It sucks, right?

536
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 0: Well, the what they're really saying is I don't know how to avoid getting shot by snipers.

537
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,439
Speaker 0: Take them out of the game so that the game is now easy for me.

538
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:48,499
Speaker 0: And if they let's say they did that Let's say they took the AWP out of the game, right?

539
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:53,776
Speaker 0: If this person would either a their only weakness was that they couldn't avoid snipers.

540
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:54,980
Speaker 0: now, they're gods of the game.

541
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,589
Speaker 0: It's too easy and there's no point for then They'll get bored of it really quick as they'll just own everybody or B They actually sucked and it was just they suck so much.

542
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,848
Speaker 0: snipers killed them for any of the other weaknesses were made aware to them And they'll die from some other thing.

543
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:11,860
Speaker 0: and all they're really saying is I suck at this game.

544
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:14,420
Speaker 0: Please make it easier for me so I can win.

545
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,845
Speaker 0: It's not fun because I can't win.

546
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:21,204
Speaker 0: and part of that comes from the fact you have a multiplayer game Where skill matters.

547
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,856
Speaker 0: and if you have multiplayer game where skill matters unlike a single-player game, right?

548
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:31,180
Speaker 0: Let's say you have a single-player game You can just if the single-player game throws the same thing at you every time.

549
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,120
Speaker 0: It doesn't get harder unless you change the difficulty setting, right?

550
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,320
Speaker 0: So once you figure out you raise your skill level up to beat the single-player game.

551
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:42,672
Speaker 0: You can eventually beat it by just playing and playing and playing it.

552
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:43,294
Speaker 0: so you get better.

553
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:44,800
Speaker 0: in a multiplayer game.

554
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,994
Speaker 0: Everyone is getting better at.

555
00:33:47,256 --> 00:33:58,420
Speaker 0: you know varying rates depending on how much they play and how what their talents are and how good they are and some people Will never be good enough to win again in a game and counter-strike.

556
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,972
Speaker 0: There's some people just no matter how hard they try.

557
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:07,638
Speaker 0: if they play counter-strike They'll just get killed right away and it will not be fun for them because they'll just constantly lose because they suck.

558
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,719
Speaker 0: and The only way to make it fun for them is to make the game so easy that they can actually play.

559
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:16,418
Speaker 1: So basically make it unreal tournament, right?

560
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:26,161
Speaker 0: So they may all they make all these complaints, you know that are like take out the AWP Make the map like this and those are just you know Reactions to.

561
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:29,210
Speaker 0: they can recognize that they law.

562
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:32,520
Speaker 0: they stay died this time because of something in the game.

563
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,708
Speaker 0: You know, it's like take out the goombas of Mario.

564
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:35,833
Speaker 0: I just died on a goomba.

565
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:36,777
Speaker 0: take out the pits.

566
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:38,226
Speaker 0: in Mario I just fell in a pit.

567
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:39,897
Speaker 0: take out the Koopas.

568
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,938
Speaker 0: in Mario I just got hit by a bouncing shell.

569
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:55,458
Speaker 0: When the real answer is don't touch the goombas don't fall in the holes and don't get it by the bouncing shells Well, if you give these people their way eventually Mario will just be a flat plane with no bad guys No holes, no nothing and a flag at the end.

570
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:59,759
Speaker 1: Well the thing is I mean that that is definitely true to a degree but there are a lot of other.

571
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:03,958
Speaker 1: I mean Sometimes people just don't understand what makes a game fun like they play a game and they think they like it.

572
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:14,400
Speaker 1: Let's take Team Fortress 2 as an example because the primary complaint that people have on the internet about the game now At least the normal stupid people is that there are no grenades.

573
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 1: well, I bring back grenades like every other Team Fortress game and What they don't seem to understand is one that Grenades were taken out of the game because the way grenades worked in every Team Fortress style game hitherto

574
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:26,881
Speaker 0: was

575
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:41,443
Speaker 1: just a programmatic way to have things that are interesting in the game like the grenade object was all they had to work with and Those things that you're missed weren't really grenades or they didn't function the way you thought they were to the purpose they served in.

576
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:48,012
Speaker 1: the game could be served in a better way and Like the unintended consequence of bringing back grenades.

577
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:48,715
Speaker 1: I mean sure.

578
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:49,980
Speaker 1: Oh the game will be more interesting.

579
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:57,279
Speaker 1: I have more options as a character But now the game is all spammy like a lot of older TFC kind of games are.

580
00:35:57,339 --> 00:35:59,033
Speaker 0: yep This explosion is good or bad.

581
00:35:59,074 --> 00:35:59,760
Speaker 1: It could go either way.

582
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,584
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it would be

583
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,027
Speaker 0: bad, but

584
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:14,399
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people who were saying hey they took out grenades don't realize the far-reaching ramifications putting grenades back in would have and the fact that it Might make the game less fun for them, even though they think it would make it more fun.

585
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you added grenades back to tf2 just if you gave everyone normal grenades, right?

586
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,968
Speaker 0: There's like a normal throwing grenade like well one.

587
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,420
Speaker 1: There's no point being a demo man anymore, right?

588
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,901
Speaker 0: There's no point being a demo man There's.

589
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:31,062
Speaker 1: not everyone can do what you do because the game is so small as in all the maps are really tiny and all the Player-models are really big.

590
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:32,485
Speaker 1: if you spam it up.

591
00:36:32,785 --> 00:36:35,169
Speaker 1: You can just kill everyone trivially and no one can get anywhere.

592
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:42,540
Speaker 0: Yep, and another thing is That if you everyone has a grenade then the classes really aren't all that different.

593
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,020
Speaker 0: I mean the scout is supposed to be a wuss who's not supposed to be able to do that much damage.

594
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,380
Speaker 0: You just be able to move fast to get the intelligence or whatever if you give him grenades.

595
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,334
Speaker 0: Now the scout is suddenly super dangerous because he can run in with grenades.

596
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:58,340
Speaker 0: and if you give the heavy grenades Well the heavy can already do a shit ton of damage.

597
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:06,180
Speaker 0: He doesn't need grenades, but actually it gives the heavy an advantage in that now The the heavy is really not so good at taking out turrets.

598
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,425
Speaker 0: That's a weakness of the heavy.

599
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:11,640
Speaker 0: if you give them grenades is gonna be taking out turrets, especially around corners.

600
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,640
Speaker 0: In fact, everyone will be doing that and the engineer will be mad weak, even though he has grenades.

601
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:27,770
Speaker 0: People don't you know, they're not game designers They're people who just play a game and they have sort of this gut reaction of what they think is Bothering them about the game something that's making it unfun for them.

602
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,894
Speaker 0: Let's make an analogy.

603
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,700
Speaker 1: say you're playing chess, right?

604
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, and for whatever reason you think you know, this is boring the way it is.

605
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:39,899
Speaker 1: Why don't we make it so that the knight can also move for like one diagonal space?

606
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you think oh that'll make it fun.

607
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:43,857
Speaker 1: It'll make it interesting It'll make it different.

608
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:53,078
Speaker 1: But the the way that that will affect gameplay in the short and long term Will make the game so completely different that it's not even chess anymore at all.

609
00:37:53,399 --> 00:38:05,705
Speaker 0: Yep It's like people who play Monopoly and then they want to do the money on free parking business and they they just don't realize That that makes the game completely different, you know, well completely random Yep, and completely stupid.

610
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:09,556
Speaker 0: and they don't consider the because they're not game designers.

611
00:38:09,576 --> 00:38:11,060
Speaker 0: They don't really know about game design.

612
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,619
Speaker 0: They don't consider the ramifications of the things they demand.

613
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:15,967
Speaker 1: So what happened with tribes?

614
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:20,320
Speaker 1: - well developers watch this little community and they paid attention.

615
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,634
Speaker 1: I mean, it's almost that they tried too hard to please their audience.

616
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:35,600
Speaker 1: They would see people make a complaint and Almost no matter what if someone made a complaint at all They would look into it and they started making changes and they started making more changes.

617
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:35,781
Speaker 1: Yeah

618
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:53,480
Speaker 0: patches to the game didn't just improve, you know bugs in the game They and some things they change were for the better but a Lot of the patches to the game that were forced you had to get them in order to keep playing online because they had a centralized Meetup matchup server Would make change the rules of the game for the worse.

619
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:58,096
Speaker 1: Yep, they made weapons faster slower and they changed vehicles and they changed damages.

620
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,400
Speaker 0: They changed the way you moved.

621
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,008
Speaker 0: They changed the way you did things.

622
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:01,672
Speaker 0: they changed it.

623
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,160
Speaker 0: So you couldn't do certain things.

624
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,340
Speaker 0: They they made certain, you know items in the game useless or more or less powerful.

625
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:17,036
Speaker 1: They pretty much listen to what all the people who played the game said without really considering The ramifications or think trying to think about.

626
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,649
Speaker 1: okay Why would this person say that?

627
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:21,578
Speaker 1: and what would happen if I did?

628
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:28,400
Speaker 1: Go like cave to their will or maybe I should look into a way to make them have more fun without Changing that fundamental part of the game.

629
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they.

630
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:34,140
Speaker 0: you make a game right and you you change the gameplay and you change the rules and you test it.

631
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,485
Speaker 0: I mean this happens at any game.

632
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:47,133
Speaker 0: even the best game designer in the world comes up with a game and they keep tweaking the Rules and they keep Playtesting until they figure out the exact right rules of the game to make it the most awesome and the most fun you know as far as they can see.

633
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:54,067
Speaker 0: if You then release the game and then you just sort of change a rule on the fly You didn't test that change.

634
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:55,613
Speaker 0: You didn't go through play testing.

635
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,360
Speaker 0: You don't know the game developers.

636
00:39:57,683 --> 00:40:04,980
Speaker 0: It's like they change the rules of the game without Testing and having a lot of playtime with those new rules to see how that would affect the game.

637
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,559
Speaker 0: They just implemented changes according to the demand of the the game players and didn't think about.

638
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,911
Speaker 0: you know Neither the players nor the developers thought about how that would change the game.

639
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:16,300
Speaker 1: kind of like if Alan Greenspan would you know?

640
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,220
Speaker 1: Listen to what the Ron Paul people said about the economy and did like, you know people complaining.

641
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:24,805
Speaker 1: Oh, we got to go back to the gold standards like yeah I'll try this gold standard.

642
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:27,756
Speaker 1: people seem to be complaining about the current system that works perfectly.

643
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:28,719
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's recessions.

644
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can vote for skin a little little if you want.

645
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:35,520
Speaker 1: there should be a recession a little aside.

646
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,926
Speaker 1: The gold standard is stupid.

647
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:41,045
Speaker 1: if you're a proponent of it do some research and if you still think that it's a good idea You're stupid.

648
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:42,439
Speaker 1: Yep, but I digress.

649
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,087
Speaker 1: So the moral here is pretty simple.

650
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,919
Speaker 1: game design is not an easy thing to do at all.

651
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:56,060
Speaker 1: I mean, that's why in Germany It's such a big deal and the good board games are always made by the same group of people.

652
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:59,293
Speaker 1: It's like those people are the Steven Spielberg's of board game making.

653
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,117
Speaker 1: they understand it.

654
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:00,800
Speaker 1: They're good at it.

655
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a reason that Rainer Canisia is like a professor and why most of his games are a lot of fun.

656
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:11,140
Speaker 0: He has knowledge of how to design games in a way that makes them fun and interesting.

657
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:20,612
Speaker 1: Game developers really have to walk a fine line because the game developer can't just go along with their vision a hundred percent Because if that doesn't jive with what the players want no one's gonna play their game.

658
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:34,176
Speaker 1: Yep, but if they give the players Everything they want all the time The game won't end up being a game anymore and it won't end up being a good game Simply because the majority of players who aren't game designers don't understand what it is that makes a game good.

659
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:36,804
Speaker 1: granted a lot of times Developers fall prey to this.

660
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:43,677
Speaker 1: I think the most horrifying example in the history of gaming was Wario aware for the Wii.

661
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:53,679
Speaker 0: Are you aware for the GameCube was just like this masterpiece game as far as well For the GameCube is funny because it's exactly the same as Wari aware for the GBA.

662
00:41:54,122 --> 00:42:00,780
Speaker 0: However it on the GameCube, of course You play it on your television and you could use a GBA with the link cable or a GameCube controller.

663
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,337
Speaker 0: But it also had this multiplayer mode tacked on.

664
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,462
Speaker 1: yeah I mean think about it.

665
00:42:05,503 --> 00:42:10,100
Speaker 1: Wari aware was a in my opinion pretty crappy game like single-player wasn't interesting.

666
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:15,220
Speaker 0: It was worth the play, but it wasn't worth like paying full price and playing it a lot and it was moderately popular.

667
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:16,871
Speaker 1: I think it was really popular in Japan.

668
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:18,100
Speaker 1: I don't remember the figures off hand.

669
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,320
Speaker 0: Well, it's a good, you know casual kind of game.

670
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, well plus it was goonie and it was the kind of thing that sells really well in Japan.

671
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of those kinds of games.

672
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:25,867
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

673
00:42:26,268 --> 00:42:28,015
Speaker 1: So alright, the game was popular.

674
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,460
Speaker 1: Let's make a GameCube version.

675
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,325
Speaker 1: Hey, why don't we throw some multiplayer in?

676
00:42:31,827 --> 00:42:36,259
Speaker 1: the GameCube version sold like crazy and was super popular and stupid.

677
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:38,869
Speaker 0: amazing I don't know if it's sold like crazy, but it was.

678
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:40,536
Speaker 0: it was a really amazing.

679
00:42:40,596 --> 00:42:41,640
Speaker 1: It was a really high selling game.

680
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:49,094
Speaker 1: It wasn't like a. it wasn't like oh my god This game sold out eight times, but it sold really well a lot better than they expected.

681
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:50,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, so alright.

682
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:52,639
Speaker 1: Well that game went really well.

683
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:56,796
Speaker 1: And now we got the Wii and the Wii has this controller that is perfect for that.

684
00:42:57,177 --> 00:42:57,980
Speaker 1: and look at the internet.

685
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:08,834
Speaker 1: everyone's buzzing about Wario aware for the Wii and how absolutely awesome that would be and how they look forward to it with every breath because people were Really talking about oh man Wario aware for the Wii is gonna be the best thing ever.

686
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:11,992
Speaker 1: and then they thought alright let's make Wario aware.

687
00:43:12,013 --> 00:43:16,648
Speaker 1: and They looked at it, and they said all right What made Mario Wario aware?

688
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:17,170
Speaker 1: popular.

689
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,720
Speaker 0: see there was no forum for Wario aware.

690
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,754
Speaker 0: So they had to go basically on what they thought made Wario aware.

691
00:43:23,794 --> 00:43:28,075
Speaker 0: fun and try to you know Have more of that and less of the stuff that made Wario were not fun.

692
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:31,690
Speaker 0: it to be honest Why are you aware for the GameCube as awesome as it was with its?

693
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,220
Speaker 0: what like 12 multiplayer modes or something like that?

694
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,202
Speaker 0: Yeah, only like.

695
00:43:35,303 --> 00:43:39,780
Speaker 0: three of those multiplayer modes were any good the turtles the disco and the Othello.

696
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,386
Speaker 1: But those three were just.

697
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:42,791
Speaker 0: ah they were amazing.

698
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:43,795
Speaker 0: the jump rope was okay.

699
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:52,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, the jump rope was just really fun Yeah, but other than that all the other multiplayer modes like the doctor and the balloon and I don't even know the other ones.

700
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,663
Speaker 0: Cuz you know play.

701
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:53,948
Speaker 1: this is actually pretty fun.

702
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:54,832
Speaker 0: It's okay.

703
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:55,534
Speaker 0: It's okay.

704
00:43:55,595 --> 00:43:56,860
Speaker 0: It wasn't as bad as the Wii one.

705
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,441
Speaker 0: No wasn't.

706
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:09,864
Speaker 1: but they thought that what made Wario aware popular and made it good was the minigames themselves and the Part of it that was.

707
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:10,265
Speaker 1: see.

708
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:13,675
Speaker 1: the thing is they thought that that was the important part when it wasn't.

709
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:19,279
Speaker 1: the important part was the Minor add-on that they threw into the GameCube one probably just for the hell of it.

710
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,520
Speaker 1: Like that was what made that game good and they didn't realize it.

711
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,564
Speaker 1: So they didn't focus on that and as a result Wario aware for the Wii had crap multiplayer to the point that the game was Unplayable.

712
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:30,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the multiplayer and Wari aware for the Wii.

713
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,729
Speaker 0: I think we've said it before but you have the big but you have to pass around the remote And you're supposed to wear the wrist strap.

714
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:38,975
Speaker 0: what the fuck were you thinking?

715
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:45,180
Speaker 0: and second of all None of the modes are actually modes where skill determines who wins.

716
00:44:46,022 --> 00:44:46,324
Speaker 0: It's all.

717
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:48,360
Speaker 0: it's most of the modes are you know?

718
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,422
Speaker 0: I mean the one mode where skill matters if you win is single elimination They got.

719
00:44:52,443 --> 00:45:03,325
Speaker 0: people want to play a bunch of gay of games at the same time And they want to see who is the best at playing these games and whoever was the best should win and everyone should get to Play a lot of games.

720
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,720
Speaker 1: They got the right things wrong and the wrong things, right?

721
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:11,537
Speaker 1: Yep, and sadly the game tanked and there's a. there's a wealth of single-player content in the game.

722
00:45:11,898 --> 00:45:14,971
Speaker 1: gobs of it But no one gives a shit about that.

723
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:20,480
Speaker 1: the one thing we all want it isn't in the game And as a result the game was hated and I still don't think they realize it.

724
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,122
Speaker 1: I don't know.

725
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:24,576
Speaker 1: think the developers in Nintendo thought why didn't Wario were sell in the

726
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:24,878
Speaker 1: u.s.?

727
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:25,460
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

728
00:45:25,761 --> 00:45:27,086
Speaker 0: I don't think I think it did sell.

729
00:45:27,146 --> 00:45:27,608
Speaker 0: it's just that.

730
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:33,700
Speaker 0: well it sold and then everyone who bought it Really everyone who bought it played it through and then stopped playing.

731
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,100
Speaker 1: I was so disappointed that I pretty much stopped playing it after a week.

732
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, I beat the whole game and like a couple days, and then I was done.

733
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:42,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I haven't played it since.

734
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:46,199
Speaker 1: That was one of the biggest disappointments in recent gaming history for me.

735
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,556
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty disappointing right there, but when it comes down to is that you have.

736
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:58,037
Speaker 0: when you make a game You can't be listening to the stupid players who don't know what the hell's going on.

737
00:45:58,077 --> 00:46:04,156
Speaker 0: and stupid players Don't go whining about a game that you think you can make it better because you can't.

738
00:46:04,497 --> 00:46:06,365
Speaker 0: you're not a game designer You don't know shit.

739
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:07,551
Speaker 0: You're just a game player.

740
00:46:07,712 --> 00:46:08,195
Speaker 0: What do you know?

741
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:09,120
Speaker 0: You don't know anything?

742
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're just gonna make your game crappy.

743
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:11,604
Speaker 0: You got a thing.

744
00:46:11,664 --> 00:46:23,019
Speaker 0: if you really do want to make a suggestion as to how your game could be made better Don't just make your gut reaction like you'll play in a game And you know let's say you know in your feel something like oh this parts too hard, or I don't like this part.

745
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,840
Speaker 0: well That's good thinking, but don't just go with the first thing that comes to mind like oh this part is too hard.

746
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:33,740
Speaker 0: Because blah you know actually think what makes this game fun.

747
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:36,092
Speaker 0: What do I like about this game that you mean?

748
00:46:36,113 --> 00:46:37,420
Speaker 0: if you're complaining about a game?

749
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,999
Speaker 0: You must like it enough that you want to keep playing it and you know for some reason if you really hated it You just would stop playing.

750
00:46:45,004 --> 00:46:49,671
Speaker 0: So there's something about the game that's fun for you And if the game is not fun for you in some way right?

751
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:52,100
Speaker 0: think about why it's not fun.

752
00:46:52,461 --> 00:47:03,340
Speaker 0: And if the answer is because you don't have enough skills, and you're losing all the time Maybe you just don't like games that require more skill than you have and you should play a different game.

753
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:04,533
Speaker 1: It's not always that I think.

754
00:47:04,593 --> 00:47:05,541
Speaker 1: most of the time It's just.

755
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:06,866
Speaker 1: it's much more benign.

756
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,276
Speaker 1: people just they feel that something's wrong with the game.

757
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:15,540
Speaker 1: there may well be something wrong But they don't understand really like what maybe like what's the important part of what's the core part of the game?

758
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:25,282
Speaker 1: or what makes the game what it is or makes it good and They'll complain about an aspect not realizing that changing that aspect would completely change the game in ways that they would never even Expect.

759
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:32,899
Speaker 0: and when you if you finally do come to a conclusion as to what you think will make the game better in some Way to fix what's wrong with it because you know game might have something wrong with it.

760
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,738
Speaker 0: Actually think long and hard about what the whole game would be like if you change that.

761
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,160
Speaker 0: one thing I mean like yeah Wouldn't it be cool if I could play Galaga?

762
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:47,480
Speaker 0: Where my ship could shoot like a million bullets a second and I could just move back and forth killing all the bad guys.

763
00:47:47,964 --> 00:47:49,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be pretty fun.

764
00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:55,997
Speaker 0: for like two seconds I would get the high score and then every level I just wouldn't be able to get hit and I would kill all the bad guys immediately because I shot so fast.

765
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,568
Speaker 1: or maybe I Should have missiles and upgrades and all that.

766
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's great.

767
00:47:59,553 --> 00:48:01,240
Speaker 1: But now Galaga is too complicated to play.

768
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a fine line.

769
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:02,979
Speaker 0: You got it.

770
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,651
Speaker 0: really think about these things.

771
00:48:04,812 --> 00:48:22,303
Speaker 0: game design is very complicated and is not for the faint of heart and a lot of people just go on forums on the internet and Spread their knee-jerk reactions around and good Game developers like at valve ignore what the fuck you say because they know they're better than you and they've proved that every time Again,

772
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,219
Speaker 1: so what should valve do to make Team Fortress 2 better?

773
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:38,204
Speaker 0: Cuz I got to admit I have a lot of opinions about the game and I like it but I think what it is is that they have designed the game in such a way where it is very fun and What they were going for.

774
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:40,149
Speaker 0: I think they have gotten exactly.

775
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:40,811
Speaker 1: I think one.

776
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:44,480
Speaker 1: they're going for a console FPS and not a PC FPS.

777
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:50,760
Speaker 0: Yep, they're going for a game where the skills of first-person shooting matter, but don't matter that much.

778
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:54,795
Speaker 0: I mean fatality will not be any better at Team Fortress 2 than rim.

779
00:48:55,056 --> 00:49:04,411
Speaker 0: rim could compete with Fatality at Team Fortress 2, but if you were to say play quake one rim would not get a single frag and he would be Oh god, I couldn't even get frags against my friend.

780
00:49:04,472 --> 00:49:06,722
Speaker 0: You probably couldn't even spawn Why.

781
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:12,489
Speaker 1: I remember when like Dan would shoot me and knock me into the air and I would say alright And I tried to shoot at him.

782
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:19,833
Speaker 1: I'd land on the grenade He had thrown I didn't realize it which knocked me into the air into the rocket He had shot at just the right time which knocked me into the wall.

783
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:21,060
Speaker 1: then I landed on the other grenade.

784
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:21,398
Speaker 0: Yep.

785
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:27,040
Speaker 0: So I think there's not only is anything wrong with Team Fortress 2 as they have made it and as they want it.

786
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:37,200
Speaker 0: The thing is is that I as Scott want a game that requires a great deal of skill in which there is a high skill Cap where fatality would own me and I would own any.

787
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:44,520
Speaker 1: See thing is I want either a high skill cap in tactics or a high skill cap in FPS skills or a combination of the two.

788
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,176
Speaker 1: I just feel like Team Fortress 2 skill cap is very low.

789
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:55,599
Speaker 1: and the strategies I mean while it still works out in the beta in the pubs because almost everyone playing the game is a total noob and just Doesn't understand how to play.

790
00:49:56,562 --> 00:50:00,119
Speaker 1: There are pretty trivial optimal strategies for this game.

791
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:07,360
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's not that hard to Make a team win all the time if you can get even three or four people to listen to what you say.

792
00:50:07,522 --> 00:50:10,126
Speaker 0: Yes on a public server You assume most of the players are idiots.

793
00:50:10,447 --> 00:50:15,739
Speaker 0: if you can get like three people to organize a little bit and actually do something Intelligent you can win.

794
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:16,403
Speaker 0: I mean hell.

795
00:50:16,866 --> 00:50:27,970
Speaker 0: the people on the pubs are so dumb that I alone as a spy could capture the flag on a lot of servers all my own because I'm the only one who's actually trying and thinking about trying to win the game and the game we just played.

796
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,937
Speaker 1: the enemy team was like super defense.

797
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:36,180
Speaker 1: you had to capture the point and You know, they were like hammering hammering hammering and there were like three centuries guarding the capture point.

798
00:50:36,906 --> 00:50:48,760
Speaker 1: I just walked up as a spy Spot, you know disguised as an enemy soldier and I stayed there for like two three minutes getting healed by their medic all the time Every other than someone to shoot me once or twice, but I didn't react.

799
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,340
Speaker 1: So they just ignored me and then the medic would come and just heal me again.

800
00:50:51,440 --> 00:51:04,871
Speaker 1: And I just kind of stand there, you know, hey, I'm defending I'm defending and I just messaged my team alright guys in 15 seconds every single century over here is going down and Then I just tapped all the century stabbed everyone and we won.

801
00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:06,860
Speaker 1: Yep, that shouldn't happen.

802
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:08,003
Speaker 0: No, it shouldn't.

803
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,550
Speaker 0: and I think the prop the thing is right now.

804
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:14,760
Speaker 0: the the weakness of Team Fortress 2 is not so exposed because You're on these public server.

805
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:29,547
Speaker 0: It will be when clans start playing people start actually playing this game seriously and you have an entire organized team against another entire organized team and you get pretty much near constant stalemates and No one can really beat anyone else.

806
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:46,031
Speaker 0: because the only possible thing where if someone has a good strategy which is really easy to come up with it's pretty obvious and someone else is a good strategy and Their FPS skills don't come into play because everyone has the most FPS skill you can possibly have Who's gonna win out?

807
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,060
Speaker 0: it might come down to chance.

808
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:51,474
Speaker 0: It might come down to incredibly minute things that no one can control just sort of.

809
00:51:51,514 --> 00:52:00,920
Speaker 0: you know random bits here and there You know a quantum difference and it might come down to stalemates every time and it's it's really the the the problems will be exposed.

810
00:52:01,681 --> 00:52:04,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I could go on and on but I think the other that might.

811
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:16,697
Speaker 1: my opinion about the game is that in the long Run the game is going to start being unfun for people because while they have done a good thing and made the class is Super specialized and made each one like so unique that is the different play experience.

812
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:23,920
Speaker 1: all together Each class is limited to the point that I feel like everyone needs one more special weapon not a game breaker.

813
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:28,480
Speaker 1: Not like giving grenades to someone or giving the rocket launcher to someone who doesn't need it.

814
00:52:29,203 --> 00:52:32,118
Speaker 0: Most of the classes I think I think they're the engineer doesn't need anything else.

815
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:34,417
Speaker 1: yeah I don't even know if the medic needs anything else.

816
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:40,520
Speaker 1: maybe plague Maybe because that was a big part of the old team fortress kind of games.

817
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:45,174
Speaker 1: Yeah But I feel like the game if they made a little spy doesn't need anything else.

818
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:48,547
Speaker 1: now the spy the spy is the best freakin Spy in any team fortress game.

819
00:52:48,607 --> 00:52:52,920
Speaker 1: ever though if the spy had feigned death I think that would not hurt the game.

820
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:55,027
Speaker 0: But the the they need.

821
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:56,031
Speaker 0: I think the heavy needs.

822
00:52:56,171 --> 00:52:58,800
Speaker 0: one more thing the pyro definitely needs something more than anyone.

823
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:05,309
Speaker 0: the Demoman could use something the The soldier could use something the scout could use a little something.

824
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:13,900
Speaker 0: all right because basically what happens is they're so specialized That you know you pick a class and I want to keep the classes super differentiated.

825
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:20,540
Speaker 0: So the scout is still the fastest guy out there And he's still super different from everyone else and is still super weak against you know actually getting hit.

826
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:22,088
Speaker 1: I mean that's the important part of the game.

827
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:24,259
Speaker 1: the rock-paper-scissors classes can't disrupt that?

828
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:26,467
Speaker 0: no But when you're the scout there's only.

829
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:29,297
Speaker 0: really you only have a few one or two things you can do.

830
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:30,240
Speaker 0: period that's it.

831
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,639
Speaker 0: You can't do anything else.

832
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:36,739
Speaker 0: And it would be cool if you could if you had one more thing that you had available to you.

833
00:53:37,222 --> 00:53:43,350
Speaker 0: You could you one more option that you were still different But you could come up with something clever to do.

834
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,460
Speaker 0: you know there'd be more options in the game instead of oh he's a scout.

835
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,545
Speaker 0: I know exactly what he's gonna.

836
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:53,440
Speaker 0: If he doesn't do that I can ignore him because he'll be ineffective.

837
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,026
Speaker 0: You know this way people.

838
00:53:55,106 --> 00:54:02,553
Speaker 0: if there was one more thing if the pyro had one more fiery weapon Then he could do something interesting and people wouldn't know.

839
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:02,714
Speaker 0: it's.

840
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:03,015
Speaker 0: you know.

841
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:04,299
Speaker 0: the pyro might pull a clever trick.

842
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:09,620
Speaker 1: Who knows and that my friends is how to critique a video game to the developers as opposed to?

843
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:18,049
Speaker 0: Omg shotgun whores ban shotties fuckers Yep, ah Anything else to say about this stuff.

844
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:18,854
Speaker 1: I think that's it.

845
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:19,820
Speaker 1: Let's make some dinner.

846
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:29,718
