1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,106
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:10,468
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,200
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,529
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,960
Speaker 1: Tonight, Sailor Moon.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,579
Speaker 1: Because Scott had actually never seen any of it until now.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,397
Speaker 0: I saw some.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,598
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,010
Speaker 1: Also known as Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,410
Speaker 0: I meant you should have said that instead of any of the other stuff you said.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,650
Speaker 1: Instead of what other stuff?

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,250
Speaker 0: You should have just said tonight, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,329
Speaker 1: Oh, you're still mad about me doing long openers?

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,684
Speaker 1: Yes.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,849
Speaker 1: You're still mad about that?

16
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,730
Speaker 0: Are you trying to make up for the openers you're not doing because you're in Europe?

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:49,290
Speaker 1: They've got to be just long enough to make it through the pre-canned opening scroll that I got in the audio.

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,390
Speaker 0: You know, you can use a smaller can, right?

19
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,470
Speaker 0: If you only get so many beans, put them in a half-size tin.

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,581
Speaker 1: No, double tin.

21
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:56,149
Speaker 1: Double it up.

22
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:01,127
Speaker 1: I should release a DVD of just Geek Nights openers.

23
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,289
Speaker 0: Do whatever you're going to do.

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,113
Speaker 1: So yeah, there's a limited time for this, but if you're an anime fan, which I assume you are, why else would you listen to?

25
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:18,289
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Wednesdays, which was once the easiest Geek Nights to do, is now increasingly the second most...

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,330
Speaker 0: I've watched a ton of animes.

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,270
Speaker 0: Which one would you like to talk about that you haven't watched?

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,909
Speaker 1: Here's the trouble.

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,643
Speaker 1: How many animes have we collectively watched?

30
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:27,130
Speaker 1: if we reviewed all of them?

31
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:28,629
Speaker 1: That'd get us a month.

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,170
Speaker 1: Two months of shows.

33
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:32,669
Speaker 0: We only do like two anime shows a month at most.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

35
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:37,650
Speaker 0: You gotta watch like one or two anime a month to make Geek Nights happen.

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,329
Speaker 1: Yep, but we gotta watch enough to properly review them.

37
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:41,487
Speaker 0: It's enough.

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:51,270
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you're an anime fan at all, you know that other than pretty much Kill La Kill and Madoka Magica, the last great anime was Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,648
Speaker 1: I have since second gig and...

40
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,530
Speaker 0: Not counting movies.

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, not counting movies.

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,630
Speaker 1: Pretty much all I've wanted out of anime.

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,790
Speaker 1: Though Kill La Kill kept me going.

44
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:08,490
Speaker 1: And though Madoka kept me going, and there were other good shows along the way, I pretty much just want more Ghost in the Shell.

45
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,170
Speaker 1: So, as you know, there is more Ghost in the Shell.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,199
Speaker 1: It's not done yet.

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,210
Speaker 1: Arise is still ongoing.

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,410
Speaker 1: It's kind of a prequel, a little bit of style change.

49
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:21,570
Speaker 0: It's one of those OAV kind of things, like Gundam UC, where I was planning to wait for it to all be done and then watch it.

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,114
Speaker 0: But you know what?

51
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,070
Speaker 0: Well, Gundam UC is done now, so I'm gonna watch it.

52
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,230
Speaker 1: But there are also... We have conflicting policies of watch any anime that's in a theater in New York.

53
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,470
Speaker 0: Right, so Arise is gonna be in a theater in New York.

54
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:43,630
Speaker 1: Borders 1 and 2 are being screened in New York, Atlanta, Cambridge, Baltimore, Alexandria, and like 12 other cities on May 29th, which is next Thursday.

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,161
Speaker 0: It's using this weird system where enough people have to want to go in order for it to happen.

56
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,350
Speaker 1: It's like Kickstarter just for a movie screening.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,590
Speaker 0: So it's like in some of the cities, not enough people signed up for it, so it's not gonna get screened.

58
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:01,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you want to see this, the deadline is in days.

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,730
Speaker 0: I wonder if we can use this and get things we want to watch in the movie theater.

60
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:06,775
Speaker 1: Huh.

61
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,570
Speaker 1: Attack the gas station.

62
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,262
Speaker 0: Exactly.

63
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:11,070
Speaker 0: Something like that.

64
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,490
Speaker 1: I think I could get a couple hundred people to come and watch that.

65
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,050
Speaker 1: I don't know if I ever want to watch Ebola Syndrome again.

66
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:20,230
Speaker 0: I don't either, but if I put it on the website, maybe other people will subject themselves to it by accident.

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,170
Speaker 1: I wonder if it's just on YouTube or something.

68
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:22,949
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

69
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:23,888
Speaker 1: I can believe that.

70
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:32,489
Speaker 1: Ebola Syndrome might literally be the most abhorrent piece of fiction I've ever watched or consumed in any way beginning to end.

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,579
Speaker 0: That is 100% correct.

72
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,529
Speaker 1: The only reason that is true.

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,370
Speaker 0: I can't even begin to think of anything, not even shit like Apocalypse Zero.

74
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,650
Speaker 1: Apocalypse Zero is basically a children's anime compared to Ebola Syndrome.

75
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:46,130
Speaker 1: That's right.

76
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,491
Speaker 1: E.G.

77
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,729
Speaker 1: the Killer is a romp through the park.

78
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:52,230
Speaker 1: Oh, Ebola Syndrome.

79
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,750
Speaker 1: But the only reason it's the most important thing I've ever seen all the way through is because I did walk out of Martin Short's Clifford.

80
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,230
Speaker 1: So yes, go buy tickets to this.

81
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,957
Speaker 1: If you go to the one in New York, well, we're going.

82
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,450
Speaker 1: We'll be there.

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,489
Speaker 1: You can say hi.

84
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,110
Speaker 0: I imagine the same people I see at every- If you're tall, don't sit in front of me.

85
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:17,050
Speaker 1: Every screen of anime we ever go to in New York City, we see the same people at every time.

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,870
Speaker 1: I imagine those people will all be there.

87
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,128
Speaker 1: If you want to join Anime New York, go to the screening.

88
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:24,289
Speaker 1: Everyone in line is going to be awesome.

89
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,870
Speaker 0: Alright, in other news, the show that we're going to talk about in our main bit, Sailor Moon, is back.

90
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,230
Speaker 0: Now we all knew there was going to be a new Sailor Moon series, Sailor Moon Crystal, something, something, whatever, right?

91
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:45,190
Speaker 0: And people have been waiting for it and it's been delayed and teased and all kinds of- Not just delayed, but delayed with no information, no art, no trailers, nothing.

92
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,887
Speaker 0: Suddenly, probably the biggest news in U.S.

93
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:53,330
Speaker 0: anime, you know, period, has happened, right?

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,126
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon, the whole thing, I don't know anything about movies, but all the TV serieses, right?

95
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:11,910
Speaker 0: Are being subbed, and new dubbed, and released, uncut in the original Japanese form, on the internet, and DVD, and buray.

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,442
Speaker 1: Original, uncropped, 4x3.

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,350
Speaker 0: In order, nothing missing, starting already.

98
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,710
Speaker 1: I like how this website I'm looking at makes a special point to say, yes, that includes Sailor Stars.

99
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,710
Speaker 0: Yep, everything, the whole deal.

100
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,770
Speaker 0: It's like, it's happening.

101
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,730
Speaker 1: No, it's interesting, because this is more the news bit.

102
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:36,850
Speaker 1: There is a small, but not trivial, backlash against this.

103
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,247
Speaker 0: Well, it's the same as like, right?

104
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,409
Speaker 0: So, most people who are like Sailor Moon are like, I mean, I'm excited about this.

105
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,929
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon is a pretty fucking important anime, both in Japan and the United States.

106
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, people, you know, like in the United States, it's like because it was on TV, right?

107
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,809
Speaker 0: That's the reason it's a big deal.

108
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:02,623
Speaker 0: But you think, oh, is it one of those shows, like in Japan, no one gives a shit about Sailor Moon, and in the U.S.

109
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,109
Speaker 0: it was a big deal, just because it was the only one that made it on TV.

110
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, it introduced the concept of a magical girl to most of the non-Japan world.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:22,490
Speaker 0: Right, but in Japan, it's like, wait a minute, if this show wasn't a big deal in Japan, like, say, Cowboy Bebop isn't that big a deal in Japan, why are there like four different seasons with 200-something episodes?

112
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:24,450
Speaker 0: Oh, because it was a big deal in Japan.

113
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:24,851
Speaker 1: Yep.

114
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,230
Speaker 1: In fact, it was a big deal around the world.

115
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,269
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon is one of those iconic, recognizable characters where everyone knows what it is.

116
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,910
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like Hokuto no Ken big worldwide, right?

117
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,492
Speaker 1: -Yep.

118
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,929
Speaker 0: -So, this is a big deal.

119
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,570
Speaker 0: So, if you didn't watch Sailor Moon back in the day, now is the Sailor Moon time.

120
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,469
Speaker 0: It is the revival of Sailor Moons.

121
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,249
Speaker 0: So, we're doing a Sailor Moon show.

122
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:58,069
Speaker 1: Yep, but what is interesting is that I was previously going to say probably not worth watching all of the old Sailor Moon, because I've watched all of it.

123
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,141
Speaker 0: -Why not watch all of it?

124
00:06:59,162 --> 00:06:59,789
Speaker 1: -Multiple times.

125
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:04,188
Speaker 1: Now I'm older and I have a lot more free time to watch these long--.

126
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,904
Speaker 1: When I was younger, I couldn't really deal with a lot of--.

127
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,449
Speaker 1: Ah, but I fly around a lot.

128
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,290
Speaker 1: Do you know how many movies I've watched in the last two weeks?

129
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,305
Speaker 0: The way I view it, right, is.

130
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,949
Speaker 0: it looks like they're going to be putting out more-- releasing episodes in order every Monday, right?

131
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:28,130
Speaker 0: So, basically, it's like if I just have nothing the fuck to do, and I can't go outside, and I can not at work, and it's just like I got 20 minutes with nothing, Sailor Moon.

132
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,696
Speaker 1: -You know what?

133
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,850
Speaker 0: -And eventually I'll see it all.

134
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,050
Speaker 1: Having just watched the first two episodes again, it's kind of worth watching.

135
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,235
Speaker 0: -Anyway.

136
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,229
Speaker 1: -It's actually a pretty good show.

137
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:39,026
Speaker 0: For what it is.

138
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:48,990
Speaker 0: But yeah, all the Sailor Moon that was beneath the surface has now risen to the top, like a giant mountain above all other animes.

139
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,110
Speaker 1: I guess that means I don't need to dig out my VCR to be able to watch my Vkill fansubs.

140
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,269
Speaker 0: No, we can sell all that shit.

141
00:07:56,051 --> 00:08:08,110
Speaker 1: Actually, I was looking around to find some info to see if the guy who did those was still around, and I found a number of people who are desperate to buy them, not to watch, but just to have as collector's items.

142
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,670
Speaker 0: All right, sell it off, make some money.

143
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,850
Speaker 1: Because this guy was pretty fucking serious about it.

144
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,800
Speaker 1: -Back in the day...

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,430
Speaker 0: -Make some dough.

146
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,570
Speaker 1: Because it's not really relevant to the show itself.

147
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,809
Speaker 1: I guess I'll tell this story now.

148
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:21,228
Speaker 1: As you guys know, I've been watching anime for pretty much literally my entire life.

149
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,170
Speaker 1: Since I was a little kid, my mom made me watch Vampire Under D. Anime, anime, anime.

150
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,450
Speaker 1: So by the time Sailor Moon was on American TV, and I was watching it, I was already old hat into anime.

151
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:37,710
Speaker 1: High school was when Cartoon Network had their big rebirth, because they brought out Sailor Moon R.

152
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,289
Speaker 0: I could see Sailor Moon in middle school because it was syndicated on the broadcast.

153
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,330
Speaker 1: It was, but that was only the first season.

154
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,350
Speaker 1: Of course, heavily edited.

155
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,510
Speaker 1: And then Sailor Moon R, the next one, has two halves.

156
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,790
Speaker 1: These Alan and Anne, aliens in a tree from space do their thing.

157
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,510
Speaker 1: And then there's the second half.

158
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,130
Speaker 1: that's all Prince Diamond and those assholes.

159
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,690
Speaker 1: They only ever aired the first half on Cartoon Network when, at least originally, when they were like, "Hey, we got more Sailor Moon.

160
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,690
Speaker 1: You can watch more than just what you saw as a kid.

161
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,974
Speaker 1: Oh my

162
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:07,379
Speaker 1: gosh.".

163
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,549
Speaker 1: But even then, anime was old hat.

164
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,990
Speaker 1: So I knew at that point about anime.

165
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:13,585
Speaker 1: I knew information.

166
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,589
Speaker 1: I knew there were clubs out there.

167
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,730
Speaker 1: I knew there were fan subs.

168
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:20,170
Speaker 1: And I had some friends who were also really into Sailor Moon.

169
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,381
Speaker 1: I really wanted to see.

170
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:26,049
Speaker 1: what I heard was the crazy crap that happens later.

171
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,268
Speaker 1: And I knew a decent bit about it.

172
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:31,390
Speaker 1: So I did the thing that you did back in the day.

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,610
Speaker 1: Bought a bunch of really high-quality VHS tapes.

174
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,910
Speaker 1: And I mailed them to a guy along with a check.

175
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,410
Speaker 1: And he mailed me back really nice clam shells.

176
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:49,669
Speaker 1: Like big, heavy, thick white clam shells with laser-printed, full-color, high-resolution images from the laser discs on them.

177
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,070
Speaker 1: These things were way high production values.

178
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,448
Speaker 1: Every - I keep saying "thinking disc".

179
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,529
Speaker 1: - Every VHS tape had its own edge label and its own side label.

180
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,110
Speaker 1: Again, printed high quality.

181
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,510
Speaker 1: All of Sailor Moon.

182
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:03,586
Speaker 1: Every bit of it.

183
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:04,775
Speaker 0: - With subtitles.

184
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:05,970
Speaker 1: - Yes, with subtitles.

185
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,594
Speaker 1: - Good subtitles.

186
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:13,429
Speaker 1: - Mastered with his fucking genlock machine from the laser disc masters that he had and the translation he did himself.

187
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,729
Speaker 1: Vkill seems to have been kind of a legend among Sailor Moon fans.

188
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:21,249
Speaker 0: That guy had so little to do that he sat there and made those tapes for you.

189
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:22,970
Speaker 0: And how many other people?

190
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,649
Speaker 1: Apparently a lot of people.

191
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,890
Speaker 0: That guy was just sitting there making tapes all day.

192
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,108
Speaker 1: That was what anime fandom was.

193
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,130
Speaker 0: How many VCRs the fuck did that guy have?

194
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,190
Speaker 1: That is what anime conventions were until, what, the year 2001?

195
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,265
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's some people in the community, right, who were like, "Ah, this is

196
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:41,729
Speaker 0: awful!".

197
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,410
Speaker 0: Because they are like Robotech people, where they - it's like, you know, a lot of those shows that were originally brought to the US were fucked the fuck up.

198
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,990
Speaker 0: Like, Robotech, they changed everyone's name and combined three shows into one.

199
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,949
Speaker 0: And Sailor Moon, they changed people's names and cut shit out, right?

200
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:00,650
Speaker 0: And some people, it's like their nostalgia is for that edited American crappy version.

201
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:03,370
Speaker 0: And they don't like the original version.

202
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,089
Speaker 0: They're like, "No, you're ruining it.

203
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,942
Speaker 0: Her name is not Usagi.

204
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:07,889
Speaker 1: Ah, ah,

205
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:07,949
Speaker 1: ah.".

206
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:19,909
Speaker 1: These people will refer to - her name's not, you know, we're not gonna - they shouldn't be using the other name, which we won't actually write out in English characters because that disrespects the ancient power of the Japanese language.

207
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:25,328
Speaker 1: It's not - Usagi is just our rough interpretation of that word.

208
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,010
Speaker 1: Weaboos amaze me to a degree that sometimes surprises me.

209
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,118
Speaker 0: It's hilarious.

210
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,907
Speaker 0: That's all there is to it.

211
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:32,488
Speaker 1: Yes.

212
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,848
Speaker 1: But little known fact, that guy, he subbed a couple other things.

213
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:38,150
Speaker 0: Evangelion?

214
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,330
Speaker 1: He subbed End of Evangelion, which I watched without having seen Evangelion, not even knowing it was related.

215
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:49,270
Speaker 1: And he subbed, I think, the Tokimeki Memorial, like, OAV special?

216
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:50,222
Speaker 0: It had anime?

217
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,050
Speaker 0: I thought it was just an SNES game at first.

218
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,190
Speaker 1: Was it Tokimeki or was it - no, it was Two Heart.

219
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,710
Speaker 1: It was one of those dating shows, whatever.

220
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,549
Speaker 0: Two Heart came way later, digital subs.

221
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,989
Speaker 0: That was one of the early digital ones.

222
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he did one of those dating game type things, had a show, and he did it as part of everything else he did.

223
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:13,089
Speaker 1: And since I was getting all of Sailor Moon, I just got everything he'd ever fan-subed, which was Sailor Moon plus those handful of other things.

224
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,810
Speaker 1: But first, things of the day.

225
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:27,326
Speaker 1: So, you guys know we're really into Counter-Strike, and while we're old - I haven't played Counter-Strike in a long time.

226
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,423
Speaker 1: I don't know why not.

227
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,109
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike is great right now.

228
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,090
Speaker 0: I'm busy.

229
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,524
Speaker 1: Busy doing what?

230
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,501
Speaker 1: You can play some Counter-Strike.

231
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:33,842
Speaker 1: Doing other shit.

232
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,200
Speaker 1: What games are you playing lately?

233
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,821
Speaker 0: Uh, video games?

234
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, what video games are you playing?

235
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,894
Speaker 0: None.

236
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:39,845
Speaker 0: None video games.

237
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,367
Speaker 1: You should play some video games.

238
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,667
Speaker 1: We've had some - so, Geek Nights actually has an official Counter-Strike server, and you know what?

239
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,275
Speaker 0: It's still up?

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,210
Speaker 0: People still go there?

241
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,970
Speaker 0: People have been playing there.

242
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,330
Speaker 1: Really?

243
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,810
Speaker 0: In fact, we just had - Listeners or just random internet people?

244
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:51,390
Speaker 1: Uh, listeners.

245
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:51,941
Speaker 0: Really?

246
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
Speaker 1: We had - it's all talk.

247
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,870
Speaker 1: It's set up for our use.

248
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,930
Speaker 1: It's an awesome server.

249
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,769
Speaker 1: So, we've been playing a bunch of Counter-Strike there, and it's super fun.

250
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,050
Speaker 1: It's amazing how it's the air hockey problem.

251
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,270
Speaker 1: I'm way better than pretty much most of the listeners.

252
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,328
Speaker 0: I'm probably garbage now.

253
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:05,870
Speaker 1: You were always garbage.

254
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,650
Speaker 0: I was not always garbage.

255
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,949
Speaker 1: You were never that good at Counter-Strike.

256
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,050
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna lie.

257
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,598
Speaker 0: I was that good, just how that - You were okay.

258
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,525
Speaker 0: I was good at a point.

259
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,523
Speaker 1: You were good when the P90 was OP.

260
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,010
Speaker 0: There were also times, right?

261
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:23,070
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be consistently good, but I would have one in five matches.

262
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,130
Speaker 0: Moment of greatness.

263
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,346
Speaker 1: There would be that moment where you just randomly flip around and click, and then you headshot a guy across the map, and you're like, "I'm gonna do

264
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:29,449
Speaker 1: that.".

265
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,463
Speaker 0: That happens a couple times, but also, there would be days where I'm really good today.

266
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,090
Speaker 0: Or when we were at PAX Prime, and I think we played with Conrad, and I was mowing everyone down with a parrot.

267
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:40,990
Speaker 0: I think there was something about that mouse.

268
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,710
Speaker 0: The sensitivity was just right.

269
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,849
Speaker 1: That's why you buy a really good mouse.

270
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:44,970
Speaker 0: I have a really good mouse.

271
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,509
Speaker 0: For some reason, I don't know what sensitivity they had that one set on.

272
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:53,650
Speaker 1: So we talk a lot about head-clicking and about games of skill, and we're just talking about mouse, and how the mouse is so important to Counter-Strike.

273
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,790
Speaker 1: So this gentleman killed you with a wheel.

274
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:07,270
Speaker 1: He puts up a video where he ends the debate between what is better for Counter-Strike, a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard, by using a wheel.

275
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,401
Speaker 1: And the opening of the video was so great, because he goes into the console while music is building up to it, and he types, "Joystick

276
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:14,751
Speaker 1: 1.".

277
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:14,897
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

278
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:20,290
Speaker 1: And then his only goal is to not be in last place.

279
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,750
Speaker 1: This is amazing to behold.

280
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,048
Speaker 1: They even have their own song.

281
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:25,385
Speaker 0: ♪ Killed you with a wheel.

282
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:26,219
Speaker 1: ♪ ♪ Killed you with a wheel.

283
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,346
Speaker 1: ♪ ♪ Headshot with the wheel.

284
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:28,852
Speaker 0: ♪.

285
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,229
Speaker 0: You kind of need to get a headshot with the wheel.

286
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:35,409
Speaker 0: The biggest problem with the wheel is you can't go up and down, so if a guy's far away or too close, you can't get him.

287
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:35,719
Speaker 0: Yep.

288
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,070
Speaker 0: But if he's just right, oh, watch out.

289
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,690
Speaker 1: But you're watching, like, trying to hit some people, and it's just almost painful to watch, but because there's a wheel there, it's great.

290
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:53,070
Speaker 0: All right, so Florida Man, notorious for drugs, disorderly public conduct, and many other bad behaviors.

291
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,710
Speaker 1: There's a reason FARC has a tag for only one state.

292
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:05,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might wonder -- and there's a Twitter account, Florida Man -- you might be wondering, "What does Florida Man do when he's not either making meth and exploding it and killing

293
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:06,310
Speaker 0: himself?"

294
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,310
Speaker 0: Or consuming meth.

295
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:08,187
Speaker 0: Or using meth.

296
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,906
Speaker 0: Or bath salts or whatever.

297
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:11,249
Speaker 0: have you.

298
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,128
Speaker 1: Bath meth.

299
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:18,010
Speaker 0: You'd probably go scuba diving because Florida's kind of warm and nice, and if you're in the water, you're far away from the other Florida people.

300
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's why people swim in Florida.

301
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:35,429
Speaker 0: Right, but of course, because so many Florida Men just die and float out to sea, it attracts certain dangerous animals that this Florida Man had to contend with in this pretty good video, which looks like it was shot with a GoPro, so watch it.

302
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,935
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

303
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:39,850
Speaker 1: Florida Man succeeds.

304
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:43,689
Speaker 0: They should have this Florida Man take out all the other Florida Men.

305
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,189
Speaker 1: Well, he's got that spear gun.

306
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,130
Speaker 0: A few million enter, one man leaves.

307
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,190
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the Book Club book is A Canticle for Leibowitz.

308
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,008
Speaker 0: I started reading it.

309
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,709
Speaker 1: I will read it soon.

310
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,779
Speaker 0: It's got Jews in it.

311
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,497
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh.

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,102
Speaker 1: You think?

313
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:04,770
Speaker 0: You don't see Jews in the sci-fi too often as a nerdy Jew.

314
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:05,849
Speaker 0: I like that.

315
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,909
Speaker 1: You know, that is kind of true.

316
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,710
Speaker 1: There are a couple of characters that exhibit some of the stereotypes that you're thinking of right now, Scad, in the culture books.

317
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,368
Speaker 1: You don't say?

318
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,427
Speaker 1: Nah, a few.

319
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,390
Speaker 1: But, yeah, not many sci-fi characters named Leibowitz.

320
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,249
Speaker 1: All this one.

321
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,466
Speaker 0: You don't say?

322
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:25,542
Speaker 1: Our forum's awesome.

323
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:26,350
Speaker 1: YouTube's awesome.

324
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,050
Speaker 1: Lots of videos coming soon.

325
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,630
Speaker 1: I'm not going to Hong Kong next week.

326
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,709
Speaker 1: I wheedled my way out of it, so I'm going to try to edit up the Geek Nights Presents Utena.

327
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,329
Speaker 1: We've got two more episodes to upload.

328
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:42,149
Speaker 0: If you ever do go to Hong Kong, I should give you a list of electronic things to acquire and bring back.

329
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,270
Speaker 1: I'm going to come back with a suitcase full of all the things.

330
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,110
Speaker 1: You know how many HDMI splitters, DRM removers?

331
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,010
Speaker 0: I'm talking about bigger things than that.

332
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,710
Speaker 0: You can get camera lenses and all that kind of shit.

333
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,109
Speaker 0: Stuff that's more expensive, but it's still cheaper there and often available there, but not available here.

334
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,509
Speaker 1: Things that I legally have to pay a duty on if I bring back into the United States.

335
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,849
Speaker 0: Also, bootleg things, right?

336
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,884
Speaker 0: I was watching some photo videos online.

337
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,390
Speaker 1: They can confiscate your bootlegs at the border.

338
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,109
Speaker 0: Whatever, but it's like these guys, they're in Hong Kong, right?

339
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,730
Speaker 0: They're like, "Okay, here's a camera challenge.

340
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,640
Speaker 0: Take pictures using this flash,".

341
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,852
Speaker 0: and it's the Fuke 960.

342
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:26,008
Speaker 0: No, it was the Fuke 690, that's what it was.

343
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,930
Speaker 0: F-U-Q 690.

344
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,367
Speaker 0: It was just some cheap flash that you can get on the street in Hong Kong, and it's like, "That's so cheap,

345
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:34,609
Speaker 0: though.".

346
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,609
Speaker 0: If I had three of those, instead of one really good one...

347
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,690
Speaker 1: Instead of one good camera, I'd buy 12 terrible cameras.

348
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:46,164
Speaker 0: But the guy did amazing shit with those flashes, because they work, right?

349
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,650
Speaker 0: And it's cheaper than getting real ones, right?

350
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:50,980
Speaker 0: No.

351
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:51,659
Speaker 0: Anyway.

352
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:53,389
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon.

353
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,050
Speaker 0: Oh, we're already talking about Sailor Moon?

354
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,289
Speaker 0: We're not talking about conventions you should go to?

355
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,619
Speaker 1: You should go to Kineticon.

356
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,049
Speaker 1: It's the next big convention we're going to.

357
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,370
Speaker 0: Keep pressing F5 while you're listening to this podcast.

358
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,649
Speaker 1: Penny Arcade Expo badges will go on sale, I'm pretty sure.

359
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,962
Speaker 1: My guess is tomorrow.

360
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,570
Speaker 0: We're on orange alert right now for PAX Prime tickets.

361
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,586
Speaker 1: My guess is tomorrow, Thursday, May 22nd.

362
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,850
Speaker 0: Probably today for most of us.

363
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,490
Speaker 1: My second guess is Monday.

364
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, they wouldn't fuck us on Friday.

365
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:33,510
Speaker 1: Well, the website went down today for a minute, and for a second I thought, maybe I shouldn't tell anyone but my close friends.

366
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,240
Speaker 0: Everyone in the world knows.

367
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,690
Speaker 0: There's no secret keeping here.

368
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,350
Speaker 1: There's a Reddit thread longer than any thread in the Geek Knights forums within seconds of that going down.

369
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,029
Speaker 0: That's right.

370
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,649
Speaker 1: You're pretty much fucked if you want to go to PAX.

371
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:53,590
Speaker 0: And to think, his award, a lot of people, their method of finding out is they've got a notification on the official PAX account, so whenever it tweets, they get a mobile notification.

372
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're going to get a notification if the badges are sold out.

373
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,569
Speaker 0: That shit is delayed one to three minutes, yo.

374
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,410
Speaker 0: In that time, you're going to be locked out.

375
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,340
Speaker 1: You might get a Monday and a Sunday badge.

376
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,230
Speaker 0: If you're super lucky, you might get the four one days.

377
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,070
Speaker 1: But you're definitely not going to be staying in the Sheraton or the Red Line.

378
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,767
Speaker 0: Hell no.

379
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,788
Speaker 1: What was that fucking hotel we stayed in?

380
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,369
Speaker 1: PAX dev was like here.

381
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,610
Speaker 0: The serviceable, but kind of annoyingly far away hotel.

382
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,690
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, say PAX is in the middle.

383
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,690
Speaker 1: This hotel was way away to the right.

384
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,388
Speaker 0: Listen, just stay in an airport hotel and use the light rail every day.

385
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, random aside, I stayed in an airport hotel for the first time in my life last week, like a hotel in the airport.

386
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,801
Speaker 0: In the airport?

387
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,770
Speaker 0: Not just next to it?

388
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,830
Speaker 0: I stayed in hotels next to an airport, but never in an airport.

389
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,150
Speaker 1: So directly connected.

390
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,370
Speaker 0: As in you could walk from the hotel to your gate?

391
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:43,909
Speaker 1: Yes.

392
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:45,150
Speaker 0: Without going outside?

393
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:46,570
Speaker 1: I did not have to go outside.

394
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:47,050
Speaker 1: Okay.

395
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,410
Speaker 1: I did have to go through security though.

396
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:49,410
Speaker 0: Alright, that's obvious.

397
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:54,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, there appeared to be a way to do security in the hotel if I was first class flying, but I was not.

398
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,410
Speaker 0: And they just drive you to the plane?

399
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they had a personal concierge who will take care of you and do personal security, but I digress.

400
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,269
Speaker 1: So, Sailor Moon.

401
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,350
Speaker 1: Scott knows almost nothing about it.

402
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,590
Speaker 0: Okay, so I watched more than zero Sailor Moon in my life, right?

403
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,489
Speaker 0: I watched when it was on the TV.

404
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:25,170
Speaker 0: I watched a few episodes, but mostly it would be on like right before the show I actually wanted to watch, which was Bot's Master, or it would be on like after something I wanted to watch like Voltron, when it was like Cartoon Network.

405
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,269
Speaker 0: So it's like it was never on at a time when I was going to watch it.

406
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,210
Speaker 0: So I watched it like a few times.

407
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,050
Speaker 0: And I know that there's a girl, she turns into Sailor Moon.

408
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,030
Speaker 0: It's really stereotypical magical girl.

409
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,643
Speaker 0: There's a bad guy, monster of the week.

410
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,329
Speaker 0: She fights it.

411
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,169
Speaker 0: She does some makeup thing and transforms.

412
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:47,790
Speaker 0: There's a tuxedo guy who's obviously that dude and that's her boyfriend.

413
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:49,808
Speaker 1: No, why would you say that?

414
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:59,030
Speaker 0: There's other sailors who are different colors for different planets, and the plot just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and then there's lesbians and then it's over.

415
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:04,690
Speaker 1: What I do enjoy is how you make a lot of guesses about the show, like from the first two episodes.

416
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,010
Speaker 0: I'm mostly right because it's so stereotypical.

417
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:09,050
Speaker 1: You're mostly like completely wrong, which is really funny.

418
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,350
Speaker 0: How could you be so wrong about something so cliche?

419
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,010
Speaker 1: Well, you're like Sailor V. That's Sailor Venus.

420
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,150
Speaker 1: So there's already Sailor Scouts.

421
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,581
Speaker 1: No, she's not a Sailor Scout.

422
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,440
Speaker 1: She's just Sailor V. She's the underwear pervert.

423
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,509
Speaker 1: She's not a Sailor Scout yet.

424
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:21,810
Speaker 0: Oh, yet.

425
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,310
Speaker 1: And yeah, she doesn't come in until way later anyway.

426
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:25,858
Speaker 0: Okay.

427
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,290
Speaker 0: But she's going to be Sailor Venus later.

428
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:27,832
Speaker 1: Yup.

429
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:30,250
Speaker 1: You thought that Naru's mom was Queen Beryl?

430
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,949
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they made it look like it.

431
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:33,510
Speaker 0: Different hair!

432
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:39,530
Speaker 1: You can only tell some of these characters apart, I realize, in retrospect, because their hair is slightly different.

433
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,910
Speaker 0: Oh, they had that dude who works at the arcade who looks just like Jedi.

434
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:44,048
Speaker 1: Jedi-t.

435
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:45,110
Speaker 0: Jedi, sorry.

436
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,024
Speaker 1: Jedi-t is...

437
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:46,545
Speaker 0: Yoda.

438
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,956
Speaker 1: Is miltoast.

439
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,050
Speaker 1: He's like Green Beryl's first general.

440
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:55,070
Speaker 1: His primary trait is being nondescript and boring and then getting admiraled.

441
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, that whole Queen Beryl thing reminds me a lot of Voltron, right?

442
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,170
Speaker 0: Because in Voltron, you've got what, Zardoz?

443
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,168
Speaker 0: No, it's not Zardoz.

444
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:02,783
Speaker 0: Zardoz.

445
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,410
Speaker 0: What the fuck is that dude's name?

446
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,270
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

447
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,467
Speaker 0: It definitely has a Z.

448
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:07,750
Speaker 1: I'm going to admit to you, Scott.

449
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,390
Speaker 1: I watched Voltron, but I did not like Voltron.

450
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,090
Speaker 0: Voltron's good.

451
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:12,567
Speaker 1: As a kid.

452
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,309
Speaker 1: But I had the Voltron board game.

453
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,469
Speaker 1: Are you looking it up?

454
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,467
Speaker 0: Oh, is it Zoltan?

455
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,969
Speaker 1: Zoltan doesn't sound right either.

456
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:21,245
Speaker 0: Zoltan?

457
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:22,929
Speaker 0: It was something like that.

458
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:23,829
Speaker 1: Regardless.

459
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,263
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was like him, right?

460
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,725
Speaker 0: And then there was Zarkon, right?

461
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,646
Speaker 0: Okay, so here we go.

462
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:33,830
Speaker 0: Thank you, Wikipedia.

463
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:35,710
Speaker 0: So it's King Zarkon.

464
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,450
Speaker 0: He's like the real bad guy, right?

465
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,050
Speaker 0: Then there was his son, Prince Lotor.

466
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,770
Speaker 0: He was like the second in command kind of bad guy, right?

467
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:53,570
Speaker 0: And then there was the sort of person on the side who would summon all of the row beasts that Voltron would fight, right?

468
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,990
Speaker 0: So, you know, the Sailor Moon setup is really similar, right?

469
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,750
Speaker 0: Like Queen Beryl's at the top, and then there's the henchman Jedi, whatever.

470
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:05,830
Speaker 0: And then he summons the monster of the week that Sailor Moon actually has to fight.

471
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:11,850
Speaker 0: And she doesn't actually fight the top bad guys, just like Voltron doesn't, you know, ever fight, you know, Prince Lotor or whatever.

472
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:13,110
Speaker 0: Anyway.

473
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,546
Speaker 1: Yeah.

474
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,309
Speaker 1: But yeah, Nephrite, or not Nephrite, that's still Jedi.

475
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,550
Speaker 1: We didn't get to all the much better ones yet.

476
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,269
Speaker 0: They all have 'ite?

477
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:19,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

478
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,049
Speaker 1: Look, you see the theme going, right?

479
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,350
Speaker 1: Jedi, zoisite, malachite.

480
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,688
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's- Oh, they're all gems.

481
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,286
Speaker 0: They're all gems.

482
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:28,668
Speaker 0: Not gems.

483
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:29,950
Speaker 0: Stones.

484
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,089
Speaker 1: Okay.

485
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,029
Speaker 1: I guess someone wasn't in Science Olympiad as a kid.

486
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:44,210
Speaker 1: But you might remember zoisite is the one who in the American dub, they made him a girl to just kind of remove this whole homosexual relationship that was going on.

487
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,170
Speaker 0: Oh, it's an androgynous person?

488
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:53,448
Speaker 0: And he- Well, you could freaking go to, you know, Messenger Z with the- Oh my god, yeah.

489
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,870
Speaker 1: But that wouldn't have been on American TV either.

490
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,730
Speaker 1: But it's interesting, you know, I watched all of Sailor Moon twice.

491
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:01,505
Speaker 1: All of it.

492
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:07,130
Speaker 1: But most of the first like 10 or 15 episodes- Of Baron Asher, right?

493
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:14,290
Speaker 1: I saw, dubbed in the English release, and I never bothered rewatching them in Japanese.

494
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,269
Speaker 0: Even though you had all the tapes?

495
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:16,990
Speaker 1: I didn't have tapes of season one.

496
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:17,808
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

497
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,290
Speaker 0: You only had those Vkills for all the other Sailor Moon?

498
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:25,010
Speaker 1: I had R, S, Super, S, Stars, Amichan no Hatsukoi, and the three movies.

499
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:39,023
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, when I was watching the trailer, right, they made a trailer for the rerelease, and the trailer only mentioned Sailor Moon, S, Super, S, and Stars, and R. It didn't mention anything about- The movies.

500
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,130
Speaker 0: The movies or that other thing you just said.

501
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,490
Speaker 1: Amy's first love.

502
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:48,408
Speaker 1: It's a side story about Sailor Mercury, and she falls in love with this hacker boy who's dating someone else.

503
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:49,450
Speaker 1: Okay.

504
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:50,849
Speaker 1: And then she comes to team.

505
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,470
Speaker 0: So I'm really curious if like the movies and everything's gonna be included in there or not.

506
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:07,950
Speaker 1: I'm also curious, the movies are, in fact, they're so stereotypical of anime series movies that if we ever do our all-anime or the same panel, we have to add all three Sailor Moon movies to it to buff it out.

507
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,390
Speaker 0: Maybe some of those Tenchi movies also.

508
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:09,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

509
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,029
Speaker 1: Well, kind of.

510
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Tenchi movies do, but these movies occur on islands.

511
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,249
Speaker 1: They bring in side characters who then die.

512
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,930
Speaker 1: Like, it's pretty much straightforward.

513
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,788
Speaker 1: I think Sailor Moon dies in all of them too.

514
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:30,690
Speaker 0: But anyway, so since I was in middle school or high school, whatever, we watched the first two re-released episodes of Sailor Moon in their uncut, subtitled version on the moon.

515
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:39,350
Speaker 1: Now, episode two is notable because it was never even aired on American TV because it showcased too much juvenile delinquency and panty shots and Satanism.

516
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you never saw it before.

517
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:41,750
Speaker 1: Never saw that episode.

518
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,890
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's just talk about Sailor Moon.

519
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:53,970
Speaker 0: So first of all, this show has a lot, you know, it's weird in that right from the beginning, you have all these magical girl show tropes, cliches, hardcore, right?

520
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:55,669
Speaker 0: Running out of the house late for school.

521
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,650
Speaker 0: She didn't have toast in her mouth, but she might as well would have, right?

522
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,190
Speaker 0: Helping pet friend transformations.

523
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,430
Speaker 1: Say moon tiara, whatever, make up, magic go.

524
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,510
Speaker 0: Magical attacks, everything, right?

525
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:08,990
Speaker 0: The whole bag, right?

526
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:27,510
Speaker 0: But unlike, say, modern shows, everything sort of moe, creepy pervy or cutesy kitty, it's a lot more wacky, comedy, gag manga style, like Ursa Yatsura or kotocha or any of the other, you know, gag mangas of that era, right?

527
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,309
Speaker 0: Or even earlier.

528
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:32,370
Speaker 1: So, and it's actually honestly, it's pretty funny at times.

529
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,169
Speaker 1: Like I forgot how funny this show can be.

530
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:42,890
Speaker 0: So in that way, it's sort of, you know, unique in that it's sort of combining the magical girl and the gag, you know, genres together.

531
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:48,986
Speaker 0: But it also has some funniness to break up the tedium of the formula fighting the monster of the week.

532
00:26:49,430 --> 00:27:04,570
Speaker 1: Though I realize something that's interesting is that Scott's opinions of this, having only kind of seen the beginning of Sailor Moon and episodes from season one and none of the later stuff, the show is way more Green Lantern-y and superhero-y later on than is obvious from the beginning.

533
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,850
Speaker 1: And the manga is just Green Lantern with girls.

534
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:08,869
Speaker 0: Even from the beginning?

535
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:09,609
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

536
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,229
Speaker 1: The manga?

537
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:15,249
Speaker 1: I haven't even read all the manga, but from what I've read of the manga, it is, it is the Green Lantern.

538
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:16,027
Speaker 1: Okay.

539
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,030
Speaker 1: It is all just space politics and battles and it's crazy.

540
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,109
Speaker 1: Kind of want to read the manga actually.

541
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,668
Speaker 1: Go for it.

542
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,329
Speaker 1: I've been thinking for a while to get it all and just try to read it.

543
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:27,769
Speaker 1: I used to read it in Borders books.

544
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:30,189
Speaker 1: Or no, no, no, Walden books.

545
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:36,990
Speaker 0: So the first thing you notice when you watch Sailor Moon is that Usagi is dumb as a brick.

546
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, Usagi is pretty fucking dumb actually.

547
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,050
Speaker 1: And, uh, spoilers, she never gets smarter.

548
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,870
Speaker 0: Even at the end where it's all Green Lantern-y?

549
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:58,590
Speaker 1: Uh, she pretty much, as far as I can tell, Scott made an observation that I never thought of much having, you know, just cause I've, I've seen the show a lot more, closer to it, so it's easy for me to kind of gloss over these things.

550
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,410
Speaker 1: Scott, you describe Usagi or Sailor Moon as almost being a weapon wielded by others.

551
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, she doesn't do anything.

552
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,628
Speaker 0: It's just like the cat tells her what to do.

553
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,468
Speaker 0: Tuxedo guy tells her what to do.

554
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,808
Speaker 0: She just, she doesn't actually attack the bad guys or do anything of her own volition cause she's so dumb.

555
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,288
Speaker 0: It's, other people just make her do it.

556
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,250
Speaker 0: And it's, she has all this power, but she has no, you know, will whatsoever.

557
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,269
Speaker 0: Her primary power seems to be- She just stands there while the bad guys are coming at her.

558
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,429
Speaker 1: Then she cries.

559
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,650
Speaker 0: One guy throws a rose once and that somehow stops all the lower henchmen.

560
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,790
Speaker 0: Cause he's way powerful.

561
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:38,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then it's just like, throw the tiara, hello.

562
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,670
Speaker 1: Welcome to the trope.

563
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,370
Speaker 0: She doesn't even transform on her own.

564
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,749
Speaker 0: It's just, hey, transform now.

565
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:44,823
Speaker 1: Do I have to?

566
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,830
Speaker 0: Say these exact words.

567
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,963
Speaker 0: What were the words again?

568
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:48,470
Speaker 1: I forgot.

569
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,150
Speaker 1: I got 30% on my English test.

570
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,670
Speaker 1: Let me tell you what, her grades only go down as the show goes on.

571
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,070
Speaker 0: How could you go down, how could she not get kicked out of school or held back?

572
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,229
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

573
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,270
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why, I mean, how long, she's in eighth grade now, right?

574
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:00,610
Speaker 0: Yup.

575
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,070
Speaker 0: So she's almost in high school.

576
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:06,129
Speaker 1: She will make it to high school in Sailor Stars.

577
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,695
Speaker 0: She actually makes it.

578
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,910
Speaker 0: So that means she has to pass the classes, right?

579
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:10,890
Speaker 0: In middle school.

580
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:12,068
Speaker 1: Uh, I guess.

581
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,369
Speaker 1: She's, you know, she's pretty dumb.

582
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:19,810
Speaker 1: But she, as far as I can remember, she doesn't do much of her own volition.

583
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,773
Speaker 1: Like really?

584
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:26,190
Speaker 1: Like there's a moment in Stars where she is finally like, you know what, I'm going to do this thing.

585
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,309
Speaker 1: And then she does it and everyone else is like, no, don't do that.

586
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,730
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when Monica's mom is like, you should do something that's the wrong thing.

587
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,689
Speaker 1: And she's like, fuck yes.

588
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,770
Speaker 1: And she throws something somewhere and then all shit breaks loose.

589
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,029
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon has a scene like that, but it takes all the way until Stars to get to it.

590
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:52,550
Speaker 1: But, uh, I don't know, the show, I kind of want to watch the entire thing again because it has been about 14 or 15 years since I watched Sailor Moon.

591
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,828
Speaker 0: It'll be 14, 15 years before you see it all again.

592
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:56,504
Speaker 0: It's 200 episodes.

593
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,109
Speaker 1: Kind of amazed how much I actually do remember, but most of what I remember is from S and Stars and Super S is just...

594
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,162
Speaker 0: What's the order?

595
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:05,709
Speaker 0: so people know?

596
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,790
Speaker 0: Obviously you watch Sailor Moon first.

597
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,766
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon, the first...

598
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,389
Speaker 0: When you watch Sailor Moon, how many seasons does that have?

599
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,810
Speaker 1: Uh, so one season was what was available.

600
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:15,507
Speaker 1: Okay.

601
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,210
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon, 26 episodes and that's just the whole Queen Beryl arc.

602
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,710
Speaker 1: And you learn, and by the end of that, you learn the backstory that she's the reincarnation of the Queen from the previous era.

603
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,750
Speaker 1: In a sense, Sailor Moon is a post-apocalyptic story.

604
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,930
Speaker 1: This is a world that was rebuilt after an apocalypse.

605
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,009
Speaker 0: But I mean, if you just watch Sailor Moon on its own, it's a complete story with an end and you can stop?

606
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,490
Speaker 0: Yes.

607
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,970
Speaker 0: Okay, so each one of them is a complete story?

608
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,777
Speaker 1: Pretty much, yes.

609
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,570
Speaker 1: Each one is a stand-alone story.

610
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,850
Speaker 0: But obviously you need to watch the previous one to understand the next one?

611
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:46,529
Speaker 0: Not really.

612
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:46,994
Speaker 0: Really?

613
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:52,489
Speaker 0: You can just watch Sailor... Like, if I just started today and all the episodes were out and I watched Super S, I would know what's going on?

614
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:56,268
Speaker 1: You wouldn't know who most of the characters were, but it wouldn't really matter that much.

615
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,250
Speaker 0: But there wouldn't be any loose ends from the previous one or loose ends hanging at the end?

616
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,750
Speaker 1: So, interestingly, after Sailor Moon, which the end of that is...

617
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:08,210
Speaker 0: It's only 26 episodes, Sailor Moon?

618
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:08,488
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,110
Speaker 1: The end of the first season of Sailor Moon is actually one of the high points of the show.

620
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:15,042
Speaker 1: It's a really good ending.

621
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:15,950
Speaker 1: Not gonna lie.

622
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,330
Speaker 0: Well, I imagine they kill Queen Beryl's as dead, right?

623
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:19,150
Speaker 0: It's complicated.

624
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:19,682
Speaker 0: Okay.

625
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,490
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon R is the next Sailor Moon.

626
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,510
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon R has two story arcs.

627
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,669
Speaker 1: There's Alan and Anne.

628
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,059
Speaker 1: I've watched that in English.

629
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,269
Speaker 1: I didn't have fansubs of that shit.

630
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,869
Speaker 1: If I did, I actually didn't watch them, I don't think.

631
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,550
Speaker 1: But they're just some aliens coming down in a tree and they're trying to steal people's energy.

632
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,829
Speaker 0: Oh, so the arcs are based on the big bad guy?

633
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,789
Speaker 1: Yes, whoever the big bad guy is, is the arc.

634
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:51,710
Speaker 1: And then the next half of that is... ...is Prince Diamond and all these sort of other royals come down and they have their business going on and they resolve that.

635
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,390
Speaker 0: Why is everyone messing with Earth?

636
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,210
Speaker 0: Aren't there a zillion other planets they can mess with?

637
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,230
Speaker 1: You'll find out later why that's the case.

638
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:58,600
Speaker 0: Okay.

639
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,369
Speaker 0: They didn't rebuild after their apocalypses?

640
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,270
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon S is when, in my opinion, shit got good because that is the crazy apocalypse.

641
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,681
Speaker 1: The Holy Grail is out there.

642
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,130
Speaker 0: There's these aliens trying to come in.

643
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,169
Speaker 0: The same one Jesus had?

644
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:13,190
Speaker 1: Maybe.

645
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:13,969
Speaker 0: Maybe?

646
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,289
Speaker 0: So Sailor Moon has to go and get the cup that Jesus drank from.

647
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,610
Speaker 0: Was Jesus like Sailor Desert or something?

648
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,538
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.

649
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:33,210
Speaker 1: There are multiple... You know some of the scenes in Kill La Kill where they're experimenting on babies and/or trying to make clothes in a lab?

650
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,075
Speaker 1: Some of those scenes are cribbed shot for shot from scenes in Sailor Moon S. Sailor Moon.

651
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:40,890
Speaker 1: S is some of my favorite Sailor Moon.

652
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,989
Speaker 1: That's the dark stuff, the weird stuff.

653
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,629
Speaker 0: So why was it called R and then S?

654
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,570
Speaker 1: Fuck if I know.

655
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:46,869
Speaker 0: Okay.

656
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,750
Speaker 1: If I knew at any point, I have forgotten.

657
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,891
Speaker 0: As opposed to Sailor Moon 2 or 3.

658
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,530
Speaker 1: S is also a complete story.

659
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:59,450
Speaker 1: S is a high body count and S is when you get introduced to the outer Senshi, the Sailor Scouts from the outer planets.

660
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,050
Speaker 0: They're still introducing characters way late.

661
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,503
Speaker 1: Yes.

662
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,410
Speaker 1: Dude, Sailor Moon is by herself for a good chunk of the first season.

663
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,110
Speaker 1: Then she gets Sailor Mercury and Sailor Mars kind of early.

664
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,685
Speaker 0: But it's like they're in the opener, right?

665
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,830
Speaker 0: In the first opener of the first episode, you see these other Sailors, right?

666
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,749
Speaker 0: And you see Sailor V before you even see Sailor Moon in the show.

667
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,351
Speaker 1: Yep.

668
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:23,570
Speaker 1: She basically awakens them as time goes on in the early parts of the show.

669
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,750
Speaker 1: Then they find Sailor Jupiter and she's this badass punching girl.

670
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, punching.

671
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:28,178
Speaker 1: Yep.

672
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:33,609
Speaker 1: Sailor Venus is already awakened because there's another cat that found her.

673
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:37,007
Speaker 1: And he is like, "Yo, you're powerful,

674
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,350
Speaker 1: whatever.".

675
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,130
Speaker 1: So she's an underwear pervert in her own regard.

676
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,990
Speaker 1: And then she becomes, she realizes she's a Sailor Scout and all that stuff.

677
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,029
Speaker 1: But that's the inner Senshi.

678
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:46,890
Speaker 1: They're responsible for internal bullshit within the solar system.

679
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,870
Speaker 0: So in this universe, is our solar system the center of the universe?

680
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,371
Speaker 1: No.

681
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:55,790
Speaker 1: There are other solar systems that have their own sets of Sailors.

682
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,630
Speaker 0: So why is Sailor Moon so much more important than any of those other people in the other solar system?

683
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,768
Speaker 1: Who says she is?

684
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,050
Speaker 0: I think she obviously is because the show's named after her.

685
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:09,310
Speaker 1: If we're watching a cop show that's set in Baltimore, that doesn't mean that there aren't cops in France.

686
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,389
Speaker 0: Sure, but this show goes into the outer space parts.

687
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's the deal.

688
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:18,250
Speaker 1: The inner Senshi are responsible, they're like the FBI of the galaxy.

689
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,483
Speaker 1: The outer Senshi are like the CIA.

690
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,616
Speaker 0: How come there's no Sailor Moon?

691
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:29,030
Speaker 0: How come there's no Sailor Io or Sailor Titan or Sailor Europa?

692
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:30,947
Speaker 1: I don't know.

693
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:31,956
Speaker 1: Huh.

694
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,074
Speaker 1: Some of that might be dealt with.

695
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:39,850
Speaker 1: There are characters that have names from those other moons and things.

696
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,545
Speaker 0: Also, clearly their astronomy was all fucked up because there is a Sailor Pluto, right?

697
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:44,230
Speaker 0: But there shouldn't be.

698
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,949
Speaker 1: Well, Sailor Pluto's weird that she can't really interact much because of her power.

699
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,190
Speaker 0: And what's the other thing that's out there next to Pluto?

700
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:52,886
Speaker 1: Oh, Charon?

701
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, how come there's no Sailor Charon?

702
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,599
Speaker 1: Well, Sailor Saturn is the most powerful one.

703
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,750
Speaker 1: Her power has basically destroyed the entire universe.

704
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,318
Speaker 0: Well, rings.

705
00:34:59,604 --> 00:34:59,870
Speaker 0: Duh.

706
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:02,000
Speaker 1: Well, Saturn.

707
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:03,229
Speaker 1: Chronos and all that.

708
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:03,948
Speaker 0: Rings.

709
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, not really rings is why.

710
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,250
Speaker 0: Well, wouldn't Jupiter be stronger with that badass fucking storm?

711
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she just punches people.

712
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,490
Speaker 0: Well, if you're that big, you usually only need to punch people.

713
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:16,750
Speaker 1: So, what's funny is in Sailor Moon S...

714
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,130
Speaker 0: Don't play an ace when in due school.

715
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,885
Speaker 1: Like, you get used to these Sailor Scouts, like this team of five.

716
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:21,650
Speaker 1: They're like the thing.

717
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,698
Speaker 1: And then you meet the outer Senshi and they're a little bit older.

718
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,450
Speaker 1: They're like later middle school, early high school.

719
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,669
Speaker 0: But they're still just people on Earth?

720
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,331
Speaker 1: Yes.

721
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:38,208
Speaker 1: They, however, drive cars, act like adults, and they're so much more powerful than the inner Senshi.

722
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:38,930
Speaker 1: It's almost a joke.

723
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,530
Speaker 0: I don't know what can be more powerful than, like, Tiara Action, you're dead.

724
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they...

725
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,424
Speaker 0: What if she accidentally shoots Tiara Action, like, at the ground?

726
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:49,270
Speaker 0: Will the Earth disintegrate?

727
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,621
Speaker 1: I think it only works on living things.

728
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,270
Speaker 0: I don't really remember.

729
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,270
Speaker 0: Like, would it disintegrate an elephant?

730
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,336
Speaker 1: Doesn't work on everyone.

731
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,624
Speaker 1: Like, she has to upgrade over time.

732
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:57,610
Speaker 1: She gets constant upgrades.

733
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,290
Speaker 1: Super S is all about her daughter from the future.

734
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:02,609
Speaker 0: Okay.

735
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,450
Speaker 1: Comes back to learn things.

736
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,930
Speaker 0: And you're a middle school girl, and here's your daughter from the future.

737
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in Stars, a younger person comes from the future, and for a while they're like, "Well, is that her

738
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:13,630
Speaker 1: daughter?".

739
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,610
Speaker 1: Granddaughter from the future.

740
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,730
Speaker 1: What the fuck's going on in the future?

741
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:21,701
Speaker 0: Why would people coming from the future... I mean, clearly people are coming from the future.

742
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,828
Speaker 0: The future's doing pretty good, right?

743
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,040
Speaker 0: So why are they coming back to the past?

744
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:26,810
Speaker 0: You should go with them back to the future.

745
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,970
Speaker 1: Well, because then you aren't there to save the past.

746
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,893
Speaker 0: Fuck the past.

747
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:31,899
Speaker 0: The future's all good.

748
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:32,885
Speaker 0: People are coming from there.

749
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:33,770
Speaker 0: They have time machines.

750
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,449
Speaker 1: Because you're still there as soon as you leave.

751
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,849
Speaker 1: It's like the Bravest Warriors, where he tries to go back in time and fix things.

752
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,769
Speaker 1: And he's like, "If this is a bad idea, I would obviously come back here and destroy this machine right

753
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:46,070
Speaker 1: before.".

754
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,189
Speaker 1: And then he comes back and destroys it right in front of himself.

755
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:50,548
Speaker 0: That is that.

756
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,489
Speaker 0: That's why Bravest Warriors is so good.

757
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:53,890
Speaker 1: Oh, Bravest Warriors.

758
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,528
Speaker 1: Bravest Warriors.

759
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,290
Speaker 1: I like that show about as much as I like Pokemon Rusty.

760
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,590
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon.

761
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:03,090
Speaker 1: Did you watch the new episode of Pokemon Rusty?

762
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:07,430
Speaker 0: How different is Sailor Moon, really, from Pokemon Rusty?

763
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:15,910
Speaker 0: The only difference between Sailor Moon and Pokemon Rusty that I can see is that Rusty fails and Sailor Moon succeeds somehow.

764
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:17,690
Speaker 0: That's the only difference, right?

765
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,850
Speaker 0: If Pokemon Rusty actually managed to beat Team Rocket and catch Pokemon and whatnot, he would just be Sailor Moon.

766
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:24,377
Speaker 0: You know what?

767
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:24,539
Speaker 1: Yeah.

768
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,389
Speaker 1: You know what?

769
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,750
Speaker 1: Interesting commentary going on here.

770
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,848
Speaker 0: Rusty is just as dumb.

771
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:35,810
Speaker 1: Watching the show in this early episode and seeing all this school stuff, that's really not there in later episodes.

772
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,857
Speaker 0: Well, that's most anime.

773
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,350
Speaker 0: Start with the school and it goes away, right?

774
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,930
Speaker 0: Well, Full Metal Panic has a school that goes away.

775
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,910
Speaker 0: Naruto has a school that goes away.

776
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,450
Speaker 0: I think Yuu Hakusho has a school that goes away.

777
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:47,408
Speaker 1: That is true.

778
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,550
Speaker 1: Koto-chan has a school that doesn't go away.

779
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:50,152
Speaker 0: That's true.

780
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:56,490
Speaker 0: I like, and the thing is, school stuff, it's like so many mangas start in school, right?

781
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,050
Speaker 0: And then they break away from it to go to some sort of formula of battling or who knows what.

782
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,610
Speaker 0: But they start with school because school stuff is so good.

783
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,549
Speaker 0: It's just really hard as a writer to keep writing school stuff where you keep it fresh constantly.

784
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,790
Speaker 1: Well, you should watch Shinsekai Yori from the New World because they're in school.

785
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:15,870
Speaker 0: The whole time?

786
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,650
Speaker 1: Well, then they're adults, but they're in college.

787
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:20,078
Speaker 1: You should watch that show.

788
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,210
Speaker 1: That gives you interesting ways to use school.

789
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:29,150
Speaker 0: Right, but I'm talking about concentrating on the Japanese middle or high school and staying in it.

790
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,670
Speaker 0: The only kind of shows that can really manage that are stuff like Azumanga Daioh.

791
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,178
Speaker 1: Why don't they make a shounen fighting show?

792
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,150
Speaker 1: that's about getting good grades in school?

793
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:37,017
Speaker 0: They did.

794
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:37,890
Speaker 0: It's called Cromartie.

795
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:44,810
Speaker 1: So anyway, Sailor Moon Super S is all about her daughter.

796
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:47,769
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon RS Super S.

797
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:51,050
Speaker 1: And it's her daughter falls in love with a unicorn boy.

798
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:53,149
Speaker 0: Wait, unicorn boy?

799
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:53,582
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,038
Speaker 0: Does he transform?

801
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:56,510
Speaker 0: Or is he always a unicorn?

802
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,607
Speaker 1: He can be a boy too.

803
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:58,180
Speaker 0: Okay.

804
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,598
Speaker 1: And that's kind of, it's important and standalone.

805
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:05,790
Speaker 1: I think it gets more treatment in the manga, but it's kind of cute.

806
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,170
Speaker 1: I really like the closing theme.

807
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,287
Speaker 0: Wait, where are the unicorns from?

808
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:10,550
Speaker 1: Space bullshit, I don't remember.

809
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,670
Speaker 0: Is this planet with unicorns?

810
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,430
Speaker 1: It's all Green Lantern space bullshit.

811
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:13,883
Speaker 0: Okay.

812
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,671
Speaker 1: So,

813
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:15,938
Speaker 1: S.T.A.R.S.,

814
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:18,191
Speaker 1: the last season, up through episode 200.

815
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,269
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the last one?

816
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,050
Speaker 0: Because I saw that in the trailer and it looked like Macross 7.

817
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:24,114
Speaker 1: S.T.A.R.S.

819
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:28,850
Speaker 1: is the one where there's dudes who, they transform into Sailor Scouts, so they just become women.

820
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:29,590
Speaker 1: Okay.

821
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,272
Speaker 1: When they transform.

822
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:36,570
Speaker 1: And they are as more powerful than the outer-senshi, than the outer-senshi are, than the inner-senshi.

823
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:37,309
Speaker 1: They're just like gods.

824
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,730
Speaker 0: So the Macross 7 people are the most powerful?

825
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,403
Speaker 1: They're the most powerful Sailor Scouts.

826
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:41,190
Speaker 1: They're badasses.

827
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,637
Speaker 0: Wait, but that thing that's all.

828
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:44,650
Speaker 0: Macross 70 is the end of the whole thing?

829
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:45,025
Speaker 0: Yes.

830
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:46,408
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

831
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,830
Speaker 1: So, everything up through Super S is kind of constrained to this galaxy.

832
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:56,390
Speaker 1: So, it's like our bullshit and our solar system within the greater galaxy doesn't really matter.

833
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,490
Speaker 1: It's just that our solar system has all these problems and we're dealing with them.

834
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,925
Speaker 1: There's an external threat from elsewhere in the galaxy.

835
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:02,590
Speaker 1: We fight it off.

836
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:03,794
Speaker 1: S.T.A.R.S.

837
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,530
Speaker 1: is about the galactic crisis where...

838
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,930
Speaker 0: That's why you need the gods to help you?

839
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bigger Sailor than...

840
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,690
Speaker 0: So how does Sailor Moon even contribute when there's these god guys taking care of it?

841
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,490
Speaker 1: So, like I said, there's a point where she kind of, like her powers work, but she's really not contributing.

842
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:18,397
Speaker 1: And there's a moment in S.T.A.R.S.

843
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:19,502
Speaker 1: where she's like, "Fuck this.

844
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:20,506
Speaker 1: I'm doing the

845
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:20,788
Speaker 1: thing.".

846
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:22,929
Speaker 1: And she does the thing and it's a thing.

847
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,349
Speaker 0: But she has a thing to do?

848
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:35,090
Speaker 1: She actually actively does a thing despite, you know... She demonstrates volition and forethought in a way that is rarely seen in her character up until that point.

849
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:36,910
Speaker 1: Okay.

850
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:45,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's interesting to watch the show and see, like, these middle school hijinks and, like, her stereotypical anime friends, Wakaba and Creepy Dude.

851
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:49,090
Speaker 0: Or, well, we could actually just call Wakaba Naru.

852
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she's a Wakaba.

853
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:51,524
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,451
Speaker 1: Wakaba 100%.

855
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:59,450
Speaker 1: In fact, Wakaba in ways that are surprisingly apt in terms of things that happen to her later.

856
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,669
Speaker 1: In terms of her not being special in any way.

857
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,870
Speaker 1: Kendall Hill Wakaba is not in the 10 Universe.

858
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,189
Speaker 0: But still being a character in the show that matters in the show.

859
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:13,810
Speaker 1: And she matters in the plot, but she's not special in whatever magical way that the special people are special.

860
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,670
Speaker 0: She's not Sailor anything.

861
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's not a duelist.

862
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:16,610
Speaker 1: She's not a Sailor.

863
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,457
Speaker 1: As I recall in S.T.A.R.S.

864
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:23,310
Speaker 1: and even in S, you kind of learn that people who aren't Sailors, their souls just fucking disappear when they die.

865
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,158
Speaker 1: Like, they got nothing.

866
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,210
Speaker 1: They don't get reincarnated.

867
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,830
Speaker 1: Only Sailors get reincarnated because they have real souls.

868
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,070
Speaker 0: Oh, so then Sailor Moon could just, like, get killed in a fight and it wouldn't matter.

869
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,689
Speaker 0: She'd come right back.

870
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,753
Speaker 1: That's the greater plot.

871
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:38,670
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon is the reincarnation of the princess from the previous world that was destroyed in an apocalypse.

872
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:39,569
Speaker 0: Okay.

873
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,355
Speaker 1: So anyway, S.T.A.R.S.

874
00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:47,370
Speaker 1: is the galactic crisis where there's kind of, like, the head Sailor who is taking over the entire galaxy and she's evil.

875
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:50,150
Speaker 0: And Sailor Moon in this... Oh, there's an evil Sailor?

876
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:51,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's...

877
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:57,790
Speaker 0: Why does the... I mean, if this is such a universal thing, what does the universe know about sailing, which is a really Earth-centric concept?

878
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,762
Speaker 1: That word means something special.

879
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:02,940
Speaker 1: That word's the equivalent of... It's like a kryptonite.

880
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,609
Speaker 1: It's a proper noun.

881
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,670
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, but they're wearing clothes that resemble sailing.

882
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:15,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess humans got their sailing tradition from... Well, I put out the Sailor, the galactic Sailors from far away, the Starlights.

883
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:17,337
Speaker 1: They don't wear that shit.

884
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:19,310
Speaker 1: They just wear, like, these black leather outfits.

885
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:20,790
Speaker 0: Sexy sailing.

886
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:22,310
Speaker 1: They're the sexiest.

887
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,087
Speaker 0: In the Navy.

888
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,550
Speaker 1: They also have the best opening theme ever.

889
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,150
Speaker 0: Well, if it's all Macross 7 style, they better, right?

890
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,551
Speaker 0: Yeah.

891
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:33,310
Speaker 1: No, every time they're about to appear, you hear this snapping.

892
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:34,790
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so badass.

893
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:38,204
Speaker 1: And then someone starts whistling and then they appear.

894
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,190
Speaker 1: They're the best.

895
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,769
Speaker 0: If we snap and whistle, will they show up?

896
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:41,467
Speaker 1: I don't know.

897
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,255
Speaker 1: I think I remember.

898
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:43,558
Speaker 1: It's like...

899
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:48,253
Speaker 0: Oh, someone's coming!

900
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:48,660
Speaker 0: Someone's coming!

901
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:54,600
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just Proto Man.

902
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:54,920
Speaker 0: Never mind.

903
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:59,820
Speaker 1: So, again, people are going to correct me, I'm sure, because I've gone over 15-year-old memories.

904
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,880
Speaker 1: Their names were Taiki, Yaten, and I forgot the third guy.

905
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:06,738
Speaker 0: Not Taiko?

906
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,158
Speaker 1: No, I think it's Taiki.

907
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:15,219
Speaker 1: Yaten is the one I definitely remember, because I think there's... Oh, I remember... It might be a translation error.

908
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,838
Speaker 0: Are they named after nebulas or some shit?

909
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:20,940
Speaker 0: I remember seeing a weird... Oh, they're named after stars because they're stars?

910
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:25,320
Speaker 1: Well, one of their powers is a cosmic uterus thing, so...

911
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,260
Speaker 0: Is there one named Soul?

912
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:26,770
Speaker 1: No.

913
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:27,686
Speaker 0: Huh.

914
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:36,560
Speaker 1: So, anyway, I recall a weird, possibly implied romance between Luna and Yaten.

915
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:38,220
Speaker 0: The cat and the rocks?

916
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,879
Speaker 1: That sailor, Starlight, the one with the gray hair.

917
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:42,199
Speaker 0: Okay.

918
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:47,040
Speaker 1: I remember thinking I saw that happening.

919
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,558
Speaker 1: Cat sex?

920
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:51,833
Speaker 1: And then I mentioned it to another friend of mine who was like, "Yeah, I always kind of thought that

921
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:51,934
Speaker 1: too.".

922
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:56,495
Speaker 1: And then he showed me even other scenes where like, "Oh, there was something going on between those

923
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:56,657
Speaker 1: two.".

924
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:59,720
Speaker 1: Even though she's supposed to be dating Artemis, the white cat.

925
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:00,855
Speaker 0: Okay.

926
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,459
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it would be hard to date anything that's not a cat.

927
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:04,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, they would.

928
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:04,620
Speaker 0: You're a cat.

929
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,020
Speaker 0: You're not transforming like the unicorn.

930
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,139
Speaker 1: She dates the unicorn, and right now he's still a unicorn right there.

931
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,144
Speaker 0: Oh.

932
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:12,107
Speaker 0: Oh.

933
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:12,976
Speaker 0: Okay, then.

934
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:14,260
Speaker 1: That's fine.

935
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,840
Speaker 0: Everyone's getting freaky, and Sailor Moon's just clueless.

936
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:29,177
Speaker 1: But yeah, the stars is like, now the galaxy's having this crisis, and Sailor Moon is just like the one power from this one region that's still holding out, and they have to fight back, and it's

937
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,740
Speaker 0: this whole- Oh, because they did such a good job of defending their solar system.

938
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,978
Speaker 1: They're like the only place where- They're the only place- Yeah, they're like the only place left unconquered.

939
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:44,780
Speaker 0: So they end up, by virtue of the fact that they didn't suck in their small local battles, they become like the home base for the galactic battle?

940
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,618
Speaker 1: The galactic resistance basically lands there.

941
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,120
Speaker 0: It's not because they're actually any more special than anyone else.

942
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,980
Speaker 0: It's just they happen to be in a good location.

943
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:51,796
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

944
00:45:53,482 --> 00:46:00,080
Speaker 1: The other things I really remember that specifically, Haruka and Michiru are the best characters in the entire show.

945
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:01,140
Speaker 0: I don't even know who those people are.

946
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,280
Speaker 1: They're Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus.

947
00:46:04,582 --> 00:46:04,840
Speaker 0: Okay.

948
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:06,339
Speaker 0: I know Sailor Uranus from Salty Bet.

949
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:06,992
Speaker 0: Yeah.

950
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,019
Speaker 0: Bet on her usually.

951
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, Uranus, everyone has their token item.

952
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,740
Speaker 0: Oh, I bet Uranus, almost.

953
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:13,579
Speaker 1: Uranus carries a sword, an actual sword.

954
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:14,259
Speaker 0: Cutting people?

955
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,587
Speaker 0: Yeah.

956
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:22,140
Speaker 1: And Neptune is, for my high school eyes watching this show- The hottest?

957
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,580
Speaker 1: The hottest character I'd ever seen in anime other than Unipuma from Tank Police.

958
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:27,751
Speaker 0: Really?

959
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,559
Speaker 1: Not Unipuma?

960
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:30,600
Speaker 1: I was always more a fan of Unipuma.

961
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,200
Speaker 0: You could tell the difference if I had two pictures?

962
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,380
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Unipuma had slightly lighter hair.

963
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:35,880
Speaker 1: Pretty sure.

964
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,780
Speaker 0: Could you tell the difference in the manga where there's no color?

965
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:38,939
Speaker 1: Probably not.

966
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:42,378
Speaker 1: But manga didn't make a lot of sense, I remember, when I tried to read it.

967
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:43,980
Speaker 0: All right.

968
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,280
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say about sailing around the moon?

969
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,840
Speaker 0: I don't know.

970
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,900
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm going to watch it all again because my memories of it, it's interesting.

971
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:06,040
Speaker 1: I remember all the big plot points and they seem really epic and interesting, but at the same time, watching episodes, I'm reminded that 90% of it is her saying, "Sukimi, kawate, ojikio, kyo," and doing all the transition.

972
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,939
Speaker 1: Battles in middle episodes of the season are every Sailor Scout doing their scripted attack one by one.

973
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm saying the whole thing is what, 200-something episodes?

974
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:15,580
Speaker 1: Exactly 200.

975
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,340
Speaker 0: But the first season's only 26?

976
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,792
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, all

977
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:19,058
Speaker 0: right.".

978
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,130
Speaker 0: Yeah.

979
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,040
Speaker 0: And how many, there's five seasons, 20?

980
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,860
Speaker 0: Hey, that doesn't make sense.

981
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,120
Speaker 0: How do you get to 200 episodes with only five seasons?

982
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,654
Speaker 1: Well, there's Sailor Moon, RS.

983
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:30,260
Speaker 1: Let me pull up the full list of episodes.

984
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:35,840
Speaker 0: Some of those other letters of Sailor Moon have to have a lot more than 26 episodes to make this work, right?

985
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:36,820
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon episodes.

986
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,120
Speaker 1: Here we go, list of Sailor Moon episodes.

987
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,380
Speaker 1: Let me get the full breakdown because I'm going to be off on some of my numbers.

988
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:40,851
Speaker 1: Okay.

989
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:42,920
Speaker 1: Oh my God, no, I was wrong.

990
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:46,441
Speaker 1: The original Sailor Moon is actually 46.

991
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:46,937
Speaker 0: There you go.

992
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,939
Speaker 0: That makes more sense.

993
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,854
Speaker 0: I'm like, "How are they going to kill Queen Beryl if they've only just doing Monster of the Week right

994
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:52,999
Speaker 0: now?".

995
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,699
Speaker 0: That makes no sense.

996
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,960
Speaker 1: Six episodes were cut from the English release.

997
00:47:56,402 --> 00:47:57,278
Speaker 0: Was the second one of them?

998
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:58,079
Speaker 0: Yes.

999
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,738
Speaker 0: What were the other ones?

1000
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,619
Speaker 1: So, the other ones were, let's see, what was cut?

1001
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,380
Speaker 1: Punish Them, The House of Fortune is the monster mansion.

1002
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,240
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon fucking loves punishing.

1003
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,699
Speaker 1: A Monster's Scent, Shanella Steels Love, Protect the Melody of Love, Usagi's the Cupid's Scent, episodes five and six were both cut as well.

1004
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,175
Speaker 0: All right.

1005
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:17,300
Speaker 0: We'll probably see those next Monday.

1006
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:20,919
Speaker 1: Episode 20, The Summer, The Ocean, Our Youth, and a Ghost.

1007
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,018
Speaker 1: Ooh, spooky ghost.

1008
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1992.

1009
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,504
Speaker 0: I was 10.

1010
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,320
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1011
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,060
Speaker 1: So, they cut the entire backstory of Sailor Venus.

1012
00:48:32,948 --> 00:48:33,239
Speaker 0: Okay.

1013
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:33,406
Speaker 0: Okay.

1014
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:34,758
Speaker 1: They just skip that.

1015
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,240
Speaker 0: Wait, so Sailor V you don't know anything about?

1016
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, they basically just skip her past and her.

1017
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:53,314
Speaker 1: because, and I remember this because this is when I went to seek the fan subs when I learned about this episode, Sailor Venus basically has a friend who's, something weird happens and Sailor Moon.

1018
00:48:53,434 --> 00:49:00,939
Speaker 1: all could have killed her and there's a debate where they almost kill a regular person and they decided that was too violent for American TV.

1019
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:01,799
Speaker 0: Okay.

1020
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:04,060
Speaker 1: Even though no actual violence happens.

1021
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,780
Speaker 1: It's just an anime.

1022
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,579
Speaker 0: There really isn't any violence in this.

1023
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,940
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon doesn't punch or kick.

1024
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,479
Speaker 0: She got cut?

1025
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all she does is stand there and eventually throws the tiara.

1026
00:49:13,757 --> 00:49:15,980
Speaker 0: and this isn't like an actual action scene, right?

1027
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,636
Speaker 0: Utena has more action and it's more poorly animated because there's actually a sword fight going on.

1028
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,000
Speaker 0: She just stands there, waits for the bad guy, and eventually she throws the tiara.

1029
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,480
Speaker 1: That trope does not change pretty much until the end of the show.

1030
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,959
Speaker 0: You could probably watch.

1031
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,478
Speaker 0: Why would you not?

1032
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,739
Speaker 0: Why would you need to change it?

1033
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:41,019
Speaker 0: The thing is, I wish she would just get there and just immediately be like, tiara action, dust done, instead of waiting there for like 10 minutes and then doing it.

1034
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:44,765
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, bad guy, I'm going to let you do a bunch of shit and then I'll do it.

1035
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,519
Speaker 0: It's like, why?

1036
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,920
Speaker 0: We just want to look at the bad guy because it's so ugly.

1037
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:48,520
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1038
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,136
Speaker 1: What's funny is that the title of the episodes almost seem to get longer and crazier as the show goes on.

1039
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:00,599
Speaker 1: I mean, eventually you get the brightness of the ceiling of the calling stars, Haruka and company into the war.

1040
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,300
Speaker 0: If we make a show, that's the kind of episode titles we're going to have.

1041
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is pretty much the best way to title anything ever.

1042
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,340
Speaker 0: Every title should be like a full...

1043
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:14,379
Speaker 1: When the galaxy perishes, the sailor soldier's final battle is four episodes from the end.

1044
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:23,000
Speaker 0: Okay, so moons, sailing, important animes of historic note.

1045
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,780
Speaker 1: We will probably do some for real modern reviews of every season, or at least every season.

1046
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll make a few videos.

1047
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,571
Speaker 0: We're not going to do a video of every episode like Utena because it doesn't warrant it, and there's 200 of them.

1048
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,880
Speaker 1: You can do an episode of every plot point, but that wouldn't take that long.

1049
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:54,639
Speaker 1: But it's kind of like how if you tell someone the story of an X-Men comic, but you skip all the kind of stupid bullshit that happens in between the actual plot points, it sounds like a really interesting and epic story.

1050
00:50:55,222 --> 00:51:07,420
Speaker 1: But then you read the comic, and there's all this bullshit in between, and the actual dramatic moments, knowing the spoiler of what happened is not much more dramatic than seeing it happen, or not much less dramatic.

1051
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:20,720
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon is kind of the same way in that a lot of it is just stupid filler, but there's little character interactions and little bits that occur in every episode along the way that are actually really good and really plotty.

1052
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,620
Speaker 0: I really wish I could see the consequences, like in the second episode of the kid being evil the day before.

1053
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, like how come he wasn't kicked out of school and sent to jail?

1054
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,579
Speaker 0: Right, and how about the other kids?

1055
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,441
Speaker 0: And how come?

1056
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:37,039
Speaker 0: every time the bad guys come, all they seem to do is put evil on every middle school kid in town?

1057
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,469
Speaker 1: Yup.

1058
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:39,140
Speaker 1: Yes, you eighth graders!

1059
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,820
Speaker 1: Go out and tear this town up.

1060
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:44,240
Speaker 0: This will give energy to my boss enough to finish their evil plan.

1061
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,338
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, you know what the answer is?

1062
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:48,259
Speaker 1: That's why Jedi is going to get Darth Vader in a little bit.

1063
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:50,839
Speaker 1: Jedi is kind of milquetoast.

1064
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,580
Speaker 0: Malachite and- He doesn't even do anything himself.

1065
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,700
Speaker 0: All he does is like send out a bad guy to do something.

1066
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,000
Speaker 1: Actually you can tell that I only watched the dub for the early episodes because I think his name is Kunzite in the Japanese.

1067
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:02,854
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1068
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,580
