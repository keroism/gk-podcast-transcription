1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,288
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, November 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:09,449
Speaker 0: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:13,319
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,327
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,420
Speaker 0: We are talking about hoodies and possibly jackets.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,878
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:28,560
Speaker 0: So, uh, we actually planned to do this show a couple weeks ago, but I had a thing come up and we bailed on the show.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,260
Speaker 0: But then, just a couple days ago, it got cold, so it's actually more topical now than it was two weeks ago.

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:36,473
Speaker 1: Sure.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,350
Speaker 1: Brr.

11
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's, uh- It's cold.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was cold enough where I actually had to go around and, like, turn up the heat in all the different rooms.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,800
Speaker 1: All the heaters are now on, but I have the heaters set to, like, 68, which is, like, what's recommended or whatever, so they don't turn on that much.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine are in, because there's three zones and they're three independent units, but- We got three independent units, yeah.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,276
Speaker 0: The number that it shows, like, the number on that thermostat does not line up to a real temperature.

16
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,340
Speaker 0: It's basically just relative.

17
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:12,500
Speaker 0: Like, it is a temperature number, but because of where the sensors are, they're all, like, accurate to themselves.

18
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,539
Speaker 0: Like, they're consistent, but they're not consistent among each other.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,501
Speaker 0: So, I have one set to, like, 74, one set to, like, 68, and one set to 70.

20
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,166
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it seems fine in here.

21
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,310
Speaker 1: The apartment's well insulated.

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,180
Speaker 1: When the sun shines in, it gets really warm, even if the heaters aren't on.

23
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:33,560
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, you know, we're definitely not- it never gets so cold in here that, like, we're like, "Bird, turn up the heat," right?

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,420
Speaker 1: You know, we just put on a hoodie or a blanket or whatever.

25
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:46,900
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll admit, I like to be in shorts and t-shirt in my entire life, and I like my home to be that warm, which, thankfully, in New York, doesn't really cost anything.

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,540
Speaker 0: Even if I turn the heat off, it's usually short and t-shirt weather inside of our apartment.

27
00:01:55,185 --> 00:02:03,040
Speaker 1: Okay, so, we had a hard time coming up with any news today, so let me geek-bite this thing, because whatever.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,900
Speaker 0: I got a similar thing, because there's no news, really, except the coup attempt and COVID and the hurricanes.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,977
Speaker 1: Alright, so, Mario, Super Mario, not the any other Mario that you might be thinking of, is 35 years old.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking of regular Giuseppe.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, one of the things they did is they released this Mario Brothers Game & Watch, right?

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Speaker 1: So, it's like, it's a Game & Watch, just like the old Game & Watches.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,720
Speaker 1: The only difference, obviously, is that the form factor is the same, but the battery is USB-C, rechargeable battery.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like what AAA's or whatever went in the original Game & Watch.

35
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,749
Speaker 1: No, and the screen is vastly superior.

36
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:49,360
Speaker 1: It is, you know, the right resolution to play Mario 1 on, right?

37
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:58,560
Speaker 1: So, and it has Mario 1, Mario 2, and Ball, but when you play Ball, Ball is the, you know, the old Game & Watch ball game, right?

38
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,451
Speaker 1: When you play Ball, Mario's head is on the guy, it's not Mr.

39
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,154
Speaker 1: Game & Watch.

40
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:03,414
Speaker 1: It's Mr.

41
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,060
Speaker 1: Game & Watch's body with Mario's head.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,880
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, it's only Ball, so I can't play Flagman or Manhole or Octopus?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,746
Speaker 1: They are not on this, no.

44
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:19,220
Speaker 1: The Mario 2 is the real Mario 2, it's not, you know, US Mario to Doki Doki Panic.

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,025
Speaker 1: It's actual, you know, Mario 2.

46
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:22,820
Speaker 0: The Lost Levels!

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, supposedly Lost Levels.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,900
Speaker 0: Of course, depending on which Game & Watch, the originals took those little tiny dime-licking cells of varying types.

49
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,850
Speaker 1: Well, people don't realize, it's like, why is it called Game & Watch?

50
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,460
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's a game and it's also a timepiece, right?

51
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,972
Speaker 1: And so is the case with this anniversary device.

52
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:44,834
Speaker 1: So who is this for?

53
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,760
Speaker 1: At 50 bucks, it's not for a lot of people.

54
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:54,860
Speaker 1: It's for people who, A, want to keep it sealed in the box and never open it and have some kind of collector's thing, right?

55
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,016
Speaker 1: I don't know how much of a collector's thing it's gonna be, 'cause I think it's readily available.

56
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,100
Speaker 0: It's not sold out or anything.

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,240
Speaker 0: Ah, it is sold out everywhere I checked.

58
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:02,484
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

59
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:02,986
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

60
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,554
Speaker 1: Well, I just ordered one, like...

61
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,407
Speaker 0: Nintendo is officially out of stock.

62
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,014
Speaker 0: I'm poking around to see if I can get one anywhere else.

63
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,159
Speaker 0: Not that I'm gonna get one, but...

64
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,725
Speaker 1: It just showed up.

65
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,355
Speaker 1: I ordered it, like, you know, I didn't order it way in advance or anything.

66
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,700
Speaker 1: I ordered it, like, you know, a few months ago.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,540
Speaker 0: I think it sold out post-release, but, like, not that quickly.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:35,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's for someone who does not have any sort of portable... It's like, if you have a phone, I guess it's like... I guess if you don't have any Game Boys or anything and you just want to play, like, Mario and that's it, it's, like, I don't know.

69
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,247
Speaker 1: It's really not that great to play Mario on.

70
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:42,140
Speaker 1: The controls are not the greatest, even though, I mean, the buttons themselves are great.

71
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 1: It's just the form factor of a rectangle is not pleasant to hold, right?

72
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:58,160
Speaker 1: The screen is pretty impressive color-wise and brightness-wise for such a tiny device, especially at this resolution, you know, the resolution of an NES.

73
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,314
Speaker 1: But the refresh rate is pretty good considering, but you can see ghosting, like, behind Mario a little bit.

74
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,460
Speaker 1: It's not... I don't think it's 60 FPS on this screen.

75
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:16,980
Speaker 1: So what I'm actually using it for is not to play Mario so much, but more, like, the watch part.

76
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Speaker 1: So if you try to use it as a watch or, like, a desk clock or a nightstand clock, it doesn't have any alarm feature.

77
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,537
Speaker 1: It's just showing you the time and that's it.

78
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,939
Speaker 0: I feel like this is the kind of thing you either put on your desk at work or, like, leave in a waiting room for people to poke at or on a coffee table for people to poke at.

79
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,781
Speaker 1: Exactly.

80
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,125
Speaker 1: It's pretty good as a desk clock.

81
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:50,680
Speaker 1: So the thing is, if you don't have it plugged into USB all the time, it'll just eventually... You'll see this surprisingly high resolution image of, like, Mario taking a nap and then it will turn off.

82
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:55,500
Speaker 1: So you have to keep the USB-C plugged in at all times for the clock to keep going.

83
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:02,500
Speaker 1: But if you do, it's actually a very nice clock because, like, basically Mario is, like, constantly doing stuff.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,634
Speaker 1: He, like, hits his head on the numbers to change them.

85
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:05,420
Speaker 1: They're made out of bricks.

86
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,664
Speaker 1: You can change the scenery.

87
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:14,200
Speaker 1: Occasionally he'll, like, go into a water level or fight a Bowser just, like, randomly and do all sorts of cute stuff.

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,165
Speaker 1: It's, like, stuff is happening, right?

89
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:20,960
Speaker 1: So it's pretty, you know, it's not boring to have it there, you know?

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,991
Speaker 1: It's, like, a really interesting timepiece.

91
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 1: I guess you could just write a piece of software that does this.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,419
Speaker 1: It's like a screensaver with a clock on it, kind of.

93
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,227
Speaker 0: I guess I stand by.

94
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:34,500
Speaker 0: This is something you put on your desk at work and every now and then you kind of fiddle with.

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,919
Speaker 0: Or someone's, like, coming over to talk to you and they pick it up and fiddle with it.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it also has great potential as if somebody is good at hardware hacking.

97
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,120
Speaker 1: You could, you know, perhaps... I'm pretty sure it's just a ROM and whatever in there.

98
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Speaker 1: So you could easily, if you can get this to run any other program, suddenly it becomes very interesting.

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,380
Speaker 1: So hardware hacky type people should be all over this if you can get one.

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,173
Speaker 0: The pro move would be to steal someone else's, hack it to add creepypasta.

101
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:05,020
Speaker 0: that'll happen occasionally on the clock screen, and then put it back.

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,770
Speaker 1: Creepypasta does happen on the clock screen, normally.

103
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,279
Speaker 1: So it's, like, you'll be, like, "What just happened?

104
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,440
Speaker 1: What?".

105
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,268
Speaker 1: And also the background behind Mario.

106
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:14,152
Speaker 1: It's, like, during the day.

107
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,100
Speaker 1: it's just the normal Mario background color.

108
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:21,040
Speaker 1: But actually it's, like, it fades like it's the sun sets and then it rises in the morning.

109
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,420
Speaker 0: Now I kind of want one, but they're sold out everywhere.

110
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,204
Speaker 1: Alright, well, I got one.

111
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,420
Speaker 1: I ordered it, like, less than a week ago and it showed up, like, the next day.

112
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,420
Speaker 1: I think I ordered it last Friday and it showed up Saturday.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,103
Speaker 0: Oh, not too bad.

114
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:34,967
Speaker 0: I guess it sold out.

115
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,714
Speaker 0: I guess it came out, people were, like, "Oh, it

116
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:37,076
Speaker 0: exists!"

117
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:37,960
Speaker 0: and then it sold out.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, if I didn't get one, I'd have been, like,

119
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:41,138
Speaker 1: "Whatev.".

120
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of how I feel.

121
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:43,948
Speaker 1: It's, like,

122
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:44,152
Speaker 1: "Whatev.".

123
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,300
Speaker 0: I mean, looking at my desk right now, I have two different identical smartphones just sitting here.

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just sort of bought it on a whim, like, "Alright, whatev," you know.

125
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,680
Speaker 0: I've spent more money on dumber things before and this thing's actually pretty cool.

126
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,113
Speaker 1: I've been using it as a clock for, like, a couple days now.

127
00:07:59,153 --> 00:07:59,978
Speaker 1: It's kind of nice, actually.

128
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,989
Speaker 1: You don't want to turn the noise on.

129
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,660
Speaker 1: You can control the sound and the brightness.

130
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:14,019
Speaker 1: You don't want the sound on when it's in clock mode, at least not all the time, because it makes noises constantly, like tick, tick, tick, like doot, doot, doot.

131
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:15,397
Speaker 1: It's annoying.

132
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:22,960
Speaker 1: It's fine if you're just, like, pulling it out of your pocket to check the time, but it's not fine if you've got it on all the time, like on your desk.

133
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,326
Speaker 0: So I bought something not on a whim.

134
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:32,539
Speaker 0: I put myself on the mailing list for this a long time ago, and I finally, it chewed through the queue.

135
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:37,299
Speaker 0: I'm sure this means that version two of this is going to come out, like, right after I get it, but whatever.

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Speaker 0: So I'm finally going to get a Valve Index because I'm kind of going, like, I'm diving deep into VR.

137
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:46,600
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into, like, the games I'm going to play with it or anything because that's more of a Tuesday thing.

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,135
Speaker 1: All two of them.

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,201
Speaker 0: There's more.

140
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker 0: There's actually, Star Wars Squadrons is, don't buy VR just for Star Wars Squadrons, obviously, but Star Wars Squadrons is great in VR.

141
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:07,559
Speaker 0: If you can name, like, four other VR games you want to play, then low-end, like mid-tier consumer VR, probably worth it for you.

142
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:13,920
Speaker 0: But one, I want to develop in VR, and two, I want to try more esoteric and interesting experiences.

143
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:21,580
Speaker 0: And I want to get away from the Facebook ecosystem because they basically said that all Oculus devices will be garbage within a couple of years.

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Speaker 0: We've talked about that before.

145
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,840
Speaker 0: So I figured I got to plan to get off of Oculus before that all breaks because I'm never going to make a Facebook account.

146
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:38,360
Speaker 0: So now I'm going to put the index, which I just got the notification that I'm allowed to buy it, so I bought it.

147
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,119
Speaker 0: It hasn't shipped yet.

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,420
Speaker 0: I think it'll arrive next weekend or maybe, like, Is it just they can't make enough to meet demand?

149
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:47,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just can't make enough to meet demand.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,519
Speaker 1: I can't imagine demand is that high.

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,559
Speaker 1: They must not be able to make that many.

152
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,356
Speaker 0: Basically, what you do is if you try to buy it on Steam, it'll say, "Okay, here's the deal.

153
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,480
Speaker 0: We'll put you in the queue.

154
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,069
Speaker 0: It's just a stacked queue.

155
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,638
Speaker 0: We just chew through the queue as fast as we

156
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:00,859
Speaker 0: can.".

157
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:04,599
Speaker 0: When your number comes up, we're not just going to charge you and ship it.

158
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,499
Speaker 0: We're going to email you and give you a week to decide if you actually still want it.

159
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,720
Speaker 1: Why don't they do this for pre-orders of everything in the world?

160
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:14,649
Speaker 0: Why not?

161
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,380
Speaker 0: Can you imagine?

162
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,560
Speaker 1: They should do this for tickets to concerts.

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,988
Speaker 0: They should do it for a 3080.

164
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,580
Speaker 0: I should be able to just get in a queue for a 3080.

165
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:22,644
Speaker 0: PS5s.

166
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,394
Speaker 0: EVGA just emails me and they're like, "Yo, dog, you still want that 3080?

167
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,497
Speaker 0: Click here and it's

168
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:28,899
Speaker 0: yours.".

169
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,632
Speaker 1: That's a little different because you have several manufacturers.

170
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,557
Speaker 1: There isn't just one product.

171
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,840
Speaker 1: But they could each do their pre-orders in this fashion and you could get on all the queues.

172
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,477
Speaker 1: And then the first one you buy and the rest of them you say no.

173
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,541
Speaker 0: Exactly.

174
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:46,234
Speaker 0: But it helps the scalpers because it's easier then to control.

175
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:48,320
Speaker 0: one Steam account, one thing.

176
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,198
Speaker 0: That's another reason why Valve can do this.

177
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:51,880
Speaker 1: That's also true.

178
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,571
Speaker 0: The problem is now I'm going to get this thing.

179
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,596
Speaker 0: I can use it with my 1080.

180
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:55,977
Speaker 0: It'll be fine.

181
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,351
Speaker 0: It is way better than my Oculus Rift.

182
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,496
Speaker 0: Everything about it is better.

183
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,520
Speaker 0: It'll work better.

184
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,554
Speaker 0: It'll work directly natively with Steam.

185
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:04,340
Speaker 0: so I can just uninstall.

186
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,160
Speaker 1: I guess you'll find out if it's better on paper.

187
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,344
Speaker 0: No, I've used one before.

188
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:17,780
Speaker 0: It is literally the best VR you can possibly get without going into non-consumer hardware.

189
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,312
Speaker 0: The refresh rate, the max refresh rate is 144 which is pretty crazy for VR.

190
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,346
Speaker 0: The resolution is nuts.

191
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:27,872
Speaker 0: It is an experience.

192
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:31,205
Speaker 0: It is a boutique, powerful... This is the max.

193
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,980
Speaker 0: This is like the person who got one of the first 4K monitors for VR.

194
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,065
Speaker 0: And it's only $1000.

195
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,599
Speaker 0: It's actually not that bad.

196
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,540
Speaker 0: So I'm going to rotate the Oculus Rift, the ancient OG one that I've got, into the living room.

197
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:48,440
Speaker 0: But I won't be able to use it out there until I get the 3080 because I ain't buying another video card.

198
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,699
Speaker 0: I want to take this 1080 and put it out there in a new HDPC.

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,376
Speaker 0: And I can't get a 3080 because scalpers bought them all.

200
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,764
Speaker 0: And it is literally scalpers.

201
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:02,500
Speaker 0: I was poking around online and I could buy a 3080 right now if I was willing to pay double MSRP.

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,058
Speaker 0: There's just tons of them.

203
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not the same.

204
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,016
Speaker 1: It's what happens when the supply is low.

205
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,020
Speaker 1: It's not the scalpers fault.

206
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,439
Speaker 1: Scalpers is doing what they do.

207
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,699
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I make that argument all the time.

208
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,393
Speaker 0: When I yell at kids who are mad like, "What do you mean?

209
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:15,639
Speaker 0: PAX hotels sold

210
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:15,800
Speaker 0: out?"

211
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,700
Speaker 0: Like, dude, there's only so many hotels in Boston.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,248
Speaker 1: There's only so many 3080s.

213
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:22,480
Speaker 1: The fab is making them slowly.

214
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,580
Speaker 0: But what's interesting is the scalper market has outpaced the consumer market.

215
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,098
Speaker 0: There are 3080s just for sale that you could just buy right now.

216
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:34,700
Speaker 0: Plenty of them.

217
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,336
Speaker 0: I could go buy three or four if I wanted, but I have to pay the markup, which is about 100% right now.

218
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:46,800
Speaker 1: This is the same as why all the sellers are just really dumb and are not responding to market pressure.

219
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Speaker 1: The same reason you have all these vacant storefronts in the city.

220
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,720
Speaker 1: I guess now it makes sense to have people jacking up their rent.

221
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:59,100
Speaker 1: They'd rather not sell it and set a high price than lower the price until it sells.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:13,540
Speaker 0: Now, the most efficient way to do this, like a 3080, the most efficient market for that could possibly exist for that would be to just they sell them and basically you put in a bid like an exchange limit order book.

223
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,879
Speaker 0: And whoever's willing to pay the most gets the first one.

224
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,387
Speaker 1: Well, this would be something, right?

225
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,814
Speaker 1: So we already have eBay, right?

226
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,140
Speaker 1: eBay exists, right?

227
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,380
Speaker 1: What if instead of eBay, we did like collective eBay where everyone, people are either buyers or sellers.

228
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaker 1: People have 3080s and people have money, right?

229
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:37,800
Speaker 1: If you're a buyer, you type in secretly the most amount, the highest amount you are willing to pay for a 3080.

230
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Speaker 0: Scott, that is literally how the equity stock market works.

231
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:45,094
Speaker 1: And then everyone who's got a 3080 puts in the lowest price.

233
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:45,897
Speaker 1: they'll sell their 3080 for.

234
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,540
Speaker 1: And then it just swaps 3080s as much as possible.

235
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,220
Speaker 0: And all you do is you take like a 0.1% commission to facilitate each transaction.

236
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,261
Speaker 1: Right.

237
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,340
Speaker 1: But no website that does that exists, but it totally could.

238
00:13:59,501 --> 00:13:59,842
Speaker 1: It could.

239
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,373
Speaker 0: That's literally, nothing did that for stocks.

240
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 0: And then one day someone was like, you know what?

241
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,648
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a stock exchange.

242
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,300
Speaker 0: I'm going to write down everyone's orders on a piece of paper.

243
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,867
Speaker 1: eBay sort of does it, but eBay does it like.

244
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,340
Speaker 1: each seller has to intentionally go and set up a specific auction.

245
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,974
Speaker 0: The key would be, because think about who you're selling this to.

246
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,120
Speaker 0: You sell it to normal people.

247
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,261
Speaker 0: Like I would go in there and type a number because I want a 3080.

248
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,379
Speaker 1: I think the thing is I would also, I would also.

249
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,385
Speaker 0: But you're also selling it to the scalpers.

250
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:31,420
Speaker 0: You have to get the scalpers to agree to type in their numbers here and sell it to them as look dudes, put in your numbers here.

251
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:36,140
Speaker 0: And you'll maximize how much you get from your scalping with the real market.

252
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,040
Speaker 1: Well, also with the service that are provided to both peoples, right.

253
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,534
Speaker 1: Is I would justify my fees and increased fees.

254
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,200
Speaker 1: In fact, with escrow, right.

255
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,112
Speaker 1: You send me the 3080, you send me the money.

256
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,162
Speaker 1: I verify it's a legit 3080.

257
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,739
Speaker 1: If it's not, I send the money back.

258
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,384
Speaker 0: Guess what?

259
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,418
Speaker 0: Stock exchanges and clearing houses do.

260
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,319
Speaker 1: Did you verify that the shit's legit?

261
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's exactly like.

262
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:04,020
Speaker 0: basically you have, it's not always escrow, but there are systems that are very similar.

263
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:11,879
Speaker 0: If I buy stock and you sell stock and we end up transacting with our stock on an exchange, the exchange guarantees that we're both going to actually deliver.

264
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,999
Speaker 0: I'm skipping a lot of steps, but it's basically that.

265
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:26,480
Speaker 0: I feel like something like that will exist someday because there's, even if we have communism, communism is not going to cover like complete luxury goods like a 3080.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Speaker 1: Let's just make it and ignore and do what all the Silicon Valley companies do, which is ignore the fact that laws exist until it matters.

267
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,359
Speaker 0: I can't actually imagine anything illegal about this.

268
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,660
Speaker 1: There's no regulation we would have to follow.

269
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,379
Speaker 0: No, it's not illegal to be a scalper.

270
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:42,240
Speaker 0: You can just fucking scalp.

271
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,179
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's just make this website.

272
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,139
Speaker 0: I'll be the head that to the hopper.

273
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:49,611
Speaker 0: It's in the hopper now.

274
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:50,095
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

275
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:52,330
Speaker 0: We'd start with the 3080s.

276
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,878
Speaker 0: I got to go find a scalper to talk to and be like, hey, would you use this?

277
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:03,219
Speaker 0: Alright, in some actual like news news, no one should have had to tell you this.

278
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:07,960
Speaker 0: The news is not that you should do this because that should be obvious.

279
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,740
Speaker 0: You should not travel for Thanksgiving.

280
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Speaker 0: Do not travel anywhere to visit people for Thanksgiving.

281
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,000
Speaker 0: There is a global pandemic.

282
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:18,020
Speaker 0: Good God, do not fly anywhere to see family.

283
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,659
Speaker 0: Do not go on a road trip to see people who you're not already quarantining together with.

284
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:34,700
Speaker 0: If you already close your bubble with someone, like you and another family, mutually exclude the rest of the world, but your kids play together, that's one thing.

285
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,579
Speaker 1: There's a great graphic, guys.

286
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,260
Speaker 0: If there's a person... It is hard to do geek nights on Discord.

287
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:56,300
Speaker 1: I saw this great graphic that was like the bubble you think you have and the bubble you actually have because it showed how, oh, here's a bunch of people and each person in the Venn diagram has a reasonable bubble of only like five people.

288
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:04,760
Speaker 1: But all of those bubbles overlap with like one or two people and your actual bubble ends up being like 30 people.

289
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:14,008
Speaker 1: So, especially on a holiday situation, if you haven't already... Holiday times, especially in the

290
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:14,249
Speaker 1: U.S.,

291
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,640
Speaker 1: it's like you're going to see the relatives you see less often.

292
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
Speaker 1: It's like, no, just see the people.

293
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,135
Speaker 1: If you're not seeing the people on a daily frequent basis already, don't go see them.

294
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:43,919
Speaker 0: Especially because when you form a quarantine bubble as opposed to visiting someone for a one-off, most people I think who actually do that and take it seriously do have that conversation of like, all right, how often do you actually like bump into strangers and you both have to make sure you're at the same level of risk or one party in that group is going to be super screwed.

295
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:48,560
Speaker 0: But like, Uncle Joe, how often do you talk to Uncle Joe?

296
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,820
Speaker 0: You sure Uncle Joe isn't just like going to the bar at night?

297
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,938
Speaker 0: Do you trust Uncle Joe?

298
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,440
Speaker 0: Did Uncle Joe get drunk at the last four Thanksgivings?

299
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,880
Speaker 1: Well, even not Uncle Joe, right?

300
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, so you and your neighbor and your parents.

301
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,760
Speaker 1: But like, anytime I walk outside, I walk past a doorman.

302
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,879
Speaker 0: So that doorman is not in my bubble.

303
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,860
Speaker 1: You're not getting sick from the doorman.

304
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,019
Speaker 0: But I have a contact with that doorman on a regular basis.

305
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,660
Speaker 1: You're not hanging with the doorman long enough to get sick.

306
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,575
Speaker 1: No, but I'm walking past him.

307
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,026
Speaker 1: That doesn't matter.

308
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,360
Speaker 1: You're not going to get sick walking past somebody.

309
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:22,480
Speaker 1: Not for two seconds, right?

310
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Speaker 1: So you got your neighbors, two people, and you got parents, two people, right?

311
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:26,123
Speaker 1: Okay.

312
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,336
Speaker 1: Well, your parents have you, right?

313
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:28,960
Speaker 1: One person.

314
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,079
Speaker 1: And they have their friends.

315
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,480
Speaker 1: Their bubble is also a small little bubble.

316
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,120
Speaker 1: But those friends are in your bubble that you never see, right?

317
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,100
Speaker 1: And then those friends, right?

318
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,560
Speaker 1: Your parents' friends go to see someone on Thanksgiving, right?

319
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:53,640
Speaker 1: And now suddenly all the people that they saw on Thanksgiving and all the people that they previously saw are now in your little safe bubble to five people with just your parents and your neighbor, right?

320
00:18:53,941 --> 00:19:01,380
Speaker 1: Has now been, you know, gets contact with a whole crap ton of people because their parents' friends went to see someone on Thanksgiving.

321
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that if someone flies or travels a long distance, that just opens up a whole door.

322
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,660
Speaker 1: That person's got to go into a one-person bubble.

323
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,095
Speaker 0: Like, I am not going anywhere near an airplane until like 2022 probably.

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely not a boat.

325
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,572
Speaker 0: But the news is the CDC in the U.S.

326
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,740
Speaker 0: actually advised Americans to not travel for Thanksgiving.

327
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:34,120
Speaker 0: And that is notable because up until this point, due to our current president and the Republican Party, they basically prevented federal agencies from telling anyone to not do anything.

328
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,180
Speaker 0: And it is notable that a federal agency is actually giving people good advice again.

329
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,900
Speaker 0: That is a very good sign about the long-term future of America.

330
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:51,060
Speaker 0: But I don't think many people are going to take that advice, and I think there's going to be a big shit show about three weeks after Thanksgiving, to be honest.

331
00:19:52,081 --> 00:20:01,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably, but at least to just make sure it doesn't happen to -- you know, you can't control what the rest of the people in the ridiculous world we live in are going to do, right?

332
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,340
Speaker 1: There's nothing -- you know, if it happens, it's like it sucks.

333
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,217
Speaker 1: I don't want it to happen.

334
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,210
Speaker 1: But what can we really do to stop it?

335
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 1: besides tell people good advice?

336
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,720
Speaker 1: Not much, right?

337
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:13,520
Speaker 1: Well, you know, what's important is just worry about your own people.

338
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,180
Speaker 1: You know, it's like not because that's a good way to think about the world to be tribal and selfish, right?

339
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:29,711
Speaker 1: You should care for all the people, but, you know, when it comes to action, you've got to accept that you can't do anything for the other people, even though you might want to, or there's little you can do.

340
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,180
Speaker 0: Like, I was out walking the other night, and I walked past a bar or a restaurant that was open and had indoor dining, and there were a shit ton of people in there.

341
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,079
Speaker 0: There's nothing I can do about those people.

342
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:41,205
Speaker 1: Nope.

343
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,580
Speaker 0: Just stay away from them.

344
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,458
Speaker 0: Other than avoid them.

345
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:44,499
Speaker 1: Right.

346
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,359
Speaker 0: So last thing, I've been kind of, when I'm exercising, working my way through the original Unsolved Mysteries, because it's all just free on YouTube.

347
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,004
Speaker 1: You can watch anything.

348
00:20:56,024 --> 00:21:07,456
Speaker 1: You have access to all the video, audio, book content in the history, you know, and you choose, of all the things, to watch some garbo TV show from the '80s, '90s.

349
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 0: I'm not watching every episode, and I'm skipping all the boring ones, but basically I'm watching all the, like, UFO bullshit ones that are, like, ghost nonsense, because they're actually, as an adult, I have not seen most of these since I was a kid.

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,856
Speaker 0: They're actually really, really, really funny, if you're an adult, watching a lot of them.

351
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 0: I'm sure they are.

352
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:39,520
Speaker 0: And people have been bugging me about this, because a lot of people know I'm watching Unsolved Mysteries again, and I have a lot of feelings about that show, that there is a new, like, a reboot of Unsolved Mysteries that's on Netflix.

353
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:57,460
Speaker 0: But it's actually, I have not watched it yet, but a lot of people have been telling me that it is kind of, like, serious, like, it's more like a real documentary, and that they are earnestly presenting cases where they believe the public could help solve this crime, or bring someone to justice, or save somebody.

354
00:21:57,962 --> 00:22:06,860
Speaker 0: And it seems like it's actually, it might be kind of like the original show, where, for all the ghost nonsense, they actually did solve a lot of crimes, for real, with people calling in tips.

355
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:17,786
Speaker 1: I also wonder, though, is, like, a lot of those, especially the crime ones, it's like, if you're not local to where that crime was, it's like, you can't, what are the odds?

356
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:18,511
Speaker 1: you can help, right?

357
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:23,040
Speaker 1: You're so... Unless you recognize a person who moved to your neighborhood recently.

358
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,306
Speaker 0: A lot of them were that.

359
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:34,797
Speaker 0: Someone was, like, on the lam after a murder, like, and the phone call was someone in a different state who, like, recognized the person under a different name coming to their golf club, or some crap like that.

360
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:45,179
Speaker 0: But in this case, this news came by, just while I was looking for news today, because I didn't really want to talk about the coup attempt, or the global pandemic, or any of that nonsense too much.

361
00:22:46,120 --> 00:23:00,486
Speaker 0: And not only is the Netflix show apparently, like, legit like this, the new one, but they're actually even, like, right now, there are updates on cases they have covered in the new show, and they're asking the public for more information, and the police are following up.

362
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:03,460
Speaker 0: Like, it seems to be making progress on some cases.

363
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:04,838
Speaker 0: So I'm going to link to one of those.

364
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,038
Speaker 0: Like, they're asking about all these people who went to some party.

365
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:12,600
Speaker 1: These are, like, things that the police should be doing, and not, you know, harassing.

366
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:23,380
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it's almost like we need to completely re-envision what the concept of police is, because right now, if I call the police because someone stole my bike, they're not going to do shit.

367
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,197
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

368
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:32,660
Speaker 0: What do you got?

369
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:34,726
Speaker 1: What do I have?

370
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,800
Speaker 1: So I think I used them as a thing of the day before.

371
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:42,778
Speaker 1: There is an amazing musical group from Korea, of course, known as Norazo.

372
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:51,699
Speaker 1: They did a song that, I mean, they've done a lot of songs, but the first song I saw from them, I think, was the cider song.

373
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,217
Speaker 1: In Korea, I think they refer to Sprite as cider, right?

374
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,060
Speaker 1: C-I-D, whatever.

375
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:04,840
Speaker 1: And then they also had the shower song, and today they have released the bread song.

376
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:12,280
Speaker 1: The music video is kind of amazing, I think because of the restrictions due to the pandemic and such.

377
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,059
Speaker 1: They want to release a music video, but you've got to get a whole crew together, right?

378
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,675
Speaker 1: You've got to get a lot of people in one place to make a music video.

379
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:19,419
Speaker 1: They don't want to do that.

380
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:27,554
Speaker 1: It's a lot of work, especially when, you know, I don't think they're making as much money as some of the other major acts out there, right?

381
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,238
Speaker 1: They're mostly making enough money to keep this going, though.

382
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:41,600
Speaker 1: So the entire music video is green-screened with hilarious CG, and three costumes, and just a couple backup dancers, and that's it.

383
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:53,420
Speaker 1: And it's just like, I think what we're going to be able to tell, looking back, video things-- Who knew production and who didn't when they didn't have all their staff?

384
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,794
Speaker 1: Well, no, you're going to be able to look back and say, "Ah, you see?

385
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:56,619
Speaker 1: This video is--.

386
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,420
Speaker 1: We can tell this video is from 2020, because look at how they tried to reduce how many people were in it," right?

387
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,579
Speaker 1: But yeah, hilarious, excellent video.

388
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,340
Speaker 0: Well, wait until there's movies about the year 2020 or set during this whole pandemic.

389
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:18,100
Speaker 0: Will everyone wear masks in the movie, or will they just not?

390
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,380
Speaker 0: Because that would be weird in a movie if the movie wasn't about the pandemic.

391
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:32,880
Speaker 1: Right, so if you like wacky comedy-type stuff, you know, the sort of ridiculous, eccentric, Eurobeat, high-energy ridiculousness, these are your people.

392
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,960
Speaker 0: So this is just a really cute animation by a third-year CalArts student.

393
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,169
Speaker 0: I just tumbled onto it the other day.

394
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,440
Speaker 0: It's actually a YouTube video from 2013.

395
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,783
Speaker 1: From what year?

396
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:44,157
Speaker 1: Does it have a year on it?

397
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:44,420
Speaker 1: Oh, old, okay.

398
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,294
Speaker 0: It's old, but I've just never seen it until recently.

399
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:47,020
Speaker 0: It's called Moon Goddess.

400
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,704
Speaker 0: It's the story of Aphrodite.

401
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:53,450
Speaker 0: You know the story where dude accidentally sees her naked and she turns him into a deer?

402
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:54,460
Speaker 1: Yes.

403
00:25:54,721 --> 00:26:08,780
Speaker 0: Well, this is a take on that, but dude Aphrodite is just there, or Artemis, Artemis, Artemis is just there being cool, and horny dude shows up being annoying, and Artemis turns horny dude into a deer, and it's cute and funny after that.

404
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did watch this.

405
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember.

406
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,017
Speaker 0: Yep, I liked it.

407
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:14,804
Speaker 0: And the meta moment.

408
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:18,160
Speaker 0: We are, I haven't read any more Tales of Genji.

409
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,979
Speaker 0: I have not gotten past the point where I read two previously yet.

410
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:22,744
Speaker 1: I also have not.

411
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:28,149
Speaker 0: It's a game of chicken on which one of us gets to a new page first, thus triggering the apocalypse.

412
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:29,437
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

413
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:39,440
Speaker 0: New code of conduct, there's conventions, the MagFest virtual convention was announced, so I assume we're going to be taking part in that in some fashion.

414
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:42,117
Speaker 1: Oh, I hadn't thought of that, but I guess that will happen.

415
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:42,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

416
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:43,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, stay tuned.

417
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,039
Speaker 0: There's going to be a VR Gaylord.

418
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,685
Speaker 1: I was thinking about it.

419
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,080
Speaker 1: I was just like, oh, I guess I'll go to that.

420
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,238
Speaker 1: It's like, oh wait, no, I probably have to do a panel edit.

421
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to have to set up all our ridiculous nonsense and do a panel again.

422
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,580
Speaker 1: No.

423
00:26:54,922 --> 00:27:10,349
Speaker 0: Hey, at least we put all the hard work in, we know how to do it, and we've gotten through the growing pains of, let me tell you, it is really fucking hard to record a panel the style of how Rim and Scott normally do panels when we're not in the same room.

424
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,280
Speaker 0: I cannot stress enough.

425
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,780
Speaker 1: I guess the cold is going to make outside not an option.

426
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,302
Speaker 0: I know.

427
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:20,657
Speaker 0: We never even got to the point of doing outside as much as we wanted to because it was also a pain in the ass.

428
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,020
Speaker 0: So we're going to have to go through this one more time.

429
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,720
Speaker 0: I feel like I want to try to structure the kinds of panels we do to be more conducive to this environment.

430
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:34,838
Speaker 0: I don't know what that means or what that looks like, but we'll figure something out.

431
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:40,879
Speaker 0: Otherwise, there's a lot of post-processing and a lot of false starts and a lot of talking over each other that I got to edit out.

432
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,049
Speaker 0: So it's perfect time to talk about this.

433
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:47,458
Speaker 0: It is now officially hoodie weather, though it's rapidly approaching full winter coat weather.

434
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,939
Speaker 0: But it's still at the point where if I go outside, all I got to put on is a hoodie.

435
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,299
Speaker 0: It's not that cold yet.

436
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 0: And we've done a lot of shows on clothes over the years.

437
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,530
Speaker 0: Clothes and Food are two of our go-to.

438
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:06,378
Speaker 0: what are we going to do on Thursday, look around the room, think about a food we've eaten recently and do a whole show on it.

439
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,600
Speaker 0: But hoodies, actually, I think a lot about hoodies.

440
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:11,828
Speaker 0: I own a lot of hoodies now.

441
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,300
Speaker 0: I got a lot to say about hoodies, I think.

442
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,000
Speaker 0: And we'll get into jackets if we run out of steam on hoodies somehow.

443
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,952
Speaker 1: I don't think we'll run out of steam on hoodies.

444
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:20,080
Speaker 1: There's a lot to say about hoodies.

445
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,118
Speaker 0: There is a lot to say about hoodies.

446
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:30,617
Speaker 1: I was watching some videos on YouTube even before we decided on this episode about the history of hoodies, and it was going way back to monks.

447
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,599
Speaker 1: You think about a monk wearing a cloak with a hood.

448
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:39,900
Speaker 1: And it's showing basically the history of hooded garments, which are basically all hoodies.

449
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,880
Speaker 1: They're just different manufacturing methods, different materials and such over time.

450
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,920
Speaker 1: And what we think of today is the champion hoodie made out of cotton jersey.

451
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:56,459
Speaker 0: We think of hoodies, they're usually a pullover or a zip-up.

452
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 0: They got a hood, they got two pockets to the side.

453
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:00,905
Speaker 1: It's a newer garment.

454
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:10,180
Speaker 1: It's not that old on its own, but the hood in general, the hooded jacket of some kind, goes way further back.

455
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,590
Speaker 1: And they're all related.

456
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,678
Speaker 1: They're all the same thing.

457
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:18,640
Speaker 1: And if you're a fashion historian, I guess there's a such thing as that.

458
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:22,900
Speaker 1: There's probably tons of history about every kind of garment.

459
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:40,780
Speaker 1: But the hoodie in particular is just really fascinating in what it means culturally, practically, the different scenarios in which you wear it, places you've seen it that are significant.

460
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,400
Speaker 1: And the signals that it sends and how that's changed over time.

461
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,659
Speaker 1: The types of people who would wear it.

462
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:55,734
Speaker 0: Scrolling through this Wikipedia, it shows a picture from the 70s of people wearing actually modern looking hoodies.

463
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,232
Speaker 0: But that's on the front page of this Wikipedia article.

464
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,032
Speaker 0: Because the 70s, they weren't that common yet.

465
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:04,580
Speaker 0: At least not the way they were later.

466
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:11,499
Speaker 0: But you also see the UK, they have a whole section on bars banning them, getting into the cultural aspects of hoodies.

467
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,914
Speaker 0: We went from a time- Oh great, a picture of the Unabomber.

468
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:15,318
Speaker 0: Here we go.

469
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,004
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

470
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,096
Speaker 1: So you've got Unabomber wearing a hoodie.

471
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,820
Speaker 1: That's iconic.

472
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:26,800
Speaker 1: You've seen, what's the movie, Hot Fuzz, right?

473
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,399
Speaker 1: The bad kids in town are like the hoodies.

474
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,129
Speaker 1: It's sort of like wearing a hoodie is sinister.

475
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,755
Speaker 1: It was associated with gang violence.

476
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:42,500
Speaker 0: It was associated with trying to hide your identity when you needed to, across multiple cultural contexts.

477
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:45,955
Speaker 1: The hood has so many uses, right?

478
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:46,980
Speaker 1: Comfort, warmth.

479
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:52,980
Speaker 0: Like if it's actually cold, a hood on a proper winter jacket is crucial.

480
00:30:56,483 --> 00:31:07,260
Speaker 1: So it went from that, but you've also got like, at least say Silicon Valley CEOs wearing t-shirt and hoodie, as opposed to suit, which all CEOs would wear previously.

481
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:19,419
Speaker 0: Now it's funny, because when I think about my own life, I never wore hoodies, really, until a few packs is in when I bought that Pax hoodie.

482
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:27,578
Speaker 0: I never liked hoodies, because in fact, I never liked long-sleeved garments of any kind, and I tried to avoid wearing them at all costs for much of my life.

483
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:36,760
Speaker 0: Like I never, as a kid, like up until high school, like after high school, never wore sweaters, like ever, except if you and my mom bought me and kind of pushed me into wearing.

484
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,090
Speaker 1: Well, sweaters are a little bit different.

485
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:44,920
Speaker 1: I avoided sweaters in my youth, because the ones I had were like the itchy wool kind.

486
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,296
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I had a few of those.

487
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:58,040
Speaker 0: My mom actually made me get all these Abercrombie ones that were pretty fashionable, but I had kid brain, but my idea of fashion was kid brain fashion, so I didn't like all the fashionable things.

488
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,899
Speaker 1: But I eventually came back to sweaters when I got ones that weren't itchy.

489
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even not itchy.

490
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:11,180
Speaker 0: My whole life, I hate wearing long sleeves, and only in my like late adulthood do I tolerate wearing long sleeves, except in like extreme temperatures.

491
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,611
Speaker 1: You can cut your sleeves off a hoodie if you want.

492
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:13,640
Speaker 1: No one's stopping you.

493
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,322
Speaker 0: Yeah, good.

494
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:31,460
Speaker 0: But in high school, middle school, like whenever I needed something warm, like the kind of weather today where I'd like put on a hoodie, in those times, I was one of those kids who would put on a flannel button-down shirt that I did not actually button, and that was what served as my warming garment.

495
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,500
Speaker 0: I was a flannel kid.

496
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,740
Speaker 1: See, the hoodie, I feel like it's, you know, it's not quite a jacket, and it's not quite a shirt.

497
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,760
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, putting on just a plain sweatshirt, you could, right?

498
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:51,960
Speaker 1: But the plain sweatshirt is more of like either a lounge wear, an athletic wear, maybe you're going outside to like rake the leaves or something, you know?

499
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,099
Speaker 1: It's sort of like, eh, you know, right?

500
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,880
Speaker 1: Whereas the hoodie is like, I need to be warmer than I am now, right?

501
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:01,630
Speaker 1: I'm not necessarily like going out.

502
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,890
Speaker 1: If I'm going out, right, I'm going to put on a jacket, because I'm going out.

503
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,499
Speaker 0: Outdoors.

504
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,846
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on the weather.

505
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:10,220
Speaker 0: I generally also avoid, I don't have light jackets.

506
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Speaker 0: I have full jacket, and I have like nothing.

507
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:19,339
Speaker 1: Sure, but it's like you can put on the jacket, go outside, when you get at your destination, you take off the jacket, put it on a coat rack.

508
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,239
Speaker 0: True, but you keep the hoodie with you.

509
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,880
Speaker 1: Right, then you would, when you leave, right?

510
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Speaker 1: So the jacket is just for keeping you warm during that outside transitionary period.

511
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,800
Speaker 1: The hoodie, it's like the hoodie is making you warmer, but you don't take it off.

512
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,254
Speaker 1: It's an indoor/outdoor, right?

513
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:38,260
Speaker 0: Well, you know where the change was for me?

514
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,078
Speaker 1: I'll even put a jacket on over the hoodie, right?

515
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:52,760
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, it's a little bit cold inside, but it's like too cold inside to just wear a shirt only, but it's really too cold outside to not wear a jacket.

516
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:53,940
Speaker 1: You just described MagFest.

517
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like hoodie, then jacket.

518
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,500
Speaker 1: So it's like I get where I'm going, I take off a jacket, but it's still cold.

519
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,771
Speaker 1: It's a little bit cold inside.

520
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,719
Speaker 1: I got the hoodie.

521
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:16,795
Speaker 0: But it was really like it was conventions that got me to start wearing hoodies, primarily because the way I use a hoodie is it is the versatile garment for the variety of conditions I'll run into, primarily at conventions, like tabletop's.

522
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:20,039
Speaker 0: really cold for some reason, but when I walk out of the main area, it's really warm.

523
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:22,873
Speaker 0: I can take the hoodie off and like tie it around my waist.

524
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:23,900
Speaker 0: That's also fashionable.

525
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:26,659
Speaker 0: If it's really cold, I can pull the hood up and put my hands in the pockets.

526
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I've always had it like, you know, wherever my office is where I'm working, I always have like a hoodie on the chair at work or a hoodie on the chair at home.

527
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:43,699
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like, okay, you know, the place that you are frequently, you've just got this hoodie at the ready.

528
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:47,020
Speaker 1: In case you're cold or whatever, you can just put it on.

529
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,800
Speaker 1: Maybe you just need to, you're going to go out, but you're going out quickly.

530
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,085
Speaker 1: Well, the hoodie's right here.

531
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:58,220
Speaker 1: Grab, go out quickly and then come back in, you know, or maybe it's going to rain, but you're not sure it's going to rain.

532
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:04,300
Speaker 1: And maybe it's not, if it does rain, it's not going to be like umbrella raincoat rain and you're not going to be out that long.

533
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:06,191
Speaker 1: You just don't want your head to get that wet.

534
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,560
Speaker 1: So you just need the hoodie hood.

535
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,759
Speaker 1: You don't need any other kind of, you know, hood action.

536
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,507
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not that cold.

537
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,740
Speaker 1: You don't need a big heavy jacket, but it's going to be windy.

538
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,291
Speaker 1: You want to keep your ears warm.

539
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,259
Speaker 1: You don't want to wear a hat.

540
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:20,982
Speaker 0: Yeah.

541
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:24,140
Speaker 0: The thing is though, the hoodie hoods tend not to be windbreakers.

542
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:30,440
Speaker 0: And if I, if I'm worried about wind, I have a lot of specialized sports jackets and sports gear to cover that sort of thing.

543
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,027
Speaker 0: And I'll use those windows again.

544
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,859
Speaker 1: The wind is that severe that you need a specialized gear.

545
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,520
Speaker 0: But if it's not that severe, I would just never put anything up on my head in the first place.

546
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,173
Speaker 0: Like I almost never pull the hood up on a hoodie like ever.

547
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,339
Speaker 1: No, I use the hood a lot.

548
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,389
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I have a lot of hair.

549
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,595
Speaker 0: I basically have a built in hoodie.

550
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:51,840
Speaker 0: The one thing I hate though, my whole life I have hated pullovers.

551
00:35:52,301 --> 00:36:02,380
Speaker 0: Like I do, I cannot stand a pullover hoodie because the whole point of me wearing a hoodie is that I can take it off and put it on really quickly without like messing up my hair or like any hassle.

552
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,330
Speaker 0: Like I can keep it on zip most of the time.

553
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,940
Speaker 0: I only zip it up if I'm cold.

554
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:09,779
Speaker 0: If it's a pullover, there's a little more hassle to take it out or put it off.

555
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:10,621
Speaker 1: Yeah.

556
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:16,840
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't have hair to worry about, at least not right now, but I still do prefer the zip hoodie to the pullover hoodie.

557
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,797
Speaker 0: People in the chat are really talking about their hoodie preferences, but people are talking about these button up hoodies, which I don't think I've ever seen in my life.

558
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,688
Speaker 1: Button up hoodie is kind of weird.

559
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,340
Speaker 1: It's like, it's even harder to put on.

560
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,626
Speaker 0: I mean, I refuse to wear a button fly.

561
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,130
Speaker 0: I remember those got popular for a little bit.

562
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,397
Speaker 0: I was like, no, that just delays me peeing.

563
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:36,302
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, the pullover hoodie is just sort of like, uh, like.

565
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:42,380
Speaker 1: I don't understand why they still make it when the zipper exists.

566
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,166
Speaker 1: Is it cheaper?

567
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:45,180
Speaker 1: Is like wind going to come in the zipper area?

568
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:54,240
Speaker 0: It's warmer, but the problem for me is if I want something that's like warm, warm, where the zipper is going to matter, I'm wearing a jacket at that point.

569
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:59,260
Speaker 0: And if you're really cold, you get a jacket where you've got the special zippers that are insulated.

570
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,200
Speaker 0: Like all my ski jackets are like that and all my sports jackets are like that.

571
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:08,009
Speaker 0: But I also focus on hoodies as a fashion thing.

572
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 0: Like I mostly wear them, like I said, in conventions because they're versatile, but also because every hoodie I own is definitely social currency.

573
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,600
Speaker 0: They're all either like packs, hoodies, or like from, from some property or like I've got a glitch wave hoodie that I really like.

574
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,760
Speaker 0: Like they're definitely primarily fashion accessory.

575
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Speaker 1: I mean, that is an interesting thing in, in 2020, you know, or at least more recently, right.

576
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,160
Speaker 1: Is it's like, you know, say when like Rocky wore a hoodie, it's like, that wasn't like a fashion item that was like a workout clothing.

577
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:46,380
Speaker 0: Like I'd always imagine hoodies as being black or gray, maybe red, like all one color, cotton, cheap.

578
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,460
Speaker 0: But now when I think of hoodie, I think of like my like line of fancy hoodies that are hanging over there.

579
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,621
Speaker 1: Right.

580
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,745
Speaker 1: It's like the hoodie now.

581
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:57,820
Speaker 1: is it's like, it's, it's utilitarian and fashionable at the same time.

582
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:02,220
Speaker 1: You know, it's, it, you know, you can, you can show off like your, your sweet hoodie.

583
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:10,354
Speaker 1: Let me, Champion, the company, I guess it was originally called something else at the time they invented the hoodie, but it became Champion, which I don't know who owns it now.

584
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,580
Speaker 1: Wikipedia will probably tell you.

585
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,388
Speaker 1: But the brand still exists.

586
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,240
Speaker 1: And that was the brand that invented the hoodie.

587
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,459
Speaker 1: The hoodies they make now are like super nice, fancy fashion hoodies.

588
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:20,740
Speaker 1: Right.

589
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,780
Speaker 1: They're not like, I mean, I guess you could wear one and go rake the leaves, but you probably wouldn't because it's a lot of money.

590
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,140
Speaker 0: I went through this like the cheapest rapid transition, like about 2019 where I had like, I only owned one hoodie.

591
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,620
Speaker 0: It was that original PEX one that I got and it wore the fuck out because I wore it a lot.

592
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:42,540
Speaker 0: And I started to like have to get a new hoodie, wear it out, get a new hoodie, wear it out.

593
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,780
Speaker 0: And I changed to a strategy now of own a bunch of hoodies and rotate through them.

594
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,960
Speaker 0: So no one of them wears out particularly quickly.

595
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:51,101
Speaker 1: Right.

596
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:57,919
Speaker 1: So a Champion, the default pullover Champion hoodie, the reverse weave hoodie is like 60 bucks.

597
00:38:58,902 --> 00:38:59,142
Speaker 1: Right.

598
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:09,380
Speaker 1: But if you scroll down immediately, right past the first row of boring old hoodies, you see just tons of tons of fancy hoodies that are all fashiony.

599
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,576
Speaker 1: We got Mario hoodie, Toad hoodie, Mario hoodie.

600
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:19,660
Speaker 0: I really like hoodies that have a striking, even if they're playing on the outside, the inside of the hood.

601
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,147
Speaker 1: Here's some with iridescent logos on them.

602
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,940
Speaker 1: Here's one with a giant C for Champion on the front.

603
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,387
Speaker 1: Here's some camo hoodies.

604
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,560
Speaker 1: Here's one with a different color hood.

605
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,660
Speaker 1: It's like a white hoodie, but the hood itself is like turquoise and it's kind of fluffy, right?

606
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,185
Speaker 1: I like the materials, right?

607
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:36,820
Speaker 1: So we think of, at least in terms of the Champion hoodie, right?

608
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,740
Speaker 1: You're thinking of like, you know, that sort of cotton jersey sweatshirt, sweat pant material.

609
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,679
Speaker 0: I only have one hoodie like that and I only use it for like ski lodge stuff.

610
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,700
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,866
Speaker 1: Hoodies today, it's like.

612
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,980
Speaker 1: you got fleece lined hoodies and that's like not, that's tame.

613
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,809
Speaker 1: You've got like velour kind of hoodies, all kinds of, you know, fancy materials, different textures, some really smooth hoodies, right?

614
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:06,071
Speaker 1: You got hoodies with like, you know, fancy sport tech type, you know, wools and things, right?

615
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:11,350
Speaker 1: You know, it's all the same shape basically, but different thicknesses, right?

616
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,320
Speaker 1: Here's one with a mesh pocket on the front with a zipper.

617
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,680
Speaker 1: It's obviously not utilitarian pocket, right?

618
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:24,304
Speaker 0: You know, actually I realized one benefit of the pullover hoodie is usually the two pockets combined for added warmth.

619
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:27,120
Speaker 1: Yes, usually you have the kangaroo pocket on the pullover hoodie.

620
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,840
Speaker 1: So if you're into the kangaroo pocket, the zipper isn't going to.

621
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:30,565
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of that.

622
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:32,439
Speaker 0: What I like, I only have one hoodie that has this.

623
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,400
Speaker 0: It's that original Pax Prime hoodie, the blue one, the one that peeled up like we all have.

624
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:47,100
Speaker 0: The thing about that one is in the right pocket, there's a little like sub pocket that is exactly the right size to wedge a cell phone into.

625
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,720
Speaker 0: And I actually love that feature and use it a lot.

626
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,560
Speaker 0: And I've never found another hoodie that has that little tiny sub pocket that is exactly the right size for a cell phone.

627
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,110
Speaker 1: Well, the pocket on the hoodie is another great thing, right?

628
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:01,819
Speaker 1: Because, you know, you think about it.

629
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,995
Speaker 1: It's like, OK, you get pants pocket, right?

630
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:05,860
Speaker 1: Whatever.

631
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,842
Speaker 1: And you got your.

632
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:11,860
Speaker 1: normally if a shirt has a pocket, it's like a dorky pocket, you know, protector pocket, right?

633
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,740
Speaker 1: The hoodie gives you pockets in a place that a coat gives you pockets.

634
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,220
Speaker 1: But now you can have those pockets indoors like those.

635
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,300
Speaker 1: If you had if you're wearing a hoodie, those are now the primary, most accessible, most useful, you know, easily grabable pockets.

636
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,180
Speaker 0: Now, I wouldn't put anything like super important, like I'm not putting my keys in those pockets because I feel like they'd fall out if I wasn't careful.

637
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,152
Speaker 1: It depends on the hoodie.

638
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:43,040
Speaker 0: Somebody said like the pockets have like a little bit, a stitch at the bottom and they're angled the right way to where stuff won't fall out, kind of like bike jerseys.

639
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:48,620
Speaker 0: But I've seen some hoodies where if you like look the wrong way or bend slightly, everything just falls out of the pockets.

640
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,441
Speaker 1: Right.

641
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:53,019
Speaker 1: But also, if you are maybe wearing clothing that does not have any pockets.

642
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:54,561
Speaker 1: Right.

643
00:41:54,922 --> 00:42:04,380
Speaker 1: You know, say maybe you're wearing, you know, some maybe like some like tights for some exercise, like some yoga situation.

644
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:05,083
Speaker 1: Right.

645
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,800
Speaker 1: It's like those don't have pockets on them usually.

646
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,422
Speaker 1: Right.

647
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,125
Speaker 1: Yeah.

648
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:13,540
Speaker 1: Or, you know, maybe you're wearing like a skirt and it doesn't have pockets or a dress with no pockets.

649
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,140
Speaker 1: You know, you could pop a hoodie on over to the top pockets.

650
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:16,941
Speaker 1: Right.

651
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:23,640
Speaker 1: It's a you know, and it's such a. the hoodie is such a, you know, gender neutral garment.

652
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:24,042
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,799
Speaker 1: It's pretty much anyone can wear one at any age.

654
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:27,662
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:30,700
Speaker 1: At any time in almost any situation.

656
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:31,061
Speaker 1: Right.

657
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:32,205
Speaker 1: A hoodie can be appropriate.

658
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:32,346
Speaker 1: Right.

659
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:36,080
Speaker 1: You could even see someone like wearing a fancy gown at a ball.

660
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:36,782
Speaker 1: Right.

661
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,479
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, on their chair at their table where the assigned seating is, they got a hoodie over the back of the chair.

662
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:45,372
Speaker 1: That doesn't seem strange at all.

663
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:46,380
Speaker 0: That's perfectly normal.

664
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,380
Speaker 0: You know, my day job is in capital markets.

665
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:57,040
Speaker 0: And just because of the nature of my work, sometimes I'm wearing like a blazer and sometimes I'm wearing nice jeans, a T-shirt of some kind and a hoodie.

666
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,699
Speaker 0: And that is just totally accepted and expected.

667
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:06,820
Speaker 0: So the fanciest hoodie I own in terms of like the quality, it's weird that this is the one.

668
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:15,420
Speaker 0: Like it is just so much higher quality than any other hoodie I've ever owned is of all things that Penny Arcade, remember Automata?

669
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:16,934
Speaker 1: Oh, that one.

670
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:17,118
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:19,898
Speaker 0: And they made that special like black on black on black hoodie.

672
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:23,020
Speaker 0: That hoodie ended up just being like such high quality.

673
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,258
Speaker 0: Like that is the best hoodie I own by far.

674
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:34,220
Speaker 1: So, you know, early, I guess early in my life, most of the hoodies I got, I would buy, you know, before buying clothes online and going to fancy stores.

675
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,481
Speaker 1: Right.

676
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:38,600
Speaker 1: There was like, you know, the local clothing store that was in Connecticut.

677
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:38,964
Speaker 1: Right.

678
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:39,976
Speaker 1: Where you just buy clothes at.

679
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,660
Speaker 1: I think it was called like Bob's something.

680
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,180
Speaker 1: It wasn't related to the discount furniture, whatever.

681
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,459
Speaker 1: I don't think it was like a huge chain.

682
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,620
Speaker 1: But, you know, imagine like a Kohl's basically.

683
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,906
Speaker 1: Same kind of place.

684
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,820
Speaker 1: Only clothes, mostly clothes.

685
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was Midwest.

686
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:56,560
Speaker 0: So we were mostly national chains.

687
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,123
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:43:58,143 --> 00:43:58,183
Speaker 1: OK.

689
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:00,360
Speaker 1: But I mean, it was still a chain.

690
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,948
Speaker 1: It just, you know, but you'd go in there and if I wanted a hoodie, I would get the one.

691
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:09,320
Speaker 1: I would get a Rangers hoodie or a Mets hoodie or, you know, a sports team related hoodie.

692
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,802
Speaker 1: Right.

693
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,459
Speaker 1: And who knew who was made by.

694
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,439
Speaker 1: And I didn't care about clothing quality then.

695
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:14,043
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,200
Speaker 1: You know, and those are the hoodies I had.

697
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:17,384
Speaker 1: Just whatever.

698
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,880
Speaker 1: I think maybe I did have the actual champion hoodie at one point.

699
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,463
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

700
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:24,780
Speaker 1: You know, but hoodies are actually kind of like expensive.

701
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:25,123
Speaker 1: Right.

702
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:26,476
Speaker 1: Compared to like, say, a shirt.

703
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:26,880
Speaker 1: Right.

704
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:32,380
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if some artist you like is like making merch, it's like you want to buy their T-shirt.

705
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,792
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, OK, 20 bucks, maybe 25, 35 if it's extra fancy.

706
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:36,563
Speaker 1: Right.

707
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:37,570
Speaker 1: They're making a hoodie.

708
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:39,060
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it's 67.

709
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,200
Speaker 1: It's a lot of money suddenly.

710
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:45,480
Speaker 1: But then, you know, I started buying hoodies later with stuff I cared about on them.

711
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:45,880
Speaker 1: Right.

712
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,662
Speaker 1: Like pecs hoodies.

713
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,726
Speaker 1: But they were making these pecs hoodies on.

714
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:59,660
Speaker 1: basically the way that works is, you know, some artist is just buying stock hoodies from some company, Gildan or American Apparel or Hanes or who knows who.

715
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,322
Speaker 1: Right.

716
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:05,120
Speaker 1: For someone of those, you know, major clothing companies just buying blank hoodies and screen printing on them.

717
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:09,379
Speaker 1: And the hoodie that they choose is not always going to be the best hoodie.

718
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,040
Speaker 0: The pecs hoodies have definitely gotten worse and worse quality as time has gone on.

719
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,983
Speaker 0: Like, I'm glad they're buying.

720
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:20,580
Speaker 1: They're basically buying in bulk the cheapest blank hoodie they can get and then putting, you know, pexifying.

721
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,420
Speaker 0: Like, I'm very glad I own the first like pecs blue hoodie, like the good one.

722
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:28,099
Speaker 0: And that first pex east hoodie, because those are way higher quality than the hoodies I've seen.

723
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,880
Speaker 1: They are higher quality, but the quality overall compared to all hoodies in the world is still not that high.

724
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,160
Speaker 1: True.

725
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:45,340
Speaker 1: So the biggest thing that wears out on the hoodies, the problems I've had with them personally is, A, the hood, the inside of the hood can get kind of there even if you wash it.

726
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,320
Speaker 1: Especially if the lining is thin or if the color is bright and your head oils get on there.

727
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,433
Speaker 1: It's like you just can't wash them out no matter what.

728
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:54,540
Speaker 1: And especially I got a bald head.

729
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,300
Speaker 1: So it's even worse if you're putting I guess room is not putting the hood on.

730
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,728
Speaker 0: So I never put the hood on.

731
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,400
Speaker 0: So my hoods are all like immaculate.

732
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,640
Speaker 1: The dark colored hoodie obviously has less problem with that sort of thing.

733
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,360
Speaker 1: And then the other thing is that thin material, right, can wear because you're wearing a hoodie a lot.

734
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,037
Speaker 1: Like you might wear the hoodie every day or frequently.

735
00:46:13,057 --> 00:46:13,500
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:19,080
Speaker 1: So what ends up happening is it just gets worn out because you're wearing it more.

737
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,020
Speaker 1: And the areas that it gets worn out are elbows.

738
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,039
Speaker 1: If you're putting your elbows on tables a lot, especially which I do, I'm doing it right now.

739
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:34,359
Speaker 1: And also the pockets, if you've got stuff in the pockets sagging them down, rubbing on the inside of them.

740
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:46,320
Speaker 1: And so I've had hoodies with like a hole in the pocket or a hoodie where the elbow is... Like all my PAX hoodies, you look at the elbow and it looks like someone just rubbed them a whole bunch.

741
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:55,740
Speaker 0: Well that's especially because when you're wearing a PAX hoodie at PAXs, because we go to a lot of PAXs, half the time you're sitting there with your elbows down on a table playing a tabletop game.

742
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:57,951
Speaker 1: But I do it also just every single day.

743
00:46:57,991 --> 00:46:59,820
Speaker 1: That same hoodie I wear at PAX, I bring to work.

744
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,378
Speaker 1: And then I wear at work all day.

745
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:04,124
Speaker 1: But yeah, they wear out.

746
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:10,270
Speaker 1: So recently I went online and I was searching through hoodies to find like... I didn't care what was on the hoodie.

747
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:11,339
Speaker 1: I was okay with plain color.

748
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:16,620
Speaker 1: I just wanted to find the strongest, most comfortable, highest quality hoodie that was available.

749
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,079
Speaker 0: I think that's the Automata Penny Arcade hoodie.

750
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,800
Speaker 1: No, you haven't seen this hoodie that I got.

751
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:24,860
Speaker 1: So I don't know if this one is the best one.

752
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:31,100
Speaker 1: Because basically what I did is I went and I read a whole ton of hoodie reviews and watched hoodie reviews on YouTube.

753
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:34,659
Speaker 1: And I learned a lot about all the different available hoodies to choose from.

754
00:47:35,182 --> 00:47:37,940
Speaker 1: And I chose one, and that one that I chose was so great.

755
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,140
Speaker 1: So I have nothing to compare it against.

756
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,960
Speaker 1: There may be a greater one that I simply, because I just chose one based on other people's advice, I chose wisely.

757
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,531
Speaker 1: Or it could be that no, actually this isn't the best hoodie.

758
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:50,395
Speaker 1: There is a better one.

759
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,459
Speaker 1: I just didn't discover it.

760
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:54,239
Speaker 1: But it's so much better than any hoodie that I've owned.

761
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,120
Speaker 1: And you can tell immediately out of the box, out of the bag, that it's so great.

762
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,900
Speaker 1: So it's made by this company I've never heard of before called American Giant.

763
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,951
Speaker 1: The hoodie is almost too thick.

764
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:09,180
Speaker 1: It's super warm when you put it on.

765
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:12,978
Speaker 1: It's like, whoa, I had to take it off because I'm too warm.

766
00:48:14,823 --> 00:48:16,854
Speaker 1: They had a medium weight one, but they sold out.

767
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:17,980
Speaker 1: So I kind of want to get one of those.

768
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,440
Speaker 1: The elbows are actually reinforced, right?

769
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:31,180
Speaker 1: So the material for the sleeve, it's got a full sleeve, but then there's an extra piece of material that comes on top of the sleeve, right?

770
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:40,300
Speaker 1: It's like an extra, extra layer that goes from the front half of the forearm, like the bottom half of the forearm, all the way to covering the elbow.

771
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,459
Speaker 1: So it's like double reinforced there.

772
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,340
Speaker 1: And the zipper is way strong.

773
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,005
Speaker 1: The hood, right?

774
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:51,520
Speaker 1: So I look on the Pax hood, for example, the Pax hoodie, and it's two layers on the Pax hoodie.

775
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,020
Speaker 1: There's the cotton jersey, and then there's like this thin lining on the inside, right?

776
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:03,700
Speaker 1: This hoodie, the American Giant one, whatever, the hood is two layers of cotton jersey.

777
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,615
Speaker 1: It's just like a double thick hood, right?

778
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,140
Speaker 1: It's ridiculously solid and heavy, and the size and shape of the hood varies a lot, actually.

779
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,754
Speaker 1: I watched a lot of hoodie reviews, and they were like, "This hood covers my whole head.

780
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:20,475
Speaker 1: This one doesn't.

781
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:21,577
Speaker 1: This one's super huge.

782
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:22,559
Speaker 1: Look, you can't even see my

783
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:22,860
Speaker 1: face.".

784
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:25,019
Speaker 1: There was so much variance in the hood shape.

785
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,127
Speaker 1: You know, this hood keeps falling down.

786
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:31,420
Speaker 1: I can't see with this one, but the hood shape was just excellent.

787
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:38,440
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think if you... The problem is it's just really hard to get sort of the two-in-one deal, right?

788
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Speaker 1: There's nobody out there who's taking an expensive, ultra-high quality garment and then also putting their cool webcomic art on it, right?

789
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,295
Speaker 1: The webcomic artist that wants to sell hoodies, they're going to sell $50 hoodies, not $150 hoodies.

790
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:01,440
Speaker 0: Because most people buying a hoodie for the intellectual property that is associated with it are doing it solely for that purpose.

791
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:02,500
Speaker 1: Exactly.

792
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,500
Speaker 0: It is social currency.

793
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:07,455
Speaker 1: I don't know how much market there is for, you know.

794
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:08,640
Speaker 1: Anyway.

795
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,000
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's the nicest hoodie I've ever had, probably.

796
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,699
Speaker 1: And people I saw who had it and reviewed it said it lasted them many, many years and was still new.

797
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,234
Speaker 1: And holding it, even though it's only a week old or whatever, I can see how that could be the case, and I hope it is.

798
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,480
Speaker 1: So we'll find out.

799
00:50:27,464 --> 00:50:30,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hoodie I got, and it's sad because I got it literally.

800
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:39,520
Speaker 0: I ordered it right before PAX East, went to PAX East, I got this hoodie, and I can't fucking go anywhere.

801
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,700
Speaker 0: So no one's seen me wear it, really, except the burger joint downstairs.

802
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,789
Speaker 0: But I got this super glitch wave hoodie.

803
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,294
Speaker 0: It's like a slim fitting hoodie.

804
00:50:48,414 --> 00:50:50,119
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot more slim fits these days.

805
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,757
Speaker 0: And it's my favorite hoodie.

806
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:57,417
Speaker 0: And I was actually weirdly looking forward to wearing it at a PAX, and I can't.

807
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,467
Speaker 0: Because I'm kind of done wearing the PAX hoodie to the PAX.

808
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:06,420
Speaker 0: That's starting to feel more and more like I'm wearing the shirt of the band to the band's concert.

809
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:13,537
Speaker 0: Like I want to signal some other thing that I'm interested in when I'm at a PAX, because you know I'm a PAX person.

810
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:14,219
Speaker 1: I'm at the PAX.

811
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:19,229
Speaker 1: Alright, well.

812
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:21,808
Speaker 0: I think that killed enough time.

813
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:23,615
Speaker 1: Okay, but yeah, hoodies.

814
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:26,630
Speaker 1: Essential garment of, you know, the times.

815
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,050
Speaker 0: I feel like hoodies are going to be very iconic of the late 2010s and 2020s, like in terms of fashion.

816
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's so many other, you know, every kind of clothing, right?

817
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,809
Speaker 1: You can go on and on about if you knew more about it than we did.

818
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:52,230
Speaker 1: But my guess would be if you're going to pick one particular clothing item, right, that really symbolizes, you know, the time that we have lived in, like the hoodie is way up there, right?

819
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,115
Speaker 1: It's certainly not like the jean.

820
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:55,739
Speaker 1: The jean was for a previous era.

821
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,190
Speaker 1: Not that we don't wear them, but I think it's more symbolic of a time before us.

822
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:06,930
Speaker 0: And I think the types of jeans people wear, like the fashion of jeans, has actually moved around a lot over the last couple of decades.

823
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:10,749
Speaker 1: It's like the baseball hat is strong, but it's not the baseball hat, you know?

824
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't seen a lot of other types of hats.

825
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:16,990
Speaker 0: People are really wearing berets a lot in the US.

826
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,337
Speaker 1: It could be the sneaker.

827
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,049
Speaker 1: The sneaker is really strong, right?

828
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:20,890
Speaker 0: True.

829
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,789
Speaker 1: The hoodie and the sneaker are pretty close.

830
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,877
Speaker 0: But that's really dependent.

831
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:30,269
Speaker 0: I think there's more cultural bounds to the fancy sneakers than there is to a fancy hoodie.

832
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:32,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't have to be fancy.

833
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,763
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, like, all hoodie versus all sneaker, right?

834
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,710
Speaker 1: Anyway.

835
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,905
Speaker 0: I guess I could make a Geek Nights hoodie high quality with the new logos and everything.

836
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,130
Speaker 0: Like, that could be classy.

837
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but how high quality are we going to make it?

838
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:52,870
Speaker 0: Yep, I can make it mid quality without doing any work because I do have that Amazon account, but high quality would take some effort.

839
00:52:54,391 --> 00:53:00,867
Speaker 1: Just so people are aware, let's see, the hoodie that I bought is the American Giant Classic Full Zip.

840
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:03,610
Speaker 1: It costs $112.

841
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:07,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, so would you buy a $120 Geek Nights hoodie?

842
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:08,710
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you're not going to get a high quality hoodie.

843
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:19,150
Speaker 1: I mean, if this hoodie does end up lasting for many, many years more than other hoodies have lasted, then that's actually kind of like a bargain, right?

844
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,998
Speaker 1: Because if you think of regular hoodies, $60, this is the cost of two hoodies.

845
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,030
Speaker 1: If it lasts as long as, you know, two shitty hoodies, you're saving, right?

846
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:28,049
Speaker 0: Someone in the chat said something about Root hoodies.

847
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:31,230
Speaker 1: Like the board game?

848
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,478
Speaker 0: That's what I was assuming.

849
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,190
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just a brand because I don't see any Root.

850
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,270
Speaker 1: There is a company that I think called Roots that makes hoodies.

851
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,124
Speaker 0: I think it's Roots makes good hoodies, not.

852
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:39,790
Speaker 0: there are Roots hoodies.

853
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,422
Speaker 1: Yes, there is a clothing company called Roots.

854
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:43,085
Speaker 1: If you go to roots.com.

855
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:53,930
Speaker 1: The thing I don't like about the Roots ones actually, I did look at those, is that they prominently put the Roots logo like right on the front of pretty much all of their clothing.

856
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,518
Speaker 1: And I like to have clothing where the logo is not on there, right?

857
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:03,170
Speaker 1: You go to Uniqlo and it's like very few clothes at Uniqlo have a Uniqlo logo on the clothes.

858
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,516
Speaker 1: You buy a red shirt there, it's a red shirt.

859
00:54:05,937 --> 00:54:08,425
Speaker 1: But if you buy a Roots hoodie, it says Roots on the front.

860
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:09,830
Speaker 1: Odds are it says Roots on the front.

861
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want that.

862
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:12,910
Speaker 0: That just reeks of Abercrombie and Fitch.

863
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:19,830
Speaker 1: Well, I think the one I hate the most is Superdry because Superdry clothes, actually the aesthetic of those clothes, I like a lot.

864
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:22,630
Speaker 1: It's not my favorite, but I do like it a lot.

865
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,841
Speaker 1: The only thing I'm not a fan of is the puffy jacket.

866
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,590
Speaker 0: I've never liked puffy jacket.

867
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:31,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, every single item of clothing in the Superdry store says Superdry on it.

868
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:38,010
Speaker 1: And it's like if you had just taken your logo off of that clothing, I would have paid probably more than what you're charging to buy it.

869
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,456
Speaker 1: Because the shape looks pretty good.

870
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:45,650
Speaker 1: But no, it says Superdry and I'm like get that shit out of here.

871
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,080
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

872
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,220
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

873

878
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,280
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

879
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:32,820
Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Alan Joyce, Heike McNichol, Marty Grenier, Link E.G, Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

880
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,656
Speaker 0: And I yelled at the cabbie, "Yo, home smell, smell ya

881
00:55:35,696 --> 00:55:35,938
Speaker 0: later!".

882
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:47,920
Speaker 0: Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Chris Minkiff, Dre, Lily Tenebrae, JustLikeADudeGuy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin Von Horl, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

883
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:53,556
Speaker 0: So I'm not going to inflict more Neil Cicierega on you, but instead, I've got something else that's kind of fun.

884
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:54,980
Speaker 0: Hopefully you recognize it.

885
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,467
Speaker 1: It's all skeletons, isn't it?

886
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's go.

887
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,662
Speaker 0: Right, but why is it all skeletons?

888
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:02,910
Speaker 1: What did we do?

889
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,050
Speaker 1: We did have a lot of xylophones on the last record.

890
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,610
Speaker 1: Right, that we did, six or seven.

891
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,290
Speaker 1: Why'd we put so many goddamn xylophones on the song?

892
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:15,290
Speaker 1: I had been listening to a lot of Tom Waits, and he's got those marimbas.

893
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,110
Speaker 1: Under Your Thumb, Rolling Stones.

894
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:17,570
Speaker 0: Exactly.

895
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,429
Speaker 1: It's a cool sound.

896
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,570
Speaker 1: It's woody, it's haunting, it's underutilized in rock music.

897
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,870
Speaker 1: We really should have splurged on the full-sized marimba and not gotten that dinky xylophone.

898
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:27,432
Speaker 1: We should have.

899
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,338
Speaker 0: We totally should have.

900
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:29,244
Speaker 0: Now look what's happened to us.

901
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:30,050
Speaker 1: This is karma.

902
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,030
Speaker 0: If we just run, are they going to chase us?

903
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,521
Speaker 0: They're skeletons, Mike.

904
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:34,810
Speaker 0: They're unpredictable.

905
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,550
Speaker 0: Stand on the Earth, or else we'll lose.
