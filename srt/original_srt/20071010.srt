1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,144
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 10th.

2
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,130
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,036
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

4
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:23,090
Speaker 0: Tonight we review the first two hardcovers/first four trades of The Walking Dead.

5
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,387
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,608
Speaker 0: Next week on Geek Nights.

7
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,200
Speaker 0: It's questions week, amends.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,904
Speaker 1: I'm kind of looking forward to it.

9
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:40,420
Speaker 1: A few of you, and maybe not that many, but a few actually have some good questions.

10
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:48,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, and surprisingly, you know, while you might think that, you know, when something is fun for the listeners, it's not fun for us, it's not true!

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,540
Speaker 0: Questions week is sort of fun for all.

12
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,847
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember- I do questions week every week.

13
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:57,080
Speaker 1: if it wasn't gonna get bad and- Well, then it would turn into a Penn Jillette show.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:06,239
Speaker 0: It's sort of the same reason that Penny Arcade doesn't do Cardboard Tube Samurai more than once a year, because they know if they do it too much, it'll get played out, even though they love it and we love it.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,160
Speaker 1: 'Cause I will admit, when we first did this way back, we did like a Thursday "Ask Rubenscott" anything, and that was super fun.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:12,664
Speaker 1: Yep.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,920
Speaker 0: So, send in questions via forum or email, and we may or may not answer them.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,040
Speaker 0: Make sure that, you know, we're doing this four days of the week.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,160
Speaker 0: So, a Monday question should go to Monday, and a Tuesday question should go to Tuesday, and a Wednesday question for Wednesday, which is today.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,260
Speaker 0: And Thursday, you can ask any question that isn't Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday questions.

21
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:38,020
Speaker 1: And isn't already answered by Google, or perhaps a previous episode of Geek Nights.

22
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,680
Speaker 0: And also, to try not to ask a question that has an incredibly long answer.

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:50,920
Speaker 0: But actually, a lot of people have asked questions that have incredibly long answers, but it's kind of okay, because we're just not gonna answer them next week, but they do make good episode topics.

24
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:56,334
Speaker 1: And I think you'll see a lot of those in the future, because a couple of them I looked and I was like, "What would I say about

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:56,517
Speaker 1: that?".

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,316
Speaker 1: "Oh, that's more than five minutes, doing a whole

27
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:58,498
Speaker 1: show.".

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:58,962
Speaker 0: Yep.

29
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,340
Speaker 0: And they were actually good episode ideas.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,420
Speaker 0: So I guess the next time we ask for episode ideas, just try to ask questions that have really long answers, and that's an episode idea.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Speaker 1: So, uh, nothing interesting happened in our lives in the last 24 to 28 hours or so, so I'll just get right into the news.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
Speaker 0: I'm still, like, got this, like, phlegm coming out of me.

33
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,460
Speaker 1: Hey, you seem a lot better than you were on Monday.

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,920
Speaker 0: I feel better, but my nose is full of snot, and it's going down my throat, and it's not, it's, it's bleh.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,600
Speaker 1: One more night of Sudafed, and you'll be fine.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,744
Speaker 0: I don't know, I'm not even gonna do Sudafed, I'm just gonna- Why not?

37
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:29,780
Speaker 1: Take a Sudafed, can't hurt.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,030
Speaker 0: Sudafed's great.

39
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:31,698
Speaker 1: Now I can't.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,380
Speaker 0: I just blow my nose and cough.

41
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,500
Speaker 1: Or just take a Sudafed and feel great.

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,298
Speaker 0: No, or not.

43
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,940
Speaker 1: Right, so, this is kinda relevant, because *gasp* I read a comic, and, oh, I have news about a comic.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,759
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,847
Speaker 1: Well, kind of.

46
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,000
Speaker 1: It's about a manga.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,960
Speaker 1: But, you know, manga, comic.

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,020
Speaker 0: A manga is a subset of comic.

49
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,920
Speaker 1: But, uh, and I know, I'm curious, how many of you out there are gonna think this is good news, and how many of you are going to think it is bad news?

50
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,297
Speaker 1: And I wonder how many of you can guess what our opinion is.

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,459
Speaker 0: Well, that's easy.

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:09,220
Speaker 1: Dark Horse, who have been putting out, among other things, Blade of the Immortal, which is a very popular manga that's been running for quite some time.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I am under the impression that it is very good, I just have yet to read it.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:22,859
Speaker 1: I remember Greg was reading it, pretty much as it came out, and he had a whole mess of it, I just never- It's, it's a samurai manga, if you like samurai action, like, you know, the Kenshin OAV- Who doesn't like samurai?

55
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,120
Speaker 0: If you like, say, the Kenshin OAV- If you like the first Kenshin OAV- That's what I said.

56
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,577
Speaker 1: You said the Kenshin OAV, that could- There's another one?

57
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,000
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, there's, the first OAV, the Samurai X-.

58
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,020
Speaker 0: You missed my thing, I know about it, I'm saying is that there isn't another one.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,260
Speaker 1: Oh, you're playing the "I have no son" card.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,960
Speaker 1: Exactly.

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:53,320
Speaker 0: So, if you like the Kenshin OAV, or if you like, uh, Lone Wolf and Cub, or some Zatoichi or something like that, you're probably gonna like Blade of the Immortal, and you should buy it at the bookstore on Amazon or something like that.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,383
Speaker 1: Dark Horse has, uh, finally seen the light, they've realized that something they were doing was kinda silly, and not many people cared about it- Or maybe

63
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,078
Speaker 0: they just weren't making money from it, so they-

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,620
Speaker 1: Well, you know, if they weren't making money from it, then it probably was kinda silly, and most people didn't want it.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:18,156
Speaker 1: They're done with monthlies, they're no longer, as of, the last one that will be released on November 7th, going to release Blade of the Immortal in 32-page monthly comics.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,920
Speaker 1: It is only going to come out in trades.

67
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:28,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you see, back in the day, like in the 90s- Well, I guess, graphic novel format, since trade doesn't actually mean the format, it means how it's sold, but anyway.

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,301
Speaker 1: Right, right.

69
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:37,992
Speaker 0: But whatever, in the back of the mid-90s, when they would bring manga to the US, you know, they started out with, you know, Sanctuary, Lone Wolf and Cub- Remember the mid-90s?

70
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,180
Speaker 1: Crying Freeman- People didn't have cell phones, and most people didn't have DVD players?

71
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:46,079
Speaker 1: Project Eiko, uh- Oh, that was a good show, we gotta talk about that.

72
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:52,340
Speaker 0: You know, Viz and Dark Horse are pretty much the only companies putting manga out, except for Marvel with their Akira, right?

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,500
Speaker 0: But even Marvel with its Akira, they put it out in the same format as comic books in the United States.

74
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,074
Speaker 0: They made- they chopped up the manga, and they would put one chapter at a time, in like a 24 or 32 or 36-page comic book.

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,620
Speaker 0: Just like the comic books of old, and the comic books that, you know, people who like underwear pervert comics still get every month.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Speaker 0: Little tiny, flimsy, floppy books that come out every month.

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,999
Speaker 1: That don't fit on a shelf, there's no way to store them easily, if you don't put them in baggies- Unless you buy bags and pieces of cardboard and cardboard boxes.

78
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,439
Speaker 0: Which cost more than the comics themselves sometimes.

79
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, all the mangas came out that way.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:43,500
Speaker 0: But most of those mangas either ended, like Sanctuary, they eventually finished it, or they cancelled, or something happened, right?

81
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:49,640
Speaker 0: And the only one that's still going, that they're still putting out the monthly issues, is Blade of the Immortal.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:06:00,040
Speaker 0: I think even, like, didn't they- they were doing, I think, the other one recently was like the canon god, Exaxian, but I think that one sort of stopped and got held up and had some censorship issues and whatever, so.

83
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,760
Speaker 0: Blade of the Immortal is the only real manga I know of that is still coming- that was still coming out in the United States in the classic monthly comic book format.

84
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:16,620
Speaker 1: And I guess this is just more proof that, by and large, other than fans of traditional comic books in the United States, no one wants that format.

85
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Speaker 0: No one wants that format other than people who like it for nostalgic reasons and people who like to waste money.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,540
Speaker 0: I mean, you could make the argument that they are- A lot of people buy that format because, like, they can't wait.

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,626
Speaker 0: It's like, they need to know what happens next.

88
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:32,839
Speaker 0: right away, as soon as it's possible to get, like, the next page of the thing, they'll get it.

89
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:40,300
Speaker 0: But if that just didn't exist, they would get, you know, the quickest way to get it would be the other format.

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,422
Speaker 1: Well, see, there's two things.

91
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:51,380
Speaker 1: In comics, what a lot of artists do now, maybe not a lot, but they'll release the monthlies, but they'll put little extras in those that won't be in the compilation.

92
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,960
Speaker 0: But also, some people release the monthlies and then put extras in the compilation.

93
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is what you should be doing.

94
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:03,440
Speaker 0: Other people are- they'll write their story, like, "for the trade" in quotes, you know?

95
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,540
Speaker 0: They'll write a story that's meant for a trade, but then it'll get chopped up into four, five, six pieces and put out monthly, and then a trade will come out.

96
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,000
Speaker 0: Or, they'll write for the issues, and then the trade will come, and the trade will be a little bit awkward.

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,295
Speaker 0: Because they didn't write- because it's not one, like, story beginning, middle, end.

98
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,500
Speaker 0: It's a bunch of small stories.

99
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:31,720
Speaker 1: That's actually something that I noticed when I read through the created version of Megatokio, and it just, in a non-webcomic form, it really didn't flow right, and it didn't feel like a comic.

100
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,561
Speaker 0: Nope.

101
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:41,920
Speaker 0: They'll also, like, the end of a plotline will come in the middle of a trade or something, because the number of issues they would've had to combine and stuff, because they didn't write for the trade.

102
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,054
Speaker 0: You know, and it's becoming, you know, it's gonna come to a head, I think, within a year or two.

103
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:50,940
Speaker 0: Either the monthly is gonna die- I hope, I hope, I hope.

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:00,214
Speaker 1: See, I don't think the monthly's gonna die, because that is one of the, like, the monthly mentality of "we've gotta sell these, and the fans have to buy 'em to be loyal to us,".

105
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,040
Speaker 1: and the nostalgia and everything in the underwear pervert industry is so strong.

106
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:07,306
Speaker 1: And no one seems to have the balls to say, "You know what?

107
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:12,418
Speaker 1: This business model is doomed to eventually extinct the entire idea of underwear

108
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:12,839
Speaker 1: perverts.".

109
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:14,726
Speaker 0: Uh, I've been saying that.

110
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,575
Speaker 0: And people seem to go,

111
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,700
Speaker 0: "Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.".

112
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,091
Speaker 1: Well, no, only comic people do.

113
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:22,012
Speaker 0: Other people either don't care- Well, other people don't care and don't read comics.

114
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,160
Speaker 0: I'm saying that's the problem.

115
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,820
Speaker 1: But the thing is, a lot of those other people read manga.

116
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:26,916
Speaker 0: They sure do.

117
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,539
Speaker 0: And, I mean, a lot- It's like, sure, barely anyone reads underwear perverts, and a lot of people are reading manga, but still, not enough.

118
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,890
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on the mon- I mean, every now and then, there's the super hit.

119
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,820
Speaker 1: Like, "Fruits Basket" sold some stupid amount of comics.

120
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:49,020
Speaker 0: It did sell some stupid amount, but even that stupid amount was not even, like, a drop in the bucket compared to, like, an average video game.

121
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even then, it depends on what kind of video game.

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,479
Speaker 0: Or a run-of-the-mill movie.

123
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,600
Speaker 1: Because most video games sell for crap, and then there's the few that actually sell.

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,800
Speaker 0: No, I mean, we're talking, like, a crap video game that sells, like, hundreds of thousands versus, uh, you know, a crap manga which sells a thousand.

125
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:12,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it also- The markets matter, because manga, even if they don't sell in the US so much, still sold in Japan, and made all the money there.

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,500
Speaker 1: But, uh, underwear pervert comics don't sell anywhere but here.

127
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,420
Speaker 0: They actually do sell them in pretty much, like, all around the world.

128
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,940
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but what volumes do they sell in?

129
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,580
Speaker 0: In many different languages.

130
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:30,940
Speaker 0: I mean, how many do they sell in Europe as opposed to- I mean, I guess they don't sell every single title in every single country, but, you know, they have, like, you can get Spider-Man pretty much anywhere.

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,791
Speaker 0: You can get Spider-Man in Japan, or Mexico, Europe, or Africa.

132
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,587
Speaker 1: You can get video games in Australia, too.

133
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,540
Speaker 1: It's just, they come out three months later and cost twice as much.

134
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how much Spider-Man costs in, say, Russia.

135
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:45,420
Speaker 0: Do they have Spider-Man in Russia?

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,437
Speaker 0: Alright, we have a lot of non-.

137
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:47,960
Speaker 0: And how many issues behind are they?

138
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,207
Speaker 1: United States listeners, tell us.

139
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,752
Speaker 1: When do comics come out over there?

140
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,116
Speaker 1: How expensive are they?

141
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,200
Speaker 1: Do they all come out?

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, can you buy Spider-Man and Superman in the store?

143
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,100
Speaker 0: In your language?

144
00:09:58,702 --> 00:09:59,320
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

145
00:09:59,620 --> 00:09:59,716
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:03,039
Speaker 1: I don't think that- I just don't feel like they would sell that well.

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
Speaker 0: Can you get the trades in your country?

148
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,460
Speaker 1: I don't think that underwear perverts have quite the following in other countries that say certain shows have in Mexico.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

150
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:21,440
Speaker 0: Oh, also, just a side note while talking about underwear perverts, in December, Marvel's doing something kinda good, but not super good.

151
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,349
Speaker 0: It's like they're getting closer to the right track.

152
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,760
Speaker 0: If you went to the comic store right now to get some Spider-Man, right?

153
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:38,820
Speaker 0: You'd have a choice between Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, I Can't Even Think But I Know There's More, alright?

154
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,700
Speaker 0: All these different Spider-Man comics, and they're all different.

155
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Speaker 1: That alone was actually the reason I did not get into comics as a kid, because I got- my parents wanted to get me into comics.

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,890
Speaker 1: They got me this X-Men board game, and I was like,

157
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,151
Speaker 1: "Huh.".

158
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,760
Speaker 1: And it came with an X-Men comic, and it didn't make any sense.

159
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,878
Speaker 1: And they were like, "Oh, you gotta read 'em, a bunch of 'em, or else it doesn't make

160
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:57,160
Speaker 1: sense.".

161
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,320
Speaker 0: Actually, the reason they had all those different titles, right, is because, you know, each comic comes out monthly.

162
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,860
Speaker 0: So if they wanna have Spider-Man more than once a month, they make a different Spider-Man.

163
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaker 0: Like, if you just read Friendly Neighborhood, it's like one story, but if you read Amazing, it's another story.

164
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,180
Speaker 0: And they sorta match up a little bit, but each one is like its own story.

165
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,518
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying, so I went, they took me to a comic book store, and I was like, "Okay, I'm just gonna buy a bunch of

166
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:22,240
Speaker 1: X-Men.".

167
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:27,720
Speaker 1: And then I learned that there's X-Men, X-Factor, X-Force, the Uncanny X-Men, and fuck it, and I gave up.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,120
Speaker 1: Yep.

169
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:32,800
Speaker 0: In December, if you go to the comic book store, you're only gonna see one thing.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,780
Speaker 1: Well, you're gonna see Ultimate, and you're gonna- You're only gonna see one thing, a bunch of nerds.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,164
Speaker 0: Well, Ultimate- that's true.

172
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:42,300
Speaker 0: Ultimate Spider-Man is its own separate thing, there's nothing to do with anything, so that'll still be there.

173
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:47,360
Speaker 0: And Marvel Adventures Spider-Man is for little kids, you'll still see that there.

174
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,470
Speaker 1: Honestly, that is my favorite Spider-Man.

175
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,080
Speaker 0: I think that's better than any other Spider-Man.

176
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,179
Speaker 0: Marvel Adventures Spider-Man is pretty good, I have it, did you read it?

177
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:58,880
Speaker 1: I flipped through it, and I liked it a lot, I just haven't had time to read it.

178
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,882
Speaker 0: It's alright, it's alright.

179
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:08,020
Speaker 0: But, if you go to the store in December, you'll see Amazing Spider-Man, Amazing Spider-Man, and Amazing Spider-Man.

180
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,179
Speaker 1: So they have three different comics called Amazing Spider-Man?

181
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,460
Speaker 0: No, it's one comic coming out three times a month.

182
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,260
Speaker 1: I know, I was making fun at the way you presented it.

183
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:27,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it actually is being written by Dan Slott, who in my opinion is the only guy who can write a decent underwear perfect comic these days.

184
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,472
Speaker 1: Oh, these days, I was gonna say, "Heh, Ellen

185
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:29,694
Speaker 1: Moore!"

186
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,061
Speaker 1: These days.

187
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:40,299
Speaker 0: So, I ordered all three and we'll see what comes of it, and if it's not bad, then I'll probably get the trades of the Amazing Spider-Man for that one.

188
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,920
Speaker 1: So, speaking of ADV, what do you got in the news?

189
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 0: Speaking of ADV, right.

190
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,240
Speaker 1: I had no sequitur there, what do you want me to do?

191
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,640
Speaker 0: So there's big news about Genian going down the tubes, and who knows what the hell they're doing, it's not, whatever, they're done.

192
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,717
Speaker 0: ADV laid off 13 people, now people are like, "Oh man, the anime industry down the hole, who knows what's going on,

193
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:02,378
Speaker 0: whoa!".

194
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:06,580
Speaker 0: But actually, ADV is hiring people in other departments.

195
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:18,419
Speaker 1: I think this is much less a, "Oh my god, we're going under," and much more a, "Get rid of employees who weren't pulling their weight, reorganize the company to have more focus on what's

196
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:18,880
Speaker 1: important."

197
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,176
Speaker 1: Which should be marketing, maybe, maybe.

198
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,100
Speaker 0: Not counting freelance people, which, you know, I'm sure they have freelance designers and they have a lot of freelance voice actors and all that stuff.

199
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,896
Speaker 0: They only have like 100 employees, so firing 13 people is like, uh, more than 13% of the workforce.

200
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,062
Speaker 0: That's huge.

201
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:45,540
Speaker 0: But they're gonna hire people in other departments, so I guess they've realized that something about the way they were doing business wasn't working.

202
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:52,420
Speaker 0: And they're rethinking it, which, I don't know the specifics of what they're doing, so I can't give an opinion as to whether I think that's good or bad.

203
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, partly because the anime industry is so secretive for no good reason in this country.

204
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,120
Speaker 0: It's because they're a private company, so they don't have to be any less secretive than they are.

205
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:12,160
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but it seems like a lot of companies, and sometimes it's justified, but like Google was that way for a long time, but they have this idea that if I'm not legally obligated to tell people something, I'm never gonna say anything.

206
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:16,984
Speaker 1: And I think that might hurt 'em a little bit, just 'cause- I think that hurts as an issue for every company.

207
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:25,240
Speaker 0: I think, in general, that with the internet, right, the way things work is people on the internet who are paying attention to information about your company want to know.

208
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:36,673
Speaker 0: And the more open you are with them, they'll be able to see right through you, and if they see that you're doing good things internally, so if you're confident that your company isn't stupid, then being wide open to the public,

209
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:37,294
Speaker 1: people

210
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:42,520
Speaker 0: who don't go on the internet and don't care, they're gonna see your company through your marketing face.

211
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,900
Speaker 0: They're not gonna learn anything about your company that they don't already know, 'cause they don't care, and they're not gonna pay attention.

212
00:14:47,301 --> 00:15:00,160
Speaker 0: And people who do care are gonna find out everything, and if what your company is is good, they'll be happy, and if what your company is is bad, then, well, then you do have something to be ashamed of and regret, you probably should fix that and then open up.

213
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Speaker 1: I just feel like, and this, obviously, I can't let it spawn off into a crazy tangent, because we'll have to do a show- It's already spawning, I feel it.

214
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,160
Speaker 0: We'll have

215
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:24,740
Speaker 1: to do a whole show on it separate, 'cause I got a lot to say, but I feel like the anime industry, as it is run in the United States, is barely alive and just on the verge of collapse at all times, and I think that they're really mismanaging something that could become gigantic and make a lot of money for a lot of people.

216
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:35,000
Speaker 0: I generally feel that almost any business could become and make a lot of money, and a lot of people just don't, and I don't know, you know, maybe 'cause, like us, they don't have the initial investment that's required to do that sort of thing.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,760
Speaker 1: But these companies have a lot already, they already have the contacts, they have some capital, at least I assume they have some capital, they must make some money.

218
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:51,680
Speaker 1: I just, they don't, there are some semi-obvious things that these anime companies could do that would probably make anime a lot more popular, and as a result, allow them to sell more anime.

219
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,780
Speaker 0: Let's do an episode on like what we'd do if we ran an anime company of some sort.

220
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,460
Speaker 1: Let's just leave it at that, we'll do an episode sometime in the future on if we were in charge of ADV, what we would do.

221
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:13,740
Speaker 0: But I think it's generally good that, you know, I don't know if this shift that they're doing in priorities is, this specific thing is good, but the fact that the companies are trying to change to try to do better business is encouraging.

222
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,280
Speaker 1: That means a lot, because I have a lot more respect for someone who tries and fails than someone who never tries.

223
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:25,580
Speaker 0: Yep, who just goes with the status quo, and whether it's profitable or not, and just keeps cranking the crank.

224
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,640
Speaker 0: Yep, but like a good example- Try cranking a different crank if that one doesn't work.

225
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,900
Speaker 1: It's kind of an analogy, but you might notice that oftentimes Scott and I, malign, very obese people.

226
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,580
Speaker 1: But one thing I would never do is if I see someone who's really fat, and they're trying to work out, there's nothing funny about that, because they're trying.

227
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,160
Speaker 1: And the anime industry is a big fat guy right now.

228
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:45,400
Speaker 0: Unless it's that gif on Fark.

229
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:46,379
Speaker 1: That one gif?

230
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:47,019
Speaker 0: That one.

231
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,290
Speaker 1: That wasn't working out, though.

232
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:49,420
Speaker 1: That was King Leonidas.

233
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:55,660
Speaker 0: No, I'm talking about the one on the treadmill with the- I have no idea what you're talking about.

234
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,614
Speaker 0: The big fat lady on the treadmill going

235
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:56,979
Speaker 0: "dunkadunkadunka.".

236
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,240
Speaker 1: I have no idea what you're talking about.

237
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,440
Speaker 0: You've seen that animated gif.

238
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:01,777
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

239
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:02,879
Speaker 0: What the hell?

240
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:07,252
Speaker 1: I don't generally go seek out animated gifs of fat people.

241
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,040
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're doing on the internet.

242
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:12,039
Speaker 0: It's on like all over, you can't possibly avoid it.

243
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,329
Speaker 1: What, like Goatsy?

244
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,760
Speaker 1: Or Lemon Party?

245
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:21,800
Speaker 1: I was just gonna make a nice analogy about how the anime industry is an 800 pound dude, and he's putting down the carrot cake.

246
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,837
Speaker 1: Now he might be picking up the cheesecake, we're not sure, but at least he put down the carrot cake.

247
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:26,359
Speaker 1: It's a start.

248
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,995
Speaker 1: Things of the day, and man, I really want some carrot cake now.

249
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:36,960
Speaker 1: I shouldn't have said that.

250
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,060
Speaker 0: I don't like carrot cake.

251
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,700
Speaker 1: Get the fuck out of this studio.

252
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,640
Speaker 0: I really don't like it.

253
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:46,740
Speaker 0: Cake is supposed to be made of sugary- I like carrots a lot, but- God, there's a lot of sugar in carrots.

254
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but carrot cake doesn't taste- cake is supposed to be made with, like, just like candy.

255
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,120
Speaker 0: Carrots are like candy.

256
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,491
Speaker 0: Cake is not made with candy.

257
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:55,520
Speaker 1: Cake is made with bread.

258
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,619
Speaker 0: Which is candy.

259
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,759
Speaker 1: Bread is candy.

260
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:58,679
Speaker 0: Well, cake bread.

261
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,259
Speaker 1: Carrots are not.

262
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,320
Speaker 0: Cake bread is candy.

263
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:02,360
Speaker 1: What about cheesecake?

264
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,030
Speaker 0: That's cheese.

265
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:04,840
Speaker 0: Cheesy bread.

266
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:07,660
Speaker 1: Okay, it's not crazy bread.

267
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,613
Speaker 0: No, it's more like cream cheese, but harder.

268
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:22,080
Speaker 1: I thought for my thing of the day here, which I found kind of randomly, that maybe I should explain who the person is they're talking about and what the game is they're talking about, but there's a man named Richard Garriott.

269
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,196
Speaker 1: Lord British.

270
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,880
Speaker 1: Lord British.

271
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,684
Speaker 0: He is a famous geek.

272
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:30,580
Speaker 0: Of course, he's not- well, good or bad is up to you, but he's famous.

273
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,482
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say this.

274
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:37,680
Speaker 1: He made a series of inscrutable, unplayable games you might know as Ultima.

275
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,912
Speaker 0: Get ready for the hate mails.

276
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:39,498
Speaker 0: Here they come.

277
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:40,859
Speaker 0: I agree with Rim, by the way.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,653
Speaker 1: Those games were ass.

279
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:54,279
Speaker 1: They were some of the most obtuse, just crap games, and they have such a following, and the following is largely self-referential and made up of-.

280
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:10,759
Speaker 1: But this video effectively will tell you everything you need to know about a man named Richard Garriott, about the Ultima series, about MMORPGs, and about this game that I'd heard of but didn't know or care about, and I'm glad I don't know or care about it.

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard the name of the game in the past, and of course I've heard of Richard Garriott in the past, but I never realized that they were like-.

282
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:26,240
Speaker 0: I didn't get the whole picture, and I'm very glad that the whole picture was presented to me by seemingly a person from Albion who agrees completely with me and would probably be my best friend.

283
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:35,640
Speaker 1: I think my favorite part of this video is when he talks about his opinion of MMOs and then how this game may or may not have changed his opinion on MMOs.

284
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,520
Speaker 0: This guy is definitely, like, the awesome guy, and I want to hang out with him.

285
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,204
Speaker 1: Looks like it's an escapist thing.

286
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:48,040
Speaker 1: You might remember The Escapist, which was awesome until it turned into nothing, but hey, check it out, I'm a girl gamer, by the way, you should play Eve Online.

287
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:49,463
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:51,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder what it's like now.

289
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,680
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go read it this week.

290
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, god, I used to read that when I worked at IBM.

291
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,320
Speaker 0: Well, when it first came out, it was like, holy shit, there's this internet video game magazine- That's erudite and interesting.

292
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,815
Speaker 0: It's erudite, interesting, and only consists of, like, five really amazing essays every week.

293
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,840
Speaker 0: And then it went on and on and on.

294
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,160
Speaker 1: And all the essays were the same.

295
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:20,460
Speaker 0: And then all the essays were the same and it kind of went downhill, and then they were the guys who made the Gamers of Jobs podcast, which was, like, the only good video game podcast, and then they moved over to The Escapist, and then they stopped doing the podcast.

296
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,180
Speaker 0: And then they started doing the podcast at The Escapist, and then they stopped doing it again.

297
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,740
Speaker 1: Plus, when they started it back up, it wasn't good anymore.

298
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:37,200
Speaker 0: So as far as I'm concerned, The Escapist is responsible for the death of the best video game podcast, and they're responsible for, like, a few good essays about video games repeated week after week after week.

299
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,499
Speaker 0: So that gives them a negative in my book.

300
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:40,226
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,100
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

302
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,940
Speaker 0: Except for this video, which might put them at breakeven.

303
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,610
Speaker 1: This video is pretty awesome.

304
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:45,999
Speaker 1: I got to admit, I lulled.

305
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,580
Speaker 0: So triumph, not the word triumph, which means, I guess, to, you know, conquer over something.

306
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,662
Speaker 1: Depends on what context.

307
00:20:53,723 --> 00:21:00,740
Speaker 1: I mean, in Rome, a triumph with a specific and legal boon given to a regeneral upon a great success.

308
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,580
Speaker 1: Like, if you did blah blah blah and you were awesome, it would be granted a triumph.

309
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,817
Speaker 1: Meaning you could ride through the streets of Rome in a great parade with all the...

310
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

311
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,080
Speaker 0: So, triumph is also a company that makes motorcycles.

312
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,940
Speaker 1: Booty of your conquests.

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,080
Speaker 0: And the one motorcycle they make is the Rocket 3, which is, I guess, the biggest motorcycle you can buy.

314
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,394
Speaker 0: At least the biggest, I guess, motorcycle being manufactured.

315
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,120
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone has, like, a custom bike that's bigger.

316
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus theoretically, I could take two wheels and stick, I don't know, a Saturn 5.

317
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,279
Speaker 0: Haha, awesome.

318
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,440
Speaker 0: So, they have a factory where, of course, they make these motorcycles.

319
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:40,480
Speaker 0: And here is a video of what goes on in that factory.

320
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,579
Speaker 0: And I think that is all I will say.

321
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,980
Speaker 1: It's a fascinating documentary.

322
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, of how they make the Triumph Rocket 3 motorcycle.

323
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,613
Speaker 1: Not just how they make it, but how they test it and all that.

324
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:52,880
Speaker 1: It's really kind of fascinating.

325
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,260
Speaker 1: And I didn't know much about motorcycles and their manufacture, but I feel enlightened.

326
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,092
Speaker 0: You can learn a lot from this video.

327
00:21:59,315 --> 00:21:59,860
Speaker 0: I learned a lot.

328
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:00,761
Speaker 1: Right.

329
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:05,180
Speaker 1: So, like I said at the beginning of the show, I read a comic.

330
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,727
Speaker 0: Holy shit, RedRamaComic.

331
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:08,800
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, wait, wait, who's that at the door?

332
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,169
Speaker 0: I think it's Satan.

333
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,855
Speaker 0: And he's wearing a sweater.

334
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 0: Oh, what's that behind him?

335
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,489
Speaker 1: Of course he's wearing a sweater.

336
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,800
Speaker 1: It's like 60 degrees out.

337
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,785
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, what's that behind him?

338
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:20,460
Speaker 0: It looks like a flying pig of some sorts.

339
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:22,727
Speaker 1: Haha, what's that?

340
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,460
Speaker 1: Mega Man's in Smash Brothers Brawl?

341
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:25,405
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

342
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:25,730
Speaker 0: Alright.

343
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,766
Speaker 1: But not only that, one step further.

344
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:33,100
Speaker 1: We're talking about a comic that's about zombies.

345
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:35,540
Speaker 0: Uh-oh, that's gonna make a lot of people happy.

346
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,139
Speaker 1: It's gonna make a lot of people happy.

347
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:39,833
Speaker 0: Not only that, but this comic is not a manga.

348
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:41,380
Speaker 0: It's an American comic book.

349
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,940
Speaker 1: And not only that, but it's pretty good.

350
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,907
Speaker 0: And it's really popular.

351
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,720
Speaker 0: Like, consider this, right?

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,980
Speaker 0: In America, comic books come out like 24 pages a month about, right?

353
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,800
Speaker 0: Those little floppy things we talked about earlier.

354
00:22:55,561 --> 00:22:57,180
Speaker 0: And then they eventually trade them, you know?

355
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,980
Speaker 0: They take each story arc and they make a little book that's a soft cover.

356
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Speaker 0: This thing, this comic book here, other than stuff like Watchmen and whatnot, this is the only comic book in the United States that I know of where month after month, the sales figures on the trade paperbacks go up each month.

357
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,640
Speaker 0: So in month one, say trade paperback number one sells a thousand.

358
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,699
Speaker 0: I'm just making up numbers here.

359
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:23,320
Speaker 0: In month two, the trade paperback will sell like a thousand and twenty.

360
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,880
Speaker 0: And the next month after that, it'll sell a thousand and thirty.

361
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,840
Speaker 0: Which means that the readership of this book is growing a lot.

362
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:31,025
Speaker 0: All the time.

363
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,259
Speaker 0: As far as the last time I checked, it was just a few months ago.

364
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:38,480
Speaker 1: So, without further ado, tonight we're going to review The Walking Day.

365
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:45,800
Speaker 0: Now, what we read is the first two hardcovers, which are the same as the first four trade paperbacks.

366
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 0: Don't even ask me which monthly issues that covers.

367
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,880
Speaker 1: Because it doesn't matter.

368
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:57,560
Speaker 1: And beyond that, I today, because I just recently read both of these in one go, read the summaries of everything that's been released beyond those first two.

369
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:00,280
Speaker 1: So I know the plot as far as it has been released.

370
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:08,900
Speaker 0: The reason I have the hardcovers, which are the same as the first four trades, is because they were actually cheaper, the way I buy comics, to get the hardcovers than to buy all the trades separately.

371
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:16,419
Speaker 1: I'll just note it was interesting, but the author, there's extras in the back of these hardcovers, and there's a little bit of talk, like blah blah blah.

372
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:29,237
Speaker 1: And he expresses, I don't want to dwell on this, but he definitely expresses that sentiment that I hate so much in a lot of American comic people, where he talks about, in this wait for the trade industry...

373
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,480
Speaker 0: You mean spend less money and not give you more money for the same exact product, only worse because it has ads and it's in a bunch of little pieces?

374
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, people who say you should buy the trades because it supports the art, or you don't, god, not the trades.

375
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:42,020
Speaker 0: Buy the monthlys.

376
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,399
Speaker 1: Buy the monthlys because it supports the artists.

377
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,600
Speaker 0: Go listen to the episode we did last week, two weeks ago.

378
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Geek Back, the special, the one about charity and such.

379
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one.

380
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:51,272
Speaker 0: This is not a charity.

381
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,200
Speaker 0: Go listen to that episode.

382
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,512
Speaker 0: Right.

383
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:53,000
Speaker 0: Right.

384
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:56,420
Speaker 0: So this guy who writes this comic is Robert Kirkman.

385
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,280
Speaker 0: And Robert Kirkman, I've read a bunch of his books, not all of them, but a bunch of them.

386
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,391
Speaker 0: And he's a pretty popular guy.

387
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:03,560
Speaker 0: He writes a lot of popular things.

388
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Speaker 0: And for me, personally, he's hit or miss.

389
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,600
Speaker 0: I mean, he wrote that Marvel team-up, the recent Marvel team-up.

390
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:09,826
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

391
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:12,040
Speaker 0: That's like one of the only good recent underwear perverts.

392
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:13,080
Speaker 1: I've heard it was pretty good.

393
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:23,179
Speaker 0: It's basically just, like, underwear perverts in New York, sort of like what the world would be like, but just kind of fun, and yeah, this is how it would be, woo.

394
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,059
Speaker 0: And I like that, because it doesn't take itself all seriously, and it doesn't come up with some contrived BS.

395
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,080
Speaker 0: It's just fun, happy times in underwear pervert land.

396
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,179
Speaker 0: And it's good stuff.

397
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,940
Speaker 0: He also wrote Invincible, which is an underwear pervert book that is for Image Comics.

398
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,280
Speaker 0: And I never read that, but it's pretty popular with some people.

399
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,719
Speaker 0: Another thing he wrote that's popular is that werewolf, I don't know what it's called, but...

400
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Speaker 1: It was a free comic book.

401
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Speaker 0: It was a free comic book, so I read the free comic book.

402
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,200
Speaker 1: I just want to say it's so pedestrian.

403
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,340
Speaker 0: It was called The Astounding Wolfman.

404
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,420
Speaker 1: It was just, it was utterly pedestrian, and that's all I really have to say about it.

405
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,140
Speaker 0: Right, so the book that we're going to talk about is the one that I guess he is, like, the guy of.

406
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Speaker 0: It's like his work, you know, is The Walking Dead.

407
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:15,900
Speaker 1: Now, there's someone else drawing it, and I think the artist actually changed recently, but we're not even going to talk about the art, because the art is just completely un-noteworthy.

408
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,960
Speaker 0: Well, the artwork is done by Tony Moore, who's the guy who does the artwork.

409
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,900
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure someone else is doing it now.

410
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:33,160
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but the artwork that we looked at in these two hardcovers is Tony Moore, and he did stuff like The Exterminators, which I really like, and I tried to get Rym to read, but I don't know where he put it.

411
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,209
Speaker 1: It's somewhere in my room.

412
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:35,360
Speaker 1: I gotta find it so I can read it.

413
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,460
Speaker 0: That's better than Walking Dead, I'll tell you straight up.

414
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,820
Speaker 0: It's written by someone that's not Robert.

415
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,440
Speaker 0: In fact, The Exterminators, I just gotta say this right away, is written by someone who never wrote a comic before in their lives.

416
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:45,138
Speaker 0: Huh.

417
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:46,259
Speaker 0: And it's awesome.

418
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:54,900
Speaker 0: And it's like watching an- well, I guess both of these comics, The Walking Dead and Exterminators, reading them is sort of like watching one of those HBO TV shows.

419
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,583
Speaker 0: It's sort of the same kind of plot, like- Wow, yeah, you know what?

420
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:05,320
Speaker 1: You could take The Walking Dead and adapt it straight up into one of those HBO shows, and it'd probably do super well.

421
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:10,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of the comics I read- In fact, the comic is basically just storyboards for the show.

422
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:10,845
Speaker 0: Yeah.

423
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,926
Speaker 0: So The Walking Dead.

424
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,200
Speaker 0: It's about zombies.

425
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:21,220
Speaker 1: Now, on one hand, it is obviously in the line of all the classic zombies.

426
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,775
Speaker 1: You know, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Dusk of the Dead, Reform of the Dead, Dusk of the Dark.

427
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,920
Speaker 0: Asterisk of the Dead.

428
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:45,760
Speaker 1: And all those movies, and there's a little bit of homage to them, and at the same time, it takes a slightly different take on it, and the author actually went to great lengths to talk about how the one thing that pissed him off about all those zombie movies was that they ended.

429
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,696
Speaker 1: Which on one hand, you can think, "Wow, he just wants to make money by making a comic that never

430
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:50,058
Speaker 1: ends.".

431
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,937
Speaker 1: But two, he's kinda right in that every zombie movie either ends with, "Oh, everybody's dead.

432
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:56,439
Speaker 1: They

433
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:56,820
Speaker 1: lost.".

434
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,473
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, they got away in the helicopter.

435
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:00,397
Speaker 1: The

436
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:00,739
Speaker 1: end.".

437
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, some other place in the world doesn't have zombies.

438
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,896
Speaker 1: Granted, all zombie movies actually end as always, "The real enemy was

439
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:09,859
Speaker 1: mankind.".

440
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:10,975
Speaker 1: Mm-mm-mm.

441
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:12,099
Speaker 1: I'll get to that.

442
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,860
Speaker 1: I really like this, but I have some issues with The Walking Dead.

443
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,499
Speaker 1: As in, I'm not going to buy any more issues.

444
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,580
Speaker 0: Forget about the hate mail for what you said before.

445
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,340
Speaker 0: You're gonna get serious hate mail if you hate on The Walking Dead.

446
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:24,571
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna hate.

447
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:25,260
Speaker 1: Here's my problem.

448
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,560
Speaker 1: The Walking Dead starts out like everything I've ever wanted in a zombie media.

449
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,570
Speaker 0: It sure does.

450
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:33,098
Speaker 0: I got it.

451
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:43,940
Speaker 1: Because every zombie movie is almost always the same, and this one departs a little bit in that it's a lot more procedural, and it skips all the bullshit and gets right to the thing I care about.

452
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, other zombie stuff.

453
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:47,180
Speaker 0: We saw that movie, The Days Later.

454
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,052
Speaker 1: Oh, 28 Days Later was super good.

455
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,800
Speaker 0: It started off pre-zombie, right?

456
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,400
Speaker 0: Then the guy was in a coma, and then he woke up and there were zombies, right?

457
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,360
Speaker 1: And it was really good, except I thought the end was really kinda cheesy and lame.

458
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,369
Speaker 0: It was an okay movie.

459
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:00,299
Speaker 0: It wasn't a great movie.

460
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:02,511
Speaker 0: Did they make a sequel?

461
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:03,480
Speaker 0: I didn't see the sequel.

462
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,260
Speaker 1: As far as I'm concerned, 28 Days Later is an amazing movie up until they meet the military people, and then it's just crap.

463
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,040
Speaker 0: I think it's just an average movie overall.

464
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,358
Speaker 0: But Walking Dead skips over that whole "where did the zombies come

465
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:16,559
Speaker 0: from?"

466
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:16,800
Speaker 0: stuff.

467
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,845
Speaker 0: There's no mystery.

468
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,200
Speaker 0: It's not like, "Huh, where did these zombies come from?

469
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,038
Speaker 0: We should try to find out and then eliminate the cause of the

470
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:23,360
Speaker 0: zombies.".

471
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:24,899
Speaker 1: I sure hope we solve this mystery.

472
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,832
Speaker 0: Or, "Hey, how do zombies work?

473
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,255
Speaker 0: I don't know.

474
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,020
Speaker 0: Let's experiment.

475
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:29,835
Speaker 0: Oh, they get there when they bite in this

476
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:30,400
Speaker 0: discovery.".

477
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,120
Speaker 0: No, it's when it starts, the zombie.

478
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,100
Speaker 0: Well, there is some of that.

479
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,120
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of that.

480
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,820
Speaker 1: There's a lot of that later in the ones you haven't read.

481
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:42,979
Speaker 0: Oh, but mostly it starts off with, "The zombie apocalypse happened, people accepted it, and now they're working

482
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,160
Speaker 0: out.".

483
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,398
Speaker 1: Yep, so it starts with this main character who effectively is a lot like the main character of Firefly, Bao.

484
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:54,120
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of character in the beginning.

485
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,060
Speaker 0: He's just a badass, kind of normal, straight-headed dude who knows the score.

486
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,140
Speaker 0: I think he was an ex-cop, right?

487
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was a cop.

488
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,500
Speaker 0: He was a cop, but then there was a zombie apocalypse, so "cop" doesn't mean much anymore.

489
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,160
Speaker 1: So he wakes up in the hospital 28 days later style, and what the fuck's going on?

490
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:16,640
Speaker 1: And then he discovers zombies, and he runs outside, and this is where I decided this comic was amazing.

491
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,359
Speaker 1: Because instead of the bullshit that happens in every zombie thing, you know what does he do?

492
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:27,720
Speaker 1: Gets some guns, goes out, tries to find people, does everything he can to be awesome, and doesn't fuck anything up.

493
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Speaker 0: And eventually gets to his family.

494
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:37,700
Speaker 1: And they form this group of people who are living in a camp outside of the city of Atlanta, and they learn that all the city's collapsed, and everything's gone, and there's zombies about.

495
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,300
Speaker 0: They come up with a pretty good system.

496
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,800
Speaker 0: They're hanging out by this RV, they got people together, they got food and water, they got zombie defense.

497
00:30:46,282 --> 00:30:47,192
Speaker 0: They got it covered.

498
00:30:47,232 --> 00:30:47,899
Speaker 0: They're making do.

499
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:58,168
Speaker 1: And what I really liked was that, without bogging down on these details, this comic was really procedural about the zombie thing, and it skips a lot.

500
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,160
Speaker 1: It'll skip intervals of time without warning you, but in a really good way.

501
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:07,414
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the burning wheel in gaming, where it gets to a point where it's like, "This is what I was waiting for,".

502
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:07,939
Speaker 1: and it happens.

503
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,700
Speaker 1: And then maybe they foreshadow the next thing that's going to happen.

504
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:15,260
Speaker 1: They don't bother going through all the crap that happens between.

505
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,319
Speaker 1: It just kind of cuts to, "It's four hours later, and they've piled all the zombies they killed into a pile to

506
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:21,539
Speaker 1: burn.".

507
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:28,015
Speaker 0: If you watch a movie like Dawn of the Dead, it's compressed to an hour and a half, two hours.

508
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,979
Speaker 1: And there's a montage.

509
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,440
Speaker 0: But there are scenes like they're ice skating, or they're hanging out drinking coffee in the mall, or they're doing stuff.

510
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:50,400
Speaker 0: And it shows you them going on, and in The Walking Dead, it sort of just skips the day-to-day life of zombie dealing with it.

511
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:52,460
Speaker 0: And it assumes a lot of it.

512
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,898
Speaker 1: It cuts to the next interesting or procedural thing, like, "Alright, we're looking for a new place to

513
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:58,199
Speaker 1: stay.".

514
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,620
Speaker 1: It skips all the stuff on the road, except when they find interesting things along the way.

515
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:08,260
Speaker 0: It's only the interesting and important parts, and all the other zombie stuff is just taken for granted.

516
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,191
Speaker 0: Oftentimes, just killing zombies is taken for granted.

517
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,779
Speaker 0: It's like, "Yep, we're defending zombies,

518
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:13,060
Speaker 0: bam!".

519
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:16,760
Speaker 1: I like the fact that they set up the zombies to allow for a lot of drama.

520
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,260
Speaker 1: The zombies are basically the slow, stupid, easy-to-kill zombies that only get you if there's a bunch of them and they surround you.

521
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:23,820
Speaker 0: Yep.

522
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:35,460
Speaker 0: It's like if you have any sort of martial arts ability and perhaps dangerous weapons, you can kill a bunch of zombies and they won't bite you unless you're really, really dumb.

523
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,259
Speaker 1: Maybe if we ever do another zombie show in a couple years, we should just take this zombie scenario and say what we would do.

524
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,600
Speaker 0: What the characters do up until a certain point.

525
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

526
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,920
Speaker 1: Well, we do have that prison right there.

527
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,440
Speaker 0: I know.

528
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,126
Speaker 0: But, you know, what goes on, it's like you still have.

529
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:59,539
Speaker 0: the drama of society has collapsed, there are zombies everywhere, the zombies used to be people, the moral dilemma of killing them, the...

530
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,702
Speaker 1: There's no moral dilemma.

531
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:02,403
Speaker 1: It's a zombie.

532
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:03,224
Speaker 1: You kill it.

533
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,587
Speaker 0: You gotta fight constantly, action movie kind of thing.

534
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:23,020
Speaker 0: You can have this human drama in this post-apocalyptic world and the zombies only show up when you need them to make a story.

535
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:33,280
Speaker 1: And most of all, just the fact that the characters are largely cool-headed and they generally do, even if not the smartest thing, I can understand why they do the things they do.

536
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:45,397
Speaker 0: They actually try to think about what they're doing and they go along with it and the only time anything gets in their way is if something unexpected happens, like, alright, they'll say, "Oh, there's an unexplored house.

537
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,120
Speaker 0: Alright, we gotta go check for food in this

538
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,400
Speaker 0: house.".

539
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:52,420
Speaker 0: And they're going real slow and cautious, like they got a plan to check out the house and keep everyone safe while doing it.

540
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:01,920
Speaker 0: And they execute that plan, but maybe something will happen, like the house will collapse or something that will be unexpected and that's the only time they'll be fucked, other than a human doing something stupid.

541
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:16,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, once I had read the first hardcover, all the way to the end, and it ends on, not a cliffhanger, but for me, for the thing I wanted, because the first hardcover of this was amazing and it was everything I wanted in a zombie comic.

542
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,500
Speaker 1: And at the end of it, they stumble upon a thing and I think I kind of spoiled it, it's a prison, it doesn't matter.

543
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:34,079
Speaker 1: And that moment was like, "Oh, it's gonna be one of those kind of things where now it's gonna be all procedural, like they're smart, they're gonna go into this prison and clean it out and make a base and something

544
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:34,179
Speaker 1: cool.".

545
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,106
Speaker 0: I mean, that in itself is sort of a new idea.

546
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:43,280
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, zombie, you know, we've had zombie movies and books and stories in malls, right?

547
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,480
Speaker 1: And houses, and nothing else.

548
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,344
Speaker 0: And houses, and office buildings and all.

549
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:55,000
Speaker 0: But a prison, really, when you think about it, is a really like this perfect setting for a sort of a zoomed in human drama zombie plot.

550
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,070
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a place that has jail cells, which can be used for cool things.

551
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,320
Speaker 0: It's a place with a lot of food, there might be prisoners inside, that'll be really interesting.

552
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,349
Speaker 0: There could be zombies in the prison, which would be really interesting.

553
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,540
Speaker 0: There could be like police and weapons and guards in the prison.

554
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:19,480
Speaker 0: There's all this drama, but it's really defensible and hard to get in and out of, but it has a lot of land and, you know, you could live in a prison without any outside contact.

555
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,660
Speaker 0: And there's just so much in a prison that it's just the perfect thing for a zombie story.

556
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,218
Speaker 1: So I finished that, and I read the end of that book right before I got off the train and went to work, and I was like, "Hot fucking

557
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:30,659
Speaker 1: damn!".

558
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:33,687
Speaker 1: This is the best, oh my god, this comic.

559
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:35,753
Speaker 1: This is zombie porn for RIM.

560
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,398
Speaker 1: I'm so excited about this.

561
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:38,200
Speaker 1: This is great.

562
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:46,239
Speaker 1: I can't wait to see how they clear out this prison, and how they're gonna, like them defending against the various zombie attacks, and maybe they're gonna set up some agriculture inside.

563
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got a fence, you don't really need to set up so much.

564
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,389
Speaker 1: It's got three fences!

565
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:51,220
Speaker 1: And like, one of the gates is broken.

566
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,240
Speaker 0: Barbed wires, sniper towers.

567
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,466
Speaker 1: Obviously there's probably riot gear and crap here.

568
00:35:56,506 --> 00:36:01,040
Speaker 1: I wanna see them get that and suit up and use it and make a little society and then try to find local survivors.

569
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:07,920
Speaker 1: Now, here is where I went from liking this comic a lot to not caring about it at all.

570
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,350
Speaker 0: Oh, boo.

571
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:16,440
Speaker 1: So, the next hardcover starts up, and the procedural stuff kinda disappears.

572
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,653
Speaker 0: It's there, because they do- Barely!

573
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,360
Speaker 0: Oh, they do a lot of stuff, clearing out the prison and trying to figure out what to do and all that stuff.

574
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,300
Speaker 1: And that takes almost no pages, and nothing interesting happens.

575
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:34,320
Speaker 1: Because right away they introduce a bunch of prisoners, and unless you're dumb, it's so obvious what's gonna happen with these prisoners.

576
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,020
Speaker 1: And then, it's so obvious, everything's just telegraphed to the point of absurdity.

577
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,000
Speaker 1: And the characters all start becoming bitches.

578
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,420
Speaker 1: And I mean, every single character, every single human, becomes an absolute raging bitch.

579
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:53,254
Speaker 1: And when I say raging bitch, that has nothing to do with gender.

580
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:54,420
Speaker 1: The men are just as bad.

581
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,577
Speaker 1: And everyone's yelling and screaming and fighting, and it's not like, "Oh, the true enemy was

582
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,038
Speaker 1: mankind!".

583
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,814
Speaker 1: It's, "Wow, these people are all stupid?

584
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,558
Speaker 1: I would've shot them

585
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:04,779
Speaker 1: all.".

586
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:12,000
Speaker 0: I think what it is, though, if you look at it the way I saw it when I read it, was yes, everything was sort of foreshadowed and I kinda predicted everything.

587
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,920
Speaker 0: Except for that character who showed up out of nowhere.

588
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what, that character is crap.

589
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,880
Speaker 1: It is, I agree, that character is- That character is such a crap character.

590
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,700
Speaker 0: That was one charac- I thought that character was crap and stupid.

591
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,540
Speaker 1: And you don't even know, when this comic gets into the gladiatorial rings later, it's just dumb.

592
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,540
Speaker 0: I didn't get to any gladiatorial rings that were not in the parts that I actually read.

593
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,090
Speaker 0: Yes, this comic, I read the plot summaries, goes- The gladiator stuff is stuff that Rim read on Wikipedia.

594
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,720
Speaker 0: We're only talking about trades one through four, hardcovers one and two.

595
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:41,580
Speaker 1: Yes, but as far as I read from the summaries, this comic goes down the fucking tube.

596
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:49,640
Speaker 0: Regardless of that fact, the way I saw it was, they showed up at the prison and they had the same idea that they had everywhere else.

597
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,174
Speaker 0: Which is, "Okay, this is how we're gonna do

598
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:51,396
Speaker 0: shit.".

599
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:59,300
Speaker 0: But then, there were these prisoners, and the introduction of the prisoners was like this big monkey wrench in their well-oiled machine.

600
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:02,760
Speaker 1: Except it didn't have to be, they set it up where it could have been okay.

601
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,501
Speaker 1: It could

602
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:25,560
Speaker 0: have been okay, the problem was, is not only were the prisoners sort of the monkey wrench in their machine, but it showed that the machine they had going, which looked like, you know, a machine that was doing the best it could in the situation at hand, what did actually was a flawed machine, and that their own distrust that was imposed by the old human society and the prison, so their distrust of the prisoners is what they eventually, is what ruined them.

603
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,489
Speaker 1: Except they should have mistrusted the fucking prisoners.

604
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:37,520
Speaker 1: The thing is, the way they introduced the prisoners, it's like, there's the big black dude who murdered some people, and there's the little mealy guy who was a tax accountant invasion guy.

605
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,520
Speaker 1: And there's the little stoner guy, and then there's the big awesome guy.

606
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,300
Speaker 1: Well, uh, it's pretty obvious which of those people is the most dangerous, and it's the tax evader guy.

607
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,440
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna worry about spoilers, 'cause it should be so obvious.

608
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:55,300
Speaker 0: Once you're introduced to the character, it is obvious when you see- They show the pictures of all of them.

609
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:55,481
Speaker 1: This

610
00:38:55,561 --> 00:39:10,079
Speaker 0: is seen, the first time you see the prisoners, all of them are sitting at a table, and you see all these prisoners, and just by looking at them, and by knowing how people write, you'll know that, yeah, the tax evader guy obviously is hiding something, and that guy is totally cool.

611
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:23,991
Speaker 1: And, but beyond that, this is my problem, is that one, alright, so, you know, everything Scott said, and also just the stress of this situation is finally breaking these people down and all that, but one, that's what every other stupid zombie thing does.

612
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:27,220
Speaker 1: I don't need to see the same zombie movie over and over and over again.

613
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,800
Speaker 1: The reason I'd like The Walking Dead was that the first two trades were not like every other zombie thing.

614
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,960
Speaker 1: They were a breath of fresh air, and then you just turn to the same bullshit that every other zombie thing is, I might as well just watch Night of the Living Dead, which is better.

615
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,629
Speaker 0: See, I- oh, it's not better.

616
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:45,940
Speaker 1: I think the thing is that- Ah, Night of the Living Dead is the best zombie thing.

617
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,260
Speaker 0: Ah, I think Walking Dead is the best zombie thing.

618
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,540
Speaker 1: It would've been, except for the second hardcover on.

619
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:58,980
Speaker 0: I think the thing is, is that every zombie thing, even Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, is the same thing.

620
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,860
Speaker 0: It's like, first it starts out procedural and people acting smart, and then eventually they lose their cool.

621
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:11,141
Speaker 0: I think what the thing is, is that Walking Dead had a whole two full trades of not losing their cool before it got to the part where the music- No it didn't!

622
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:15,880
Speaker 1: It had two full trades of one person not losing his cool and everyone else being a fucking moron.

623
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:17,659
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't know about that.

624
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,020
Speaker 1: Yelling at each other all the time.

625
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Speaker 0: They were smart enough to go along with what the smart guy was saying.

626
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,880
Speaker 1: Only after the other guy dies!

627
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:26,779
Speaker 0: I guess, yeah.

628
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,160
Speaker 1: And also, just, there are a couple of problems.

629
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,820
Speaker 1: I think my real issue is that this comic does the same thing that every other zombie thing does, but it doesn't do it as plausibly in a lot of points.

630
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:41,876
Speaker 1: Like, the descent into madness and chaos is literally like- Ah-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

631
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:42,705
Speaker 0: Ahhhh!

632
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,720
Speaker 0: It was, I do agree.

633
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,720
Speaker 1: It's like suddenly all the characters are screaming at each other all the time.

634
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,319
Speaker 0: It was indeed a very rapid descent into madness, I must say.

635
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,560
Speaker 1: Panel one, everyone's talking.

636
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Speaker 1: Panel two, everyone's fine.

637
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:55,980
Speaker 1: Panel three, guys smiling.

638
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,020
Speaker 1: Panel four, everyone's screaming.

639
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,160
Speaker 1: Panel five, two people were murdered.

640
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,100
Speaker 1: Panel six, two more people were murdered.

641
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,419
Speaker 1: Panel seven, the zombies fucking broke loose.

642
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,380
Speaker 0: I do agree that in the pacing of at least reading it the way I read it in these two hardcovers, that the descent into madness did come suddenly.

643
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:20,720
Speaker 0: Like, you know, at the end of the first trade everyone was saying, at the beginning of the first trade everyone was saying, you know, and then there was this slight distrust with the prisoners and the little weird stuff going on.

644
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,460
Speaker 0: But then by the end of the second hardcover, they've completely lost it.

645
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,740
Speaker 0: I'm like, whoa, you lost it really quick.

646
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,900
Speaker 0: And maybe on the one hand someone could say, well, they lost it really quick.

647
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,000
Speaker 0: That's the reality of a zombie world.

648
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,099
Speaker 0: That's why every zombie story is the same, because that's how it would be.

649
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,060
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, it really does feel like a too quick a descent into madness.

650
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,420
Speaker 0: I could have bought it more easily if the descent into madness, they would have been completely mad at the end of, say, the third hardcover.

651
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,840
Speaker 1: It just, it wasn't well done, and it wasn't well paced.

652
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,240
Speaker 1: And because it was, in addition to that, the same as every other zombie thing, it lost all its pizzazz.

653
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Speaker 1: Also, this comic has a tendency of, any time the writer, I guess, that gets bored, he just randomly kills someone.

654
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:06,033
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, shit

655
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:06,560
Speaker 1: zombies!".

656
00:42:06,661 --> 00:42:08,235
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, shit serial

657
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:08,558
Speaker 1: killer!".

658
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,438
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, shit crazy village run by some crazy guy who has a zombie daughter and has gladiatorial

659
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:14,860
Speaker 1: fights!".

660
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:23,520
Speaker 1: Or, everything they run into is just weird and implausible, and all the characters they meet along the way are... They don't act like humans.

661
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,960
Speaker 1: And like, there's a thing with a double suicide that happens, and it's just so out of nowhere.

662
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,859
Speaker 1: And it's not like, "Oh, I'm mad because they didn't foreshadow this, but they did foreshadow

663
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,000
Speaker 1: this.".

664
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:35,276
Speaker 1: No.

665
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,860
Speaker 1: There's a certain amount of foreshadowing that is required, lest you have everything just be a deus ex machina, or just a monkey wrench in the plot.

666
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:50,300
Speaker 1: And this comic either foreshadows things stupidly to the point that it's obvious what's gonna happen, or just has crazy bad shit come out of nowhere.

667
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,620
Speaker 0: Could that also be, though, an effect of your enhanced reading abilities?

668
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,356
Speaker 1: You know what, if that's the case, then this is below me.

669
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:58,840
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

670
00:43:00,843 --> 00:43:02,879
Speaker 1: I can't, I gotta go read, I don't know.

671
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:06,260
Speaker 0: No, I too saw through all the foreshadowing as well, and knew exactly what was gonna happen.

672
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,860
Speaker 1: Except for the things that weren't foreshadowed at all, or that were foreshadowed poorly.

673
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:12,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the fact that it was a prison, I was like, "Oh man, it's a

674
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:12,679
Speaker 0: prison.".

675
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,080
Speaker 1: The double suicide thing, when you get to it, is really dumb and not explained at all.

676
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:25,640
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's cool to have an unexplained thing in the universe, but it's unexplained in a really bad way and just doesn't make sense.

677
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:27,547
Speaker 0: I didn't feel so poorly.

678
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:30,000
Speaker 0: I mean, the double suicide wasn't, like, my favorite part or anything.

679
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,100
Speaker 1: It came out of nowhere and served no purpose.

680
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,680
Speaker 0: It didn't leave a particularly bad taste.

681
00:43:33,901 --> 00:43:38,640
Speaker 1: And also, the characters who did it had no motivation to do that.

682
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,340
Speaker 1: There was nothing there for that, at all.

683
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:42,823
Speaker 0: I don't know.

684
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,251
Speaker 1: There was some dialogue before they did it.

685
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,897
Speaker 1: No, the only dialogue was, "Huh, that one character is a little weird and creepy, but the other one's really normal and

686
00:43:51,937 --> 00:43:52,399
Speaker 1: balanced.".

687
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,673
Speaker 1: And it just was dumb.

688
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:57,460
Speaker 0: Alright, well, do you wanna keep going, talking about it?

689
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,820
Speaker 1: I don't know, I said the art is completely... meh, and it is.

690
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,820
Speaker 1: The art doesn't really add or detract at all.

691
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:09,640
Speaker 0: Well, the art is... I think one thing to be said about the art is that it's black and white, which is really cool for, you know, a comic that's being made right now.

692
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,720
Speaker 0: You know, 'cause most comics made right now are not... well, it's not black and white, it's grayscale.

693
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,520
Speaker 1: The one thing I can say that a lot of action scenes, if you actually take the time to look at them, don't flow at all.

694
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,065
Speaker 1: There's no choreography in fight scenes.

695
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:28,820
Speaker 1: It is just... they give the impression that a fight is happening, but they don't actually ever let you see a fight.

696
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:38,918
Speaker 1: And it kinda bothers me, just because I liked where they were going with this kind of a procedural, like, "This is how they're dealing with it, this is the reality of the tactical situation of dealing with

697
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:39,399
Speaker 1: zombies.".

698
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:46,394
Speaker 1: And instead, they never actually show you, like, the zombie defense working, or the mundane encounter.

699
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:47,236
Speaker 1: Like, encounters.

700
00:44:47,697 --> 00:44:49,000
Speaker 1: Actual encounters with zombies.

701
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,639
Speaker 1: It's just all kinda like, "And then they killed all the

702
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:51,820
Speaker 1: zombies.".

703
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,180
Speaker 0: As I think that's what they're doing, is they're trying to concentrate on the human drama.

704
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,280
Speaker 1: But the human drama is poorly written, the characters are very poorly done, and seem to have almost no motiv-.

705
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:04,800
Speaker 1: It's like the characters' motivations change randomly, depending on the scene.

706
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,060
Speaker 1: Burning wheel characters are better, 'cause at least they only have three things going, and they stick to those three things.

707
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:19,340
Speaker 1: It's like the characters are all bipolar, and they're either yelling, screaming crazy about something just weird, or they're just completely calm and normal.

708
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:22,311
Speaker 1: And it doesn't flow well.

709
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:23,838
Speaker 1: It could flow well, but it doesn't.

710
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,660
Speaker 1: Also, this isn't the writer's fault, I don't think, but there are a lot of grammatical mistakes.

711
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,190
Speaker 0: Are there?

712
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,100
Speaker 0: That's the editor's fault.

713
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,499
Speaker 1: He mixed up effect and effect more than once.

714
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,020
Speaker 0: I didn't notice that, really, 'cause I read comics real quick.

715
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,600
Speaker 1: There were, like, one or two misspelled words, but other than that- I'm not complaining about that, don't get me wrong.

716
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, blame the editor for that one.

717
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:53,860
Speaker 0: But, in general, I think that The Walking Dead is- there's actually a thing going around, people think there's too many zombie comics, I don't know what they're talking about.

718
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:01,680
Speaker 1: I think there aren't enough, because almost all- I mean, I'm not saying that The Walking Dead is bad, it's really good, but every other zombie thing is crap.

719
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,742
Speaker 0: I think The Walking Dead- it's not perfect.

720
00:46:04,782 --> 00:46:23,820
Speaker 0: I mean, it does suffer some problems, because it's being written as, you know, a monthly 24-page thing, and I'm reading it in a hardcover, and I think that it's sort of written to be read in sort of little bits at a time, to let you digest those little bits slowly, and, you know, if you buy a little bit, you wanna feel like something happens in that little bit, and that affects the pace when you read a whole bunch at once.

721
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:31,640
Speaker 1: And I realized this, because I read the summaries of the ones I haven't read yet, just to, you know, know where the plot goes, because I wonder, you know, maybe it saves itself.

722
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,719
Speaker 1: And I realized something.

723
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:43,900
Speaker 1: Reading the summary of an issue I'd read was pretty much the same as reading the issue, because all it does is lay out what happens, but it skips the, you know, the human drama.

724
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:59,580
Speaker 1: But the human drama's not very compelling, because it's all kinda either really out there and doesn't really make sense in terms of how humans would act in any situation, or really pedestrian and just has played out and been done a million times before and not interesting.

725
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:05,199
Speaker 0: I think the human drama's a little more interesting than that, but I agree that it's not, you know...

726
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,549
Speaker 1: I can't care about these characters.

727
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:08,773
Speaker 1: I can't get into the characters.

728
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:10,520
Speaker 1: I can't understand their motivations.

729
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,454
Speaker 0: That is one thing, is that I didn't, most of the characters I did not care about.

730
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:16,200
Speaker 0: There were only a very few that I cared about.

731
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:21,020
Speaker 1: Some of the characters I couldn't tell the difference until one died and then there was only one left, and then I realized one was different.

732
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,785
Speaker 0: The ones that I did care about I could tell the difference.

733
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:28,936
Speaker 0: It was mostly, like, I could recognize the characters because the art was okay, but I could, the name matching.

734
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:30,820
Speaker 0: I didn't get quite right, you know, quick enough.

735
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:35,298
Speaker 0: But, overall, the few characters I did care about, a lot of them died.

736
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:45,420
Speaker 1: But what I was getting at is that reading the summary, like a two or three paragraph summary of the plot of one, gave me the same feeling that reading it did.

737
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:53,880
Speaker 1: And that's why I read the summaries of the rest, and I think I'm gonna read the summaries of all the rest of this comic on Wikipedia instead of reading the rest of the comic.

738
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,466
Speaker 1: They will, you know.

739
00:47:56,747 --> 00:48:00,760
Speaker 1: The article on this comic is rather extensive in terms of plot summary.

740
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,319
Speaker 0: Scary.

741
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,480
Speaker 1: It also has a matrix of characters who were still alive and as of when.

742
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:05,061
Speaker 0: Wow.

743
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:05,763
Speaker 0: Crazy.

744
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:11,978
Speaker 0: So, as far as I'm concerned, if you like zombies, if you like comics, this is the comic to buy.

745
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:12,720
Speaker 0: You should be buying this.

746
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,253
Speaker 1: As far as I'm concerned, the first two trades or the first hardcover is great.

747
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:17,935
Speaker 1: Read it.

748
00:48:18,115 --> 00:48:19,439
Speaker 1: There's no reason not to read it.

749
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:27,920
Speaker 1: However, if you really like it, I will warn you that I feel that the comic goes effectively nowhere from that point forward.

750
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:34,620
Speaker 0: I think it goes from what I've read, which is the second hardcover, so trades three and four, that it goes a little bit downhill.

751
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,360
Speaker 0: But I don't think it's like this horrible, terrible piece of crap.

752
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:47,856
Speaker 1: The plot of what happens after what you have read from the summaries I read on Wikipedia is really, really dumb.

753
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:50,400
Speaker 1: Like, not worth reading dumb.

754
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,140
Speaker 0: Well, hardcover number three is coming pretty soon.

755
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:54,339
Speaker 0: That's all you.

756
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:58,099
Speaker 0: And I will read it, and until then, I will withhold an opinion of it.

757
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'd get, like, I'm gonna do the one out of ten whatever.

758
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:06,660
Speaker 1: I would give the first one nine out of ten because it was a breath of fresh air and I fucking loved it.

759
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,600
Speaker 1: Second one five out of ten, and the rest of it from the summaries, like, four out of ten.

760
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,884
Speaker 0: Let's see.

761
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:19,760
Speaker 0: I would give the first one also a nine out of ten, and I would give the second one maybe a seven, six and a half, something like that.

762
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:24,720
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, the second one was just kind of eh, and I think about, like, is there anything I'd rather be doing?

763
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,160
Speaker 0: The thing is actually towards, it's like, it's sort of like the beginning, the second one, the reason it's hard to give, what'd you give it, like a five, a four?

764
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,064
Speaker 1: Well, here's the problem.

765
00:49:32,104 --> 00:49:35,200
Speaker 1: The first, like, quarter, or third of the second one.

766
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,862
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

767
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:37,406
Speaker 0: The second one is like this slope.

768
00:49:37,446 --> 00:49:42,360
Speaker 0: It's like it starts out as nine, and it slopes down to, like, you know, five and a half.

769
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, the second book is just- Overall, I've got to give it something in between.

770
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,650
Speaker 1: It's like I start on this plateau, and I'm just running along this plateau, and it's great.

771
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,380
Speaker 1: I start the second one, and it's just a hill, and going down.

772
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,460
Speaker 1: And at the bottom of the hill, where the third one's gonna start, is a crevice.

773
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,043
Speaker 0: Ah.

774
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,900
Speaker 1: And at the bottom of that crevice is the Marianas Trench.

775
00:49:59,505 --> 00:49:59,759
Speaker 0: Alright.

776
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:17,280
Speaker 1: I really am disappointed, because I really liked it, and the fact that, and, you know, I really wanted to, like, when I got to the parts that I didn't like in the second one, I kept convincing myself that it'll get better again, or it's not so bad, and I was trying to like it, and by the time I got the end, I was like, wow.

777
00:50:17,941 --> 00:50:21,580
Speaker 1: I really didn't enjoy that at all, and I really don't want to read any more of this.

778
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:22,380
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

779
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:28,397
Speaker 0: So, I guess if you are interested in reading comics about zombies, it's me versus Rim.

780
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:29,300
Speaker 0: We slightly disagree.

781
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:37,480
Speaker 0: But regardless, I think everyone should read the first two trades/first hardcover of The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman from Image Comics.

782
00:50:38,126 --> 00:50:39,559
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we didn't, did we say who wrote it?

783
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:40,688
Speaker 0: Robert Kirkman.

784
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:41,500
Speaker 0: I said that before.

785
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,340
Speaker 0: Let's see how much it costs on Amazon, and then we'll be out.

786
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:55,001
Speaker 0: Okay, on Amazon, each individual trade costs about, oh, $10.39.

787
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:55,760
Speaker 1: That's probably worth it.

788
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,520
Speaker 0: And the hardcovers are about $20, so it's like- Might as well buy the hardcovers.

789
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,927
Speaker 0: I mean, look, hardcover, $19.99, trade paperback, $10.39, so you're either gonna pay $20.80 or $19.99 to get a hardcover.

790
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,933
Speaker 0: I mean, you're saving money buying a hardcover.

791
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:13,820
Speaker 0: Can't go wrong.

792
