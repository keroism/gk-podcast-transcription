1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,348
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 2nd.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,232
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,739
Speaker 1: I'm Scott yokai.

4
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:26,973
Speaker 1: It's no good Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,746
Speaker 0: I was so wrecked at work today.

6
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,530
Speaker 0: I almost fell asleep like three times.

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:41,457
Speaker 1: I was pretty wrecked him and I got into work and I went and I did a bunch of stuff and then I basically played Flash games rest of the day and I died.

8
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:47,059
Speaker 0: Well, actually I came into work and I asked one of the developers like hey Can I turn the log level down on this one thing?

9
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:47,862
Speaker 0: and he was like why?

10
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:52,969
Speaker 0: and I was like because it's generating like four Gigabytes of logs a day and I'm sick of dealing with it.

11
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,025
Speaker 0: And they're like, well, is there still a problem with that thing?

12
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,750
Speaker 0: And I'm like, yeah kind.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,819
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, we should leave it on.

14
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,688
Speaker 0: and then I was like, yeah Well, you know what?

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,494
Speaker 0: That's probably for the best cuz I'm sure it'll crash soon enough and crash and then I'll be able to Make use of those logs.

16
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,280
Speaker 0: and he was like don't be snarky.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,390
Speaker 0: and I sit down at my desk and sure enough it was crashed.

18
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I sent him over a cord on fit and some logs.

19
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:21,881
Speaker 1: Cord, I'm fantastic yeah, but There was a little storm here last night, which is fine.

20
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,170
Speaker 1: I like me a storm little thunder lightning action.

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,490
Speaker 0: Oh, that was a great storm - it was okay.

22
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,530
Speaker 1: The thunder and lightning was not numerous or loud enough But the thing is the rain and the wind are pretty fierce.

23
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,659
Speaker 0: The thing is though it was super warm in the morning.

24
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:50,617
Speaker 0: So Emily and I are looking out the window like wow thunderstorm Let's totally run outside and we run outside and it had been 70 degrees when the storm rolled in as It was cold.

25
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:58,205
Speaker 1: as as storms do that makes the power go on and off a little bit, you know Not there's never like gonna be a big blackout, you know, especially at night when everyone's sleeping.

26
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:03,350
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter so much Unless you have electric heat, but you know, it's just okay, whatever.

27
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:07,090
Speaker 1: But we were pissed off a long time ago because that would turn our computers off.

28
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, because our one our house is kind of crappy wiring because we're on the edge of beacon.

29
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:18,450
Speaker 0: So across the street from us a lot of those people start getting their power from other sources Like you can see the different sets of wires.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:28,090
Speaker 1: Yeah Like when there's a blackout or when a power goes out you can look outside and you can see where there's light and where there's Darkness is different sets of power lines and you can tell where the breakage happened.

31
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,921
Speaker 0: But we're kind of on the end of our run.

32
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,070
Speaker 0: So we often have little blips.

33
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,930
Speaker 0: Also, our house is not the most well-wired house.

34
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, our house the power will be like on off on off and that's not good for computers and other electronic women.

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,303
Speaker 1: So we bought the cheapest UPS is imaginable and we brought.

36
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:44,167
Speaker 0: we got several of.

37
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,518
Speaker 1: we have four of them I think and the thing is they're fine.

38
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:51,089
Speaker 1: They help out a lot when the power goes blip all the computers are like what?

39
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:51,550
Speaker 1: what happened?

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,354
Speaker 1: Nothing, that's right.

41
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:53,098
Speaker 1: Yes.

42
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:54,043
Speaker 0: There's one problem.

43
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:59,261
Speaker 0: However with the cheap UPS So I'm asleep and scouts asleep and the power goes out.

44
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:00,284
Speaker 0: whatever.

45
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:04,501
Speaker 0: now, of course even without this I would have been woken up by the thunderous silence.

46
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,104
Speaker 1: Yeah.

47
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, but You know when you're this.

48
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:17,690
Speaker 0: I've talked about this before we all you talk about this a lot But if you're tired and an unexpected noise happens your brain Like your body is flailing around trying to deal with it.

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:24,963
Speaker 0: But your brain's not awake enough yet to analyze the situation and be like that's not your alarm clock rim That's your cell phone.

50
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:25,709
Speaker 0: It's ringing.

51
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:34,529
Speaker 1: You can't stop it by turning off the alarm clock no matter how hard you try And now you're gonna go back to sleep and the cell phone stops ringing But you're not gonna wake up in the morning cuz you turned your cell phone off.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,185
Speaker 0: So it's even worse when it's a really unexpected sound.

53
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:50,350
Speaker 1: so we're asleep and suddenly All the UPS's had run out of battery because they're cheap shit UPS's and they make loud noises.

54
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,202
Speaker 0: Well, they make noises saying hey the power's out.

55
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,923
Speaker 0: Just so you know, hey the power's out Just so you know.

56
00:03:56,451 --> 00:04:00,886
Speaker 0: so and they actually last quite a while because we have one computer plugged into each and then the out.

57
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:10,518
Speaker 1: the last ones just like the night like crawl out of bed and stumble around turning off all these stupid UPS's and plugging things in and switching to my Cellphone alarm and all this bullshit.

58
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,482
Speaker 0: I was laying in bed.

59
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:12,104
Speaker 0: I'm like Emily.

60
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,530
Speaker 0: your cell phone's going off.

61
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:15,958
Speaker 0: Emily your cell phone's got.

62
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,721
Speaker 0: oh god.

63
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:17,283
Speaker 0: Damn it.

64
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,329
Speaker 0: No, I know what's going on.

65
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,870
Speaker 0: It's pretty bad, I really like crawl under my desk.

66
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,930
Speaker 0: I'm like trying to log into my computer to turn it off, but the monitor wasn't on but I was too tired to realize that.

67
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:33,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in the end I just fucking turned off the UPS unplugged everything and then went back to sleep.

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did similar things in my room But then I lay back in bed.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,344
Speaker 1: I'm like it's not cuz I looked at the clock before I turned it off.

70
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:45,127
Speaker 1: cuz you know as the clock is running on the Battery power and it's at 1158 and I'd gone to bed at like 10 something.

71
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:45,790
Speaker 1: It was like fuck.

72
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:50,110
Speaker 1: I felt like I was asleep for hours, but really I was not asleep very long at all.

73
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,221
Speaker 0: The worst thing is I get back in bed and then I hear faintly.

74
00:04:53,242 --> 00:05:06,481
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah UPS on the networking equipment Yeah, and then when I woke up this morning gonna turn that back on because I couldn't get on the Internet's Yeah, well the thing is it whenever that UPS is going off.

75
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:09,288
Speaker 0: It's pretty much equidistant from me and Scott.

76
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:14,250
Speaker 0: So Well, I'll kind of lay in bed and thinking I hope Scott deals with it and he'll lay in a bed thing.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,450
Speaker 0: I hope rim deals with it and then eventually one of us will stagger out there and like kick it to death.

78
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,556
Speaker 1: It did generally sucked.

79
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,564
Speaker 1: Hey, I use my cell phone alarm to wake up.

80
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:26,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, my cell phone Strangely enough is having some problems.

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,182
Speaker 0: Suddenly.

82
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:36,770
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna buy a new one already The the backlight just didn't turn off today really and it's still on and try messing with the power savings.

83
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:47,163
Speaker 0: I think The little thing that tells when you close the lid Is broken or something and it just it's.

84
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,407
Speaker 0: I think I gotta get a new cell phone.

85
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:52,202
Speaker 0: Just take it to the place Yeah, and they're gonna tell me get a new cell phone.

86
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:52,584
Speaker 0: Yeah.

87
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:56,966
Speaker 1: All right, whatever Alright, so ready for news isn't what nuts?

88
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:57,268
Speaker 0: I think.

89
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:01,102
Speaker 1: so You can do you want to go first and I'll go first cuz I got news.

90
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,970
Speaker 0: I'm like some other lazy people.

91
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,895
Speaker 1: Hey, I'm not lazy.

92
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:07,397
Speaker 1: I'm Proactive.

93
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,470
Speaker 1: try to help the listeners.

94
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:16,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know The only time I ever use the word Proactive is like it might work and there's something that needs to be done and there's something fun to do.

95
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:22,009
Speaker 0: Usually fun to do is like set up something new and awesome and not fun to do is like do the work.

96
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,365
Speaker 0: So it's like why aren't you working on the thing you're supposed to be working on?

97
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:32,509
Speaker 0: I'm being proactive Mmm, anyway, so there's a lot of Otakon news.

98
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:34,920
Speaker 0: I think the most important one.

99
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,035
Speaker 0: if you didn't realize it yet The artists alley is done.

100
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,658
Speaker 0: It's sold out.

101
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:38,979
Speaker 0: You're.

102
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,544
Speaker 0: if you don't if you didn't know you're screwed.

103
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:45,196
Speaker 0: Not necessarily, but Otakon historically has a problem.

104
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:52,350
Speaker 0: where the artist alley is so popular despite being so gigantic It's that artist alley is bigger than most anime cons.

105
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:57,854
Speaker 1: It's bad that pretty much the amount of room that the artists alley and the art show take up That room.

106
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,750
Speaker 1: you could have an entire comic convention in that room room to spare.

107
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,464
Speaker 0: Not only that it's more fun than a lot of anime cons.

108
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:10,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would go to Otakon I think just for the artist alley but yet it's just one room of Otakon Otakon.

109
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:21,148
Speaker 0: but Historically when they announced the artist alley, it'll pretty much effectively be sold out within I don't know four seconds Maybe six seconds if you're lucky.

110
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,147
Speaker 0: But this year they did something a little different.

111
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:55,730
Speaker 0: now We got kind of a head start on this because our obsessive-compulsive friends Discovered the ASP that handles registration before it was announced and basically sat there all day hitting f5 until it worked and then told all of us some of them might have been pressing ctrl R. they might have been but Artist alley is open and this year It doesn't look like they're handling it the way they usually do because they didn't say Oh, it's already sold out and they haven't made any announcements to that effect.

112
00:07:56,071 --> 00:08:02,843
Speaker 0: But the form just works and you fill it out all the artist alley stuff and then You get an email back saying we got your request.

113
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,610
Speaker 0: You will get some information soon.

114
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,144
Speaker 0: Now, I don't know how they're gonna handle it this year.

115
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:16,970
Speaker 0: I have no idea I have absolutely no insight into this and furthermore No one on the Otakon staff has given me any secret details about this in particular.

116
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:22,518
Speaker 0: So what you're about to hear is entirely speculation speculation.

117
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:22,578
Speaker 1: if

118
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:53,957
Speaker 0: I Were running the artist alley at Otakon and I would still say, you know, yeah, it's first come first serve Let it be however But secretly I would have in the previous Otakon gone around the artist alley or sent my lackeys around the artist alley Figured out who was good and made a list of like the people who are awesome and I also would have made a separate list of the people who were wasting their tables or In my opinion or in the opinion of say some sort of group of staffers working together What was not worth being there?

119
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:56,105
Speaker 1: because yeah, we weren't worth being there though.

120
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,209
Speaker 0: No, we totally weren't.

121
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:01,156
Speaker 0: Well this year will be worth being there But last year not so much.

122
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,529
Speaker 0: but part of that was that we didn't know we had a table until right before the con.

123
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:15,530
Speaker 0: but what I would do is I would kind of handpick who gets to be in because a Lot of people want to be in the artist alley at Otakon and Otakon has the best artist alley of any con.

124
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:24,349
Speaker 0: But three or four times the number of people who can fit in that artist alley Want to be in that artist alley every year and there's almost no fair way to do it.

125
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:33,540
Speaker 0: And when there's no fair way to do it You at least could do a way that I don't know makes the alley as good as possible for the people in it and for The people wanting to peruse it.

126
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,730
Speaker 0: So I think I would have done something like that.

127
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,151
Speaker 0: I don't know what Otakon is doing, but it was the smoothest registration they've ever had so kudos to them All right.

128
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing to say is that I got no god.

129
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:54,080
Speaker 0: No, so beyond that you got more than that Otakon as there there have been a lot of hints that this is gonna be the biggest and baddest Otakon ever.

130
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,710
Speaker 0: I mean, it's their 10th year at the BCC.

131
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,468
Speaker 0: It's also the 15th Otakon and There were a lot of rumors going around about.

132
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:03,457
Speaker 0: you know, they're gonna get some crazy musical act.

133
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,626
Speaker 0: Oh my god They're gonna get some crazy musical act some up.

134
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:15,760
Speaker 0: some staffers might have been banning these flames by periodically emailing us saying hey Something cool is gonna be at Otakon, but I can't tell you what.

135
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:27,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah not fooling anybody but it's finally been announced or at least part of it Otakon is going to have as their musical act one of their at least one of their musical act.

136
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,007
Speaker 1: now I don't know if there are any more musical acts I would suggest that there might be.

137
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:33,271
Speaker 1: there probably will be.

138
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 0: I would be fine if this was the only musical act.

139
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,543
Speaker 0: They have announced that they have got jam Project.

140
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:43,200
Speaker 0: jam project is responsible for a lot of the music from anime that you know and love.

141
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:51,940
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do a whole show or a whole thing here about jam project But check out the Otakon press release and you'll see the names of a lot of things you might recognize.

142
00:10:52,161 --> 00:11:04,790
Speaker 1: I think jam project was a great choice because you know in the past they've had like, you know huge You know much more much more popular bands at least, you know, it's sort of like hit, you know pop You know rock j-rock music like what

143
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,819
Speaker 0: they got laraku which was like amazing.

144
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:17,122
Speaker 1: Yeah But Basically, those are bands that were just musical acts that happen to have one of their songs be used as an opener closer to an Anime or something.

145
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:19,950
Speaker 0: Well, and they also happen to be really popular in Japan.

146
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:28,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this case it's actually people who specifically make Anime music very specifically and like all their music is anime music.

147
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:34,180
Speaker 1: So it definitely has the wide appeal to both the music fans and the anime fans both.

148
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:42,060
Speaker 1: So you're not gonna get those people complaining like Those j-rockers come to my anime convention and right at those people can shove it.

149
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,780
Speaker 1: They those people can indeed shove it, but I think this is a much better choice overall.

150
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,069
Speaker 0: See, I don't know necessary.

151
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,540
Speaker 0: I think it's a good choice.

152
00:11:51,741 --> 00:12:04,866
Speaker 0: I wouldn't necessarily say better but one thing that this group has over other possible musical acts is that everyone in the audience is gonna recognize a lot of the things they play and You know how anime cons.

153
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:11,738
Speaker 0: all you have to do if you're on stage is pretty much say something like hey guys Pikachu and the crowd just loses their shit.

154
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:18,222
Speaker 0: Well, if it's if it's these people playing songs that people recognize the crowd is gonna go crazy Like.

155
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,230
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine what the crowd is gonna be like.

156
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,893
Speaker 1: there will be.

157
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:26,929
Speaker 0: all shit will be lost is basically Now, I mean some of the people involved in this.

158
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,300
Speaker 0: the name that you'll probably know more than any is Masami okui.

159
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:34,881
Speaker 0: Look up what Masami okui has been responsible for Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,012
Speaker 0: Now that is not all of the awesome news for Otakon.

161
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,440
Speaker 1: for how much awesome Otakon news do you have?

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,167
Speaker 1: I'm sure you're not until August.

163
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,860
Speaker 1: Can't you save some of this news for when you don't have news next week?

164
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,120
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be a steady stream of Otakon news right up until Otakon.

165
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,586
Speaker 0: Oh good god, because I too

166
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,611
Speaker 1: many people we got like four

167
00:12:53,712 --> 00:13:05,618
Speaker 0: months too many people on the inside have been hinting that Yeah, this is gonna be like the baddest Otakon ever and I Kind of expected alright, they're gonna get a crazy musical act or two and then they announce that it's like.

168
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,486
Speaker 0: alright They've got a crazy musical act.

169
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:11,000
Speaker 0: Okay, but I did not expect that Madhouse.

170
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:20,536
Speaker 0: Madhouse Studios, you know Madhouse It's going one of the best animation studios in the planet is going to be animating the opener as in like.

171
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,858
Speaker 0: if Otakon were an anime They're animating the opener to Otakon.

172
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:34,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah see that's a genius idea because any anime convention even super big ones like Otakon not enough people go to opening ceremonies.

173
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:40,557
Speaker 1: most of the people who go are like nubs or People who really have a thing for opening ceremonies or such.

174
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,031
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean even we don't go to opening ceremonies.

175
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,742
Speaker 0: really the only kind I ever went to opening ceremonies That was.

176
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:56,120
Speaker 0: I went to anime central's twice, but that was because back then I went to opening ceremonies at penguin Otakon once and we tried to get the crowd to yell something and it failed.

177
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,279
Speaker 1: We tried to start a big chant and it didn't work because people weren't into it.

178
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,220
Speaker 1: now I was like, what's the point of coming opening ceremonies if everyone isn't gonna get all excited and rowdy?

179
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:06,820
Speaker 0: I think Otakon's opening ceremonies are gonna be all exciting and rowdy.

180
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,893
Speaker 1: This is the most genius idea ever to get people to come to opening ceremonies.

181
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:13,180
Speaker 1: show them an animation that can't be seen anywhere else.

182
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,000
Speaker 1: That was especially made just for those opening ceremonies.

183
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:17,204
Speaker 0: Yep, now they might.

184
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:27,820
Speaker 1: that's like if you had a video game convention and you made a video game that would only be played at Your convention made like by Square Enix to only be played at your convention at one event.

185
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,737
Speaker 1: He would be lined up around the doors.

186
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:38,998
Speaker 1: now I think that what says the most as in they'd be standing outside the door of their homes and the line to the convention would be forming for the.

187
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,600
Speaker 0: Here's a quote from the thing on anime news network because this is this is Otakon's Jim Vowels.

188
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:54,399
Speaker 0: You might remember Jim Vowels from such things as being at every Otakon ever and being awesome and liking Doctor Who More than any man should or than any man could know.

189
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:58,718
Speaker 0: No, but he's one of those like we talked about in the forum the.

190
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:02,412
Speaker 0: you know There's staffers at cons and then there's super staffers.

191
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:08,840
Speaker 0: He's one of those super staffers, but Quotes this was the most fun I've ever had.

192
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:16,592
Speaker 0: Now that quote is in reference to the meeting where they talked about what was gonna be in this opener And how it was gonna be put together.

193
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:20,247
Speaker 0: Oh good guy That was somewhat a selective quote.

194
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,231
Speaker 0: It's actually the most fun.

195
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:25,690
Speaker 0: I've ever had at an Otakon meeting No, all right, but I don't know the most fun.

196
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,332
Speaker 0: I've ever had.

197
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,140
Speaker 0: seems like a more news bite worthy.

198
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:32,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can imagine to be quite fun But yeah Otakon this year is gonna be.

199
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,320
Speaker 0: I can't even begin to think about awesome Otakon's watch.

200
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,820
Speaker 1: It's gonna be epic fail like anime Boston.

201
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:38,886
Speaker 1: It could happen.

202
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,536
Speaker 1: actually it could happen not likely but it could happen.

203
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:45,732
Speaker 0: speaking of that I want to touch on this very very briefly before Scott gets in.

204
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,237
Speaker 0: after we talked about the news anime Boston We got a few emails.

205
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:51,717
Speaker 0: What two of them were from?

206
00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:04,922
Speaker 0: Otak anime Boston staffers who wish not to be named and we also got a lot of feedback from people are at the con and Like we kind of guessed it people said that other than registration the rest of anime Boston was in fact awesome As I

207
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:06,813
Speaker 1: as I suggested

208
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:18,929
Speaker 0: and furthermore it seems like they are fully aware internally as to exactly what the problem was and It'll be fixed next year or more bad things will happen.

209
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,880
Speaker 1: I am sure that an appropriate number of heads are rolling now.

210
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,819
Speaker 0: I can't really say more yet because it's way too soon, but there's too soon too soon.

211
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:31,980
Speaker 0: There's a good chance that we are going to be attending anime boss.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,069
Speaker 1: Well a better chance than ever before.

213
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,073
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say good shit,

214
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,679
Speaker 0: I've already tentatively agreed

215
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:46,495
Speaker 1: All right, so I couldn't find a worthwhile news and I'm tired of anime news network and whatnot, right So I'm not doing a news but anime

216
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:47,080
Speaker 0: news Nina

217
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:54,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever and I've been doing a lot of geek bites on Wednesdays of you know, like comics I've read or whatnot.

218
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:00,400
Speaker 1: All right, but I actually am reading novel right now So I can't be reading any comics to do a geek bite of.

219
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:08,275
Speaker 1: So I try to think of something to fill this space with and I got an idea For a bit and I want to see if anyone out likes this bit.

220
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:15,020
Speaker 1: and if you like this bit I can make it a monthly bit and so it's sort of impossible for me to make this bit more or less than monthly.

221
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,029
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna call this bit?

222
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,359
Speaker 0: I mean, I have no idea that trouble naming bits.

223
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Speaker 0: So we started out where like we called everything a geek.

224
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,931
Speaker 1: So why don't we tell what the bit is before we think?

225
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:24,573
Speaker 1: think of the name?

226
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:31,840
Speaker 0: Well first, you know our kind of Ad-hoc naming philosophy was that we kind of everything is geek something in camel case.

227
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:35,555
Speaker 0: But then we started falling away from that because nine times out of ten.

228
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,760
Speaker 0: That sounds really dumb.

229
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, but all right what you bit?

230
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:44,084
Speaker 1: All right, so you know, you listeners might know that I do not.

231
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:56,096
Speaker 1: I purchase comic books monthly mostly not actual comp books But you know big trade paperbacks and whatnot from a website or a service known as DCB service.com discount comic book service.

232
00:17:56,136 --> 00:18:11,420
Speaker 1: calm and Basically what they allow me to do is I can order pretty much anything that diamond the evil comic distributors Of the direct market distribute two months in advance and then I get a tremendous discount.

233
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,829
Speaker 1: We're talking like 40% off.

234
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,118
Speaker 1: We're talking like four dollar comic books for 75 cents.

235
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,467
Speaker 1: It's way cheap, but I have to.

236
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,940
Speaker 1: the only disadvantage is that to buy things sight unseen?

237
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,786
Speaker 0: There's there's another disadvantage.

238
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,880
Speaker 0: I buy things through Scott because he'll say hey, do you want this?

239
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,084
Speaker 0: Hey, do you want this?

240
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:32,160
Speaker 0: and a lot of times I'll say yes without listening because it's so cheap.

241
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,742
Speaker 0: I don't care.

242
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:36,233
Speaker 0: and then Scott gives me a pile of comic books that I remember.

243
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,219
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, I don't want this damn it.

244
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, what am I gonna do with a serenity comic?

245
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:40,990
Speaker 0: It's awful.

246
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, was it awful.

247
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:42,858
Speaker 1: Did you read it?

248
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,446
Speaker 0: It was Expectedly bad.

249
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,119
Speaker 0: It wasn't awful, but it wasn't good.

250
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:48,964
Speaker 1: So there are.

251
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,554
Speaker 1: there are other websites that provide a similar service.

252
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,980
Speaker 1: heroes corner is one of them.

253
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,753
Speaker 1: I don't you know, I don't advocate any particular one.

254
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,878
Speaker 1: I just happen to use this one.

255
00:18:56,898 --> 00:19:11,180
Speaker 1: and so basically what happens here is I get every month in the mail a giant box of comic books and I recommend Using a service like this to anyone who buys a significant amount of comics on a monthly basis.

256
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,493
Speaker 1: Who doesn't have a lot of money to spend and really really need that big discount?

257
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:27,758
Speaker 1: or if you don't live anywhere near a Comic book store conveniently, you know because then this way you don't it just shows up at your house You don't have to go driving to some comic book store an hour away or any bullshit like that, right?

258
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,400
Speaker 1: But I get this box of comics every month like at the beginning of the month.

259
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,793
Speaker 1: It's like clockwork and sometimes the little box sometimes a big box, you know, who knows.

260
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:47,080
Speaker 1: but I thought it might be an interesting bit To just sort of briefly go over Everything I got in the box this month and maybe you would call the bit like Scott's box.

261
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:47,666
Speaker 1: I don't know.

262
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:51,942
Speaker 1: That's not the best name I think.

263
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:53,286
Speaker 0: I think you've named it.

264
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,790
Speaker 0: There's no going back from that.

265
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,773
Speaker 1: Oh this going back.

266
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,940
Speaker 0: There's there is no turning back.

267
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's that.

268
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:00,728
Speaker 0: you've already opened the coffin.

269
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,674
Speaker 0: It's open the vampires out.

270
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:04,740
Speaker 0: You can't put him back in the other coffin as a mummy.

271
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,595
Speaker 1: I'll just open that and they'll fight and then I can go back to choosing.

272
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:08,500
Speaker 1: maybe a slime will come.

273
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:11,972
Speaker 0: Everyone knows that vampires and mummies are natural allies.

274
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:13,657
Speaker 0: You need a werewolf to fight them.

275
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:16,579
Speaker 0: or good That's or a van peel.

276
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,182
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna briefly go over every comic or you know book that was in the box this month and you know If this.

277
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:34,271
Speaker 1: I think this will help people sort of get an idea about what kind of comics I'm buying What sort of comics they might be interested in buying?

278
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:34,653

00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:41,420
Speaker 1: I was terrible.

284
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,383
Speaker 0: What the fuck was that?

285
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,326
Speaker 0: That was awful.

286
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,891
Speaker 0: Why was Aquaman even there?

287
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,235
Speaker 0: He didn't even do anything.

288
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,960
Speaker 0: Neither did the flash seriously.

289
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,014
Speaker 0: Wow, okay, I'm done.

290
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:54,342
Speaker 1: All right Okay, so I'm gonna do this and then you're gonna go in the form and tell me if you think you want me to do This again.

291
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,389
Speaker 1: All right.

292
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,240
Speaker 1: So the first thing I'm just doing this in the order.

293
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,616
Speaker 1: It's listed on the website because on the website you can see what showed up in the box.

294
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:01,198
Speaker 1: It's pretty useful.

295
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,400
Speaker 0: Yes, yes in case you don't want to actually look in the box you can go.

296
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,480
Speaker 1: Well, it's easier for me to look at this webpage than to have a pile of comics in your room on the floor.

297
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,242
Speaker 0: That's true.

298
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:12,563
Speaker 0: Okay.

299
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:18,001
Speaker 1: So the first thing that was in the box back Mongolian chop squad manga volume 11.

300
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,626
Speaker 1: There are 19 volumes in total.

301
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,152
Speaker 1: This is you know back.

302
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,280
Speaker 1: It's the rock and roll kind of manga.

303
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:26,758
Speaker 0: I gotta actually watch that anime so we can talk about the anime I liked a lot.

304
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,594
Speaker 1: But the thing is with the anime is at the end of the anime.

305
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:37,860
Speaker 1: the anime sort of ends Not at the climax of the story and then they sort of tell the rest of the story During the closing credits of the last episode.

306
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,140
Speaker 1: So I wanted to get the manga to see first of all if there was any difference between that and the tv show.

307
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:52,740
Speaker 1: And also it is, you know sort of get the full fleshed out story that was in that epilogue and right now around volume 11 It's reaching the point where that of that climax.

308
00:21:53,222 --> 00:22:01,980
Speaker 1: So now I think i'm gonna i'm finally gonna get to read new stuff as opposed to just sort of reading a Manga retelling of the anime even though the anime was retelling of the manga.

309
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:08,845
Speaker 1: next Uh andromeda stories volume three, I think this I think this is the last volume.

310
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,894
Speaker 1: I'm not sure of that but andromeda stories is by keiko.

Speaker 1: Remember that contest we're having where vertical sent us the three volumes.

428
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,687
Speaker 1: I've talked about this before.

429
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,040
Speaker 1: well, you know, they gave us the three volumes.

430
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:56,260
Speaker 1: But now the third volume that I paid for showed up Full metal alchemist manga volume 16, you know the full metal alchemist manga.

431
00:28:56,562 --> 00:29:00,020
Speaker 1: I got it at the beginning because it was the full metal alchemist manga and that was so long ago.

432
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:04,683
Speaker 1: Right, like if the full metal alchemist manga volume one came out now I probably wouldn't buy it.

433
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:09,160
Speaker 1: and I started reading it and it was good and it diverged wildly from the show.

434
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:10,914
Speaker 1: But it wasn't bad.

435
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:12,142
Speaker 1: It wasn't great But it was.

436
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:15,599
Speaker 1: it was just kind of normal and at times I thought about stopping buying it.

437
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:24,355
Speaker 1: But the last volume that I read I think volume 15 Like came on full force and totally reminded me why i'm buying this.

438
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,138
Speaker 1: so volume 16.

439
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,640
Speaker 1: Here we go Phoenix volume 12.

440
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,473
Speaker 1: There are only 11 volumes of osama tezuka's phoenix.

441
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,281
Speaker 1: this volume 12.

442
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:41,650
Speaker 1: What viz has done is they have taken some earlier works of tezuka and some other things and sort of created a 12th volume of phoenix.

443
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:46,960
Speaker 1: Uh to sort of you know round out their publication, you know their series.

444
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,473
Speaker 1: So if you if you're buying the other 11 phoenixes, you gotta buy the 12th phoenix.

445
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:57,860
Speaker 1: and the last thing I bought was Transhuman number one, which is the guy who does nightly news brian hickman.

446
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:05,126
Speaker 1: Basically, if you haven't done any redney brian hickman's stuff, I think it's hey brian hickman It might be someone else hickman.

447
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:05,789
Speaker 1: I thought great.

448
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,352
Speaker 1: I forget.

449
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:09,827
Speaker 1: Sorry, but he's basically His comics.

450
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:21,671
Speaker 1: Yeah, his comics are amazing because they're basically like graphic storytelling via graphic design and they'll just blow you away if you Everyone should go buy nightly news.

451
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,580
Speaker 1: There's a trade paperback of nightly news.

452
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:29,379
Speaker 1: This is just the first issue of transhuman so I can sort of test it out to see if I want to buy the trade When it eventually comes out.

453
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,899
Speaker 1: And that's what I got in scott's box.

454
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,974
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

455
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:44,067
Speaker 0: so utenna is like one of the greatest anime ever made.

456
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,190
Speaker 0: we reviewed pretty great.

457
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,547
Speaker 0: We reviewed it before pretty terrific.

458
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:54,850
Speaker 0: someday We'll do some final thoughts bits, but that's complicated because utenna is one of the more complicated and literate shows out there.

459
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:04,737
Speaker 0: but uh if you need any more glowing recommendation as gomi dog in the forums because she finally saw the whole show and She will tell you Objectively how good it is.

460
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,042
Speaker 0: I might be a little biased.

461
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:15,606
Speaker 0: I'm kind of an utenna fanboy but uh kind of It's like the best show ever made with the exception of irresponsible captain tyler both of which made me cry.

462
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:22,369
Speaker 0: Anyway, so teen girl squad plus utenna equals uh Hilarity.

463
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,229
Speaker 0: I'm gonna leave it at that.

464
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:32,249
Speaker 0: The only other thing i'll say is that if you have not seen all of utana or at least if you've not seen any of utana This is still kind of funny.

465
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:36,950
Speaker 0: The more utana you've seen the funnier this is and the less spoilerific.

466
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,570
Speaker 0: It's not spoilerific.

467
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:47,802
Speaker 0: it's one of those like ava where like you see things in the opener or you see things and They might be a spoiler, but you have no context.

468
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,006
Speaker 0: So they're not a spoiler.

469
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:54,881
Speaker 0: That's sort of true Like if you see A scene of a giant white ray making people turn to goop.

470
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:59,076
Speaker 0: that doesn't really spoil ava because you have no idea What the hell that's all about.

471
00:31:59,137 --> 00:31:59,740
Speaker 1: That's true.

472
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,182
Speaker 1: It's true.

473
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:13,817
Speaker 1: But yeah, uh If you are crazy with the spoilers you do want to avoid it though Yes and also if you really need to understand both teen girl squad and utenna to really Get the fullness of this mashup.

474
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:17,468
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're not getting really out of it what you could get out of it.

475
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,479
Speaker 0: I think there are Three possible.

476
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:27,710
Speaker 0: I think there are three levels of Having seen utana in terms of getting all the jokes here And if you hit the third level you pretty much saw the rest of the show.

477
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,328
Speaker 1: It's a very deep uh mashup and that's why it's high quality and thing of the day.

478
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:32,613
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

479
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:33,096

Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah her lucy's the girl.

507
00:33:54,948 --> 00:34:05,206
Speaker 0: Sorry Anyway, we're gonna talk about the show look at it tonight that we haven't seen in a long time but that's fine because In all and in fact, I actually only saw like the first seven episodes.

508
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:06,150
Speaker 0: I never watched the rest.

509
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,949
Speaker 1: That's fine because the show is really shallow and you don't need to really watch it recently to have a bunch to say about it.

510
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,690
Speaker 1: Plus a lot of the things you have to say about the show are meta.

511
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:28,790
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk a lot about the history of anime fandom in the us because gatekeepers was a forgettable Mediocre like, you know highly well produced but just other otherwise forgettable show.

512
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:34,310
Speaker 1: Gatekeepers was a show that was on tv when japanese school kids got home from school.

513
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:45,380
Speaker 1: you know is that kind of show like, you know, come home from school and Watch high school kids fight big alien robots pow Zap that that sort of show.

514
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:51,040
Speaker 1: and you know, we we watched it At the rit anime club in our freshman year.

515
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:56,601
Speaker 1: So in the year 2000 when it came out And you know, it was it was very shallow.

516
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,885
Speaker 1: It wasn't a deep show.

517
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:02,953
Speaker 1: It wasn't a high quality show but At the time You know gonzo It was.

518
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:25,549
Speaker 1: it was better animation than being seen in many other things at least in terms of the digital Technologies used by gonzo who had you know been making like video game, uh, you know cut scenes until then and It was one of the first digital fan subs and it was also a show that just the way it's structured If you have a room full of excited anime fans, they can yell and cheer and go.

519
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:31,068
Speaker 0: It's one of those shows that sets you up with things that are designed to make someone yell, yep

520
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:42,262
Speaker 1: Basically, here's how the show goes right high school kids Alien invaders the alien invaders are all cool and stylish like they all have black hats But one of them always has a red hat and he's the weak point.

521
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:47,510
Speaker 1: then they all form together Right into like a giant blob or something, right?

522
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,527
Speaker 1: And the cool part of each episode is seeing what the bad guys form into like in one.

523
00:35:52,668 --> 00:36:00,770
Speaker 1: in one episode They form into like a piece of a super highway so it's like these two pieces of street are stomping around the town.

524
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:05,130
Speaker 1: Uh in another and I think the first episode they're just like a giant black ball.

525
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:12,269
Speaker 1: You know, they have all these different, you know formations and it's it's always sort of funny to see How the bad guys decide to attack this time.

526
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:16,467
Speaker 1: uh And the rest of it is just these high school kids.

527
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:23,976
Speaker 1: or you know They join or forced to join the secret organization aegis And jokai and jesu.

528
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:33,710
Speaker 1: and then there's these really cool kind of stylish scenes where they're like sent out into action and it sort of got like a Like a bit of a 50s styling to like drive an old motorcycle to the scene.

529
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:38,830
Speaker 0: The show was fly a retro rocket to the scene in like the late 60s in japan.

530
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's one thing you might not realize watching the show.

531
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,039
Speaker 1: I mean you have to kind of pay attention to that.

532
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,510
Speaker 1: it's set in an older time period.

533
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,759
Speaker 0: Not but it is the deal.

534
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 0: we'll talk about gatekeepers itself first because I would have had a lot more to say about this show if we were doing geek nights.

535
00:36:56,127 --> 00:37:09,830
Speaker 0: I don't know like April something in the year 2000 when I saw it because the show was Really crazily popular in america and it was like a big deal and everyone watched it Everyone knew about it and it was oh my god.

536
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:14,546
Speaker 0: If the same show or a similar show would come out today, it would have been completely ignored.

537
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:17,074
Speaker 0: Yep, and There's there's.

538
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,040
Speaker 0: the show is not deep at all.

539
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:24,940
Speaker 1: It is pretty much just fight the bad guys An incredibly shallow high school character development.

540
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,602
Speaker 0: I mean it there's.

541
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:27,369
Speaker 0: it follows shun the main character.

542
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:27,489
Speaker 0: who?

543
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,510
Speaker 0: Happens to have the most badass gate in the world gate by the way is just the powers they have.

544
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:41,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know one girl is like gate open and she shoots an arrow with a magic gate and another girl like goes gate open and she Plays the piano and it makes things happen.

545
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:48,447
Speaker 1: I think her superpower was that she was incredibly stupid Yep, and the main guy of course goes gates open and he has a sword.

546
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,172
Speaker 1: Duh Sword.

547
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:55,690
Speaker 0: i'm not even gonna bother talking about the plot really because it's the show was just eye candy.

548
00:37:56,113 --> 00:38:04,370
Speaker 0: And the things to remember about the show are one The way gatekeepers and like military people within this organization saluted each other.

549
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:11,477
Speaker 0: You could not walk around rit without someone doing that to you Every day for like a month after.

550
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:17,158
Speaker 1: it wasn't that bad but at anime club people would be going like I go ages All the time.

551
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,310
Speaker 0: it was and they make.

552
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:23,765
Speaker 1: I had a gatekeepers, uh, uh id card in my wallet that we got for free.

553
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:25,550
Speaker 0: somehow a lot of us had them.

554
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:26,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

555
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:34,373
Speaker 0: Yeah this show was really popular at rit and the showing of it in the anime club was crazy yelling and screaming because What's his name?

556
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,925
Speaker 0: the guy who's like the head officer of the commander of aegis.

557
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:46,100
Speaker 1: every time he would send him out on mission He would do this phoenix right style pointing kind of thing like go You know what like aegis attack or something.

558
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,910
Speaker 1: I forget exactly what he said to call it phoenix right style.

559
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:52,889
Speaker 0: Does it a disservice if you think phoenix right has a powerful point?

560
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,676
Speaker 0: Phoenix right has got nothing.

561
00:38:55,836 --> 00:39:09,909
Speaker 0: phoenix right is like a beginning pupil of the gatekeepers commander Like whenever he was about to do it you could tell that like the people animating it and everything were excited Because it would like zoom in and his hand would come up his whole body would rotate.

562
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,640
Speaker 1: His hand would like come out from behind his head.

563
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,410
Speaker 0: It would fly around in a circle with motion blur.

564
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,724
Speaker 0: It would come forward with action lines so hard.

565
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,970
Speaker 0: The screen would shake.

566
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:28,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was that alone made the show worth watching pretty much and also like, you know The bus that turns into like a heavily armored vehicle.

567
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:35,315
Speaker 0: I think the best thing was that the secret base of aegis was just in the high school and It was secret.

568
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,942
Speaker 0: I don't think you can see me making quotation marks.

569
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,947
Speaker 1: It was a clark kent kind of secret.

570
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:48,750
Speaker 0: Not even that Everyone and I mean pretty much everyone on the planet except the bad guys knew that that was the aegis headquarters.

571
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:53,718
Speaker 0: They'd be like, oh the high school Yeah, you'd be sitting in high school in class.

572
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,468
Speaker 1: suddenly one year's one kid that always leaves.

573
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:57,010
Speaker 1: all the time.

574
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:07,273
Speaker 0: Lee walks out of the room like the fire alarm goes off and then and then a rocket flies out of the roof like basically like a smoke would appear if we're like, oh there's a Fire.

575
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:12,150
Speaker 0: and then like the bus full of guns flow not guns, but gatekeeper craft flies away.

576
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:17,822
Speaker 1: Basically, it's just a silly after school show with animation.

577
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,747
Speaker 1: That was impressive digital animation.

578
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:20,990
Speaker 1: That was impressive at the time.

579
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:22,595
Speaker 1: It's really shallow.

580
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:23,518
Speaker 1: It's good.

581
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:28,774
Speaker 1: If you want to have a fun time with a bunch of you know, anime club type people But it's really.

582
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:33,768
Speaker 1: it's not worth watching all the episodes unless you really don't have a lot better to do.

583
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:36,315
Speaker 1: I mean, it's okay But it's not great or anything.

584
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:39,985
Speaker 1: It's it's a. it's a solid low b high c kind of show.

585
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,930
Speaker 1: It's just fun and shallow.

586
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:42,974
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean the other.

587
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:47,670
Speaker 0: oh, the only other thing I want to bring up before we stop talking about the anime itself was boncho.

588
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:50,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine he was the comic relief kind of character.

589
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:57,922
Speaker 0: this is a show where everyone has a gate like a power They're all little superheroes, but boncho was not a superhero.

590
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,890
Speaker 0: He was just some guy who was really intense.

591
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was his superpower.

592
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,543
Speaker 1: He's basically like let me join the team.

593
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,349
Speaker 1: I'm on the team whether you like it or not.

594
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:07,513
Speaker 1: He's like.

595
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:08,616
Speaker 1: he's like yes.

596
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,439
Speaker 1: I have a power.

597
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:10,482
Speaker 1: You just haven't seen it yet.

598
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:10,964
Speaker 1: Blah.

599
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:12,970
Speaker 0: Yeah guts and that's all he had.

600
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, his power was guts and he would just.

601
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,330
Speaker 1: he was just a tall bigger than the average high school student.

602
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,126
Speaker 1: It was really comic relief.

603
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,810
Speaker 0: So Why the hell are we talking about this show then?

604
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,683
Speaker 0: I mean there are better shows coming out now that we're not watching or reviewing.

605
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:26,606
Speaker 0: so why this?

606
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:31,059
Speaker 1: well because back in the day As I said before it was one of the first digital fan subs.

607
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,190
Speaker 1: and even if it wasn't the first digital fan sub, right?

608
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,722
Speaker 1: this show Basically, there was a website anime dash factory.

609
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:42,789
Speaker 1: I wonder if that website is still there.

610
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:56,249
Speaker 0: Well while you look it up, I mean the first digital fan sub that really got widely Circulated as far as I was aware was the escaflowne movie and people made a big deal about that and like, oh my god It's a fan sub.

611
00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:02,350
Speaker 1: Yeah Because until then all fan subs were sort of vhs and a lot of people didn't even know what a fan sub.

612
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,309
Speaker 1: I didn't know what a fan sub was till I got to rit.

613
00:42:04,932 --> 00:42:25,588
Speaker 1: so the idea of a digital fan sub really hadn't gotten around yet and It wasn't the first one because we did have the escaflowne one before we had the gatekeepers one, but The gatekeepers one was on a website that basically said come here and download gatekeepers episode one with subtitles And watch it on your computer and we'll have episode two soon.

614
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:27,197
Speaker 1: and then they started doing.

615
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:32,321
Speaker 1: boys b was the next show they tried to do and this sort of people saw that and it was sort of.

616
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:37,502
Speaker 1: they realized it clicked like Oh A digital fan sub.

617
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:48,062
Speaker 1: I get it Oh shit, and just because it happened to be the show that sort of started that Realization process it gained a lot of popularity.

618
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,089
Speaker 1: That was a lot very undeserved.

619
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:53,766
Speaker 0: But actually I think the escaflowne movie was released a little bit after.

620
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:54,730
Speaker 1: oh, was it really?

621
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, so maybe it might have been the first digital fan sub.

622
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:11,390
Speaker 0: I'm just not committing to that because i'm not sure but This show kind of this marks a turning point in anime fandom in the united states like Anime fandom after this show was completely different in a lot of ways.

623
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,995
Speaker 1: I mean basically the anime club.

624
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:16,405
Speaker 1: when this started happening they had to debate at the anime club.

625
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:18,110
Speaker 1: Should we show this?

626
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,734
Speaker 1: You know and it was like a big.

627
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:23,590
Speaker 1: they had shown tape fan subs before but it's like can we show this?

628
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,773
Speaker 1: Should we show it?

629
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:28,710
Speaker 1: because in those days, you know the divics and stuff wasn't the same quality it is now.

630
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,770
Speaker 1: I mean, well vhs is terrible quality, but you know, there were all sorts of issues like should we show it?

631
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:42,855
Speaker 1: It was a big discussion and it was a major turning point, you know, it was pretty much like it was like, uh, You know They were on one course.

632
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:47,170
Speaker 1: then this happened and then that's when they started to turn towards the other course.

633
00:43:47,371 --> 00:44:18,850
Speaker 0: I mean I I really gotta stress how much things change because before this for the majority of people who liked anime At rit just because that's an example If you wanted to see Anime that wasn't already released in the us on vhs or dvd and there wasn't that much that was easy to get especially for poor college kids You pretty much had to go to anime clubs And at the anime club the like the eboard would sit and debate and decide What are we going to show these people?

634
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:25,326
Speaker 0: They're a captive audience because this is the only place they can get this stuff easily And then they could check stuff out of the library too.

635
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:32,839
Speaker 0: Yes But at the same time the the club was like there was so much in the library because god We had so many tapes even before digital fan subs.

636
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:33,502
Speaker 0: It was crazy.

637
00:44:33,662 --> 00:44:34,967
Speaker 0: Yeah that there was like.

638
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:35,850
Speaker 0: people needed direction.

639
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:46,750
Speaker 0: So pretty much you'd have two hundred three hundred people come to watch anime Partly because they'd get to see stuff that they'd never heard of had really no easy way of finding out about.

640
00:44:47,213 --> 00:45:02,548
Speaker 0: and the the like the goal of the club was to Show as many different kinds of anime as possible to get people into anime and then after gatekeepers People could go find out about anime on their own and then get it on their own.

641
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,628
Speaker 0: Yep, and there was a lot of talk about.

642
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,310
Speaker 0: well How are we going to get people to keep coming to the anime club?

643
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,266
Speaker 0: of course people kept coming and that's probably a topic for a separate show.

644
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:16,970
Speaker 0: as to how Some anime clubs survived this and many did not.

645
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:22,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we've talked about that plenty before but you know the the important point is that gatekeepers.

646
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:28,390
Speaker 1: It sort of got the ball rolling ironically enough because the bad guys turned into a giant ball in the first episode.

647
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:33,830
Speaker 0: It was also a lot of people called it the linux anime because the redhead guy was always the bad guy.

648
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,582
Speaker 1: Uh, it's so lame, but everyone I never heard anyone make that joke.

649
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:39,866
Speaker 0: people made that joke all the time.

650
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:41,110
Speaker 0: It's rit god.

651
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,130
Speaker 1: Oh, let me let me add in a note here gatekeepers has a manga, right?

652
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:54,580
Speaker 1: And it was a good call by tokyo pop to bring over the gatekeepers Manga because it would be able to sell to the people who had seen the gatekeepers anime Fan subbed based on the title alone and it.

653
00:45:54,882 --> 00:46:05,320
Speaker 1: in fact, I bought volume one way back in the day At full price even though now this is super super super discount bin fodder And rightfully so because it is a terrible manga.

654
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:10,850
Speaker 1: if you think the anime is shallow and nothing The manga is 10 times more shallow and nothing.

655
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,602
Speaker 1: It's basically like you open it up and it's just really.

656
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,930
Speaker 1: it's like meant for like five-year-olds this manga.

657
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:21,754
Speaker 1: It's like attack the bad guy gate open boom The end.

658
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:23,178
Speaker 1: that's pretty much it.

659
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:24,643
Speaker 1: You don't need to read the manga.

660
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:26,910
Speaker 0: No, don't forget my fray for two words.

661
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,198
Speaker 1: They might enjoy it collateral damage.

662
00:46:30,479 --> 00:46:34,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's another thing about like this show.

663
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:53,516
Speaker 0: The other the revolution of anime fandom was also that up until this point and up until digital fan subs people kind of Took whatever they could get and pretty much any show that people got their hands on they would watch I mean god, we watch legend of lennemere And we watch a lot of bad anime.

664
00:46:53,576 --> 00:47:02,930
Speaker 1: Yeah up until that point in my life, you know any anime that was on any You know, whatever sci-fi channel was showing I was there whatever anime club was showing.

665
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:07,547
Speaker 1: I think every anime that the anime club showed, you know was like, yes.

666
00:47:07,768 --> 00:47:08,109
Speaker 1: Awesome.

667
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:11,890
Speaker 0: Yes Awesome, and everyone would show up the people who only like giant robot stuff.

668
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:26,389
Speaker 1: They came to see the fancy lala-esque shows because it's anime It's anime, but this as you know within a few months just months because it was still freshman year Right after you know, this sort of this came out.

669
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:35,089
Speaker 1: You know, I was on you know hotline and there was plenty not actually ran a very popular hotline server At rit for a while quite uh.

670
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:43,276
Speaker 1: And you know We were all sharing all these digital fan subs that all of trygun and like real media files and it was all this stuff Going on and like.

671
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:55,569
Speaker 0: there was this sudden explosion and then all of a sudden A lot of people no longer had interest in one bad anime, but two anime that They on the surface didn't think they'd like.

672
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:56,132
Speaker 0: Like.

673
00:47:56,433 --> 00:48:00,090
Speaker 0: if we like fancy lala as an example ignore when fancy lala came out or whatever.

674
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:08,010
Speaker 0: But before the fan sub revolution and gatekeepers If we showed fancy lala everyone would come because all right anime the b-board picked it.

675
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,589
Speaker 0: It must be good enough to see and I want to see some anime.

676
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:17,510
Speaker 0: after that Fancy lala and people who like magical girls would come and everyone else would say screw it.

677
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:25,647
Speaker 0: I'll stay home and continue watching like fist battler baki And i'll wait for the next fist battler baki like show before I go back to the anime clubs.

678
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:26,089
Speaker 0: Yep

679
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:42,390
Speaker 1: You know the one more thing gatekeepers actually did is as far as i'm concerned is it was sort of you know It wasn't the first thing that gonzo ever did but it was one of the first uh, tv shows ever Animated by gonzo which is now a pretty big and important studio.

680
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:47,728
Speaker 1: they got their start doing you know video game cutscenes and then gatekeepers one of their first tv shows.

681
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:54,370
Speaker 1: and Gatekeepers really, you know the digital animation techniques used in that are pretty much used in everything today.

682
00:48:54,914 --> 00:49:01,246
Speaker 1: And i'm not I don't think they invented those techniques But that was like one of the first places I ever saw animation.

683
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:02,150
Speaker 1: that was that shiny.

684
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,182
Speaker 1: Did you see animation that shiny before?

685
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:05,630
Speaker 0: then gatekeepers?

686
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:13,290
Speaker 1: I mean, I see I saw better animation like akira is much better animation than gatekeepers, but it wasn't as shiny.

687
00:49:13,894 --> 00:49:15,830
Speaker 1: You see i'm the shiny does not go better.

688
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:45,005
Speaker 0: This is kind of like how tenchi muyo when american fans saw it There was a big hubbub because it looked so Shiny compared to other anime and it stood out as being like oh my god This was kind of similar that it looked really good and that drew a lot of people to it and gatekeepers Was like so shiny and so eye candy that a lot of people who had never seen this sort of thing before fell hand over foot for it because it just looked so Amazing

689
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:45,833
Speaker 1: Yep,

690
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:50,831
Speaker 0: and part of that too was that they just hadn't seen a lot of anime and this was kind of a new thing for Them.

691
00:49:50,951 --> 00:50:04,110
Speaker 1: and I think that because it was one of the first if not the first show to be digitally fan subbed You know and the p I knew that was when I knew who ganzo was like Think about that someone who never really paid attention to who made anime.

692
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:12,129
Speaker 1: I didn't really pay attention to directors other than miyazaki until like a couple years ago Right, like when I started listening when podcasting started coming into being.

693
00:50:12,149 --> 00:50:13,838
Speaker 1: you know An animal order told me.

694
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,005
Speaker 1: Oh, you should pay attention.

695
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:15,528
Speaker 1: I said, oh shit.

696
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:27,306
Speaker 1: You're right This is the year 2000, but I knew that this was made by studio ganzo because I don't know how that Knowledge like stuck with me, but it did and there was just something about that.

697
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:28,169
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

698
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:33,019
Speaker 1: So I I really I give gatekeepers a lot of credit for so.

699
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:44,829
Speaker 1: well Basically, I think that it had a significant role in bringing studio ganzo to to from being some nobody's made video game Cutscenes to the high profile studio they are today.

700
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:49,224
Speaker 0: Well, there was also a lot of some fun side stories that you know We talked about.

701
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:55,330
Speaker 0: oh This was a new issue much like when the un has to deal with like a new kind of weapon or a new kind of warfare.

702
00:50:55,892 --> 00:51:12,447
Speaker 0: the anime clubs of the world had to deal with a new kind of anime distribution medium and the the most interesting debate that happened was actually after the fact because there was a sequel to gatekeepers called Gatekeepers 21 i've watched one episode and decided it was garbage.

703
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:12,929
Speaker 0: I don't know.

704
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,430
Speaker 1: I watched one episode and I didn't decide it was garbage.

705
00:51:16,795 --> 00:51:17,890
Speaker 1: It seemed like it was a crime.

706
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:25,770
Speaker 1: It seemed like they were trying to ham-fist a show like noir Into the gatekeepers universe in the distant future and it wasn't working so well.

707
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:28,963
Speaker 1: But I don't think it was garbage, but I only watched one episode.

708
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,750
Speaker 0: It really didn't grab me at all.

709
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:32,405
Speaker 1: I was I didn't watch any more of it.

710
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:32,889
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

711
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:49,830
Speaker 0: but there was a crazy controversy about the gatekeepers 21 because we you know, anime clubs we had a lot of policies about what to show and Fan subs were usually deemed Okay because most fan subs weren't released like there are very few fan subs available that were ever released commercially.

712
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,619
Speaker 0: Are there any plans to release commercially?

713
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:53,850
Speaker 1: the issue of the vhs fan sub?

714
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,910
Speaker 1: You know was a solved problem long before we ever got to the anime club.

715
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:09,757
Speaker 0: Like we had all these policies to deal with it, but then with these digital fan subs, so gatekeepers 21 someone had laboriously fan subbed it and It this person.

716
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:11,766
Speaker 0: they wanted it to be shown at the rit anime club.

717
00:52:11,786 --> 00:52:12,630
Speaker 0: like look what I did.

718
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:14,675
Speaker 0: Let's let everyone see this.

719
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:23,290
Speaker 0: but in between when the fan subbing was completed and when it was to be shown It was announced that it was going to be released commercially.

720
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:26,582
Speaker 1: Yep, because it's like wow because I didn't you know.

721
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:28,208
Speaker 1: up until then there weren't.

722
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,660
Speaker 1: The commercial releases of anime are few and far between.

723
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:39,350
Speaker 1: we're talking streamline vhs's and such But I mean we're talking like try gun came out on dvd kawa bebop was come was out on dvd.

724
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:46,189
Speaker 1: That was the beginning of professionally released anime in the us, you know being on dvd and being high quality and awesome.

725
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:50,863
Speaker 1: and There was an announced licensing of gatekeepers gatekeepers 21.

726
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:54,773
Speaker 0: I forget it was gatekeepers 21 is the specific one and We debated.

727
00:52:55,094 --> 00:53:00,910
Speaker 0: we had like this crazy eboard meeting for hours where we debated whether or not we should show it.

728
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:03,718
Speaker 0: And then if we show it what's the rationale?

729
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:07,730
Speaker 0: if we don't show it what's the rationale what is our policy going forward?

730
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,093
Speaker 0: What like?

731
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:27,369
Speaker 0: we had to worry about this because it was a new thing and we didn't know what to do and we eventually came upon the kind of golden rule of anime clubs that still holds true to a large degree today, which was that We decided that as long as the show had not been given a street date as in there was.

732
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,397
Speaker 0: no We have the license.

733
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,190
Speaker 0: it is going to be released as of this day.

734
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:40,751
Speaker 0: We wouldn't wait until it was released because that was kind of crap because but We wait until they said it was going to be released and they said like it's going to be this day or this month Yeah,

735
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:44,587
Speaker 1: because someone could buy the license to something and then never release it.

736
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:59,909
Speaker 1: and we you know There was a sort of feeling that well if they're going to do that then You know There's a chance that they won't ever release it which is actually something that did happen way back in those days Not like now where they license something and it almost always gets released except, you know Even more recently the trend is reversed.

737
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:12,110
Speaker 1: So, you know if there was a if unless they said the dvd will be available volume one on this date Then that meant there was a chance that they were just going to hold on to the license and never release it.

738
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:20,270
Speaker 1: So he said in that case It's still okay for us to show a fan sub because this could be like, you know Lost art that no one will be able to see because someone's hoarding the license.

739
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:26,910
Speaker 0: Yep Now pursuant to that was the general policy that we'd never really showed whole shows and we kind of pointedly avoided.

740
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:32,526
Speaker 0: We never actually addressed the issue, but we never showed a marathon Of a fan sub.

741
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:39,750
Speaker 0: no We would show the first four episodes because if nothing else that did All that did is generate more interest in the actual commercial release.

742
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,604
Speaker 1: whenever we did a marathon of an entire show would always be the real dvds.

743
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:48,024
Speaker 0: now I to go over this very briefly.

744
00:54:48,446 --> 00:55:06,615
Speaker 0: back then Industry relations in terms of fan clubs were kind of different from they were today and we'd always you know we got like legal permission to show things and all this sort of and we had the Implicit and tacit a kind of approval of our policies by the anime Quote-unquote industry.

745
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:16,470
Speaker 0: at the time there was kind of a yeah, they won't say that though But we we had a lot of working relationship with many industry people and the policy then was an unspoken.

746
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:22,750
Speaker 0: As long as you follow the rules, you said you're following we will never bother you about your the way you show fans.

747
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:24,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a long time ago though.

748
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:25,301
Speaker 1: So don't it won't.

749
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,325
Speaker 1: it's not the same today.

750
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:27,430
Speaker 0: It's totally different now.

751
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,260
Speaker 0: Now the other issue was all right.

752
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,070
Speaker 0: We had a gigantic anime library.

753
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:32,661
Speaker 0: Do we allow?

754
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,301
Speaker 0: Digital fan subs in the library and if so in what capacity?

755
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:39,830
Speaker 0: and that that argument lasted for months.

756
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, they would.

757
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:45,810
Speaker 1: they I think eventually like they took some digital fan subs and transferred them to vhs and put them in the library.

758
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:51,569
Speaker 0: But that died out and eventually actually became moot before we came up with a policy on how to deal with it.

759
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:58,170
Speaker 0: Everyone just downloaded their own fan subs and the only purpose of the library then was to get legitimate releases.

760
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, they eventually old old like vhs releases of.

761
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:10,030
Speaker 1: like rupan Yep, they eventually just started You know buying dvds and throw and replacing all the fans of vhs's that you know had dvd replacements.

762
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:19,789
Speaker 0: Of course right about then was when scott johnson was in the process of being the best goddamn librarian ever In terms of getting enough money from rit to buy the sick amount of dvds that we had.

763
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:25,995
Speaker 1: man He like the library was pretty big when I joined the anime club scott It was in these cabinets.

764
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:30,269
Speaker 1: They had these eight cabinets and the club library filled the cabinets, but that was it.

765
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:41,030
Speaker 1: Scott johnson got added so many tapes to the library that not only did he fill those cabinets all the way He completely covered like three or four long tables.

766
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:46,410
Speaker 0: Yes, like our office was basically just full of dvd and vhs tapes.

767
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:48,746
Speaker 1: It was it was quite a thing to see.

768
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:54,750
Speaker 0: and then scott Johnson was the like emperor justinian of the rit anime club library something along those lines.

769
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:55,893
Speaker 0: Yes, I remember.

770
00:56:55,953 --> 00:57:02,250
Speaker 0: and then the worst thing is our method of dealing with like inventory was basically this little notebook.

771
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:02,872
Speaker 1: Yep,

772
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:13,793
Speaker 0: and we revolute we me and him sat there for like two days straight one weekend Recat catalogizing I'm gonna say catalogizing

773
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:15,117
Speaker 1: taking inventory of

774
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:27,950
Speaker 0: not just that but making the whole new system of taking inventory and relabeling Everything and the shit I got for the next three years because my g's look too much like o's and my handwriting was bad.

775
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:33,830
Speaker 1: Screw you you guys you guys didn't help me at all and gatekeepers was an instigator of the whole thing.

776
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:35,822
Speaker 0: I don't know what else we really have to say.

777
00:57:35,863 --> 00:57:41,770
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of Intimate little details about fan subs and gatekeepers and things that you probably don't care about.

778
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:49,500
Speaker 0: I don't think I want to get into the specifics of the arguments that we had in the club or Like just the reactions and all those crazy things.

779
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,070
Speaker 0: I think you get the overview of what was going on at that time.

780
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:53,112
Speaker 1: All right.

781
00:57:53,633 --> 00:58:03,907
Speaker 1: Uh, all I gotta say now is that uh, I have received what appears to be Uh one more valid entry into the goon saga manga contest.

782
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:19,009
Speaker 1: Oh snap I am going to judge the valid entries this week and I will announce a winner Next wednesday on the show, but if you send in a valid entry between today and next wednesday I will enter it into the judging.

783
00:58:19,574 --> 00:58:21,447
Speaker 1: So right now you got a one out of three.

784
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,963
Speaker 1: I think there's three entries and two of them are valid so far.

785
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,770
Speaker 0: so you'll win the goon saga manga.

786
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:29,883
Speaker 1: Your chances are good of winning if you send in a valid entry.

787
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,570

793
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,364
Speaker 0: We just had a lot of other things going on like gaming for hope which is the same.

794
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:51,629
Speaker 1: how much you're gonna give away now?

795
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:58,090
Speaker 0: All i'm gonna say is that we are now attending the new york comic con and we're going to be press for one.

796
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:02,382
Speaker 0: But much more importantly we're doing some events we're doing.

797
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:12,190
Speaker 0: we're going to be involved in something That may or may not involve guests of honor at the convention and may or may not be completely awesome.
