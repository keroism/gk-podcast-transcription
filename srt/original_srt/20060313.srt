1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,711
Speaker 1: It's Monday, March 13th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:15,580
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about our favorite hardware.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,078
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:21,320
Speaker 0: Well, we're back from a long and relaxing weekend.

5
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:26,220
Speaker 1: Uh, the internet went out at work, and I think I said that I said that already?

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:27,855
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know if you did or not.

7
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:28,280
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,299
Speaker 1: Oh, no, cuz it was Friday, wasn't it?

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
Speaker 0: I think you got confused by the fact that we recorded in a couple of extra episodes yesterday.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,260
Speaker 1: Or maybe was it Thursday?

11
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,580
Speaker 0: I think you said it on the extra episode yesterday.

12
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:43,799
Speaker 1: Anyway, sometimes- yeah, it must have been Friday last week that the internet just didn't work at work.

13
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,631
Speaker 1: So, of course, I went home.

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,559
Speaker 1: No reason for me to be there.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,316
Speaker 1: Yeah.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,620
Speaker 1: And then I come in this morning, and, um... It's still, uh, not, uh, working.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,419
Speaker 0: What, did they forget to pay the bill?

18
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:56,946
Speaker 1: I don't know.

19
00:00:57,752 --> 00:01:00,651
Speaker 1: I did just, um... Yeah, they must have.

20
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:01,520
Speaker 1: I don't know, they just suck.

21
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,999
Speaker 0: So why even go to work?

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,560
Speaker 1: So I went to work this morning, and it still wasn't working.

23
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:13,040
Speaker 1: So I just waited around, and I called them, and then I bothered them, and then they brought it back up, so... Wasn't a wasted trip today.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,080
Speaker 0: Alright, well, whatever, that's kind of weird, but your company's kind of weird in general.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't get it.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:18,936
Speaker 0: Yeah.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,140
Speaker 0: Though this will be an exciting podcast, since for some reason, there's a thunderstorm going on.

28
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:25,906
Speaker 1: Awesome!

29
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,320
Speaker 1: My favorite variety of weather.

30
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:28,137
Speaker 0: Yes.

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,095
Speaker 1: The mighty Thor is outside.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,940
Speaker 0: Lest this become Thor Nights.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,778
Speaker 1: Yes.

34
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:36,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a super inside joke right there.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,979
Speaker 0: Yes, it is indeed.

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,300
Speaker 0: Alright, anyway, in the actual news, uh, we like Ubuntu a lot.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,920
Speaker 0: It's a Linux distribution that, for those of you who don't know, is very awesome in that it just works.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,840
Speaker 1: If anyone's gonna use Linux, uh, just use Ubuntu.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,680
Speaker 1: That's the, uh, today, I really can't suggest anything different, and not laugh.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 0: Well, I guess my suggestion would be, try to do a Gen 2 at least once.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,696
Speaker 0: You'll learn a lot, and then you'll realize how beautiful Ubuntu is.

42
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:03,459
Speaker 0: when you switch to it.

43
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:16,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, or try to install Debian, and then realize... Then realize that Ubuntu basically is the same thing as Debian, like 99%, with, you know, only crooks slightly so.

44
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:20,060
Speaker 1: But it installs with, like, you push one button.

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, really, Ubuntu just works in the way that, like, Windows 2000 just works.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
Speaker 0: You install it, and everything's working.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, my parents use it.

48
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:28,640
Speaker 1: They got no problems.

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,029
Speaker 0: Yeah.

50
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,680
Speaker 1: They got less problems with that than they got with my brother's Windows computer.

51
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:45,758
Speaker 0: I'd almost recommend Fedora Core if you're making a computer for an elderly relative, because it's real hard to turn off a lot of the auto-update type stuff on Fedora Core, and it's real hard to break it, because you really can't do anything.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,465
Speaker 1: Nah, just give Ubuntu.

53
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:46,890
Speaker 1: It's a lot simpler.

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,619
Speaker 1: There's less stuff.

55
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,899
Speaker 1: And there's less trouble if you ever had to do something to it.

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, anyway, use Ubuntu.

57
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,020
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

58
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,840
Speaker 1: Or Kubuntu, if you're a KDE fan.

59
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:56,371
Speaker 0: I'm actually not.

60
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,100
Speaker 0: I like my GNOME.

61
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,680
Speaker 0: Or, uh, IceWM in the house.

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,494
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

64
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:01,467
Speaker 0: All right.

65
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:10,940
Speaker 0: So anyway, the reason I bring up Ubuntu, I didn't just want to talk about how awesome it is, but, uh, apparently they were caught with their pants down with a fairly severe vulnerability.

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,319
Speaker 1: How severe.

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,766
Speaker 0: Well, let me put it this way.

68
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:21,460
Speaker 0: When you install any modern distro, there's usually a little installer program, and it makes a log, like, while it's going of all the stuff you've done.

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,200
Speaker 0: You know, all the options you've picked, the root password you selected.

70
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,960
Speaker 0: Uh, note that I said the root password you selected.

71
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:30,040
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, in Ubuntu, you don't have a root password.

72
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:32,699
Speaker 1: It chooses one for you and keeps it a secret from you.

73
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the thing is-- And then you just use sudoo all the time.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,399
Speaker 0: So in Ubuntu, but you still make an account, and that account has full sudo privileges, so effectively you can make it root.

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,350
Speaker 1: Yep.

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:55,960
Speaker 0: Now, instead of deleting this log file, or encrypting this log file, version 5.1.0 and earlier of Breezy Badger just left it there, and any user could just look at this file and see what your password is.

77
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,859
Speaker 1: You realize the permissions on this file were just anyone can read it?

78
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:00,460
Speaker 0: Uh, that's what I'm led to believe.

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,140
Speaker 1: And the file was not automatically deleted at the end of install?

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,140
Speaker 0: It was supposed to be automatically deleted, and was not, due to a bug.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Speaker 1: Oh, well, see, that's-- see, you don't really need to encrypt that sort of file, 'cause who can get you while you're installing?

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 1: - I mean, while you're installing-- - Well, yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,340
Speaker 0: The thing is, they didn't get rid of the file.

84
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,160
Speaker 1: Oh, well, they gotta shred that file right after install is done.

85
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,885
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

86
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,779
Speaker 0: They fixed it within hours.

87
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:21,478
Speaker 1: It's not a hard thing to fix.

88
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, they didn't even notice.

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,140
Speaker 0: Some guy in the forums posted, "Hey, uh, just so you guys know, my root password, or my account password, is in this file.

90
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,915
Speaker 0: I'm curious as to why that

91
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:31,976
Speaker 0: is.".

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,773
Speaker 0: And the Ubuntu people said, "Oh, shit!

93
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,217
Speaker 0: Here's a

94
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:34,539
Speaker 0: patch!".

95
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:36,200
Speaker 0: And then they had an update ready.

96
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaker 1: All right, so if you're using Ubuntu, delete this file.

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,793
Speaker 0: - Yeah, uh, look at the article I linked to.

98
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,400
Speaker 0: - And change your passwords.

99
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:56,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, the reason I say it's a severe vulnerability is that in the off chance that you got hosed in the intervening time between when this happened or when it was discovered and when they fixed it, - you're screwed.

100
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:10,799
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the only real situation I could see that happening is if you're running a multi-user Ubuntu server and one of the users who is not supposed to be root went and found the file and knew about this and then logged in as root and did some nasties.

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:20,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, because basically any computer, Windows, Linux, whatever, if someone gets access to the rootest of root accounts, they can install a root kit and there's nothing you can do.

102
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,100
Speaker 0: And there's pretty much no way to undo that.

103
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:34,900
Speaker 1: On the bright side, think of it, even if you're running a Ubuntu web server, right, if you're the only real user on it, if this file isn't in the web directories or the htdocs, no one's going to figure it out.

104
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:40,078
Speaker 1: They'd have to SSH in first to get it, and if they don't have an account, they can't get the file, so it's just...

105
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:47,014
Speaker 0: I guess I don't want to overstate this because it was definitely fixed quickly and not many people knew about it, but I don't want to understate it because Linux isn't 100% secure.

106
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:49,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing's 100% secure.

107
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can make my computer 100% secure from outside attacks.

108
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,740
Speaker 0: I'll unplug the ethernet cable.

109
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:59,238
Speaker 1: Yep, that's from outside attacks, you know, but...

110
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,640
Speaker 0: Oh, from inside attacks, I'll take the processor out.

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,276
Speaker 1: There you go.

112
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:04,339
Speaker 1: All right.

113
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,600
Speaker 1: So, in France, the people, they use iTunes, just like we use iTunes.

114
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:13,237
Speaker 0: Oui, oui.

115
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:19,999
Speaker 1: And you know that if you buy music from the iTunes Music Store, it comes in AAC format with Apple DRM.

116
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,499
Speaker 1: And it can only be played on iTunes and iPods and such.

117
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,620
Speaker 0: Now, most people don't seem to have a problem with this because they have some sort of Apple fetish.

118
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:32,460
Speaker 1: I don't seem to have a problem because I just don't buy music from the iTunes Music Store.

119
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that too, that too.

120
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,540
Speaker 1: I just use normal MP3s, which work fine no matter where I go.

121
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:45,540
Speaker 1: But anyway, France is pushing through a law that says, "Hey, you can't lock in those songs to iPods only.

122
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,034
Speaker 1: You have to sell songs that'll play on

123
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:48,396
Speaker 1: anything."

124
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,712
Speaker 1: Which means MP3.

125
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,477
Speaker 0: And there's no way to put DRM in an MP3.

126
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:53,866
Speaker 1: Well, there is.

127
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:54,836
Speaker 1: It's just no longer an MP3.

128
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,206
Speaker 0: Well, then it...

129
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 1: You realize that...

130
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,734
Speaker 0: I don't know what to say to that other than, "I gotta walk over there and hit

131
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:02,855
Speaker 0: you.".

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:15,116
Speaker 1: No, but anyway... France, it'll basically make it sort of no longer illegal to just bust DRMs and such in France and all sorts of good stuff, so...

133
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like to see what comes of this.

134
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,280
Speaker 1: I think great things will come of it.

135
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, either Apple is gonna have to open up, but then the record labels are gonna back away from iTunes, or Apple's not gonna open up.

136
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,960
Speaker 1: Or at least the French record labels, or people just won't sell their music in France, or who knows?

137
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,720
Speaker 0: I'll bet a lot of American music gets sold in France.

138
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what would be cool is if they just stopped selling it to France.

139
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,919
Speaker 1: Then the people in France would just stop buying it, and they would either start pirating it the old-fashioned way or maybe they would find some other music to listen to.

140
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,620
Speaker 1: Maybe French music, and then hate us more.

141
00:07:50,443 --> 00:07:52,700
Speaker 1: I don't know, it's definitely good news all around.

142
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,859
Speaker 0: Yep, I really wanna see what happens after all this.

143
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,579
Speaker 1: All right, so the second bit of news here.

144
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gave Scott two news today.

145
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:01,879
Speaker 1: Oh, they were just such good news.

146
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,477
Speaker 1: There's a game called Galactic Civilizations 2, Galaxy of Two.

147
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 0: Yep, Scott's been playing it for the last couple days.

148
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Speaker 1: No, I played it for one day for a few hours, that was it.

149
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:10,719
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

150
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point is is that it's basically a Master of Orion type of game, but it's new and shiny.

151
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,660
Speaker 1: I'll talk about it in more detail some other time.

152
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I assumed you played it longer because of the long, heated argument we had about that frickin' game.

153
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,555
Speaker 1: No, that was our idea for how to make the game not suck, but anyway.

154
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,500
Speaker 0: That'll be another Monday or Tuesday.

155
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you like Master of Orion games, you'll like this game, but anyway, the game does not really have so much copy protection.

156
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,559
Speaker 1: I mean, you can just get the CDs from someone and install it, not enter, the serial key, the serial code to enter is optional.

157
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,058
Speaker 1: You don't have to enter it if you don't want to.

158
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
Speaker 0: Now, this is intentional, correct?

159
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:51,480
Speaker 1: Yep, they intentionally don't want to force you to enter the serial code when you install the game.

160
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,320
Speaker 1: That way, if you buy the game, you can have it on all your computers at once without having to buy more copies 'cause they're so cool.

161
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
Speaker 0: Now, that's a really good thing.

162
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,280
Speaker 0: That's about what I'd expect from a non-evil company that was selling software.

163
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:14,240
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is if you enter the key, then you get automatic updates of the software, so patches and stuff will come in, and you can also, I think, play online in the special online network.

164
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,719
Speaker 1: You know, you get all kinds of little perkies.

165
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,960
Speaker 0: All right, it sounds like a game that if I liked it, I'd actually purchase it and not pirate it just because they're so awesome.

166
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,260
Speaker 1: Yep, so there was a big hubbub on the internet, or first, people were like, "Oh, they want you to pirate their game.

167
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,640
Speaker 1: "They're not having copy protection,".

168
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,480
Speaker 1: and then they were like, "No, we don't want anyone to pirate our game.

169
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,340
Speaker 1: "We just want to be cool and not be evil," you know?

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,520
Speaker 1: And then the people who do Star Force, which is the horrible, horrible game copy protection software that destroys your computer and breaks your computer out.

171
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,399
Speaker 0: Doesn't World of Warcraft use it?

172
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 1: I don't think it does, does it?

173
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:46,239
Speaker 0: Some big game uses it.

174
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:46,999
Speaker 0: I forget which one.

175
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,119
Speaker 1: A lot of them use it.

176
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,460
Speaker 1: It's kind of, have we talked about it before?

177
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:51,780
Speaker 0: I think we have.

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,040
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is game copy protection software.

179
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:54,699
Speaker 0: It's bad.

180
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,380
Speaker 1: It's real bad, called Star Force.

181
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,520
Speaker 1: You don't want to install any game on your computer that uses Star Force, 'cause Star Force will ruin your computer.

182
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:04,780
Speaker 0: Not only is it bad, but the people who make it are generally jerks.

183
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Speaker 1: They're evil Russian guys.

184
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:11,300
Speaker 1: So what the evil Russian guys did was they said, "Galactic civilizations, too.

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,539
Speaker 1: They want you to pirate their game.

186
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,248
Speaker 1: He's linked to the

187
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:13,594
Speaker 1: torrent.".

188
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:20,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what they're saying is, "Well, you didn't want to pay us to secure your game, so now people are going to steal it.

189
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,846
Speaker 0: Ha ha

190
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:21,009
Speaker 0: ha.".

191
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyone who doesn't use our stuff, we're going to pirate your stuff and help other people pirate your stuff.

192
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:28,380
Speaker 0: Evil Russian guys.

193
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:29,598
Speaker 1: That's what they are.

194
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:31,299
Speaker 1: That's what they are.

195
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:32,437
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I guess.

196
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,119
Speaker 1: It's not even an exaggeration.

197
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:35,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really are evil Russian guys.

198
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,600
Speaker 0: They're in Russia.

199
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:37,220
Speaker 0: They're evil.

200
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:40,260
Speaker 0: They might not be natively born Russians.

201
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,419
Speaker 0: We don't know that much about them.

202
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,399
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, maybe not, but who knows?

203
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,459
Speaker 1: The point is is that Star Force bad, galactic civilizations, I'll talk about some other time.

204
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:03,250
Speaker 0: So recently, there was a very important political movement and change in a small country.

205
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,770
Speaker 1: Now, don't small countries change their politics and governments all the time?

206
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,290
Speaker 0: Well, actually, this country has been under a feudalistic dictatorship.

207
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,403
Speaker 0: Well, basically just feudalism for the past 450 years.

208
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:14,987
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

209
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,710
Speaker 1: You mean kings and lords and knights?

210
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,790
Speaker 0: I mean kings and lords and knights and peasants.

211
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:19,929
Speaker 1: Do they really have knights?

212
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,490
Speaker 0: I don't know if they actually had knights there, but I think they had the title knight.

213
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,910
Speaker 1: Did they have peasants for real?

214
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:26,150
Speaker 0: Basically.

215
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,058
Speaker 1: Really?

216
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,347
Speaker 0: All right.

217
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:34,030
Speaker 1: So you're telling me that right now, somewhere there's a peasant living in-- Not anymore because they just discovered democracy.

218
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,410
Speaker 1: But I mean, a few days ago, they were living in thatcher of cottages?

219
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:41,630
Speaker 0: Um, you realize that peasant is just a title.

220
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,410
Speaker 1: Well, that just sucks.

221
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,130
Speaker 0: Anyway, I just thought this was neat.

222
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,684
Speaker 0: Now, this island has been feudalistic, like old school feudalism, for the past 450 years.

223
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,330
Speaker 0: And just recently, they switched over to democracy.

224
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,310
Speaker 0: So now, any of the 600 residents of Sark can run for office.

225
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:11,790
Speaker 0: Now, Sark, if you don't know, is about 20 miles off the coast of France, and it's a part of the British Crown Dependency, which I didn't know what that meant, but apparently it means that it's owned by the Queen, but it's not a part of the United Kingdom.

226
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:20,069
Speaker 1: So, um, the United Kingdom, as opposed to Britain, England, whatnot?

227
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,928
Speaker 0: All right, we can't recreate it, like we just tried to do.

228
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:34,610
Speaker 0: But before the show, when we were talking about this, we argued for a while about the difference between England, Britain, Great Britain, the United Kingdom, and Albion.

229
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,550
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so, I've decided to just call all of it Albion now, because screw it, it's not working.

230
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,810
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I mean, England, Wales, and Scotland are all independent, and they're not countries, right?

231
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,626
Speaker 1: - I'm sure someone who's in Britain listening, you know, is like, "Oh, I know what it is, "you guys are idiots for not knowing the

232
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:52,990
Speaker 1: difference.".

233
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,148
Speaker 1: Well, you know what, I've heard multiple people from Albion disagree on what the actual things are.

234
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,949
Speaker 1: And you know what, the internet isn't even consistent, so.

235
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,930
Speaker 0: - The way I'm going here is that England, Scotland, and Wales are separate, and they're not countries.

236
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,150
Speaker 0: Together they're the United Kingdom, and Great Britain is the island.

237
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,670
Speaker 0: I don't know what Britain is, but Great Britain is the island.

238
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,570
Speaker 1: - But Northern Ireland gets thrown in there.

239
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,608
Speaker 0: - Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain, so what, I don't, god dammit.

240
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,770
Speaker 1: - It's all Albion, screw you, whatever.

241
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,510
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I thought this was really cool.

242
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,490
Speaker 0: Apparently, Sark is a very nice place, and they get most of their money from tourism.

243
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,509
Speaker 1: - We should totally go on vacation to Sark.

244
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,050
Speaker 0: - It very much reminds me of the Duchy of Grand Fenwick.

245
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,848
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and I wonder if anyone will know what the hell that is besides us.

246
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,370
Speaker 0: - Yeah, if anyone out there knows what the Duchy of Grand Fenwick is, without looking on Google, I award you something.

247
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,309
Speaker 0: A point of cool.

248
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,670
Speaker 1: - A point of cool.

249
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,329
Speaker 0: - You know what, you know what, I'll knight you.

250
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,510
Speaker 0: You can become a geek knight.

251
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,444
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

252
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,890
Speaker 1: Can it get, just like in Sark, where they still have candidates.

253
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:55,556
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

254
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:56,109
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

255
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:02,549
Speaker 1: All right, so my thing of the day, I don't think it's funny, but it might be.

256
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,430
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, remember way back--.

257
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,850
Speaker 1: - Well, at least one part of it is funny.

258
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:14,184
Speaker 0: - There was way back when there was that kid who was playing Xbox Live, and he was yelling at his mom, and it was just this horrible, "Freaking chocolate milk, you

259
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:14,469
Speaker 0: bitch!".

260
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,669
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that one.

261
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,764
Speaker 1: Well, this is worse, different.

262
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,750
Speaker 0: - Scott showed it to me, and it wasn't funny.

263
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,770
Speaker 0: It's just kind of disturbing.

264
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,022
Speaker 1: - Well, except for the one funnier part is, "Bye, it's time to escape

265
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:26,144
Speaker 1: in!".

266
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:28,829
Speaker 1: See, that's the funny part.

267
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,990
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I don't know, I mean, is this real?

268
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:31,789
Speaker 0: Is it fake?

269
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,461
Speaker 1: Is it a good camera?

270
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:32,870
Speaker 1: - I can't even tell.

271
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,469
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is what the video is.

272
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,589
Speaker 1: Let me describe it to you for those who don't watch it.

273
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,849
Speaker 1: It's this German kid.

274
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,704
Speaker 1: He must be between the ages of 13 and something.

275
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:43,906
Speaker 1: I don't know.

276
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,569
Speaker 1: And he's at a computer, and I think he's trying to play a computer game.

277
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,190
Speaker 1: And he's frustrated with the game.

278
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,689
Speaker 1: I can't tell if it's because he's losing, or is it because he can't get the game to run?

279
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,029
Speaker 0: - We really can't tell.

280
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,810
Speaker 0: It's drowned out by his horrid, screeching screams.

281
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,210
Speaker 1: - So he's German, and he's yelling and screaming at this game.

282
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,809
Speaker 1: If anyone knows German well enough, maybe you could translate what the hell he's saying.

283
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:11,610
Speaker 1: I can make out a few of the words, like spiel means games.

284
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,748
Speaker 0: - And escape in.

285
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:20,390
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so he gets so pissed off, and in such a fit of crazy, zany screaming.

286
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,169
Speaker 0: - Zany is not the word.

287
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,789
Speaker 1: - I don't know.

288
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,870
Speaker 0: - I don't think the word zany fits this at all.

289
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,950
Speaker 1: - No, hysterical?

290
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,570
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's a much better word.

291
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:38,650
Speaker 1: - Okay, so he's literally smashing the keyboard and the mouse, and at one point, it just freaked me out.

292
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,570
Speaker 1: I don't know how someone like this can exist.

293
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:42,510
Speaker 1: This is why we need nut houses again.

294
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,090
Speaker 0: - I mean, it started out, and he was showing it to me, and I thought, all right, this is funny.

295
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,510
Speaker 0: Look, this kid is really frustrated.

296
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,109
Speaker 0: Aha, I've thought like that before.

297
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:55,469
Speaker 0: And then it keeps going, and it keeps going, and it just doesn't stop.

298
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:58,450
Speaker 0: And I don't know what to think.

299
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,049
Speaker 0: If this is real, that kid needs help.

300
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,370
Speaker 0: And if it's fake, well, that kid can act.

301
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,390
Speaker 1: - Yeah, if it's fake, that kid can act.

302
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,830
Speaker 1: Now, who put this camera here?

303
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:07,629
Speaker 1: How did it get there?

304
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:08,889
Speaker 1: That's what I wanna know.

305
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,189
Speaker 0: - Yeah, maybe his brother knew that he's crazy and put that there.

306
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,110
Speaker 0: Maybe-- - That's a reasonable explanation.

307
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,988
Speaker 0: - Maybe it's fake.

308
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,309
Speaker 1: - Maybe it's fake.

309
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,829
Speaker 0: - I mean, this is like way back.

310
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:25,589
Speaker 0: There was this video online a long time ago of a guy getting hit by a car, and we sat for hours debating whether or not it was a real video or not.

311
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,849
Speaker 0: We ended up finding out that it was fake.

312
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,509
Speaker 0: - Of course.

313
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,849
Speaker 0: - Which we had kind of determined by going frame by frame and like, ah, I think it's a dummy there.

314
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,507
Speaker 1: - Yup.

315
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,509
Speaker 0: - I don't know about this one.

316
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,169
Speaker 0: There's no frame by frame to look at.

317
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,909
Speaker 0: There's no dummy.

318
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,849
Speaker 1: - Yeah, this one is just, wow.

319
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:44,030
Speaker 1: The only thing I had to say, I already said we need to bring back nuthouses.

320
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,426
Speaker 0: Seriously.

321
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,689
Speaker 0: - You know, there are nuthouses.

322
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,489
Speaker 0: - Oh, there are?

323
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:48,729
Speaker 1: I thought we got rid of all of them.

324
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,070
Speaker 0: - No, there are plenty of nuthouses.

325
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,649
Speaker 0: You can check yourself into one if you want.

326
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,490
Speaker 1: - Well, someone needs to check this kid into one ASAP.

327
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,527
Speaker 0: - You know, I really hate people who say ASAP as opposed to A-S-A-P.

328
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,590
Speaker 1: - Whatever.

329
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,687
Speaker 1: You can shove it.

330
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,049
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's why he's saying sequel instead of SQL.

331
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,710
Speaker 1: - Oh God, those people need to die.

332
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,102
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

333
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,970
Speaker 1: - I might go into a historical fit of rage.

334
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,589
Speaker 0: - Just don't destroy my keyboard.

335
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,710
Speaker 0: I need my escaping key.

336
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,529
Speaker 0: - But it's not escaping!

337
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:14,329
Speaker 0: (laughing).

338
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,569
Speaker 0: - See, we said it's not funny, but now we're laughing.

339
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,910
Speaker 1: - That's the only funny part, 'cause he smashes the keyboard and he loses the escape key, and then he needs the escape key, for whatever he's doing.

340
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,080
Speaker 0: He says, "Why is that

341
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:24,444
Speaker 0: escape?".

342
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:25,709
Speaker 0: - You know what?

343
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,730
Speaker 0: In that point, I can only describe it as delicious irony.

344
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:29,865
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

345
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,969
Speaker 1: It's funny, he doesn't seem to care about losing the other keys.

346
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:34,969
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.

347
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:40,470
Speaker 1: Watch it and be appalled, amazed, shocked.

348
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:48,529
Speaker 0: - I was less appalled by that than I was by the video we watched just before the show, which was a montage of stupid people doing stupid things and hurting themselves.

349
00:17:50,710 --> 00:18:00,170
Speaker 0: - I'm not gonna link to it, you can find it, but basically, the one that got me was, there's this guy who's obviously drunk, and he has this big firework that he's, that, you know, - Oh, that one.

350
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,309
Speaker 0: - a golden candle, and he holds it to his crotch like, "Ha ha, it's a penis.

351
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,484
Speaker 0: "Look at me, I'm gonna shoot a giant fireball out,

352
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:06,605
Speaker 0: woo!".

353
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:08,910
Speaker 0: But I think he's holding it backwards.

354
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,550
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it looks like it shoots a fireball into his penis.

355
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,109
Speaker 0: - It's one of the most horrid things I've ever seen.

356
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,730
Speaker 1: - Yeah, some of them are pretty bad.

357
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,750
Speaker 0: - All right, so anyway, I have the escapin' key.

358
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,890
Speaker 0: So today, we're starting a new Favorites Week.

359
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,889
Speaker 0: - All right, and-- - Actually, this is our first Favorites Week.

360
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:38,829
Speaker 1: - Yep, and we're going to preface all the Favorites Week episodes with a little spiel about what Favorites Week is about, because-- - Since a lot of people out there are now subscribing to individual days of Geek Nights instead of the whole week.

361
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,590
Speaker 1: - Yeah, if you're only listening to Geek Nights Sci-Tech, or I guess that's today, right, Monday Sci-Tech?

362
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:43,905
Speaker 1: - Yep.

363
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:50,470
Speaker 1: - Then you might wanna know that, you know, we also have shows Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday every week that you can subscribe to those as well.

364
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,089
Speaker 0: - You might already know and not care, but in case you don't know.

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,969
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so anyway, for those of you who were just listening today, favorite is not the same thing as best.

366
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:13,770
Speaker 1: As in, I could recognize that, you know, the first Matrix movie might be my favorite movie, but at the same time, Citizen Kane, which I can't stand to watch, might be the best movie.

367
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:15,129
Speaker 1: Do you see the difference?

368
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,170
Speaker 0: If not, well, whatever.

369
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,690
Speaker 1: - Yes, but this week is Favorites Week.

370
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,290
Speaker 1: It is the things we like the most, regardless of their quality.

371
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,930
Speaker 0: - Yeah, because I gotta say, especially when we get to Anime Day, we'll both admit that we like some crap.

372
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,590
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we like a lot of crap.

373
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,110
Speaker 1: I mean, no one really likes the stuff that's the best.

374
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,310
Speaker 1: That's why we have the word movie and the word film.

375
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:38,550
Speaker 0: - I really, really like Cowboy Bebop, and it's also the best.

376
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,510
Speaker 1: - Yeah, yeah, that's true, but I'm saying not always.

377
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,542
Speaker 0: - All right, I'll also note that, yeah, people who really make the distinction between film and movie, yeah.

378
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,130
Speaker 1: - Yeah, those people are not the best, nor are they my favorites.

379
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:58,190
Speaker 1: Okay, so today we're gonna do favorite hardware.

380
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,530
Speaker 0: - That sounds very generic, but what do you want?

381
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,741
Speaker 1: - We're talking about all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, computers, electronic stuff.

382
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,410
Speaker 1: that is our favorite stuff.

383
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:34,350
Speaker 0: - Now, when I was a little kid, and I'm sure you've seen him, they used to sell him at Radio Shack all over the place, but I had this little kit that was full of resistors and capacitors and diodes and a little breadboard and batteries and speakers, and it was a little electronics kind of workshop, and I learned almost everything I know about electronics today from having that thing when I was a little kid, and I think I would rank it as the best technological or hardware-based toy I've ever had, also my favorite.

384
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,030
Speaker 1: - Wow, that's quite a bit.

385
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,869
Speaker 0: - Well, let's see, with that thing I learned how to solder, I learned how to make a alarm for my room, which did nothing but piss my mother off.

386
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,770
Speaker 1: - I also made a room alarm out of simple electronics.

387
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,789
Speaker 0: - See, first I made one, I wasn't too clever, where basically the wires had to be touching, or it wouldn't go off.

388
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,810
Speaker 1: - Oh, I had ones with little depressing buttons, where if the door moved, it would go off, or if the door hit it, it would go off.

389
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,269
Speaker 0: - See, I ended up setting it up with a mercury switch, so if you turned the door knob, it would go off.

390
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,275
Speaker 0: - Ooh.

391
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,617
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and you know what, I set it up.

392
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:11,309
Speaker 0: so if it went off, not only would it not turn off, but it had multiple power sources.

393
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:12,939
Speaker 0: - Ooh.

394
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,490
Speaker 0: - Yeah, my mom didn't like that one whit.

395
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaker 1: - No, okay, let's see, if we're gonna start with the young days.

396
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,729
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the educational, fun, young, technological hardware.

397
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,810
Speaker 1: - You know what, I gotta go with the erector set.

398
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,390
Speaker 0: - See, I only had one erector set ever, and I got it kinda late in my life.

399
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,049
Speaker 1: - You see, I got the erector set.

400
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:36,729
Speaker 1: I didn't have the erector set from the store, not that wussy piece of junk.

401
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:41,646
Speaker 1: I had my uncle's ancient 1950s erector set.

402
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,676
Speaker 0: - The metal ones?

403
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,130
Speaker 1: - It was completely metal.

404
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,689
Speaker 1: It came in a metal box with metal tools, and every single piece inside was metal.

405
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,430
Speaker 1: Metal, metal, metal, metal, metal.

406
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:59,790
Speaker 1: And it came with screws and bolts, and all you did was screw and use screws to connect metal things to make stuff.

407
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:02,130
Speaker 1: It was freakin' awesome.

408
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:14,350
Speaker 1: The thing is, I never really got any other erector stuff because I got it in that interim period where erector really wasn't available, and then erector sets came out again, and I got one helicopter, but it wasn't quite the same.

409
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:22,648
Speaker 1: So I never really, and it was a 1950 set, I couldn't really get a lot of compatible stuff, so Lego ended up winning out, which I could just keep getting more of.

410
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,088
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we're not gonna talk about Lego, but--.

411
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:39,910
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but erector will let you make some really cool stuff that you couldn't make with other things, especially things that worked, like mechanical things that worked, like better than Technic could ever, except you needed more pieces, and it was more expensive, and it was metal and dangerous.

412
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,750
Speaker 1: Erector is the shit, is it still out?

413
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,590
Speaker 1: Can you still get erector sets?

414
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,890
Speaker 0: - I don't know, I mean, when I got older, I remember I had K'Nex, and I remember when I was younger, Tinker Toys.

415
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,030
Speaker 1: - Yeah, erector set is the original real deal, and we're talking hardware, so I gotta go with that one.

416
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,629
Speaker 0: - All right.

417
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,529
Speaker 1: - All right, let's move ahead a few years.

418
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,889
Speaker 1: I gotta say, let's start getting to where computers are at.

419
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,899
Speaker 0: - All right, I remember my 486SX2.

420
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,090
Speaker 1: - I'm going earlier, I'm going with the Apple IIGS.

421
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,150
Speaker 0: - See, surprisingly, my 486SX2 was my first computer.

422
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,890
Speaker 1: - My 486DX4 was my first computer.

423
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,550
Speaker 0: - Never had an Apple IIGS.

424
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,708
Speaker 1: - I never had an Apple IIGS.

425
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,750
Speaker 0: - Never had a Commodore.

426
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,589
Speaker 1: - My cousins all had Commodores.

427
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,430
Speaker 0: - First time I ever used a computer was in fifth grade.

428
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,508
Speaker 1: - First time I ever used a computer was in kindergarten, there was an Apple IIE.

429
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:37,089
Speaker 1: It was awesome, 'cause I didn't, the other kids couldn't figure out how to use it, the teachers couldn't figure out how to use it, I sat down and I figured it out, just in two seconds from looking at it, and looking at the keyboard, and looking at what was there, and I was like, oh, that's what you do.

430
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:44,309
Speaker 0: - So I went to a Catholic school, and they had one room with four Apple computers in it, and that was for the older kids, so I was never allowed to go in there.

431
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:56,618
Speaker 1: - Oh, see, in my elementary school, every single classroom had, well, most of the classrooms had an Apple II in them, and there was one lab full of Apple IIs, and then I think that lab was quickly upgraded to all Macs, like Mac 512Ks.

432
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:16,588
Speaker 0: - Yeah, when I got to fifth grade, there was a 386 in the back of the room, and I remember kids who didn't know anything about computers, I remember this one kid, Dustin, he opened some WordPad-y kind of editor thing, and he scrolled down like 100 pages, he typed a naughty word, and then he closed it, thinking that it would be there when someone reopened it.

433
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,127
Speaker 1: - Ah ha ha ha ha.

434
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,648
Speaker 0: - Ah, kids.

435
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,569
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so smart.

436
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:28,910
Speaker 1: Now, but the Apple IIgs is like the pinnacle of old school, elementary school times computing.

437
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,110
Speaker 1: I mean, the GS really does stand for graphics and sound.

438
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,248
Speaker 1: This thing was an Apple II, just like those green screen Apple IIs you played Oregon Trail on.

439
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:50,170
Speaker 1: It's the exact same computer, only the screen was in color, like a lot of colors, and the sound rivals the sound unlike the Sound Blaster 16, if not better.

440
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,630
Speaker 0: - See, at that point in my life, I was still pretty much a Nintendo kid and a Nintendo kid alone.

441
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:06,528
Speaker 1: - I was still playing Nintendo in those days, but in school, the Apple IIgs is recognized as the computer, and I did a lot of summer programs, or I would go and use the computers at the school and all kinds of cool stuff.

442
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:15,270
Speaker 1: So I learned logo on those things, and the Apple IIgs was always the best computer, 'cause it wasn't a Mac with a mouse and stuff.

443
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:20,409
Speaker 1: It was still an Apple II through and through, but it was the baddest-ass, most powerful Apple II you can get.

444
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,190
Speaker 1: There are people who still use these things today as their primary computing platform.

445
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:34,090
Speaker 1: They have TCP/IP stacks for these things, they have AIM, they have Wolfenstein 3D, they have CD burners, you can trick these things out.

446
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,730
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

447
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:43,070
Speaker 1: I actually have one in the other room, I think, and I have a card that goes in it that gives it four megabytes of memory.

448
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:43,755
Speaker 1: Four.

449
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,950
Speaker 0: - Now, he's turned this thing on once or twice, and the rest of the time, it just sits there.

450
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,246
Speaker 1: - That's 'cause I need to get more five-and-a-quarter floppies to get software on it.

451
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:53,050
Speaker 1: That's the only reason.

452
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:55,069
Speaker 1: If I can get the good software, I'd be all over it.

453
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,730
Speaker 1: But my Oregon Trail disk is broken a little bit.

454
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,889
Speaker 0: - You know, I could probably get you some five-and-a-quarter floppies.

455
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,630
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I just, now I need a five-and-a-quarter floppy drive to plug into my-- - They're not hard to find.

456
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,990
Speaker 1: - To plug into my normal computer.

457
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,589
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

458
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,670
Speaker 0: - And then I need to get images-- - You plug it into that second slot on your floppy cable.

459
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,410
Speaker 1: - Yeah, then I need to get some images of games and things to put on the floppies from the internet.

460
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,310
Speaker 0: - I'm sure those are readily available.

461
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,850
Speaker 1: - And then I gotta use the DD command to put the images onto the five-and-a-quarter floppy drives.

462
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,589
Speaker 0: - All right, then do all that.

463
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,209
Speaker 1: - I would if I wasn't busy doing other stuff.

464
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:40,709
Speaker 0: - See, for me, computing didn't explode until fifth grade when suddenly, school had a computer, I used it, I liked it, I started staying after school to play Scorched Earth with all these other kids.

465
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,389
Speaker 1: - Holy crap.

466
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:51,290
Speaker 0: - Yeah, pretty much every Monday I remember I'd stay after school, especially in sixth grade, until like six at night just playing Scorched Earth or Stunt's 4D Racing cracked by Kill Fit.

467
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,910
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we didn't really play, the games we played at school are mostly the Apple-type games, a little Carmen Sandiego action, Oregon Trail action.

468
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:03,378
Speaker 1: There was this one game where you had to, what was the guy, Dr.

469
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,769
Speaker 1: Livingston, you had to find him.

470
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:08,629
Speaker 1: It was a crazy game, I wish I could find it, it's kinda rare.

471
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,490
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we had King's Quest I as well.

472
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:19,949
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we didn't have the PCs at all, so nothing going on there until I got the 486DX4, which was not one of my favorite hardwares, so we're not gonna talk about it.

473
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:32,310
Speaker 0: - Yeah, though I can say something interesting, that for three generations of computers that I owned, every time I bought a new computer, I exactly quadrupled the processing power and quadrupled the RAM, like exactly.

474
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:40,469
Speaker 0: First I had the 486SX2, then I got the Pentium 200, and then I got my 800 megahertz Athlon.

475
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,790
Speaker 1: - Well yeah, quadruple.

476
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,890
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and the RAM quadrupled the same.

477
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:52,190
Speaker 1: See, I had a 486DX4 100 megahertz, which is not my favorite computer, it was actually quite an unpleasant computer.

478
00:27:52,790 --> 00:28:00,610
Speaker 1: Then I got my perhaps favorite computer, even though it doesn't hold up today in terms of power, was my Pentium 3450.

479
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:07,339
Speaker 1: Now, my favorite thing about the Pentium 3450 was not the Pentium 3, nor was it the 256 megabytes of PC 100 RAM.

480
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,790
Speaker 0: - How about that loud-ass, horrible hard drive cooler you had stuck in the front?

481
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,810
Speaker 1: - No, it's not the horrible hard drive cooler that I added later.

482
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,168
Speaker 0: - I hated that thing so much.

483
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,302
Speaker 1: - It was the Abit BX6 R2 motherboard.

484
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:34,910
Speaker 1: Now, the thing about this motherboard is that it's just so incredibly bad-ass that it's every motherboard since then should look at this one for how to be a good motherboard.

485
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,230
Speaker 0: - This motherboard is one of the most stable platforms I've ever witnessed.

486
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,250
Speaker 1: - The BX chipset is just the most unbelievable chipset ever created.

487
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,369
Speaker 0: - Now, Scott and I are not the only ones who say this.

488
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,610
Speaker 0: We have many friends who have independently of us come to this conclusion.

489
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:57,970
Speaker 1: - Yes, I still have the motherboard, and it is still excellent, and if I found a better Pentium 3 to put in it, a slot one processor, then I'd be good to go with some awesome action.

490
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,090
Speaker 0: - See, my favorite computer would be the first one I ever built.

491
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:11,270
Speaker 0: I learned a lot about computers, and then the summer of 2000, right before I went to RIT, I dropped almost $4,000 on the baddest-ass computer the world had seen.

492
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:18,967
Speaker 0: I got a SCSI card and a CD burner that went with it so I could burn CDs without using my CPU.

493
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,809
Speaker 0: I had a pile of RAM, I had 800 megahertz processor.

494
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,707
Speaker 0: I bought the topest, top-of-the-line video card you could get for gaming, the GeForce 2 GTS.

495
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:38,649
Speaker 0: Now, the funny part about this is that I used the computer for so long, and I'm still using that computer, and it's what I'm recording the podcast on right now.

496
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,930
Speaker 1: - Well, you upgraded the motherboard and the CPU and stuff.

497
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,650
Speaker 0: - I upgraded the motherboard and CPU only because the previous motherboard exploded.

498
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,429
Speaker 1: - Obviously, it was not as good as the BX.

499
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,950
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well, I overclocked the hell out of that thing.

500
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,089
Speaker 1: - I overclocked the BX.

501
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,950
Speaker 1: The BX could bring the front side bus up to 133.

502
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,950
Speaker 1: It was the first motherboard that could do that reliably.

503
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,808
Speaker 0: - All right, well, you know what else I did it in?

504
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,189
Speaker 0: Remember the capacitor mishap?

505
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,829
Speaker 1: - Yep.

506
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,350
Speaker 0: - My motherboard was affected by that.

507
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,346
Speaker 1: - Yeah, again, the BX, awesome.

508
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,490
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the thing is, back then, overclocking was awesome.

509
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:15,910
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I see all these kids who overclock their computer, and really, what are you doing?

510
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:17,168
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

511
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,030
Speaker 0: It doesn't get you anything anymore.

512
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,629
Speaker 0: Back then, I had 800 megahertz processor with 100 megahertz front side bus.

513
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:29,570
Speaker 0: If I upped my front side bus to 133, my computer was screaming like noticeable performance increases.

514
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:34,470
Speaker 0: If you overclock a modern top-of-the-line computer, all you do is add instability.

515
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,569
Speaker 1: - Actually, this one, I just heard a story today, actually, that kind of shoots that down.

516
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,588
Speaker 1: Some guys at Intel, 'cause the Intel should be anti-overclocking, of course, right?

517
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:51,370
Speaker 1: But some guys at Intel are all enthusiasts, and they invented a new cooling thing that's actually pretty cheap, like 50 bucks.

518
00:30:52,152 --> 00:31:03,729
Speaker 1: And if you install this cooling thing, you can get a Pentium Extreme Edition up from three-point-something gigahertz to five gigahertz without even worrying about stability at all.

519
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:04,950
Speaker 1: It's just that awesome.

520
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,109
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we'll see how long that lasts.

521
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,849
Speaker 1: - It's made by Intel.

522
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,690
Speaker 1: This isn't like some hardware hacksaw guys.

523
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,569
Speaker 1: This is the real deal.

524
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,529
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so let's see if they market that.

525
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,083
Speaker 1: - We'll see.

526
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,050
Speaker 1: Supposedly they will, but anyway.

527
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:24,630
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I mean, your computer, if you buy the giant-ass heat sink and you think you're gonna overclock it to get that extra frame per second in Quake.

528
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,050
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so we're supposed to be talking about our favorite hardwares.

529
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:36,510
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well, my favorite hardware is that computer, which is sitting in front of me with the giant, giant two-and-a-half-foot tall full tower case.

530
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,603
Speaker 0: This thing weighs about 70 pounds.

531
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:46,910
Speaker 0: And of course, sitting in front of me, the LG StudioWorks 19-inch monitor, which to this day is still almost perfect.

532
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,428
Speaker 1: - Oh, oh, we're gonna talk about favorite monitors?

533
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:57,798
Speaker 1: All right, so I used to be a ViewSonic fan 'cause they made generally good monitors, and it was cool.

534
00:31:57,838 --> 00:32:00,310
Speaker 1: that ViewSonic was so good that you didn't buy it in the store.

535
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,109
Speaker 1: You had to buy it online.

536
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:05,750
Speaker 1: I had the cool little birdies on it, and it was generally good monitors for good prices.

537
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:22,309
Speaker 1: I had a ViewSonic GS771, which was a 17-inch CRT, but the depth, meaning the distance between the front of the glass and the back of the monitor where you plug stuff in, was a lot, lot shorter than any other 17-inch monitor you could buy, so it took up less room.

538
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,010
Speaker 0: - My monitor is a giant behemoth.

539
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,570
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but that monitor really wasn't that great.

540
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:27,609
Speaker 1: looking back on it.

541
00:32:28,252 --> 00:32:36,950
Speaker 1: I liked it when I had it 'cause I had been using NEC multisync 15s until then, which are pretty much run-of-the-mill 15-inch monitors.

542
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,930
Speaker 0: - Hey, my first monitor was a 12-inch bastard.

543
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:41,290
Speaker 0: I've still got it.

544
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,829
Speaker 0: I use it as a second monitor here.

545
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:47,529
Speaker 0: I've gotta keep it at least eight feet away from my primary monitor or it interferes with it.

546
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:56,842
Speaker 1: - Yep, so then I finally decided to go to LCDs, and I had money, and I discovered a new monitor, the Samsung, what's it called, the ZX15.

547
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,549
Speaker 1: I don't even know the number of it anymore, but I have two of them, they're so good.

548
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,290
Speaker 0: - Yeah, one of which, the backlight is broken.

549
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,010
Speaker 1: - No, the backlight's not broken on it.

550
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,330
Speaker 0: - All right, the monitor's dim as hell.

551
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,748
Speaker 1: - It's not dim as hell.

552
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:12,508
Speaker 1: than your monitor.

553
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,330
Speaker 0: - The only reason my monitor's dim at all is because my video card, the Geforce 2 GTS--.

554
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,570
Speaker 1: - Even if your video card is working perfectly, that monitor is still brighter.

555
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,489
Speaker 0: - I doubt it.

556
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,250
Speaker 0: We should do a side-by-side comparison 'cause my monitor's kinda badass.

557
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,170
Speaker 1: - We should, your monitor's not badass.

558
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,366
Speaker 1: Your monitor's an old, crummy 19-inch CRT.

559
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:35,070
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know what, considering that it's still in perfect working condition, despite the fact that every other LG product that I've known has just fallen apart.

560
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,110
Speaker 1: - I still have old stuff that's in perfect working condition.

561
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:41,290
Speaker 1: that NEC 15 I was talking about is still working just fine.

562
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:50,609
Speaker 0: - See, I'm just very pleased with my monitor, and as soon as I buy a new video card, The monitor I'm talking about, the Samsung 172X, they don't even make it anymore, I don't think.

563
00:33:51,372 --> 00:33:52,809
Speaker 1: It's like the perfect LCD.

564
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,950
Speaker 1: It's like there's not too much plastic around the edges.

565
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,629
Speaker 1: You know how monitors tend to have big plastic things around the glass?

566
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,249
Speaker 1: There's maybe like half an inch of plastic around the edge.

567
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:09,123
Speaker 1: And you get the full 17 inches, and on an LCD, 17 inches is really as big as a 19-inch CRT.

568
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:17,129
Speaker 1: And the resolution is great, and the response time is great, and it has a DVI end-to-VGA that you can switch between with one button.

569
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:19,130
Speaker 1: It's just the perfect monitor.

570
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,626
Speaker 0: - Yeah, except for the fact that one of 'em's real bright and one of 'em's dim because one's broken, ha ha.

571
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,109
Speaker 1: - It's not broken.

572
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,348
Speaker 0: - Something's wrong with it.

573
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,690
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'll fix it someday.

574
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,348
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we'll see.

575
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:35,302
Speaker 0: Though I gotta say, at work, I got a hold of a 21, I think it's, it's either 21 or 23 inches.

576
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:47,469
Speaker 0: It's this massive, massive professional CRT, like flat screen kinda deal, that I got from a, they're closing down one of the buildings where I work, and we went over there to scavenge a server that we wanna use for something.

577
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:52,790
Speaker 0: And the monitor was just there with it, and the guy said we could take it, so I put it in my office.

578
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,193
Speaker 1: - Yep.

579
00:34:54,214 --> 00:34:54,889
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

580
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:55,449
Speaker 1: - Cool.

581
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,510
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh, let me talk about my favorite mouse.

582
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:00,776
Speaker 0: - Uh.

583
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:01,770
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

584
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,409
Speaker 0: - Whatever, mice are mice.

585
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,641
Speaker 1: - No, no, no, so I currently have the Logitech MX1000 laser mouse.

586
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:11,730
Speaker 1: It's not really my favorite mouse, I gotta be honest.

587
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,290
Speaker 1: I mean, it has a lot of buttons, and it's the most useful.

588
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:19,589
Speaker 1: But my favorite mouse was the one I have downstairs, the Logitech Wingman Gaming Mouse.

589
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:23,670
Speaker 1: It's just three buttons and an extra big ball.

590
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:32,530
Speaker 1: Now, back in the day, before optical mice existed, and before you needed a scroll wheel on your mouse, this thing was like the baddest motherfucker.

591
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,489
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but you know what, I need a scroll wheel.

592
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:41,849
Speaker 1: - Well, now you do, that's why you can't really use it anymore, but in the day, like, I enjoyed that mouse then more than I enjoy my current mouse now.

593
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,570
Speaker 1: Like, it had three buttons that actually all worked and clicked nicely, you know, it was real sensitive.

594
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:53,691
Speaker 1: Like, you could turn it up to 200 when every other mouse only went up to like 80.

595
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:55,750
Speaker 1: And you could frickin' play games with that, man.

596
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:56,589
Speaker 1: Like, holy shit.

597
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,230
Speaker 0: - Of course, meanwhile, my current mouse does 800.

598
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,790
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's-- - Without even blinking.

599
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,850
Speaker 1: - This is also one of the first USB mice.

600
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,070
Speaker 1: Like, at first, I couldn't even use it 'cause I didn't have USBs, it was so, you know.

601
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,389
Speaker 0: - Ah, I remember when USB came out, I feel old.

602
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,889
Speaker 1: - That's how awesome this mouse was.

603
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,750
Speaker 1: It was like a USB ball mouse, it was the total hotness.

604
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,570
Speaker 1: And it was only like 40 bucks and it came with free games, free games I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

605
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,430
Speaker 1: that I now greatly enjoy.

606
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,970
Speaker 0: - Actually, you know what, if you're gonna talk about that mouse, I gotta talk about my keyboard.

607
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,709
Speaker 1: - I'll talk about my keyboard.

608
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,950
Speaker 0: - All right, so I had this keyboard.

609
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:40,209
Speaker 0: It's the keyboard that came with the Pentium 200 that I got way, way back.

610
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:50,488
Speaker 0: And basically, over the years, I wrote things on it because I played a lot of, even back when I had the Pentium 200, I played a lot of Quake 2 online and I played a lot of Weapons Factory and that sort of thing.

611
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:56,030
Speaker 0: So I had key bindings and I had just basically notes and things written all over this keyboard.

612
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,688
Speaker 0: Like, the keyboard just looked like a giant mess, but I knew where everything was and some keys were rubbed off and I'd written other things on 'em.

613
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,729
Speaker 0: And it was full of filth, you know, years and years of filth.

614
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:17,269
Speaker 0: I used that keyboard all the way through middle school, all the way through high school, and then for three years at RIT, until finally one day, I was playing Counter-Strike and it just stopped working.

615
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:18,322
Speaker 1: - Ah.

616
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,450
Speaker 0: - And when I tipped it over, I took it apart just to see.

617
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:25,990
Speaker 0: The level of filth in there was abominable.

618
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,190
Speaker 1: - Yeah, monitors are like the filth in keyboards are like the filthiest-- - Monitors, eh?

619
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,070
Speaker 1: - Yeah, keyboards are like the filthiest things in the universe.

620
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:33,594
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

621
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:34,287
Speaker 1: - Everyone knows it.

622
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:42,369
Speaker 0: - I mean, seriously, if you did a culture of the inside of your keyboard versus, say, the edge of your toilet, the keyboard probably has more dangerous things in it.

623
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,850
Speaker 1: - Yep, it's very likely.

624
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:52,129
Speaker 1: I mean, your hands touch all sorts of shit and then they touch your keyboard a lot of times and they rest on there and shit builds up and no one cleans it.

625
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,390
Speaker 0: - Now, a lot of people say, yeah, clean your keyboard out every couple months.

626
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:55,947
Speaker 0: You know what?

627
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,330
Speaker 0: Buy a new keyboard.

628
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,310
Speaker 0: - Yeah, if-- - Unless you have a special keyboard like the Optimus.

629
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,348
Speaker 1: - Yeah, oh, the Optimus, whoa.

630
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:07,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I clean my keyboards, I shake it out and then I clean off the keys and stuff.

631
00:38:08,595 --> 00:38:10,710
Speaker 1: I heard that some keyboards can be cleaned into the dishwasher.

632
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,750
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the old IBM AT keyboards.

633
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,568
Speaker 1: new ones also.

634
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:23,549
Speaker 0: - I have a pile of like 300 of 'em where I work and in addition, back when we were at RIT, RIT threw out a frickin' dumpster full of 'em and we scavenged all of 'em.

635
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,750
Speaker 0: - Yep, and I even had one of those-- - We then threw them away a year later when we realized we had no use for them at all.

636
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,670
Speaker 1: - I even had one of those left over from high school, an IBM AT keyboard.

637
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,810
Speaker 0: - The problem is they're real clacky.

638
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,648
Speaker 0: They're too loud.

639
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,129
Speaker 1: - Well, I like the clackiness for me, but when other people are clacking, I just wanna kill them.

640
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:44,570
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you always yell at me that I type too loud on my basically silent keyboard.

641
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:51,349
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like, I don't mind if I click away and it's like frickin' thunder and lightning when I click, but when other people are clacking, I gotta stab 'em.

642
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,810
Speaker 1: So anyway, my keyboard, actually this is a recent favorite.

643
00:38:56,651 --> 00:39:02,070
Speaker 1: I used to use just normal Logitech whatever keyboards and I liked it a lot with all them extra buttons and stuff.

644
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,840
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the standard 104 key.

645
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:11,830
Speaker 1: - Now, I got a job and they said they would buy me whatever I wanted, so I could've asked for a brand new laptop and stuff, but I didn't.

646
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,109
Speaker 1: I took the laptop they had.

647
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:18,588
Speaker 1: So I figured I'm gonna ask for at least one thing 'cause they seem really, really eager to give me whatever I asked for.

648
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,810
Speaker 1: So I asked for something I'd thought about getting, the happy hacking keyboard.

649
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:29,949
Speaker 1: The happy hacking keyboard is a very small keyboard, but it has every key you need, but some of the keys are in different places.

650
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:33,150
Speaker 1: Like caps lock is not there.

651
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,610
Speaker 1: In order to get, instead of caps lock, there's control.

652
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,710
Speaker 1: And control is not where it would normally be.

653
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,148
Speaker 1: The only control is where caps lock used to be.

654
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:44,199
Speaker 1: And there's no F1, F2, F3, there's an F button.

655
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:47,590
Speaker 1: There's two F buttons actually.

656
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:52,348
Speaker 1: And if you wanna do F1, you push the F button and then you push one at the same time.

657
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,689
Speaker 1: And for most people, this is completely useless and you'll just wanna kill yourself.

658
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:04,070
Speaker 1: But if you're the type of person like me who writes a lot of software and codes a lot, this thing is fantastic.

659
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,847
Speaker 1: Like I couldn't live without it.

660
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,469
Speaker 1: now if you're getting used to it, holy crap.

661
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,650
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the only drawback is if you're a gamer.

662
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,969
Speaker 1: - If you're a gamer, you can live with WASD.

663
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,950
Speaker 0: - I don't like WASD at all.

664
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:18,368
Speaker 0: I could talk, we should do a show on the way we use keyboards and FPS.

665
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,930
Speaker 1: - We should, but if you're gonna use WASD or something like that, this keyboard's fine.

666
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,326
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna do anything else--.

667
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:35,210
Speaker 0: - If you use period comma space bar or you use the keypad or you use the arrow keys-- - You can use period comma space bar on this thing, just fine.

668
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,749
Speaker 0: - Nah, not the way I use 'em.

669
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:39,630
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell's wrong with you, but yeah, it doesn't have a numpad.

670
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,669
Speaker 1: There is no numpad.

671
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,249
Speaker 1: I had to buy a separate numpad because yeah, it doesn't have one.

672
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,050
Speaker 0: - Of course your numpad is also a calculator.

673
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,869
Speaker 1: - My numpad's also a calculator and a thermometer and some other things.

674
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,130
Speaker 0: - Is it a phlebotomist?

675
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:51,887
Speaker 1: - No.

676
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,049
Speaker 0: - All right then.

677
00:40:53,730 --> 00:41:00,350
Speaker 1: - But yeah, I have a numpad and the other cool thing about the Happy Hacking Keyboard is it's a USB hub.

678
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:05,869
Speaker 1: So you plug it into a USB hole on your computer and then you can plug two USB devices into it.

679
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:14,710
Speaker 1: And as long as those aren't USB devices that require a lot of electricity, like a USB fan or an iPod, it'll work just fine.

680
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:18,410
Speaker 1: Like I plug my thumb drive in there all the time.

681
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:18,989
Speaker 1: It works great.

682
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:19,889
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

683
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,969
Speaker 0: - So we've talked for a while.

684
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:30,350
Speaker 0: Let's wrap this up with a, Scott, let's both name the piece of hardware we currently own that is just the best, favorite, most useful whatever.

685
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,902
Speaker 1: Top of the list right now.

686
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,187
Speaker 0: - Right now?

687
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,008
Speaker 0: - Right now.

688
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,289
Speaker 1: - Oh man.

689
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,390
Speaker 0: - Any kind of hardware, which I realize is a difficult question.

690
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:44,030
Speaker 0: as I stare at the compressor and mixer in front of me and then I look at my computer, then I see my Nintendo DS and my cell phone.

691
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,348
Speaker 1: - Right now of all the stuff that I own, it can't be something I don't own?

692
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,049
Speaker 0: - No, it has to be something we own.

693
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,070
Speaker 1: - Something I own.

694
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,690
Speaker 0: - I'm not gonna use my computer because I can access a computer at work.

695
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,930
Speaker 0: I can use anything for a computer.

696
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,049
Speaker 0: The computer is old and not special in any way.

697
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,110
Speaker 0: I need my cell phone, but I could buy another.

698
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,088
Speaker 0: Any cell phone would do.

699
00:42:01,391 --> 00:42:02,790
Speaker 0: I took the cheap free one from Sprint.

700
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,030
Speaker 1: - Oh, I have an iPod.

701
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,549
Speaker 1: I have so much good stuff.

702
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:06,816
Speaker 0: What is it?

703
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:07,550
Speaker 0: - What would it be?

704
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:11,388
Speaker 0: You know, I'm gonna have to go with my DS.

705
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,208
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the DS is real good.

706
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,189
Speaker 1: The computer's real good.

707
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:20,449
Speaker 1: The headphones are real good.

708
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,490
Speaker 0: - Oh, those isolation headphones?

709
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:24,330
Speaker 1: - Yeah, they're real good.

710
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:25,989
Speaker 0: - Well, take your turn.

711
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,250
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna sit here recording silence all night.

712
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,400
Speaker 0: - I made my decision.

713
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,560
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I don't wanna say DS also.

714
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,126
Speaker 0: - Just say the DS.

715
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,128
Speaker 0: You know you want to.

716
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,889
Speaker 1: - It's good.

717
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:54,650
Speaker 1: The DS and the iPod are pretty equal.

718
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:58,770
Speaker 0: - All right, I can see that, especially since you have a hour commute in the car.

719
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,629
Speaker 1: - Oh, dude, the car.

720
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:04,210
Speaker 1: The car.

721
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,970
Speaker 0: - Yeah, your brand new Mazda 3?

722
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,908
Speaker 1: - Yeah, only 'cause it's brand new.

723
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,709
Speaker 1: But hopefully it will last me more than 10 years.

724
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,229
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it should, it should.

725
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,590
Speaker 1: Unless you-- - I'm gonna make it last 20 years if I can.

726
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,240
Speaker 0: - Well, I'm pushing 100,000 miles on my Sunfire.

727
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,299
Speaker 1: - My goal, 500,000 miles.

728
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:21,470
Speaker 1: It's my goal.

729
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,870
Speaker 0: - Yeah, maybe we didn't live in the salty north.

730
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,530
Speaker 1: - Yeah, damn salty north.

731
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,580
Speaker 0: - And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

732
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,219
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

739
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,040
Speaker 1: - Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

740
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:09,960
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
