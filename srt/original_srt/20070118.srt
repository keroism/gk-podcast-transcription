1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,859
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, January 18th.

2
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:13,203
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,106
Speaker 1: And I'm Rin.

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,170
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,900
Speaker 1: Tonight we discuss snooze.

6
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:18,704
Speaker 1: Snow.

7
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:19,610
Speaker 1: Snow.

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:22,764
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,370
Speaker 0: Well, as I was reminded last night, because I actually forgot, as I've forgotten in the past, tonight's actually my birthday.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,055
Speaker 1: Congratulations.

11
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:33,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

12
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,650
Speaker 1: An arbitrary time has passed.

13
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:40,770
Speaker 0: I have survived for another year in an arbitrary time scale that involves planets.

14
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:57,104
Speaker 1: Yes, the sphere upon which we live has traveled its entire orbit a round number of times about, well, I mean, it'll, for like a nanosecond, you know, the smallest unit, if there is a smallest unit of time, that was true.

15
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,650
Speaker 1: Now it has passed.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,677
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, I don't remember, well, obviously I don't remember, but I don't know when I was born during the day, so it could be any time.

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,490
Speaker 1: I think I was born like two in the morning.

18
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,212
Speaker 1: I don't really remember.

19
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:10,184
Speaker 0: See, I think that too, but I might just be totally making that up.

20
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:10,766
Speaker 0: Yeah.

21
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:11,650
Speaker 0: I'm really, I don't know.

22
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:13,478
Speaker 1: But yeah.

23
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,073
Speaker 1: You could still be 24, possibly.

24
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,383
Speaker 0: But at least this year, I didn't totally forget.

25
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:24,989
Speaker 0: It was like, it came up what day it was, then I was like, "Oh, yeah, my birthday's in an

26
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:25,250
Speaker 0: hour.".

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,215
Speaker 1: Huh.

28
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,930
Speaker 0: I think it was two years ago, might have been three years ago.

29
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:32,690
Speaker 0: I completely forgot it was my birthday.

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,090
Speaker 0: I absolutely had no idea, and then eventually I forget who it was, but someone wished me a happy birthday.

31
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,334
Speaker 0: And I was like, "It's not my

32
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:39,796
Speaker 0: birthday.".

33
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:43,710
Speaker 0: And then someone else convinced me it was my birthday, and I thought about it.

34
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:44,854
Speaker 0: "Wait, Jenny?

35
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, hot

36
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:46,405
Speaker 0: dad.".

37
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:47,230
Speaker 1: Yep.

38
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just don't really pay attention to birthdays around here.

39
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:51,986
Speaker 0: Birthdays are- No, we used to.

40
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:52,689
Speaker 0: Remember at RIT?

41
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,599
Speaker 1: Other people really paid attention to them for us.

42
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:56,122
Speaker 1: Yeah.

43
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,110
Speaker 1: It was like we were getting pushed into it by others.

44
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:08,225
Speaker 0: See, we have two general traditions around birthdays that pretty much died as we left RIT, just because we're not around each other every waking moment of every single day.

45
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:08,910
Speaker 1: Birthday punches.

46
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that wasn't all.

47
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:15,356
Speaker 0: That was mostly just Kate coming and punching us, regardless of whether or not it was our birthday.

48
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:15,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

49
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,090
Speaker 0: But no, we had one tradition among a small number of us.

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,150
Speaker 0: I think it was Peter who started it, where on your birthday, you had to buy a steak dinner for everyone else.

51
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:25,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that was a tradition.

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,260
Speaker 1: I think that was just people did it because, like I remember on my birthday, I took everyone to the Outback because it was my birthday.

53
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,658
Speaker 1: My mom decided to pay for everyone to go to the Outback, so I took as many people as I could.

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,650
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a- Oh, yeah, it wasn't the whole crew.

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,650
Speaker 0: It was pretty much just a few of us who did that, and we did it semi-regularly, if we remembered birthdays, for about two and a half years.

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,055
Speaker 1: I guess that's about right.

57
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,305
Speaker 0: It was almost your tradition, and then we moved away.

58
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:49,928
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,727
Speaker 0: That, and we always tended to get cakes, which ended in the archangel, dark angel debacle that I won't get into.

60
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:57,289
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,482
Speaker 0: I still, to this day, do not know how that happened.

62
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:01,306
Speaker 1: I remember that now.

63
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,010
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

64
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,109
Speaker 1: I can't believe I forgot it.

65
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,418
Speaker 0: I was thinking about it the other day, in fact, because I was talking on the phone when Emily reminded me it was my birthday, so I started telling- Ear?

66
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:09,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, ear.

67
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:15,990
Speaker 0: I started telling birthday stories, which, of course, the ultimate birthday story is the story of the ear on the cake.

68
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,989
Speaker 1: I totally forgot about that, but now it all came back to me in like a rush.

69
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,949
Speaker 0: How that ear appeared on that cake, man will never know.

70
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:23,672
Speaker 1: No.

71
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:27,550
Speaker 0: There's no way to track down the person who put it there and ask them why they did that.

72
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,910
Speaker 1: It's a great mystery of the universe.

73
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,978
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll actually tell the story someday.

74
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,283
Speaker 1: Maybe we will.

75
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,390
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's as good as the blow-dryer story.

76
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,270
Speaker 1: I haven't heard the blow-dryer story because I haven't listened to Penn in God knows how long.

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:48,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there is more important news, aside from it being my birthday and me being exactly, give or take, up to 12 or so hours, a quarter century old.

78
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

79
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,274
Speaker 0: A third of my life is gone.

80
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,708
Speaker 0: Maybe a quarter if technology stays up and I'm as healthy as I think I am.

81
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,569
Speaker 0: But, uh, it snowed today for the first time.

82
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,152
Speaker 0: Ever?

83
00:03:59,172 --> 00:03:59,252
Speaker 0: Yeah.

84
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,339
Speaker 1: How did we have a word for it?

85
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,165
Speaker 0: I made the word up just now.

86
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:03,988
Speaker 0: Now, it snowed.

87
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,650
Speaker 1: All right, so everybody, that white stuff that you see falling from the sky, we're gonna call it- Snew.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,647
Speaker 1: I can't bel- What's snew with you?

89
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,789
Speaker 0: Do you even know the origin of snew?

90
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,861
Speaker 1: It's a joke from Kermit the Frog on that commercial with Fozzie.

91
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,688
Speaker 0: No, it came from way before then.

92
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,310
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

93
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz that was the best.

94
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,548
Speaker 1: It was like he had those barrels and Kermit was like, "What's

95
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:28,829
Speaker 1: snew?".

96
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,632
Speaker 1: He's like, "Snew?

97
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:29,994
Speaker 1: What's

98
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:30,234
Speaker 1: snew?"

99
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,423
Speaker 1: and Fozzie goes, "What's snew with you?

100
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:33,105
Speaker 1: Oh,

101
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:34,229
Speaker 1: zing!".

102
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,049
Speaker 0: Now there's a much older snew.

103
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:46,100
Speaker 0: In fact, if any of our listeners can bring up that older reference to snew, which specifically refers to- The show knows what snew is.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,825
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

105
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:47,249
Speaker 1: I don't.

106
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:49,270
Speaker 1: And uh- I don't need to remember his Fozzie bear.

107
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,201
Speaker 0: You won't win anything.

108
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:50,910
Speaker 1: Okay.

109
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,583
Speaker 0: They're like, "He'll win fuck

110
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:54,107
Speaker 0: all!".

111
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:56,089
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's a good prize.

112
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,659
Speaker 0: But yeah, it hadn't snowed yet this year.

113
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,190
Speaker 0: In fact, it had barely frosted yet this year.

114
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,304
Speaker 0: I have been wearing t-shirts outside up until about two days ago.

115
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:10,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah, two days ago it got cold and I was like, "Ooh, it's cold now.

116
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,888
Speaker 1: I have to wear like a coat and I wish I had a

117
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:12,129
Speaker 1: hat.".

118
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it wasn't bitterly cold.

119
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,105
Speaker 0: It was hovering around freezing.

120
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,070
Speaker 1: It wasn't really below freezing.

121
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't shivering outside in my coat, but walking out to the car I was just thinking, "Woman, it is

122
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:22,581
Speaker 1: cold.".

123
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,690
Speaker 1: And, you know, there was frost on the car.

124
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,316
Speaker 1: I had to defrost it a little bit, warm it up.

125
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:29,066
Speaker 1: You could see the exhaust coming out of cars.

126
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:33,390
Speaker 1: It was cold, but it wasn't like Rochester cold.

127
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:33,774
Speaker 0: God.

128
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,383
Speaker 0: See, maybe it's just because I grew up in Michigan that- I mean, cold is cold.

129
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,050
Speaker 0: And if it's below freezing, it's cold.

130
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:44,847
Speaker 0: But it's not that special kind of cold unless it's below zero Fahrenheit.

131
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:45,710
Speaker 1: That's right.

132
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,599
Speaker 0: That's the moment where I go outside and go,

133
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,041
Speaker 0: "Fuck!"

134
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,810
Speaker 0: And you turn around and go back inside.

135
00:05:49,990 --> 00:06:00,828
Speaker 0: No, you end up doing that Rochester shuffle where you're walking as fast as you can, but you're holding your body perfectly rigid hoping that no amount of air will in any way enter your clothing.

136
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,290
Speaker 1: Yep.

137
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,050
Speaker 1: I pull that string at the bottom of my coat in to keep the air from going up into my business.

138
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,542
Speaker 0: But no, my news is that it snowed and I live in a state where it snows.

139
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:18,505
Speaker 0: It snows pretty much, barring catastrophe, every year in New York State, both upstate and downstate.

140
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,250
Speaker 0: It snows here every year.

141
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,229
Speaker 0: You'd think after the previous thousands and thousands of years of it snowing.

142
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:25,992
Speaker 0: You know what?

143
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:26,757
Speaker 0: I'll even go closer.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,478
Speaker 0: Since the invention of the automobile, except for that first winter, people knew it was coming.

145
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,204
Speaker 0: You knew it was gonna snow.

146
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:39,600
Speaker 0: You knew that your car might spin out or somehow lose traction in snow.

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,430
Speaker 0: You know exactly what snow is going to do when it's on a road.

148
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,244
Speaker 0: You'd think after that first winter we would have this down.

149
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:48,590
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be an issue anymore.

150
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,357
Speaker 0: But no, it snows today.

151
00:06:50,377 --> 00:07:02,885
Speaker 0: And not only did I pass five or six major, major freaking accidents with dead people laying in the street, but one of the accidents that I passed, there were about no exaggerations.

152
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,750
Speaker 0: I'll tend to exaggerate stories.

153
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:11,757
Speaker 0: There were exactly 16 police cars that I could see and more than six ambulances.

154
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,790
Speaker 0: There were at least 20 cars involved in this accident.

155
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,550
Speaker 0: There was debris everywhere, and I'm pretty sure I saw body bags.

156
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:19,671
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:27,650
Speaker 0: Now, I would have understood this if there had actually been any significant amount of snow on the ground, but the roads were just fine.

158
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:36,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I, driving home, I drive half the way home on a freeway and half, well, an interstate, and half the way home on this country road.

159
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:37,805
Speaker 1: that kind of sucks.

160
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:47,715
Speaker 1: And on the country road, there was one part that was slippery going down an incredibly steep hill, and my anti-lock brakes made it nothing.

161
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,465
Speaker 1: So, and they didn't even engage the rest of the way home.

162
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:51,610
Speaker 1: I just kind of coasted home.

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,284
Speaker 0: I probably would have just, as I crested the hill, downshifted.

164
00:07:56,786 --> 00:08:00,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, either way, I'm just saying, I had no problems going home at all.

165
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,340
Speaker 0: It seems to me that people, when it comes to snow, when they're driving, can't take a rational, middle-of-the-ground approach.

166
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:18,269
Speaker 0: It seems like everyone out there either goes faster for some reason, just as fast as they can possibly go, tailgating me, or they go five miles an hour.

167
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:24,027
Speaker 1: It's like people are either driving, you know, they're like, "Oh, it's safe to drive," and they drive fast.

168
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,797
Speaker 1: Or they go, "Oh, it's dangerous," and they drive too slow.

169
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,900
Speaker 0: It's like, what the fuck?

170
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:31,634
Speaker 0: I mean, first, I pass all these horrible accidents, and now I'm just on the taconic.

171
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,361
Speaker 0: I'm going about 50.

172
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,370
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm not speeding, the road is fine.

173
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,852
Speaker 0: Absolutely fine.

174
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,378
Speaker 0: It's just snowing a little bit.

175
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,549
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm not speeding is because there's cops everywhere.

176
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,888
Speaker 1: The road was worse when it was raining a week ago when there was fog.

177
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,170
Speaker 1: Yeah.

178
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:49,330
Speaker 0: So, eventually, traffic slows down in the traffic wave pattern.

179
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,790
Speaker 0: So I get in the right lane, because everyone ahead of me seems to be getting in the right lane, and everyone seems to be slowing down a lot.

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,520
Speaker 0: So I figure, all right, there's trouble ahead.

181
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,010
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna, you know, do the smart thing.

182
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,622
Speaker 0: So five minutes later, I just kind of zoned out listening to movies.

183
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,124
Speaker 0: you should see.

184
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,650
Speaker 0: I'm catching up on the archives.

185
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,749
Speaker 0: I actually finally listened to the episode where we reviewed Attack the Gas Station on their show.

186
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,753
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

187
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,250
Speaker 1: See, I listened to the ones where we were on their show a long time ago.

188
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,481
Speaker 1: Their episodes were not on the show that I had.

189
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,010
Speaker 0: I gotta say, that was a long time ago.

190
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,298
Speaker 0: We didn't do a very good review.

191
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:18,900
Speaker 1: No, we didn't.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,124
Speaker 0: We just kind of gushed.

193
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:21,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

194
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,404
Speaker 1: We did the same thing for our City of God review also.

195
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,058
Speaker 0: If they ever ask us to do it again, let's give them a real review.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,447
Speaker 1: We'll have to prepare.

197
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:29,970
Speaker 1: That sucks.

198
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,384
Speaker 0: No, I think we just have to avoid saying things like, "This is without a doubt the greatest achievement in the history of

199
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:35,825
Speaker 0: cinema."

200
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:40,342
Speaker 0: Which we said more than once about Attack the Gas Station.

201
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,250
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't lie at least.

202
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, so after about five minutes of this, I hit pause, and I think, "All right.

203
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,990
Speaker 0: I've been going 30 miles an hour for five minutes in a line of cars in the right lane.

204
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,453
Speaker 0: The left lane is empty.

205
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,201
Speaker 0: I'm going to go for

206
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:56,341
Speaker 0: it.".

207
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,330
Speaker 0: So I pull into the left lane, and I accelerate back.

208
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,813
Speaker 1: That's a big risk.

209
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,342
Speaker 1: What if the left lane is closed ahead?

210
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:02,570
Speaker 1: Now you're going to look like an ass.

211
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I drive a lot.

212
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:06,661
Speaker 0: I've driven this road a lot.

213
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,690
Speaker 0: I drive hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles every single week.

214
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,580
Speaker 0: So I think I've made a calculated risk here, and I start going.

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,222
Speaker 0: I accelerate to 50.

216
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:16,971
Speaker 0: I accelerate to 60.

217
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:18,600
Speaker 0: I accelerate to 70.

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,270
Speaker 0: I pass hundreds of cars.

219
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,170
Speaker 0: Eventually, I get to the front, and there's no traffic anywhere.

220
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:36,970
Speaker 0: These people are just so paranoid about this zero inches of snow and this light dusting that is slowly falling from the sky and quickly melting on the salt that they're driving 30 in the right lane of the Taconic during rush hour.

221
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,070
Speaker 1: Don't they usually drive 90 in the left lane?

222
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually got home faster because of the snow because everyone got the hell out of my way and went to 30 miles an hour.

223
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:46,470
Speaker 0: Awesome.

224
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:47,775
Speaker 0: I don't know.

225
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:49,262
Speaker 0: I couldn't fathom it.

226
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:50,610
Speaker 0: I just kind of drove.

227
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,010
Speaker 1: Maybe there was an accident, but you just waited so long while listening to movies.

228
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,804
Speaker 1: You should see that when you got up there, the accident was cleared out.

229
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,050
Speaker 1: You got there just at the perfect time.

230
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,290
Speaker 1: The last police car was pulling away as you got there.

231
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:11,050
Speaker 0: The thing is, I drove for a long time, and no one was in the left lane anywhere in that entire time, including all the way behind me, and no one thought to follow me.

232
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,550
Speaker 1: My guess is that a lot of the people who were in the left lane assumed that there was an accident up ahead.

233
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,654
Speaker 0: Well, no.

234
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:24,930
Speaker 0: What I think it was, because there's a bunch of somewhat sharp corners around there, while there was no snow on the ground and traction was just fine.

235
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,247
Speaker 0: In fact, I tested my traction by braking carefully around corners to see if I would start to lose control, and I didn't.

236
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,050
Speaker 0: It was fine.

237
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,922
Speaker 0: But because of the wind, it looked like there was a slick surface.

238
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:37,030
Speaker 0: It looked like there was a lot of snow on the ground, but it wasn't.

239
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,629
Speaker 0: It was just kind of swirling in the corners.

240
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,790
Speaker 0: I think people were just afraid of having an accident, especially after having passed three fatal accidents just before that.

241
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was a combination.

242
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,370
Speaker 0: Of course, the best part is there was one accident blocking my area of traffic, not from the accident.

243
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:02,795
Speaker 0: The accident was in the southbound lanes, but the car, which had crashed all by itself due to stupidity, had crashed into the guardrail.

244
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:09,077
Speaker 0: Various bits of large debris had continued through the guardrail and blocked my side of the road.

245
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,250
Speaker 0: There was a hood laying there and a fender.

246
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,859
Speaker 1: Going pretty fast, wasn't he?

247
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,350
Speaker 1: His hood flew off.

248
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:17,770
Speaker 0: I don't know what he was doing.

249
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:27,710
Speaker 1: I didn't even see an accident on the way home, but as soon as I got on the interstate, there was a short, about a half mile of slow traffic in both lanes.

250
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:30,578
Speaker 1: An ambulance got on the highway.

251
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:39,037
Speaker 1: It merged right into where I was sitting, so I just kind of stopped in the middle of the highway until the ambulance went away, down the highway in front of me.

252
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,927
Speaker 1: I assumed, oh, there's an accident up ahead.

253
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,413
Speaker 1: That ambulance is going to it, right?

254
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:48,215
Speaker 1: Then eventually, I'm going down about a half mile, then traffic picks up again, and I'm on my way home.

255
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:54,360
Speaker 1: Then eventually, I get to one of those cross-the-highway bits, and the ambulance is going to the other side of the road.

256
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,510
Speaker 1: It was somewhere way behind me.

257
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,614
Speaker 1: I wasn't even close to it.

258
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:05,790
Speaker 0: Actually, one, you have to give right away, obviously, and you should give right away, but you don't have to stop for an ambulance on the freeway.

259
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:11,149
Speaker 1: I was at this merge, and there was no way it was getting on unless I let it.

260
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,410
Speaker 1: If I wanted to, I could have held the ambulance there and not let it go anywhere.

261
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,911
Speaker 0: A few months ago, I was driving up the Bronx River Parkway, and there was an accident somewhere up ahead.

262
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,910
Speaker 0: I'm in three lanes of traffic, completely balled up, stopped for like 10 minutes.

263
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,889
Speaker 0: Eventually, I see a commotion way back, so I just get out of my car and look.

264
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:32,865
Speaker 0: There's an ambulance trying to get to the scene of the accident, furiously.

265
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:43,109
Speaker 0: The ambulance driver is obviously very pissed off and fervently trying to get through this crowd of cars, and all the cars in front of it are just sitting there like, "Where do you want me to go?

266
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,535
Speaker 0: There's nowhere to move my car.

267
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:48,245
Speaker 0: There is no way we can let you through.

268
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,510
Speaker 0: What were you thinking?

269
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,308
Speaker 0: Whoever you're coming to save is already

270
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:51,510
Speaker 0: dead.".

271
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,959
Speaker 1: The road is too narrow and full of cars.

272
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,063
Speaker 1: That's it.

273
00:13:56,645 --> 00:14:00,990
Speaker 1: If you're an ambulance guy, you should grab your little medical first aid kit and run.

274
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:02,926
Speaker 1: That's what you should do.

275
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,055
Speaker 1: I got a news here.

276
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 1: It said the headline is MySpace to Offer Spyware for Parents.

277
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,550
Speaker 1: Now, you read that headline and you think, "All right, what is MySpace going to do?

278
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:28,310
Speaker 1: They're going to give a program that even the stupidest parents can install that will let them see everything their kid is doing on MySpace, even the private stuff and everything, to make sure their kids aren't doing any nasties, right?

279
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:33,408
Speaker 0: The first thing I thought was, "How can I gain the system in installing this for one of my

280
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:33,869
Speaker 0: friends?".

281
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:34,694
Speaker 1: Exactly.

282
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,490
Speaker 1: However, that's not what they're doing.

283
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,270
Speaker 0: What are they doing?

284
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:48,330
Speaker 1: Parents who install the monitoring software on their home computers will be able to find out name, age, and location their children are using to represent themselves on MySpace.

285
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:50,288
Speaker 1: That's it.

286
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,190
Speaker 0: Can't you just look at their MySpace?

287
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:57,350
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

288
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,489
Speaker 0: Does this cost money?

289
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:00,028
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

290
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,076
Speaker 0: I hope it costs money.

291
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,250
Speaker 0: I hope this costs money, because that is a direct...

292
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:14,529
Speaker 1: It's like, in order for this to work, you'd have to know your kid's MySpace username anyway, to type it in, to know what... The software has to figure out who to look for.

293
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,090
Speaker 1: Maybe it could root through your cookies or something, but I doubt that highly.

294
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,170
Speaker 1: This makes no sense.

295
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:36,270
Speaker 1: It's basically, MySpace is doing nothing at all, and stupid parents see this nothing as if it's a move to help them out and make MySpace safer when it's actually nothing.

296
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:37,668
Speaker 0: I'll bet I know what this is.

297
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:46,140
Speaker 1: These stupid experts, all these expert people, they're like, "Ah, now the kids are gonna run away from MySpace because the parents can watch them on it.

298
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,497
Speaker 1: They're gonna start using something else because kids are all fickle.

299
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:53,571
Speaker 1: They'll just go to a different social network as soon as one starts to

300
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:53,872
Speaker 1: suck.".

301
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,423
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Dude, MySpace already sucks the most.

302
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,473
Speaker 1: It doesn't get much worse than MySpace.

303
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,027
Speaker 1: Anyone who hasn't pleaded already isn't

304
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:03,309
Speaker 1: gonna.".

305
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,310
Speaker 0: I think I know exactly what MySpace is doing.

306
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:14,855
Speaker 0: By doing this, they can now say that, "We have implemented measures to protect children from predators.

307
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:19,234
Speaker 0: It is now the parents' responsibility to make use of this tool that we have provided.

308
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:20,459
Speaker 0: You have no excuse.

309
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,543
Speaker 0: You can't sue us.

310
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:22,989
Speaker 0: Nah nah nah nah nah nah.

311
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:24,583
Speaker 0: Nah nah nah nah nah.

312
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:25,129
Speaker 0: Goodbye.".

313
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,579
Speaker 1: Well, kind of what it says here is a group of 33 state attorneys led by Connecticut's attorney, Blumenthal.

314
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,486
Speaker 1: That guy's not so great.

315
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:32,869
Speaker 1: I know him.

316
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:34,892
Speaker 0: Who are the other 33?

317
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,450
Speaker 1: Other state attorneys general.

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:36,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

319
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:37,582
Speaker 0: Which states?

320
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,130
Speaker 0: Does it say?

321
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,574
Speaker 1: No.

322
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,330
Speaker 0: Because I want to know so we can tell people not to ever vote for them again.

323
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:42,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

324
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:51,171
Speaker 1: They're thinking about taking legal action against MySpace if it doesn't raise the age limit to join the site to 16 from the current 14.

325
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,890
Speaker 0: But the law says 14.

326
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:52,977
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:16:54,932 --> 00:17:01,695
Speaker 0: Not to use such low language, but this is a phrase that I think applies perfectly and should be the response of MySpace.

328
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 0: Eat a dick.

329
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:04,750
Speaker 0: Eat a dick.

330
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,011
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:14,650
Speaker 1: It also says that they want MySpace to verify members' ages against public databases.

332
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,550
Speaker 1: What?

333
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,638
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

334
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,230
Speaker 0: I don't think anything needs to be said about that.

335
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,470
Speaker 1: The answer is lawyers do not understand technology, and MySpace has done a double whammy.

336
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:33,196
Speaker 1: These lawyers who don't understand technology causing MySpace some trouble because they don't understand technology.

337
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,522
Speaker 1: So what does MySpace do?

338
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:35,266
Speaker 1: They go, "Hey, wait.

339
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,998
Speaker 1: These guys are giving us trouble because they don't understand technology.

340
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:42,758
Speaker 1: Let's take advantage of the fact that they don't understand technology, and let's do

341
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,642
Speaker 1: nothing.".

342
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:48,909
Speaker 1: And because they don't understand technology, they'll think we did something, and they'll leave us alone.

343
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,687
Speaker 1: It's brilliant.

344
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:51,833
Speaker 1: It's brilliant.

345
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,039
Speaker 1: It's, "Hey, look.

346
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,948
Speaker 1: These dumbasses are causing us trouble because they're

347
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:55,430
Speaker 1: dumbasses.".

348
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,181
Speaker 1: Well, since they're dumbasses, it's not easy.

349
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:00,653
Speaker 1: It's not too hard to fool them into going the fuck away.

350
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,229
Speaker 1: And it looks like what's going to happen to me.

351
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,305
Speaker 0: I think so.

352
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,392
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

353
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:10,921
Speaker 1: Anyone who saw this headline and didn't actually read the story, MySpace is doing nothing.

354
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:17,370
Speaker 1: See, now- They're not giving your parents spyware to check your emails or anything.

355
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,274
Speaker 0: This is actually one of the main reasons why I'm more and more seriously considering going to law school.

356
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:30,349
Speaker 0: I'd probably be maybe one of, I don't know, 10 lawyers in the world who knows something about technology.

357
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:31,849
Speaker 0: I don't know.

358
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,135
Speaker 0: I mean, I have a BS.

359
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:35,667
Speaker 0: I have a bachelor's of science in information technology.

360
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:36,270
Speaker 0: I'm an expert.

361
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,213
Speaker 0: I've worked in the industry.

362
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:41,409
Speaker 0: If I was also a lawyer, I think I could do some good.

363
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,010
Speaker 0: I think I could actually change something.

364
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:43,738
Speaker 1: Maybe.

365
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:44,410
Speaker 1: We'll see.

366
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,431
Speaker 0: We'll see.

367
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:53,901
Speaker 0: Also, I do find it interesting that Geek Nights has a lot of strange or somewhat counterintuitive target demographics.

368
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,650
Speaker 0: I mean, we're popular among Australians.

369
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,345
Speaker 1: Yep.

370
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,257
Speaker 0: Much more so than you'd think.

371
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,910
Speaker 1: We have a not insignificant number- Well, I think podcasting in general is pretty big in Australia more so than you would think.

372
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,869
Speaker 1: I don't know why, though.

373
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:07,350
Speaker 0: I'll bet it has to do with- Because I don't know enough about Australia.

374
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,050
Speaker 0: I'll bet some of it might have to do with access to other media.

375
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,030
Speaker 1: Perhaps.

376
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,650
Speaker 0: Because, you know, Australia always gets dicked when it comes to video games and DVDs.

377
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,773
Speaker 1: That's true.

378
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,925
Speaker 1: They do get stuff, but they do have Wii's there.

379
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:18,770
Speaker 1: They got Wii games.

380
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:20,568
Speaker 0: They don't get dicked as much as Europe does.

381
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:27,669
Speaker 1: I think their proximity to Japan helps them a little bit, but I don't think they have the greatest selection of German board games in Australia.

382
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:31,161
Speaker 1: I don't know.

383
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:31,548
Speaker 1: They might.

384
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,690
Speaker 1: They might, but I'm just guessing that they don't.

385
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:36,150
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is also very popular among atheists.

387
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:44,470
Speaker 0: And Geek Nights apparently is more popular than you might randomly assume among lawyers.

388
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,930
Speaker 0: A not insignificant number of the people active in our forums are lawyers.

389
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:53,170
Speaker 1: Which must mean that at least one person not active in our forums is also a lawyer.

390
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're a lawyer and you're listening to this- Oh, he says it's a safe assumption.

391
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,929
Speaker 0: Join the forums and there's other lawyers there.

392
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:00,893
Speaker 1: Gasp.

393
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,330
Speaker 1: Law-ing.

394
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,090
Speaker 0: Well, the mayor mays, the lawyer lois.

395
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:06,674
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

396
00:20:06,694 --> 00:20:07,689
Speaker 1: That's right.

397
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,620
Speaker 0: Things of the Day.

398
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,833
Speaker 1: Oh, I found this I think last night maybe.

399
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:21,920
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

400
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott had another thing of the day and we're just about to start recording the show.

401
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,796
Speaker 0: And I say, "Well, it's my

402
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:29,260
Speaker 0: birthday.".

403
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,647
Speaker 0: And then Scott says, "Oh, shits!

404
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,316
Speaker 0: I gotta use this other thing of the day.

405
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:32,617
Speaker 0: Start

406
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:32,838
Speaker 0: over.".

407
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:33,519
Speaker 1: Yep.

408
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,816
Speaker 0: Even though that had nothing to do with- That's right.

409
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:54,180
Speaker 1: As any real geek knows, if you were to watch Star Wars Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, if you were to watch the special edition, at the end, there's this big celebration where they show you all these cities around the galaxy and- And they play some jive music.

410
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,360
Speaker 1: And there's this jive song going on, right?

411
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,660
Speaker 1: Well, if you watch the original Star Wars Episode VI, Return of the Jedi, at the end, they don't show you cities around the galaxy.

412
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:07,400
Speaker 1: All they show you is the Ewoks celebrating.

413
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:10,339
Speaker 1: Everyone else who's celebrating, you don't see them.

414
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:13,080
Speaker 1: And during that, they don't play no jive music.

415
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,378
Speaker 1: They play the Ewok song.

416
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,292
Speaker 1: Yub nub.

417
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,428
Speaker 0: Okay, it's a pretty catchy song.

418
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,317
Speaker 1: And I like it.

419
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,638
Speaker 1: Even though a lot of people hate it, I like it.

420
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,500
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't play that song just now is that I don't want to get sued by George Lucas.

421
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,276
Speaker 1: Yeah.

422
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,680
Speaker 1: So, that is the song.

423
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,100
Speaker 1: Now, how could I turn that song into a thing of the day?

424
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,659
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just a song in a movie, you know, it's hard to-.

425
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,000
Speaker 0: Well, maybe if someone made a music video to that song.

426
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,800
Speaker 1: Ooh, that would be pretty good, but I don't know.

427
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Speaker 0: Maybe someone took the new Star Wars and put that music over it.

428
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that wouldn't be so good.

429
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,859
Speaker 0: That would just- Maybe if someone else performed that song, a cover, if you will.

430
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,780
Speaker 1: Well, it just so happens that this song has been performed by a mediocre barbershop quartet.

431
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:10,980
Speaker 0: Now, when he says barbershop quartet, he means it.

432
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,480
Speaker 0: When he says mediocre, he fucking means it.

433
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a video on YouTube of these four guys.

434
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,739
Speaker 1: That's what a quartet is, four guys.

435
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,639
Speaker 1: And they're a barbershop quartet.

436
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:26,400
Speaker 1: They're not a very good one, but they're better than no barbershop quartet at all, I guess.

437
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 0: I think they get an A for effort and an A for concept, but a D for execution.

438
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you look at them and you say, "Well, okay, that guy with that beard, he's such a nerd, oh

439
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:35,858
Speaker 1: god.".

440
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:37,958
Speaker 1: Those other guys, yeah, they're pretty nerdy too.

441
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,960
Speaker 1: And they sing Yub Nub, the Ewok celebration song.

442
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:46,400
Speaker 1: And they have some subtitles so you can see what they mean, what the Ewok words mean.

443
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:48,015
Speaker 1: What the fuck does Yub Nub mean?

444
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:48,339
Speaker 1: I don't know.

445
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:50,900
Speaker 1: The thing is, I don't know how they came up with these subtitles.

446
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,219
Speaker 1: They must have gotten it from some Star Wars fan site because Ewok is not a language that you can speak.

447
00:22:56,741 --> 00:23:02,640
Speaker 1: You can speak Klingon because nerds have figured out the whole language, but- Did George Lucas put out some official lyrics?

448
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,539
Speaker 1: I don't know, but you cannot speak Ewok.

449
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:13,360
Speaker 1: And a lot of times, I think they say like one word and then they say another word and both of those words translate to mean celebration.

450
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,059
Speaker 1: So, I don't know what fucks up with that.

451
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,200
Speaker 0: Well, obviously, they're different inflected tenses of the verb.

452
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:20,276
Speaker 1: It could be.

453
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,680
Speaker 1: I mean- It could be just a bad subtitle.

454
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,900
Speaker 1: It could be just a Hong Kong subtitling.

455
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:27,740
Speaker 1: I mean- We need to go get the legitimate region one DVD.

456
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,280
Speaker 0: Because we can speak hut just fire, beach of a wookiee Chewbacca.

457
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:32,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

458
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,259
Speaker 1: And I can speak Boba Fett real well too.

459
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:35,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

460
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:37,940
Speaker 0: Or even Jawa.

461
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,074
Speaker 1: I'm fluent, Boba Fett.

462
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:40,935
Speaker 1: Oh dee dee.

463
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:42,014
Speaker 1: Oh dee dee.

464
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,000
Speaker 1: But yeah, you cannot speak Ewok.

465
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,040
Speaker 1: That is not a fully fleshed out language.

466
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,600
Speaker 0: So, my thing of the day is very much related to the topic at hand and to my news.

467
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,759
Speaker 0: You see, all three of my things are in fact the same thing.

468
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,151
Speaker 1: Snow.

469
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,600
Speaker 1: Oh my god, is there a word for that when all three things match?

470
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,956
Speaker 0: Well, you see- A trifecta?

471
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,537
Speaker 0: The word used on Fark is trifecta, which apparently is a term from horse racing when a very specific thing happens.

472
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:12,902
Speaker 0: But on Fark, a trifecta is when three stories that are far too related to be normally statistically probable, like

473
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:13,483
Speaker 1: say

474
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:24,639
Speaker 0: there are two stories of fat people exploding, then people start posting in the end of the second one, "Man, if there's a trifecta of this, I'm buying a lottery

475
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:24,800
Speaker 0: ticket.".

476
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,618
Speaker 1: I would too.

477
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,918
Speaker 0: So I guess this is the first Geek Nights trifecta.

478
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,979
Speaker 0: Well, other than, I don't know, I guess every show is a geek trifecta.

479
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:32,858
Speaker 1: I guess so.

480
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,958
Speaker 0: Two of them in fact.

481
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:36,480
Speaker 1: All right, but yeah.

482
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:52,597
Speaker 0: I would never have used this as a thing of the day, and I'm using it only as a public service announcement and an educational bit to all of our listeners who do not live north of the Messier Line in the United States, because I don't think anyone else in the world does this.

483
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:59,539
Speaker 0: At least not to the extent that Americans do, to the point that we have a word for it, a commonly understood and known word.

484
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:04,640
Speaker 0: You see, a long time ago, I was hanging out with a friend of mine from down south.

485
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,540
Speaker 1: Not even that far down south.

486
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:07,600
Speaker 1: North Carolina.

487
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:08,679
Speaker 1: Not that far at all.

488
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,479
Speaker 1: Not that far south.

489
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,140
Speaker 0: And for somehow, the conversation of donuts came up, and this person was entirely utterly confused as to what I meant.

490
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,279
Speaker 1: They thought we were talking about Krispy Kremes and Dunkins.

491
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,920
Speaker 0: And they wondered how Krispy Kremes and Dunkin' Donuts had anything to do with snow and cars.

492
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,340
Speaker 0: What, do you get a warm donut and sit in the car while it's cold?

493
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,600
Speaker 0: Is it a euphemism for something?

494
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,560
Speaker 0: And I was flabbergasted.

495
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:42,420
Speaker 0: I think I realized at that point that there are a lot of people out there, especially people who don't live in pretty much New York State, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.

496
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it reminds me, one time I was at my grandparents' house in Florida, and I needed a haircut pretty badly.

497
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,619
Speaker 1: So I went to just whatever the closest place was that could give a haircut, and I got a cheap, shitty haircut.

498
00:25:54,222 --> 00:26:00,039
Speaker 1: But the person who cut my hair was like 40-something years old at the time, and this must have been years ago.

499
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,840
Speaker 1: So they must be 50-something now, right?

500
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:07,660
Speaker 1: And they said that they had never left Florida in their entire lives.

501
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:09,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:11,620
Speaker 0: I can't fathom that.

503
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,660
Speaker 1: No, I can't either.

504
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:13,919
Speaker 0: I mean...

505
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,600
Speaker 1: That have never left the state of Florida.

506
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,700
Speaker 0: My wanderlust is enough to get that.

507
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,319
Speaker 0: I would just die.

508
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,840
Speaker 1: But it's probably never seen snow, ever.

510
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

511
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,957
Speaker 0: Except in TV.

512
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,475
Speaker 1: Yep.

513
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,207
Speaker 1: So.

514
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:26,080
Speaker 0: All right.

515
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:29,676
Speaker 1: There's no... I can't expect that person to know what I mean when I say, "Do a

516
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:29,958
Speaker 1: donut.".

517
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:46,280
Speaker 0: So, a donut, which is... I mean, there are probably terms for this in other places that it's done, but to all of you in foreign countries, I don't think you quite understand, even Canada, the extent and the fervor which is put forth when it comes to donuts up here.

518
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:56,797
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a lot of places in the world where donuts are done, but specifically in the Northeast US, I don't know about other places, but we're really intense about doing donuts.

519
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,480
Speaker 1: College students and high school students in the Northeast United States love doing donuts, and they will do as many as they can.

520
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,538
Speaker 0: Like in high school, right?

521
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,318
Speaker 0: If I was in 10th grade, I got my car, 11th grade, whatever, anytime all through high school, I've got my car.

522
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:19,734
Speaker 0: If it snowed and I had nothing else going on, I would probably just get in my car and drive over to the high school, which had a gigantic donut-shaped parking lot of all things.

523
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:23,980
Speaker 0: And in this parking lot, I would proceed to make donuts.

524
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:33,960
Speaker 0: Now, not only would I be doing this, but I could count, I could just expect at least 10 or 15 other cars to be in this parking lot doing the exact same thing.

525
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,600
Speaker 0: There'd probably be one guy in the church parking lot across the street because he's afraid of getting hit by someone.

526
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,220
Speaker 0: There'd probably be some kid doing it at the park in the grass on the ice.

527
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:48,440
Speaker 1: It's kind of like, you know, if it snows, you go down to the golf course with your sled and what do you see?

528
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,799
Speaker 1: A bunch of other kids with sleds.

529
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you go down to the local pond and you all start ice skating.

530
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:57,080
Speaker 0: Y'all go down to the local thing and start doing donuts.

531
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,579
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what donuts are.

532
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,700
Speaker 0: And pretty much it was either that or play hockey.

533
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:01,778
Speaker 0: That's what we did.

534
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,255
Speaker 0: Yep.

535
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:11,220
Speaker 0: So a donut, very specifically, is when you get into your car and there's a slick ice covered or snow covered surface somewhere.

536
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,800
Speaker 1: I guess you could do a donut when there is no ice, but you would have to be going very fast and it would be rather dangerous.

537
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:17,939
Speaker 0: I wouldn't call it a donut.

538
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,940
Speaker 0: So you get out of the parking lot.

539
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,676
Speaker 0: Now, part of the reason that I think they're so pervasive in the U.S.

540
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,304
Speaker 0: is to other places is that in the

541
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:25,686
Speaker 0: U.S.,

542
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:29,438
Speaker 0: especially in a lot of the places we've grown up or lived, everyone has a car.

543
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,600
Speaker 0: Also, everyone has a parking lot.

544
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,600
Speaker 1: And when it snows, those parking lots are empty and icy.

545
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:39,780
Speaker 0: And they don't bother plowing the parking lot because people can just deal with it.

546
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,679
Speaker 0: They usually plow it like on Monday for work.

547
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,900
Speaker 1: But actually one that was like plowed recently, but then it's still snowing.

548
00:28:46,102 --> 00:28:47,099
Speaker 1: That's usually the best.

549
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,879
Speaker 1: Yes, because if they plow it because it's got like a foot of snow and it's still snowing, you can go there when there's like half an inch.

550
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:54,640
Speaker 1: That's perfect.

551
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,420
Speaker 0: However, I think the best possible donut is when there's about two to three inches of snow and it can just be powder.

552
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,900
Speaker 0: It has to be a little bit wet, but it can't be too wet.

553
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,520
Speaker 1: But you got to be slippery.

554
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,940
Speaker 1: It's the kind of snow where you get out of your car and fall on your ass if you weren't careful.

555
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not the so cold that it's a solid sheet.

556
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, solid sheet of ice.

557
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,716
Speaker 1: You just kill yourself because you don't have enough friction to stop or get going.

558
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,438
Speaker 0: You want snow that when you step on it, compact snow that would make good snowballs makes good donut snow.

559
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:36,860
Speaker 0: So then what you do is you get into a large open area, which are very common in the United States in the Northeast in your car, and you proceed to start driving until you reach whatever speed you are comfortable with performing this maneuver.

560
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,479
Speaker 0: Now, at this point, it depends on your exact car, your level of ambition and adventure and your skill.

561
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,080
Speaker 1: And if your car is front or rear wheel drive.

562
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,700
Speaker 1: Yes, all sorts of front or rear or mid engine.

563
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:56,599
Speaker 0: But considering that most Americans have a two wheel drive, front wheel drive, automatic car in one of those cars, the front engine.

564
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,058
Speaker 0: Yes, for the front engine.

565
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,379
Speaker 1: I mean, you could have a rear engine front wheel drive.

566
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,199
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone's ever made anything like that.

567
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,079
Speaker 1: I think there does exist, but I don't know.

568
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,498
Speaker 0: Maybe someone made one to say they made one.

569
00:30:10,064 --> 00:30:11,800
Speaker 0: That seems like a bad idea all around.

570
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,079
Speaker 1: But that's not the point.

571
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,615
Speaker 0: And what you do is you go in at a good clip, so say 30, 35, 40 miles an hour.

572
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:27,700
Speaker 0: Then you turn your real a little bit to the right or a little bit to the left, depending on which direction has less stuff, just enough to start the car turning.

573
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:36,118
Speaker 0: Now, obviously, at this point in a car like this, you're going to understeer, meaning your front tires are going to lose traction and your car will start to angle to the right or to the left.

574
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:40,420
Speaker 0: But it will continue going mostly straight and the front tires are not grabbing at all.

575
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:44,658
Speaker 1: It will go in the direction you were originally going and not in the direction you were trying to turn into.

576
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:52,179
Speaker 0: At this point, you flip your car into neutral so you don't stall out and you simultaneously pull your parking brake.

577
00:30:53,903 --> 00:30:56,060
Speaker 0: Now, you don't hold the parking brake the whole time.

578
00:30:56,662 --> 00:31:03,100
Speaker 1: You just pull it a little bit because pulling the parking brake, what it does is it takes your rear brakes and locks them.

579
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,819
Speaker 0: Now, also, you do not want to do this if you have a Boolean parking brake, the one that's just on, off.

580
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,780
Speaker 0: You only do this if you have a normal parking brake.

581
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,140
Speaker 0: Usually you want the hand one.

582
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:22,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, if your parking brake or your emergency brake or whatever you want to call it, it's a parking brake, is the kind where you pull a lever with your right with your hand, your hand brake, that's good.

583
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:30,080
Speaker 1: If it's the kind where you push down this locking pedal, like on the left, like to the left of where the clutch would be, that's no good.

584
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,180
Speaker 0: Now, you can do it without using the brake, but the brake will give you the most dramatic results with the least required skill or effort.

585
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,900
Speaker 1: That is correct.

586
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:42,360
Speaker 0: Your car will then proceed to spin any number of times while flying across the parking lot at high speed, eventually coming to a stop.

587
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:51,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, because what's happened here is the initial turning, your front wheels have lost traction because they are trying to go in a direction, but the momentum is carrying you in a different direction.

588
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,917
Speaker 1: Secondly, your rear wheels, which still have the traction, have now locked and those wheels will not spin.

589
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,440
Speaker 1: Thus, your car will spin around in a circle with a little 360 creating a donut on the ice.

590
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,699
Speaker 0: That's the basic, basic, basic donut.

591
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:11,840
Speaker 0: If you want to be more advanced, obviously you can do really cool things.

592
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:18,880
Speaker 0: It's kind of like Initial D, you can drift all around, you're not going to ruin your tires, you're not going to hit anything unless you're a complete consummate jackass.

593
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,098
Speaker 1: Or dumbass.

594
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:20,716
Speaker 0: Yeah.

595
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,760
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

596
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,280
Speaker 0: There was a friend of ours once, because in addition to donuts, I would often use my parking brake in snow.

597
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,138
Speaker 0: It's something that, because I grew up in Michigan, if you live in a place where it snows a lot and you just have to drive in snow all the time, it snows and that can't stop you, you just have to go.

598
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,819
Speaker 0: The parking brake is often useful to swing your car around a corner that you might not otherwise make due to your current speed.

599
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:55,780
Speaker 0: So whenever I was dropping people off at the dorms on my way back to our apartment, I'd usually do that coming up to the area where I could let people out, because otherwise I'd have to go real freaking slow to get around that corner.

600
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,779
Speaker 0: So I'd just go faster, pop it, come around, come to a stop, let them out.

601
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:09,018
Speaker 0: One of our friends, while they were driving someone else home, because one time I drove them home and they saw me do this and they were a little bit impressed, probably more impressed than they should have been.

602
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:09,659
Speaker 1: That's right.

603
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,660
Speaker 0: Because a lot of people who go to RIT are not natives to cold places, so they can't understand what all these donut snow people are doing.

604
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,056
Speaker 1: It's like, "What are you

605
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:18,198
Speaker 1: doing?".

606
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:19,460
Speaker 1: This is still the thing of the day.

607
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

608
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:22,160
Speaker 0: That's fine, because it's relevant.

609
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:22,700
Speaker 0: It's pertinent.

610
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:33,459
Speaker 0: So then he decides to do it one day with someone else in the car, and he comes around, he pops the parking brake, car slides and bump just right into the side of the building, just and stops.

611
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:36,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

612
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:48,020
Speaker 0: But really, if you want to get advanced, instead of popping your car into neutral, you use the accelerator and use the wheel right to try to get a perfect slide or some counter steering, try to land on a target.

613
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:56,480
Speaker 1: I think my goal, usually when doing donuts, the goal is to go as fast as you can safely and then do as many 360s as possible in place.

614
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:57,599
Speaker 1: That's the goal.

615
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,580
Speaker 1: My goal is almost always to do the- Because that provides the most thrills in the car.

616
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:04,700
Speaker 1: Anyone else who's in the car with you, it's like an amusement park ride.

617
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:13,420
Speaker 0: God, there were like four times at RIT where I took someone out who had never been on a donut run before, and I just took him out into a parking lot, and I did a donut.

618
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
Speaker 1: Like a shitty donut too.

619
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:22,927
Speaker 0: Just like a little like, because Scott was in with a couple times, and we'd just be like a little, like I'd maybe go like one 360, like a little, "Shit, it wasn't going more than 30 or 35 miles an

620
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:23,027
Speaker 0: hour.".

621
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:27,000
Speaker 0: And they'd totally freak out like I was going to kill him somehow.

622
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:35,300
Speaker 1: I think what it is, is people feel those g-forces not too often, and when they do feel them, it's in an environment where they know they're safe, like a roller coaster or something.

623
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,599
Speaker 1: So when you feel them in a car, which is a place where you never want to feel those kinds of g-forces, you freak out.

624
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:47,000
Speaker 1: Now unless you're from the place where these are common- Unless you fee- Well, you know, if you do it twice, then you're used to it.

625
00:34:47,080 --> 00:35:00,380
Speaker 0: I mean, the first time I ever did one, when I was in 10th grade, I didn't even have my driver's license yet, I had my learner's permit, I was so afraid I was going to hit something, and then I did one, and I didn't hit anything, and I did one again, and I realized that you can't hit anything unless you're a consummate jackass.

626
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:09,779
Speaker 1: See, now I want to encourage people to do donuts, that way they'll be better to able handle their cars, like if they get into some serious snow traction situations in the snow, not on purpose.

627
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,740
Speaker 1: However, is it illegal to do donuts or not?

628
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,580
Speaker 0: You see, it depends.

629
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,420
Speaker 0: If you're doing it on private property, it's not illegal unless you're trespassing.

630
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:23,920
Speaker 0: They could get you for reckless driving if you did that on a public road, but you shouldn't be doing that on a public road anyway.

631
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,745
Speaker 1: No, I think just don't do it where you know you're going to get in trouble for doing it.

632
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,217
Speaker 0: RIT turned a straight up blind eye to it.

633
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,239
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure if Campus Safety was right there- Campus Safety was right there watching me one day.

634
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:40,080
Speaker 0: I was just sitting there in his car, and I was doing donuts.

635
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:51,246
Speaker 0: I didn't notice him at first because it was still snowing, so finally, in the middle of one of my runs, I look and I see this car, this Campus Safety guy sitting right there looking at me, and I just stop, and I sit there like, "Great, he's going to come do something to me,".

636
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:52,699
Speaker 0: and he doesn't do anything.

637
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:01,396
Speaker 0: So eventually, I build up a little bit of courage, I do another donut, and then eventually his lights come on and I think, "All right, now he's coming after me,".

638
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:07,520
Speaker 0: and he drives off into this other parking lot, does a donut, and then drives away.

639
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:14,320
Speaker 0: It was one of the most beautiful moments in my life, second only to when this jackass ran a- I keep saying jackass today.

640
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,359
Speaker 1: Ran a stop sign- I had to say ass hat instead.

641
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,780
Speaker 0: The guy passed me from behind over a double yellow and ran a stop sign.

642
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,260
Speaker 0: He was then immediately pulled over, and I drove past him.

643
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,585
Speaker 0: I was laughing so hard with the window down, and the cop looked up to me, and he gave kind of this smirk like,

644
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:30,787
Speaker 0: "Yeah?".

645
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:34,207
Speaker 1: "Lol.".

646
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we rely on cops a lot, but we don't dislike cops.

647
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Speaker 0: We just dislike some of the uses of cops.

648
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:41,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some cops.

649
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:42,454
Speaker 1: All right, so.

650
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,339
Speaker 0: So, my thing of the day- Oh, shit.

651
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:51,600
Speaker 0: Is a video of someone at RIT in the donut parking lot.

652
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,960
Speaker 1: Doing it in a Saturn.

653
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:54,999
Speaker 0: I mean, D-Lot is well and good.

654
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,820
Speaker 0: If you've never been to U-Lot.

655
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,420
Speaker 0: And he does a pretty damn good donut.

656
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,720
Speaker 1: Anyone but us got that reference.

657
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,780
Speaker 0: Now, I will note that while the donut- the normal donut he does is really impressive.

658
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,620
Speaker 0: The end of the video is doubly impressive.

659
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:17,260
Speaker 0: I would give it a 20% chance that he faked the second half of the video with a clever cut and then having a guy laugh.

660
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,357
Speaker 1: It could be.

661
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,640
Speaker 0: However, I have known people.

662
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:21,879
Speaker 0: I am not- I cannot do this.

663
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,740
Speaker 0: I don't think Scott can do it.

664
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,838
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone we know can do it.

665
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 1: I could do it if I practiced a bit.

666
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I knew people in Michigan who could do donuts.

667
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,260
Speaker 0: you wouldn't freaking believe.

668
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:33,440
Speaker 0: They would have two cars and they'd go at each other like you're playing a game of chicken.

669
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,798
Speaker 0: And then one would veer to the right and one would veer to the left and they'd like initial D past each other.

670
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,060
Speaker 0: And that was like the common game and I never ever had the balls to try that.

671
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,560
Speaker 1: I would never have the balls to try it either.

672
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,560
Speaker 1: Unless it was a shit car and like a demolition derby of ICE.

673
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,457
Speaker 1: Then I would do it.

674
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, and yeah, I guess in that case.

675
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:55,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it was like a demolition derby car with like the roll bar and a helmet and everything, I'd be up for it.

676
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,078
Speaker 1: But not in my car.

677
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,540
Speaker 0: Right, so the topic today is snow because it snowed today.

678
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:05,819
Speaker 1: What is there to say about snow?

679
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,220
Speaker 1: Let's see.

680
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,080
Speaker 1: It's cold, it's wet, it falls from the sky.

681
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,159
Speaker 0: It's made out of mostly water, but sometimes there's some acid in it.

682
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,759
Speaker 1: A lot of people in the world don't deal with it.

683
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,479
Speaker 0: A lot of people get a lot of it.

684
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:19,060
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's good and sometimes it sucks.

685
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:21,340
Speaker 1: It's pretty much like all weather.

686
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,080
Speaker 1: It's like you want it and sometimes you gotta deal with it when it comes.

687
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think every part of the world, people just growing up have very different snow experiences.

688
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,500
Speaker 0: We both grew up in somewhat similar climates.

689
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, where I live it's got summer, spring, winter, and fall.

690
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:39,839
Speaker 1: It's just like the climate is here right now.

691
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, and contrary to popular belief, while it's really cold in the winter and it snows a lot in Michigan, it's really hot in the summer too.

692
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:56,579
Speaker 0: So yeah, but I remember it seems like the older I got, like my joy from snow is inversely proportional to my age.

693
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,440
Speaker 0: Because when I was young, no matter what, if it snowed it was a good day.

694
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,880
Speaker 1: Snow was the best thing in the world as a kid for many reasons.

695
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:05,799
Speaker 1: In my cancel school.

696
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,980
Speaker 1: In my cancel school, in my delay school.

697
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,119
Speaker 0: I went to a private Catholic school.

698
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,860
Speaker 0: They would cancel school at the drop of a goddamn head.

699
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:21,798
Speaker 1: In my younger years, they wouldn't cancel school so easily, but later as liability fears rose, they would cancel school over anything and that made everyone happy.

700
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,020
Speaker 1: Except for the parents, well some parents.

701
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:35,477
Speaker 0: See my high school never canceled school, and actually as I got older, especially when I lived in the suburbs, no one ever canceled school when it snowed unless there was freezing rain and they just expected you to drive in it.

702
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:39,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, they always canceled school because buses and shit.

703
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:48,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I think it's just a different, I mean I grew up in a place where if it snowed a foot, you weren't expected to alter your habits in any way and no one did.

704
00:39:50,261 --> 00:40:00,100
Speaker 1: See the other reason snow was awesome as a kid is because it was sort of like this toy that you didn't know if you were going to get to play with it and just some days it would appear outside your house.

705
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,480
Speaker 1: Like imagine if outside your house there was a swing set and most of the time you looked out the window and the swing set wasn't there.

706
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,200
Speaker 1: It was just the summer, you look out the window, no swing set.

707
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:15,319
Speaker 1: Then in the winter, on just a few random days for one part of the year, the swing set would appear.

708
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:18,039
Speaker 0: Not just in your yard, but in all your friends' yards too.

709
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in the streets and everywhere.

710
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,638
Speaker 1: And that was the best times, building snow forts.

711
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,139
Speaker 0: Snow igloos which always collapsed on me.

712
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:30,259
Speaker 1: Yep, throwing snowballs, snow angels, snowmen.

713
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:32,819
Speaker 0: Whitewashing as I got older.

714
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:34,160
Speaker 1: Snow everything.

715
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,920
Speaker 0: Every Bill Cosby stand up about snow.

716
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:41,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was just so much shit to do with snow if you were a little kid.

717
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,000
Speaker 0: God, I mean, I love sledding.

718
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,980
Speaker 0: I still love sledding.

719
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,000
Speaker 0: Sledding is one of my favorite things in the world.

720
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,360
Speaker 1: Sledding is pretty damn good.

721
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,300
Speaker 0: I haven't done it recently.

722
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,338
Speaker 0: I wanted to.

723
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,539
Speaker 0: In fact, I had decided to this year.

724
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,259
Speaker 0: I had a sled picked out to buy and everything and it just hadn't come to be.

725
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,218
Speaker 0: Rosebud.

726
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,660
Speaker 0: But when it would snow, like my brother and I were serious about it.

727
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,400
Speaker 0: When it snowed, we'd get together kind of like Calvin and Hobbs style.

728
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:12,760
Speaker 0: And alright, this is what we're going to build out there in terms of sledding hills.

729
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,839
Speaker 0: We'd always make sledding hills in our front and backyards.

730
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:23,660
Speaker 0: We'd always make different, like in the front yard because the plows would pile up all that extra snow from the street into the front half of the front yard.

731
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:31,179
Speaker 0: We'd take all that in addition to the driveway snow and the yard snow and make one really, really tall hill to sled off of.

732
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,519
Speaker 1: Oh, see our backyard had a hill so we mostly sledded on that.

733
00:41:34,922 --> 00:41:44,980
Speaker 1: But if you wanted to get some serious dangerous, possibly dangerous sledding, you could go to this one golf course where one of the holes just was like a big, big hill.

734
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:48,020
Speaker 1: And you would just go right down this hill on your sled.

735
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,780
Speaker 1: The thing is, if you went too fast and you didn't slow down or stop properly, there was a little hill.

736
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,660
Speaker 1: There's like a bump at the end, sort of like a slip and slide.

737
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:55,838
Speaker 0: No, wait.

738
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:58,539
Speaker 1: The thing was that you were going straight for the road.

739
00:41:59,302 --> 00:42:06,100
Speaker 1: And I don't know if this is true, but I heard a story once that someone went down that hill full speed, hit the bump, went out into the road and got hit.

740
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,800
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's true, but I guess it'd be, it would be pretty difficult if you've seen the area.

741
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,579
Speaker 1: Like they would have to be going really fast.

742
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:21,160
Speaker 1: But if someone did have a really fast sled and they were big enough and they got a running start, it could be possible.

743
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,419
Speaker 0: If you had one of those cigarette style bullet sleds.

744
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be possible.

745
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,400
Speaker 1: But just a story that they make about that hill to scare you from going to the fun hill.

746
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:32,099
Speaker 0: It's kind of like going over the bar.

747
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,140
Speaker 1: Exactly.

748
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:36,319
Speaker 0: Even though a kid did go over the bar at my school and did break his neck.

749
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:36,787
Speaker 1: Wow.

750
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,599
Speaker 0: But he didn't go over the bar all the way so much as he went so high up that he just kind of fell right down out onto his neck.

751
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:43,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

752
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks.

753
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,820
Speaker 0: Then he got beat up after he came back to school.

754
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,380
Speaker 0: He was fine.

755
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,057
Speaker 0: Just other than a broken neck, but he had to wear this huge horrible brace and some kids beat him up.

756
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:54,037
Speaker 1: What the hell?

757
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:54,528
Speaker 0: Yeah.

758
00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:56,280
Speaker 0: Anyway.

759
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,339
Speaker 1: See, I grew up in... Getting hit by a car.

760
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,720
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan.

761
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,340
Speaker 0: There weren't hills anywhere.

762
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,378
Speaker 1: Ah, true.

763
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,620
Speaker 0: We didn't see anything ever.

764
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:10,820
Speaker 0: So we had to make our own.

765
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:20,060
Speaker 0: Now, as a result, we got really good at it and we learned that while the tall hill seemed like the best idea to a young kid, make a tall hill and go off the top of it.

766
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,919
Speaker 0: You didn't go so fast.

767
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,520
Speaker 0: What we realized, the ultimate way to sled in a flat front yard.

768
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:35,180
Speaker 0: We made a bump about, I don't know, a little over knee high and we'd make it really, really compact and we'd pour some water over it and more snow overs.

769
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,379
Speaker 0: It was this compact solid ice thing.

770
00:43:38,363 --> 00:43:41,300
Speaker 0: What you would do is you would run at it at full speed.

771
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,040
Speaker 1: You'd hit the bump and get some air.

772
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,479
Speaker 0: No, you'd run at it full speed just before you got to it.

773
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,459
Speaker 0: You jump into the air, stick your sled under your knees and land on it.

774
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:55,439
Speaker 0: You would go flying down three or four yards.

775
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:56,087
Speaker 1: Oh.

776
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,680
Speaker 0: And usually we'd put jumps or angles or beams or ice or something.

777
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,900
Speaker 0: A lot of times we'd pull out a hose and make ice lanes.

778
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's always a good plan.

779
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,420
Speaker 1: You know, you can make like a little, what's it called?

780
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,859
Speaker 1: The thing in Cool Runnings.

781
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,220
Speaker 1: The toboggan run.

782
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,300
Speaker 1: A bobsled action.

783
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,486
Speaker 1: Yeah.

784
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:23,716
Speaker 1: You pile up snow on two sides and then you compact the snow in between and then you just run for it and go right down the middle with your sled.

785
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,020
Speaker 1: And if you put a turn or two in there, you can bank off the turns to pick up more speed.

786
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:30,858
Speaker 1: That could be some good stuff.

787
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,520
Speaker 0: See, we'd always make those kind of, they would just happen because we're sledding in the same place.

788
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,440
Speaker 0: It kind of made a dip in the snow over time.

789
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,099
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

790
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,320
Speaker 1: You didn't actually do it by hand.

791
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,920
Speaker 1: That takes too long.

792
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:50,780
Speaker 0: But oh, when I was a kid, I was a Cub Scout and right before I, you know, left the Cub Scouts and decided not to join the Boy Scouts because no offense, but it seemed really kind of nerdy and I didn't like any of those people.

793
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also did the same thing.

794
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:56,959
Speaker 1: I got like two Cub Scout things and no- I got all the way to Weebillows.

795
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:58,480
Speaker 1: I didn't go to Weebillows.

796
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,200
Speaker 0: I also got a pile of medals and pins and whatever.

797
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,100
Speaker 1: I gave them the finger way before Weebillows.

798
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,519
Speaker 0: I didn't get the religion pin.

799
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,920
Speaker 0: Because that was before they kicked atheists out of the Cub Scouts.

800
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,419
Speaker 1: I actually got that one for Jew.

801
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:10,339
Speaker 0: Really?

802
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:11,799
Speaker 1: I don't remember actually.

803
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,400
Speaker 1: I had to go look at my little- I remember one of the-.

804
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:22,380
Speaker 1: The thing was my mom was so like lazy about sewing those things on to the stupid shirt that like I had a whole mess of them that never got attached to anything.

805
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:23,899
Speaker 0: That's so sad.

806
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

807
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, my Pine Box Derby cars always sucked ass.

808
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had one and it sucked ass, and I only did the Pine Box Derby once.

809
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,860
Speaker 1: But in that one Pine Box Derby, I saw the kid who won and I realized the answer to winning.

810
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:42,380
Speaker 1: And if I would have had another year, I would have won because I would have done it Formula One style.

811
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,300
Speaker 0: I think we could do a show on Pine Box Derbies.

812
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:45,580
Speaker 1: That's not a good idea.

813
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,435
Speaker 0: If we also include CO2 cars.

814
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:48,932
Speaker 1: Ah, CO2 cars.

815
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:51,100
Speaker 0: I think the two combined will be a good show.

816
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,700
Speaker 0: But anyway- So we went to this huge Boy Scout camp in the middle of nowhere.

817
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,277
Speaker 0: And it actually was somewhat hilly there.

818
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:01,880
Speaker 0: But it wasn't hilly like, you know, rolling hills.

819
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,779
Speaker 0: It was hilly like dangerous hills in the woods.

820
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,040
Speaker 0: So at our cabin, right next to it was not really a cliff, but a very sharp grade.

821
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,119
Speaker 0: It looks like it was a drainage ditch and it was snow and ice.

822
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:19,200
Speaker 0: And it formed what appeared to us as young, not so bright kids to be a perfect toboggan run.

823
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,660
Speaker 0: However, at the bottom was a little bank of snow.

824
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,680
Speaker 0: And the toboggan run kind of went to the right or to the left.

825
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,440
Speaker 0: And there was a raised section in the middle.

826
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,899
Speaker 0: And directly behind this raised section was a gigantic oak tree.

827
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:38,820
Speaker 0: So we're all debating, will the bank push you out of the way before you hit it or not?

828
00:46:40,682 --> 00:46:44,085
Speaker 0: So finally, one kid gets in a little saucer and he goes- A saucer?

829
00:46:44,186 --> 00:46:45,600
Speaker 1: Oh shit, I wouldn't do it in a saucer.

830
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,358
Speaker 0: Why, saucers are the crappiest of sleds.

831
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,080
Speaker 1: No, you're not using the saucer properly then.

832
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,739
Speaker 0: How do you use the saucer properly?

833
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,420
Speaker 1: You got to make sure that you don't let yourself rotate in the saucer.

834
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:56,299
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm well aware.

835
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,220
Speaker 0: Saucers can't go nearly as fast as certain other kinds of sleds.

836
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,620
Speaker 1: No, saucers can go fast.

837
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,240
Speaker 1: What you have to do is you have to bend the sides up, right?

838
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,200
Speaker 1: That way it does less-.

839
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,420
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm well aware.

840
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:08,060
Speaker 0: You can also steer by pulling one side up or the other side.

841
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,720
Speaker 1: Or you can do the national lampoon style where you get the metal saucer and you polish it.

842
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,780
Speaker 0: That doesn't actually work.

843
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:14,960
Speaker 1: I know, but it's hilarious.

844
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,040
Speaker 0: I was thinking, I was trying to come up with a way to reference that.

845
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:19,580
Speaker 1: I just came out and said it because I knew.

846
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:21,860
Speaker 0: I was going to reference it somehow and be all clever.

847
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,939
Speaker 0: So he's going down and he's going straight for the tree.

848
00:47:25,923 --> 00:47:28,038
Speaker 0: And at the last second, because there's- He just jumps off.

849
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:33,460
Speaker 0: No, because the snow goes up, it goes right toward it, and then it just kind of falls to the side and keeps going down the trail.

850
00:47:34,128 --> 00:47:34,480
Speaker 0: Oh, sweet.

851
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,651
Speaker 0: So the next kid's like,

852
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:36,419
Speaker 0: "Badasses!".

853
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:37,880
Speaker 0: He just jumps down without even thinking.

854
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,399
Speaker 0: Same thing, but he goes to the left.

855
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,860
Speaker 0: And so we're saucering for a while and people are like, they figure out how to pick left or right and it's going okay.

856
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:49,879
Speaker 0: Then a kid pulls out the toboggan and we're like, "All right, who's with

857
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,020
Speaker 0: me?".

858
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:51,357
Speaker 0: Not me.

859
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,360
Speaker 0: So I got on, but I was at the back.

860
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,898
Speaker 0: There were six people in front of me.

861
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:57,059
Speaker 1: It's a big one.

862
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a big straight up wooden one with metal railings on it.

863
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,320
Speaker 1: Oh, shits.

864
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:06,680
Speaker 1: No, it was either plastic dish or it was plastic sled.

865
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,912
Speaker 1: We didn't have no wooden ones.

866
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,700
Speaker 0: The most dangerous sled are the ones that are about six feet long, about a foot wide.

867
00:48:13,044 --> 00:48:14,000
Speaker 0: They're made out of plastic.

868
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:19,700
Speaker 0: Basically just a shallow piece of plastic and they have basically rifling along the bottom.

869
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's dangerous.

870
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:25,060
Speaker 1: Those things got- Remember when we went sledding with dinner trays?

871
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:25,920
Speaker 0: That didn't end well.

872
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,520
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.

873
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:27,620
Speaker 0: No, that was awesome.

874
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:28,659
Speaker 1: It was hilarious.

875
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,940
Speaker 0: I watched a guy try to snowboard with a piece of cardboard.

876
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:32,749
Speaker 1: Wow.

877
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,260
Speaker 0: He met down a steep hill.

878
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,239
Speaker 0: He made it about two feet and then he fell on his face.

879
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,259
Speaker 1: At least did he attach it to his feet with strings?

880
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:40,017
Speaker 0: You'd think that.

881
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:43,300
Speaker 0: It basically just stopped and then he just fell.

882
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:45,819
Speaker 0: This toboggan, I'm at the back of it.

883
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,300
Speaker 0: I'm the seventh person and the lucky hobbit at the back.

884
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,240
Speaker 0: I know this is not going to end well.

885
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,479
Speaker 0: I've decided to be at the back because that way I have six airbags in front of me.

886
00:48:55,861 --> 00:48:59,440
Speaker 0: It's going down and they're like, "Yeah, we're going to make it.

887
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,166
Speaker 0: We're going to make it,".

888
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:01,540
Speaker 0: because they're all big tough boy scouts.

889
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,679
Speaker 0: Now I'm a little young cub scout.

890
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,980
Speaker 1: This thing is not going to turn.

891
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,959
Speaker 1: It's how long?

892
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:07,139
Speaker 0: This thing's going straight for the tree.

893
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:11,160
Speaker 0: I bail about halfway down.

894
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,300
Speaker 1: Bailing is something that you do in snow often, not just when it's in sledding.

895
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bailed and rolled.

896
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:24,360
Speaker 0: I saw that one other person bailed and at the last second I hear, "Oh shit," and it just goes right into the tree.

897
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:30,620
Speaker 0: Just, "Fuck," and the back of the toboggan goes up and then back down and I just hear,

898
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:31,662
Speaker 0: "Oh."

899
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:34,960
Speaker 0: Right in the mean bean machine.

900
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,099
Speaker 0: They were all hurt.

901
00:49:37,386 --> 00:49:38,260
Speaker 1: As they deserved.

902
00:49:40,005 --> 00:49:40,918
Speaker 0: They totally deserved it.

903
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:46,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think though in the front row crew, I'm really the only one who skis.

904
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just sort of anti-skiing.

905
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:52,420
Speaker 1: Like, I actually kind of like watching downhill skiing in the Olympics.

906
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,240
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool and I like playing Ski Free for Windows 3.1.

907
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,916
Speaker 0: I remember that.

908
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,119
Speaker 0: The Yeti would get you again.

909
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,860
Speaker 1: The Abominable Snowman.

910
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good one.

911
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,379
Speaker 1: I love that game.

912
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:07,759
Speaker 1: But actually skiing, I've never done it and I don't plan to because I can get a lot more fun with a lot less danger.

913
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:09,760
Speaker 0: Skiing is not that dangerous.

914
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:12,800
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it is that dangerous, but it is dangerous.

915
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,360
Speaker 1: See, the thing is- And there is the danger to fun ratio is not good enough.

916
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:19,739
Speaker 0: I don't think you quite understand how fun it is.

917
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:22,419
Speaker 1: I think I know how fun it would be for me.

918
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,057
Speaker 1: Not so much.

919
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,020
Speaker 0: Well, that's just because you have no leg strength.

920
00:50:25,784 --> 00:50:26,800
Speaker 1: I have plenty of leg strength.

921
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:27,373
Speaker 0: We'll see.

922
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:37,059
Speaker 1: But even if I, you know, it's like the amount of time to take that... If I tried to ski right now, I'd kind of suck at it and it wouldn't be fun.

923
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:39,580
Speaker 0: Not because, honestly, the basics of skiing.

924
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,079
Speaker 0: I mean, you saw that South Park.

925
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,500
Speaker 0: French fries, pizza.

926
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,498
Speaker 0: French, that's it.

927
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,600
Speaker 1: But even so, you know, it would take me a while before I could actually ski anywhere fun.

928
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,200
Speaker 0: It would take a lot of time.

929
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,060
Speaker 0: That's not true at all.

930
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,160
Speaker 1: And a lot of money and I might get hurt.

931
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,097
Speaker 0: The first time I ever went skiing, it cost me 20 bucks for a lift ticket and 20 bucks to rent skis.

932
00:50:58,741 --> 00:50:59,759
Speaker 0: I went over to the bunny hill.

933
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,580
Speaker 0: Someone explained to me how to use the tow rope.

934
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:04,120
Speaker 0: That's all I needed.

935
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:12,660
Speaker 0: And they explained to me, I took a little 20-minute lesson where they taught me how to go faster, how to go slower, how to turn, and how to not impale myself.

936
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,259
Speaker 0: Impaling yourself, you see, never hold a ski pole out in front of you.

937
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,160
Speaker 0: Because if it, like, anywhere in front of your body, because if it catches, you have basically just planted a spear against the charge.

938
00:51:25,522 --> 00:51:27,300
Speaker 0: And you know that that does triple damage.

939
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,460
Speaker 1: Oh man, I never thought about that one.

940
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:35,198
Speaker 0: Neither did I. And the ski instructor was like, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't cross your skis, blah, blah, blah.

941
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,539
Speaker 0: Crossing your skis totally sucks.

942
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,500
Speaker 1: See, this thing, there's just too many things.

943
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:40,876
Speaker 1: You know what?

944
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:42,199
Speaker 1: I can go to a roller coaster.

945
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,160
Speaker 1: It's faster, it's more fun, it's cheaper.

946
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,820
Speaker 1: And I can ride it a bunch of times.

947
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:47,440
Speaker 1: I don't need to learn anything.

948
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,339
Speaker 1: I don't need to sit on some lift.

949
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 1: It's not cheap.

950
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,220
Speaker 1: I don't need to wait in line.

951
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,740
Speaker 0: To buy a ticket, to get on the dope-ass Disney train.

952
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,640
Speaker 1: It's much cheaper and it's much less effort.

953
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:02,620
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, at Roller Coaster Land, press A. Actually, I'm kind of considering the two of us should go.

954
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:03,798
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll get anyone in on it.

955
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:11,060
Speaker 0: Should just fly out to Ohio, go to Cedar Point, get all of our rollercoastering out of our system and be done with it forever.

956
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:12,460
Speaker 1: Maybe that's a good idea.

957
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,260
Speaker 1: Then we'll have to go to the Slitterbot and get all the water parking out.

958
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,800
Speaker 1: The thing is, I kind of want to go to the water park more.

959
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:25,320
Speaker 0: Well, I do too because I haven't been to a water park nearly so recently as I've ridden And I like water parks a lot more than I like roller coasters.

960
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that's because you won't go on half the good roller coasters.

961
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,179
Speaker 1: I just don't like the upside downy.

962
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why.

963
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,280
Speaker 0: I think the upside downy is great as long as it's done well.

964
00:52:32,381 --> 00:52:35,540
Speaker 0: As long as it's all the special kinds of loops and not just a circle.

965
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:36,539
Speaker 1: Uh, not a fan.

966
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I like roller coasters, but I like skiing more.

967
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:47,239
Speaker 0: The problem is I skied in school and I went to RIT and I didn't have any money anymore and no one I knew skied.

968
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:49,480
Speaker 0: So I basically just gave up skiing.

969
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,493
Speaker 0: And this year, now that I'm finally, I've settled somewhere.

970
00:52:52,694 --> 00:52:53,820
Speaker 0: generally, I have money.

971
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:54,698
Speaker 0: I thought I'm going to ski.

972
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,100
Speaker 0: I'm going to buy a bunch of equipment.

973
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:57,619
Speaker 0: I'm going to go skiing.

974
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,980
Speaker 0: And it hasn't fucking snowed until today.

975
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,597
Speaker 0: Yeah.

976
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,720
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they have places where they make snow.

977
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's some mountains that are high enough around here where there's snow, even though there isn't any on our front lawn.

978
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:09,499
Speaker 0: Oh no.

979
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,716
Speaker 0: Yeah.

980
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,458
Speaker 0: There were places I could have gone to ski, but all the places that were really close and really cheap.

981
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:16,460
Speaker 0: No, not so much.

982
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:17,759
Speaker 1: There's a reason places are cheap.

983
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:23,039
Speaker 1: You know, it's when the skiing sucks, they make the prices low because that way you can ski even though it sucks.

984
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,000
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the prices are high.

985
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:26,679
Speaker 1: That means there's good skiing going on.

986
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:35,579
Speaker 0: Though a friend of mine from IBM, the one who was over the other day did point out to me that because the skiing season has been generally abysmal, I can pick up ski equipment real cheap.

987
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,040
Speaker 1: Well, it's not real cheap.

988
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,199
Speaker 1: It's relatively cheap.

989
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,279
Speaker 0: No, that's real cheap.

990
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,900
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it's relatively cheap for ski equipment.

991
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,680
Speaker 1: On an absolute scale, ski equipment is still expensive.

992
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:51,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I could outfit myself with everything I would need and high quality relative to my skill for about 500 bucks.

993
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

994
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,459
Speaker 0: That's not bad at all.

995
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,040
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's still 500 bucks is a lot of money.

996
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,099
Speaker 1: You could get a PS3, the low end one.

997
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:02,280
Speaker 1: Couldn't get a real PS3 or get an Xbox 360 in a game.

998
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:08,940
Speaker 0: You could buy for good ski equipment and go skiing for less than the cost of an iPhone.

999
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:09,974
Speaker 1: All right.

1000
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:16,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now that I'm older, I love snow still because I want to go skiing.

1001
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:24,180
Speaker 0: I have snowball fights and everything, but most of the time all snow means is my commute is going to take longer because people don't know how to drive.

1002
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:31,299
Speaker 1: Once you get out of high school and the snow, it generally just sucks because you've made enough snowmen in your life.

1003
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,240
Speaker 1: Sleds are too small for your body most of the time, even though not always.

1004
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,680
Speaker 1: Well, the other thing is skiing takes time and it's expensive.

1005
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,619
Speaker 1: You can only do it on the weekend.

1006
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,300
Speaker 0: When I went sledding again at RIT, I realized something important.

1007
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,073
Speaker 0: When I was a little kid and I sledded, my body was resilient.

1008
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:48,060
Speaker 0: I would just bounce off of things.

1009
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,019
Speaker 0: Now, a lot of the things that I did as a kid would kill me, including many of these stunts I've tried to pull when sledding.

1010
00:54:53,229 --> 00:54:53,379
Speaker 1: Yep.

1011
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,940
Speaker 1: You know, when you're a kid, you could just fall down in the snow, jump around.

1012
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,557
Speaker 1: It was okay because you just bounced around as an adult.

1013
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,259
Speaker 1: You fall down once you're done.

1014
00:55:01,906 --> 00:55:02,498
Speaker 1: Oh, my hip.

1015
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:03,758
Speaker 1: Oh, my ribs.

1016
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm 25 now.

1017
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,120
Speaker 0: I'm a quarter of a century old.

1018
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:07,716
Speaker 0: That's the end.

1019
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:09,097
Speaker 1: It's very much the end.

1020
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,320
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, as an adult, it's like, oh, great, it snowed.

1021
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,759
Speaker 1: Now I have to clean off my car.

1022
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:14,420
Speaker 1: Great.

1023
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,380
Speaker 1: Now I can't go anywhere.

1024
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,557
Speaker 1: It's way for my car to warm up.

1025
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,079
Speaker 0: I will never complain about cleaning my car off again.

1026
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,719
Speaker 1: Oh, I have to shuffle, you know, shovel the walkway.

1027
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:23,360
Speaker 0: We don't have to shovel the rockway.

1028
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,540
Speaker 0: We pay people to do that.

1029
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,640
Speaker 1: I know, but you still have to do it indirectly.

1030
00:55:27,521 --> 00:55:27,918
Speaker 0: See, the thing is.

1031
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,120
Speaker 1: It would be worse if we did have to shovel like most people do.

1032
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,540
Speaker 0: I always used to like shoveling snow.

1033
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,740
Speaker 0: And if we didn't have a service already, I would just shovel the snow because I like doing it.

1034
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:37,359
Speaker 0: It's good exercise.

1035
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,619
Speaker 0: I like being outside like that.

1036
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,900
Speaker 0: And usually if I'm out there anyway in snow pants shoveling, I've got no excuse not to build a snowman or something since I'm already snowy.

1037
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:52,740
Speaker 1: The thing is like with shoveling snow is a lot like mowing the lawn, you know, it's like before I mowed the lawn, I really wanted to mow the lawn.

1038
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,239
Speaker 1: You know, like I thought mowing the lawn would be so fun.

1039
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,280
Speaker 1: And then once you mow the lawn once, you know, it's fun to use the lawnmower.

1040
00:55:59,702 --> 00:56:02,240
Speaker 1: But after that, there's no fun in it anymore.

1041
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,899
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, great.

1042
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:03,599
Speaker 1: This sucks.

1043
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,060
Speaker 1: I walk around for an hour pushing this thing with a tractor.

1044
00:56:07,162 --> 00:56:08,199
Speaker 1: It's a little more fun.

1045
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,732
Speaker 0: No, no.

1046
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,920
Speaker 0: See, I actually even right up until I left, I always like mowing the lawn.

1047
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:17,079
Speaker 0: The only reason I wouldn't want to mow the lawn is that to mow the back lawn, I'd first have to pick up the dog crap.

1048
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:19,799
Speaker 0: And I never wanted to do that.

1049
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,660
Speaker 1: See, I just I liked mowing the lawn maybe twice and then it was not fun anymore.

1050
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,660
Speaker 1: The same thing with shoveling snow.

1051
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,519
Speaker 1: See, I like mowing it.

1052
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,920
Speaker 1: You know, if you had a new shovel, it would reinvigorate the joy of snow shoveling for a few minutes.

1053
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,778
Speaker 0: Well, we have a new shovel.

1054
00:56:32,283 --> 00:56:32,434
Speaker 1: I know.

1055
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,020
Speaker 1: So you'd shovel for a few minutes.

1056
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,539
Speaker 1: You'd be like, whee, a new shovel.

1057
00:56:35,781 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 1: And then you'd be like, oh, yeah, shoveling snow sucks.

1058
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,880
Speaker 1: Unless, well, I guess if it's a light snow, it's not so bad.

1059
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,620
Speaker 0: No, heavier the better.

1060
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,020
Speaker 0: I love just battling the elements like that.

1061
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,580
Speaker 1: No, just it's like, yeah, it's great to battle the elements for the first battle.

1062
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:54,260
Speaker 1: And then as soon as you win one battle and then you realize you have to fight that same exact battle 100 more times, it's just like, fuck this.

1063
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,798
Speaker 1: I'm going inside.

1064
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,820
Speaker 0: But remember, we lived in Rochester.

1065
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:03,660
Speaker 0: We can never complain about cleaning off our cars again because here we have to clean our cars off maybe once every couple of weeks, even when a normal winter happens.

1066
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,620
Speaker 1: And it's real easy to do it.

1067
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:09,080
Speaker 1: I don't have to chip off a half an inch thick shield of ice from my front windshield.

1068
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:16,760
Speaker 0: In Rochester, it would snow just enough to where you would have to scrape your car off every single night.

1069
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:18,720
Speaker 1: Every snow, not every night.

1070
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:35,958
Speaker 1: Every time you got in your car, you would drop, you would wake up, you'd get in your car, you'd go, you'd wake up, you clean off your car, you'd go to class, you would come back to your car in the parking lot, clean it off, drive home, go inside for 10 minutes, come outside, clean off the car.

1071
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,258
Speaker 0: Double awesome.

1072
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:37,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1073
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:48,799
Speaker 1: My strategy whenever there was a perfect sheet of ice just covering the windows, which there often was, I would turn the car on, have the heat going full blast and all the defrosters and everything on all the time.

1074
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:57,560
Speaker 1: And what eventually would happen is the ice, the part of the sheet of ice that was closest to the windows, the parts that were actually touching the windows of the car would melt.

1075
00:57:57,962 --> 00:58:00,059
Speaker 1: And then I would just push the sheet of ice off the car.

1076
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:01,054
Speaker 1: Just whoop.

1077
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:02,920
Speaker 1: That was the great strategy of Scott.

1078
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:05,000
Speaker 1: No chipping, no hacking, no scraping.

1079
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:05,798
Speaker 1: That was the key.

1080
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,100
Speaker 1: It still sucked because it took so long to wait for that shit to defrost.

1081
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:11,660
Speaker 1: But it was fun when I pushed that device right onto the ground.

1082
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,300
Speaker 0: I always used to love sheets of ice whenever I could get a hold of them.

1083
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,100
Speaker 0: I always felt like I was breaking a giant plate glass window.

1084
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,599
Speaker 1: Remember that dude with the recycle bin?

1085
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:27,080
Speaker 0: Actually, one time, we'll end on this just because we've already gone way too long for an episode of this caliber.

1086
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,485
Speaker 0: Yep.

1087
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:34,878
Speaker 0: My mom had to wash her Jeep to get the salt off of it and the sand off of it so it wouldn't cause problems.

1088
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,039
Speaker 0: And it was in the winter, but car washes are open in Michigan in the winter.

1089
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:47,019
Speaker 0: So we go to the self-serve car wash and there is a sheet of ice about three to four inches thick covering both walls.

1090
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,115
Speaker 1: Wow.

1091
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:51,220
Speaker 0: So we wash the car and then we pull the car out.

1092
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,520
Speaker 0: I go back in and I start doing something that's rather non-intelligent.

1093
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:57,159
Speaker 0: I start poking at this wall.

1094
00:58:57,562 --> 00:58:58,380
Speaker 1: That's not a good idea.

1095
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,179
Speaker 1: That sheet of ice is going to fall down on you.

1096
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:01,920
Speaker 0: So I realized this right away.

1097
00:59:01,981 --> 00:59:02,920
Speaker 0: So I back away from it.

1098
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,998
Speaker 0: I take the power washer.

1099
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:06,439
Speaker 0: I put some quarters in because I figured this is going to be worth it.

1100
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:07,080
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

1101
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:08,560
Speaker 0: I set it to the strongest setting.

1102
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,880
Speaker 1: This is not, it's gotta be on YouTube.

1103
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,059
Speaker 1: Why didn't you have a camera with you?

1104
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,280
Speaker 0: Because I was in high school.

1105
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:12,916
Speaker 1: Dumbass.

1106
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:15,298
Speaker 0: You wanted me to go find my, uh...

1107
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,620
Speaker 1: You should have had the foresight to know that 10 years later, YouTube would be around.

1108
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:19,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1109
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,439
Speaker 0: Back then the idea of a video on the internet was crazy.

1110
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:24,337
Speaker 1: Yep.

1111
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,399
Speaker 0: So I set it to the wide spray.

1112
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:26,936
Speaker 0: So I've got...

1113
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,519
Speaker 1: Well, I guess real player might've been out.

1114
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:41,620
Speaker 0: So I've got this basically hot sword of water and I proceed to cut the bottom of this ice sheet and eventually I hear creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, creak.

1115
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,320
Speaker 0: And then the thing just goes, it starts to fall like the whole thing in one sheet.

1116
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,779
Speaker 0: And then the top breaks off and it makes a tremendous mess.

1117
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:51,059
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1118
00:59:51,702 --> 00:59:52,560
Speaker 0: And then we drove away.

1119
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,399
Speaker 0: That pilot was there for another three or four weeks.

1120
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,049
Speaker 1: Sweet.

1121
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,799
Speaker 1: You should have done the other wall.

1122
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,279
Speaker 0: I'd already lost interest.

1123
00:59:59,922 --> 01:00:00,616
Speaker 1: Oh, that's too awesome.

1124
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,490
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
