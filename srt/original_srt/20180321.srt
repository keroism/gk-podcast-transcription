1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,254
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 21st 2018.

2
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:11,658
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,465
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:16,610
Speaker 0: We review Lou over the wall.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,466
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,314
Speaker 0: Got to do something.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,563
Speaker 0: I only get to do two or three times a year today.

8
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,150
Speaker 0: I wore the work in the snow.

9
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:28,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, so many people didn't go to work and it was totally fine.

10
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,950
Speaker 0: But I realized all the people who didn't go to work are the people who don't live in the city.

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,449
Speaker 0: Basically if you work in the city, but don't live in the city, it sucks and that's it.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,370
Speaker 0: So everyone who lives in the city was just in the office and everyone doesn't live in the city.

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,999
Speaker 0: He was working from home pretty much.

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,849
Speaker 0: I got to wear my fancy boots.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,974
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean you could wear them whenever you want.

16
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,277
Speaker 1: You don't have to wear them when it's news.

17
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:52,873
Speaker 0: They're so big and There's.

18
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:59,389
Speaker 0: they're the most comfortable shoes I own but they're so big and clunky that it's there's very few occasions to ever wear them.

19
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:03,790
Speaker 1: My pre my boots that I were very expensive and high quality.

20
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,830
Speaker 1: The rubber part just like had cracks in it recently, so I had to get new one.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,743
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and then I realized wait, these are so old.

22
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:13,130
Speaker 1: I had them when I lived in Beacon.

23
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:24,309
Speaker 1: You can't be too salty about that No, but I bought new ones and the new ones I got I guess were highest rated on Zappos or whatever And they're the kind where there's no laces or anything.

24
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,130
Speaker 1: So at first I ordered the regular size, but they were all slippy.

25
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,249
Speaker 1: So the size smaller and that was better.

26
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:39,439
Speaker 1: But the inside of them is all like fuzzy and cozy like a slipper you would wear in your house But you would never know when by looking at him.

27
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:44,659
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's like I'm walking around and my feet are like But everyone you looking at me.

28
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,589
Speaker 1: It looks like I'm wearing a clunky boot.

29
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:54,186
Speaker 0: I have like a leather boot in insert that is itself as big as an entire boot and I can wear that like a giant comfortable slipper.

30
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,080
Speaker 0: And then inside of the boot is that.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,747
Speaker 0: but then the boot itself is like this monster.

32
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,943
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, they seem very good to keep my feet warm and dry.

33
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,270
Speaker 1: So yeah, no complaint.

34
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:11,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, the snow is not really a big problem and everyone's kind of freaking out about it, but we don't drive Yeah, we don't go far to work.

35
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,062
Speaker 0: Don't have to shovel.

36
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:17,869
Speaker 1: No, cuz it seems like Just it is Cold, which is fucking bullshit.

37
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,689
Speaker 0: It'll be warm soon enough, but I might ski this weekend with all this snow.

38
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,423
Speaker 1: I mean this climate change really some false advertising.

39
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:25,448
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be 90 degrees.

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 1: I burned coal to make it 90 degrees in March and it has not yet to be 90 degrees in March.

41
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,055
Speaker 1: I'm very upset.

42
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,088
Speaker 0: I gotta see how much snow we're getting.

43
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:34,470
Speaker 0: upstate Cuz.

44
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,222
Speaker 0: actually I think the snow is coming here more than it is up there.

45
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,293
Speaker 1: So just burn more coal this year Rolling your coal.

46
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,396
Speaker 1: That's right.

47
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:43,599
Speaker 1: I gotta get it to be warm.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,121
Speaker 1: It's too cold.

49
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:47,190
Speaker 0: So you got any anime or animation related news?

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not super news.

51
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:50,680
Speaker 1: This is movie.

52
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,970
Speaker 1: they came out and anime movie.

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,850
Speaker 1: They came out like late 2016 and I guess there at least I didn't notice any talking about it.

54
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,134
Speaker 1: But that could just be like it.

55
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:00,636
Speaker 1: just be me.

56
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,824
Speaker 1: I think I saw this mention.

57
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,470
Speaker 1: I heard it mentioned like one time.

58
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:13,910
Speaker 1: So this is a movie that's in the sad Hiroshima genre, which is it's a genre a common genre Japanese works of all mediums obviously.

59
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:21,604
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's called in this corner of the world and the news is that this shit is on Netflix and people didn't even fucking know about that.

60
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,470
Speaker 1: So I plan to go home and watch this on Netflix as soon as I get a chance.

61
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,398
Speaker 0: All right, I guess this will be our next Wednesday show.

62
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,210
Speaker 0: maybe the geek nights movie club watch this movie.

63
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,556
Speaker 0: We're gonna review it soon.

64
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:41,168
Speaker 1: But yeah, uh, it's like wow, there's an anime movie That's totally legit that you know showed up on Netflix and I the only reason I know is one person tweeted it.

65
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:43,099
Speaker 1: one person No one else said a damn thing.

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it wasn't for that one person I wouldn't even know and it wasn't for me.

67
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:48,205
Speaker 1: You wouldn't even know so speak.

68
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,290
Speaker 1: How did that go under the radar?

69
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,039
Speaker 1: I don't I don't know.

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,244
Speaker 0: I I Vaguely was aware of this.

71
00:03:53,264 --> 00:04:03,370
Speaker 1: in the same way There's not many anime movies that figure if any one of them is even screened Anywhere outside of Japan that there'll be like a big explosive, you know news at least in the nerd.

72
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:11,803
Speaker 0: Yeah or in the very least we'll like find out just the way we do and get tickets and go see it because I usually be In New York, I guess we missed this until now, but we're good.

73
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:29,690
Speaker 0: But speaking of a tweet If you don't follow Anna Twitter like Mike tool at all Darryl sir, like all those types of people Mike reminded me today of saw of a chapter of my life That was very important to me and people who were fans not just of anime but of East Asian cinema.

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,098
Speaker 1: Well any cinema that wasn't United States in.

75
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,105
Speaker 0: so you young kids might not understand.

76
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 0: but when we went to college It was rare to have a DVD player.

77
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:43,078
Speaker 1: They were when we got to college freshman year No one none of us owned one.

78
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,003
Speaker 1: There was a cherry.

79
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,110
Speaker 1: we had VHS players.

80
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,382
Speaker 1: It was a DVDs or super news.

81
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,065
Speaker 1: the year 2000, you know.

82
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:51,421
Speaker 1: DVDs I think came out in the late 90s, but people still.

83
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:53,310
Speaker 1: they were not widely adopted in 2000.

84
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,501
Speaker 1: They became widely adopted between 2000 2003 for yeah.

85
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:07,102
Speaker 1: And when we got to RIT the ps2 was brand new freshman year the year 2000 and it had a D. It was a DVD was a DVD player, which was you know.

86
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,788
Speaker 1: nowadays it's like oh, it's a bure pair.

87
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,470
Speaker 1: who cares, right?

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,197
Speaker 1: But it's like at that time it was like whoa.

89
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,309
Speaker 1: I need a DVD player anyway and a ps2.

90
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,373
Speaker 1: It's the same deal.

91
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,518
Speaker 1: It's like a huge deal.

92
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,562
Speaker 1: It's like it was a bargain.

93
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:18,686
Speaker 1: cuz you're getting more important.

94
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:19,409
Speaker 1: You're getting twofer.

95
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:34,553
Speaker 0: DVD was like doubly important in that era because an anime VHS box set Tended to cost two to four times more than the exact same show in a DVD box set and DVDs on anime were starting to Come out that year 2000.

96
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:37,684
Speaker 1: That's when they first started making them for reals.

97
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,490
Speaker 0: So we didn't have any money.

98
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:45,109
Speaker 1: There was a charity casino night that we went and gambled fake money to attempt to win a ps2.

99
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,330
Speaker 1: We want all air between us and we failed.

100
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,590
Speaker 0: I wonder what would happen across all our different dorm rooms if that would have been a radioactive man number one situation.

101
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,429
Speaker 1: Well, the other people we know bought a ps2 at some point.

102
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:57,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, he didn't.

103
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:01,330
Speaker 1: so what we did and our TV was much larger and superior.

104
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:05,209
Speaker 0: But what we did is the summer between our freshman and sophomore year.

105
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:09,850
Speaker 0: Was this golden age where DVD players are actually really expensive?

106
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:15,329
Speaker 1: yeah, they were like three four hundred dollars, but there was a particular brand of.

107
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,643
Speaker 0: I don't want to say they were bootleg, but they were dodgy as fuck.

108
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,730
Speaker 1: This was the year 2001 2002.

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, not 2000.

110
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,930
Speaker 0: this company called apex.

111
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:30,630
Speaker 1: You could buy these apex branded DVD play was sort of like Vizio TVs used to be where it's like.

112
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,740
Speaker 1: What the hell is that brand?

113
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,398
Speaker 1: I never seen the TV like Magnet box.

114
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,214
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't that it wasn't like that But it was like this brand.

115
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:41,110
Speaker 1: you never heard of suddenly producing electronics and selling him at the store.

116
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:48,022
Speaker 0: So we learned from the early internet while we were at our IT That the apexes were special for two reasons.

117
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:53,700
Speaker 0: one if you bought one It costs like hundred bucks 60 bucks.

118
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,723
Speaker 1: Sometimes they were.

119
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,890
Speaker 1: they were el cheapo crapo DVD players.

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,276
Speaker 1: We're up until that point.

121
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,607
Speaker 0: I think I would circuit city to get one.

122
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:04,323
Speaker 1: up until that point I had borrowed stolen a DVD player from someone else.

123
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:05,950
Speaker 1: That was actually a Sony legit one.

124
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, that DVD player was a part of.

125
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:08,545
Speaker 1: that was my.

126
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,490
Speaker 1: that was my best DVD.

127
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:14,167
Speaker 0: Well, we know for a fact that Scott's owned that DVD players.

128
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:14,970
Speaker 1: That is correct.

129
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,206
Speaker 1: DVD player belong to Scott.

130
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,247
Speaker 0: Whatever anyone on the show even knows that.

131
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:20,630
Speaker 0: anyway.

132
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,775
Speaker 0: That's that's somebody.

133
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:25,450
Speaker 0: if you were a fan of us in like 2005 you might know what we're referring to anyway.

134
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:37,669
Speaker 0: So I did research and learn that if you buy an apex, not only are they cheap Not only are they shitty But it worked if y'all bought the right one.

135
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:46,117
Speaker 0: Meaning you had to look at the serial numbers look for particular Combinations of numbers and like you had to look at the box and like figure this out I was at a circuit city.

136
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was not buying on the internet days.

137
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,694
Speaker 1: This was buying in a store.

138
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:53,144
Speaker 0: like I went to stores like bigger stores wouldn't carry.

139
00:07:53,284 --> 00:08:01,030
Speaker 1: apex drove a car innocent In the suburbs of the college town to I heard to circuit city in the Best Buy to look at DVD player.

140
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,572
Speaker 0: that's why I didn't even have these things.

141
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:21,576
Speaker 0: now I heard tell that a circuit city a couple towns over had a bunch of them and They were just in their original boxes on a pallet on the show floor Which is what I needed because I had to look at the serial numbers and the version numbers and the model numbers to get this Particular one that was either region free.

142
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:28,609
Speaker 0: We'll get back to what that means and why we cared or Was capable of being hacked to become region free.

143
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:42,371
Speaker 0: So the reason we cared was that if you there were a lot of anime DVDs But more importantly a lot of like weird East Asian cinema DVDs that were not region one Right.

144
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:47,410
Speaker 1: So even that expensive high-quality Sony player would not play some of it some of the easy one.

145
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,438
Speaker 1: And now some DVDs were unlocked.

146
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:56,506
Speaker 1: like we'd go to video barn and they would have a bootleg DVD that would work No matter what but but even video barn would flag like some of the movies they had.

147
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:57,330
Speaker 0: they're like guys.

148
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,338
Speaker 0: This is region to like.

149
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,850
Speaker 0: they put a warning on the box, right?

150
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:04,890
Speaker 1: It's like you needed to have this hack DVD player to watch any DVD in the world because they were all region locked.

151
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:21,445
Speaker 0: So I it's funny because my tool tweeted about this I think ever almost everyone from this particular era of anime fandom or East Asian cinema fandom in the u.s Did the same thing about the same shitty apex DVD player because it was region free.

152
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:28,290
Speaker 0: and then in retrospect We probably only watched like four things that needed the region freeness at any point.

153
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, also that DVD player is so crappy had problems like overheating and such.

154
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,290
Speaker 1: so we would like take the lid off.

155
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,269
Speaker 0: Yeah I Burned this DV.

156
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,714
Speaker 0: Well, I burned a CD and I put it in there and I did some stuff to it that hacked the firmware to make it Truly region free.

157
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:46,990
Speaker 1: eventually we graduated to HD PC and we were still watching DVDs.

158
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,656
Speaker 1: What you do is the HD PC.

159
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,462
Speaker 1: you'd have a piece of software called any DVD.

160
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:53,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would unlock your CD ROM some CD.

161
00:09:53,833 --> 00:10:01,545
Speaker 0: so some DVDs would just play on Computers without much effort and some you had to mess with you make it work.

162
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,610
Speaker 0: I That's this whole era flooded back to me.

163
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:14,407
Speaker 0: So if you wonder why Anna Twitter is talking about a particular shitty DVD player from the early 2000s, that is why mm-hmm in some other really tiny news.

164
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:22,207
Speaker 0: Adventure time which I feel like we're gonna have to do a big like even a bus short series on adventure time.

165
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,174
Speaker 0: once it's done done Do something it's good.

166
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:24,797
Speaker 0: It's ending.

167
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,487
Speaker 1: It is end and ending the end of all of them.

168
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,270
Speaker 1: There are comics.

169
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,622
Speaker 1: I don't know if the comics will end but TV show will end.

170
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:32,766
Speaker 0: the TV show not.

171
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:33,348
Speaker 1: they might make.

172
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,794
Speaker 1: who knows if they'll make Anything else?

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,101
Speaker 1: I don't know they could be moving.

174
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,146
Speaker 1: who knows what they're gonna do, right?

175
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:37,850
Speaker 1: It's completely unknown.

176
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:46,680
Speaker 1: But the actual adventure time TV show the original core real deal is going to have a final episode Five episodes from now.

177
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:52,249
Speaker 0: there is a teaser trailer up now Hinting at the what the end arc will be.

178
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,438
Speaker 1: I don't know like do they mean five?

179
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,690
Speaker 1: because adventure time is a weird show where one episode is like two tiny ones.

180
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,810
Speaker 1: But usually it's like there'd be a tiny new one and then a tiny old one next to each other.

181
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:11,824
Speaker 1: So is it gonna be ten tiny episodes or five half-hours like I have no Five 15 minute episodes like how long is that these five episodes gonna be?

182
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:13,950
Speaker 0: there's so the thing adventure time.

183
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:24,830
Speaker 0: like I really like Steven Universe, and I like a lot of shows, but I think adventure time is going to Survive and be remembered as one of the most important and influential cartoons in American animation history.

184
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:30,390
Speaker 0: Mmm, like it's it's had a long enough run and these she's all started with that crap.

185
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,701
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's short that we watched at our IT.

186
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:39,344
Speaker 0: Who knows when we watched that we watched that at our IT I remember very specifically because we were for like a week.

187
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:46,510
Speaker 0: We were like algebraic And then we just forgot about it and then later someone was like hey, you know They turned it into a garden network TV show.

188
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,030
Speaker 1: It's real like I didn't realize it like when adventure time had become a TV show Like I was like, I feel like I've seen these characters before.

189
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like I didn't quite put it together that oh that weird little one-off short somehow became a legit.

190
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:01,990
Speaker 0: I didn't even start watching it until several seasons in and I didn't watch it several seasons in either.

191
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:07,723
Speaker 1: But then I watched every episode up to a point Sometime, I don't remember maybe a couple years ago.

192
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:09,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like, alright, it's gonna end.

193
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,784
Speaker 1: Do you say well, I will just stop watching now and when it ends then I will go.

194
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,213
Speaker 0: whoosh you're there's a lot That's happened.

195
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:17,699
Speaker 1: I'm sure a lot has happened.

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,490
Speaker 1: But if I think about adventure time, it's real quick to watch.

197
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,289
Speaker 1: You can just burn through so fast.

198
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:36,832
Speaker 0: but the the most impressive thing about it and the reason why I put it on such a high pedestal is that the sheer scope of Eames the end styles that it is embraced over its run is Shocking.

199
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:41,105
Speaker 0: they're like pick any like for random seasons and watch one random episode.

200
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:48,470
Speaker 0: They're so different You might not even realize they're the same show and yet they are all thematically tied.

201
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:51,540
Speaker 0: Despite this the scope is breathtaking.

202
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:57,450
Speaker 0: The fact that it's ending is actually a pretty big deal Mm-hmm, and then Scott will finally watch a bunch of this.

203
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,650
Speaker 0: I don't even know how they're gonna resolve all the Jake stuff that they mean.

204
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,930
Speaker 1: I you know, it's gonna be one of those things and they don't resolve everything which is dope.

205
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,456
Speaker 0: Well what I want what I wonder?

206
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:13,830
Speaker 0: I don't care if they resolve any details of the story because it's kind of like Evangelion and end of Evangelion if you cared about those details you miss the point.

207
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,035
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

208
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:18,010
Speaker 0: what I'm wondering about is how are they going to resolve this?

209
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:23,979
Speaker 0: cyclical almost hero of time Story around Finn on the meta level.

210
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:24,541
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

211
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:25,144
Speaker 0: There's the.

212
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,650
Speaker 0: the themes are what I want to see.

213
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,795
Speaker 1: We don't have to resolve it.

214
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:34,610
Speaker 0: You just had to you know, well, I'll put it this way Where are they going to leave the overarching theme of the show?

215
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,534
Speaker 0: Irrespective of the details?

216
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,843
Speaker 0: because they've hinted at a lot of very interesting directions.

217
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:46,921
Speaker 1: There's not much time left to Solidify that you can only do so much in five episodes.

218
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,948
Speaker 1: However big those five episodes are.

219
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,995
Speaker 0: Yep They could have just kept going forever.

220
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:54,566
Speaker 0: Finn's been aging at a rate of one year per actual year.

221
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:59,790
Speaker 0: The show has been produced Like he had his birthday in the show and it lines up like recently.

222
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,800
Speaker 0: so I was kind of hoping they would keep going.

223
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:19,763
Speaker 0: and when I'm in my 80s like Finn the human is like 70 something and he's just like the show is being animated by 20 year olds for your 80.

224
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:22,640
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day what do you got?

225
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:28,613
Speaker 1: So this is a really kind of simple deal here, but it's a whole lot of fun.

226
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:29,716
Speaker 1: Even though it's so simple.

227
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,283
Speaker 1: It's a website and This website.

228
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:42,576
Speaker 1: all you do is put in a URL of an image or upload an image or upload an image and It will take that image and put it on a flag on a flagpole and wave the fuck out of it.

229
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:43,057
Speaker 1: in 3d the edge.

230
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:54,287
Speaker 1: Oh, you can choose between Dexter and sinister hoisting yeah, and you can change the flag to be vertical horizontal left right up or down and you can turn the wind on and Off and that's about it.

231
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,399
Speaker 1: And you should definitely put a good goatsey flag up there first.

232
00:14:58,423 --> 00:14:59,468
Speaker 0: You were trying to do.

233
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,659
Speaker 1: how can you resist that as your first option?

234
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:08,320
Speaker 0: I Feel like goatsey is fading from the public like internet culture and consciousness.

235
00:15:08,428 --> 00:15:09,764
Speaker 0: Yeah probably for the best.

236
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:20,120
Speaker 1: but the point is if you need to say for example make like a YouTube video or a movie or Some kind of short and in that you want to have a scene of a flag wave I guess I don't know what kind of rights are tied to this.

237
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:20,947
Speaker 0: I guess I don't have any right.

238
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:26,740
Speaker 1: pretty sure you could just screen capture The box of the flag waving and scale it up to 1080p and you're good to go.

239
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:28,513
Speaker 0: Whatever will happen if I zoom it out.

240
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,122
Speaker 0: Look if I zoom in It doesn't.

241
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,709
Speaker 0: it zooms the web page, but not the flag.

242
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

243
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,860
Speaker 1: The point is this is pretty cool and fun.

244
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,234
Speaker 1: Yeah is a nice amusement for a short time and also possibly a useful tool.

245
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:50,916
Speaker 0: So speaking animation you might remember I'm pretty sure we made this thing today a long time ago But IBM made a movie an animation like an actual animated cartoon a short.

246
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,000
Speaker 1: IBM made a lot of stuff.

247
00:15:52,041 --> 00:16:03,728
Speaker 0: There's the Jim Henson IBM Movies and shit, but this was the one that was literally constructed of individual Adams Titled a boy and his Adam.

248
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked about it a long time ago.

249
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,085
Speaker 0: I'm confident We did so.

250
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,840
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is not the animation because that's old old news.

251
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:19,786
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is that I found all these videos that explain in detail how the hell they made an animation with Individual visible Adams.

252
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,020
Speaker 1: Well recently there was that photo of a single Adam, right?

253
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,295
Speaker 1: somebody won like the the science photo of the Year award with.

254
00:16:27,657 --> 00:16:30,050
Speaker 0: so this is Utterly fascinating.

255
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,400
Speaker 0: and these videos are all short.

256
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,580
Speaker 0: They're like two minutes.

257
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,306
Speaker 0: even if you have no attention span.

258
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:44,937
Speaker 0: you can watch this video and learn a weird story about how IBM made a machine to literally move an individual Adam around so that they could create a stop-motion animation.

259
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,593
Speaker 1: Adams are pretty small So they're good for short attention.

260
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:51,147
Speaker 1: Yeah You can see a lot of them all at once real easily.

261
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:55,800
Speaker 0: in the moment the book club book is the Odyssey by Homer.

262
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,400
Speaker 1: So I I loaded that shit up on the kindle on my iPhone.

263
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,645
Speaker 0: I start reading it now.

264
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:03,175
Speaker 1: basically the Kindle says I'll finish reading in like 12 13 hours.

265
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,740
Speaker 1: So add up poops and train rides and of 13 hours and that's what I'm gonna finish.

266
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:13,834
Speaker 0: I think we'll do the gig the gig nights book club on Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey.

267
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:20,032
Speaker 0: a week or two after packs 12 or 13 poop train hours from now you burn through it pretty quick.

268
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:20,876
Speaker 0: Once you start reading.

269
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,220
Speaker 0: Did you start reading?

270
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:29,450
Speaker 1: I'm rereading intro because I you know, just yeah Because I read the intro and then I forgot half the intro.

271
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:33,683
Speaker 0: The intro is actually really good like really interesting I learned.

272
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:36,779
Speaker 1: I'm obviously going through the intro pretty quick because it's the second reading of the.

273
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,084
Speaker 0: yeah It's kind of.

274
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:40,251
Speaker 0: it's quite good to reread it if you were fuzzy on the details.

275
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:47,226
Speaker 0: cuz reading the actual Odyssey and keeping that in Mind is really important But it's it's good.

276
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,340
Speaker 0: Otherwise, uh, if you want to go to our website right now.

277

Speaker 0: There will be some content for you that will not make it to YouTube, but we're gonna try to do the thing on YouTube.

288
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:58,020
Speaker 0: So if you show up to this panel think of yourselves as the live studio audience.

289
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:01,553
Speaker 1: I mean normally I tell people it's PAX you get something better to do.

290
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,340
Speaker 0: don't come and see anything better to do.

291
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,767
Speaker 0: It's Sunday morning.

292
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Sunday morning is actually like the time.

293
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:16,088
Speaker 1: Maybe you could consider coming and frankly maybe if you want to know something better to do But not much not as much as other times of that.

294
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:18,415
Speaker 0: also unlike other PAX is I like?

295
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,860
Speaker 0: I've realized something with our fans.

296
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,347
Speaker 0: It's real easy for people to find us at all.

297
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:33,700
Speaker 0: The PAX is except East East is so big and so dense that There are friends we know who go to PAX East who we never bump into in tabletop at any point.

298
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:36,792
Speaker 0: So if you're trying to find us there you're basically effed.

299
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:42,419
Speaker 0: so this is the only Guaranteed way to find us at PAX East.

300
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:52,447
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we went to see at the New York International Children's Film Festival as we do anime movies And one of the movies we saw is loo over the wall.

301
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:56,200
Speaker 1: This is the like opening of the festival movie, right?

302
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,349
Speaker 1: It was dubbed which I was surprised.

303
00:19:58,409 --> 00:19:59,817
Speaker 0: I didn't know that was good though.

304
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:00,420
Speaker 0: That's fine.

305
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:01,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about that.

306
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 1: some of the characters sounded like my little pony characters.

307
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:11,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did not look at who the voice actors were to confirm that but I was so sure that girl was Pinkie Pie pretty quick, maybe.

308
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:18,100
Speaker 1: So yeah, so this is also made by Masaaki wasa who we talked about recently who did an Adventure Time short.

309
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, we talked very easily for Devilman crybaby.

310
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,234
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know this dude.

311
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,020
Speaker 1: It's like wow, he's making tons of crap.

312
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,968
Speaker 1: Yep, it's all over the place.

313
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:34,558
Speaker 0: if I had to on a really high level I try to pin down what I would think of when I think of Masaaki Yuasa Things that are a little bit weird.

314
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:36,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't what I would say.

315
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,520
Speaker 1: But what I noticed is he has this distinctive art, you know artistic style as most you know.

316
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:49,008
Speaker 1: You don't tell just looking at it like it'll go a little flat a little like stretchy Usually usually what the way you can tell it's his.

317
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:56,943
Speaker 1: the lines of the characters get a little bit wobbly Right almost like they're made with like a wiggly pencil Sort of.

318
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:09,100
Speaker 1: and like they're like they'll deform a little bit in sort of a Picasso Esque like you take an anime character and then like you don't go full Picasso But you like slightly Picasso it with wiggly outlines.

319
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:13,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's what the Yuasa style looks like and you can see it in all his animes.

320
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:17,060
Speaker 1: But what's interesting in Lu over the wall is most of the time?

321
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:24,800
Speaker 1: The characters are like not drawn in that style or only have very tiny hints of his style showing through like a character.

322
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,920
Speaker 1: We'll have like, you know a slightly elongated neck and you'll notice you know.

323
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:35,780
Speaker 1: But then in scenes where appropriate where shit gonna you know goes crazy and magical and crazy things happen.

324
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:39,080
Speaker 1: Then everything like goes like super Yuasa land.

325
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it happens like that like a song starts and it's crazy crazy crazy in your face, right?

326
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,748
Speaker 1: That's the visual things about this.

327
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,040
Speaker 1: also it's a it's anime movie with a big budget so it looks great in general.

328
00:21:50,722 --> 00:22:03,430
Speaker 0: The only thing I'll say though if you if you think because you like Lu over the wall that you should immediately watch other things He's made like Devilman crybaby Just look at what those things are Before you watch them.

329
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm going to say.

330
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:09,739
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the second thing is I didn't know you might not know this is a musical, right?

331
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:16,144
Speaker 1: Since it was dubbed we had all replacement music and the replacement music was It was fine.

332
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:16,686
Speaker 1: It was okay.

333
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I won.

334
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,220
Speaker 1: I'm curious what the original music was.

335
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:22,340
Speaker 0: I'll find some clips to watch in Japanese.

336
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:29,220
Speaker 1: Yeah I wonder I don't know if it was a Situation where the music was the same and they re-sang it or if it was completely new music or not.

337
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:29,583
Speaker 1: I don't.

338
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:30,089
Speaker 1: I don't know.

339
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:34,511
Speaker 0: I believe Someone in my Twitter feed said it's the same song.

340
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,680
Speaker 0: They just translated and re-sang and they I believe it.

341
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:44,160
Speaker 0: But the vague story of this we won't spoil anything because it's an anime movie and it's good and it's big-budget.

342
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:45,298
Speaker 0: You should just go see it.

343
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you need the short review just go see it like find a pirate.

344
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:50,823
Speaker 0: if you have to see this movie It's good.

345
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:51,526
Speaker 0: You'll enjoy it.

346
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,100
Speaker 1: You'll probably marry in the witch's flower.

347
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:55,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like.

348
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:59,197
Speaker 0: This is better than sort of a stranger.

349
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:05,138
Speaker 0: Yeah It is better than many many most of the anime movies we've reviewed.

350
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:05,760
Speaker 0: It's really good.

351
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,447
Speaker 0: It's got flaws.

352
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:07,073
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

353
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,099
Speaker 1: No, but If I it's not like a paprika.

354
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:21,779
Speaker 0: But if I had to say like what I like about it the most on an abstract level without getting into details or spoiling anything It moves way faster than you expect it to.

355
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:28,940
Speaker 1: well I think all Yuasa's work sort of this sort of breakneck pace where things keep moving along crazy fast and seemed disjointed.

356
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:35,809
Speaker 1: But you can still put them together in your brain like like it'll cut to a C me Things will start happening.

357
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:36,373
Speaker 1: You're like what.

358
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,359
Speaker 1: did we just skip all that?

359
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,051
Speaker 1: Like I don't understand.

360
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:44,960
Speaker 1: and then 10 seconds later You just sort of accept it and go along with it and put it together in some way in your brain.

361
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:55,633
Speaker 0: Yep But like if you want to say like you want a really simple sample of what that can look like watch the adventure time Episode that he did because it is literally like normal adventure time.

362
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:57,197
Speaker 1: He also did a space dandy hips.

363
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:00,027
Speaker 0: I think so I don't even I never finished that show.

364
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:10,560
Speaker 0: I should mmm, but the movie also Covers a lot more ground and a lot more themes than you would expect from the first four minutes of the movie.

365
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:19,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think because of the speed of it that you they fit more into it Even though it's also felt like you'll get to a slightly long, but it didn't feel like it dragged Like.

366
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:21,174
Speaker 1: it just felt like he kept doing stuff.

367
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:24,340
Speaker 0: at no point Do you think oh I know where this is going because you're wrong.

368
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,380
Speaker 0: No, I had no idea was good and to you'll get to a plan.

369
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,599
Speaker 1: It would be happy ending because it's a kids movie, but that's about it.

370
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,980
Speaker 0: But it also took a pretty dark swerve that could have continued swerving.

371
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:48,820
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but some of it is it's sort of like, you know It has one of those situations where there are things happening where if you really think about what's happening It's really dark, but it's presented in a way that makes it seem, you know bright for children, right?

372
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,232
Speaker 0: Yep, which is part of the.

373
00:24:50,273 --> 00:25:07,280
Speaker 0: well We'll talk a few spoilers toward the end of this because I have some specific thoughts, but I don't want to ruin Interesting aspects of the movie because the fact that you're gonna have a hard time Figuring out where this movie is going is a big part of how you both how you might enjoy it the first time you watch it.

374
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:16,879
Speaker 0: There's a lot of music in it and you'll get to a point where someone's dad shows up and you're wondering what that's gonna be Like and then the movie is just like 90 to return for a while.

375
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:33,950
Speaker 0: It's also subtle in that there's a lot of little things that happen on screen and A lot of little things that happen in the background that if you notice them are really fascinating But you'll probably miss a lot of them right they cram.

376
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,420
Speaker 1: it's weird for your move for an anime movie.

377
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:44,250
Speaker 1: It feels like he put as many characters in as you'd have in like a TV series, but none of them feel like Flat or useless like I know.

378
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,400
Speaker 1: but the screen time of some of them is short.

379
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,960
Speaker 1: But you still get their idea and they complete their arc even though they're only in there a little bit.

380
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:53,487
Speaker 1: You can make a hole.

381
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:56,240
Speaker 1: you can make almost half a Simpsons with the amount of characters.

382
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:04,384
Speaker 0: there's a million characters who all have a recognizable arc and all have a recognizable and Relatively complex character.

383
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:06,610
Speaker 0: for how many seconds of screen time they have.

384
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the grandpa the old lady.

385
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:13,612
Speaker 0: Yeah There's every one of these characters.

386
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a Simpsons carrot.

387
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Speaker 0: It's like moves the you get about the level of most his lack and season six seven of the Simpsons like he's there.

388
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,647
Speaker 0: There's a character there.

389
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,800
Speaker 1: There's a complete aside.

390
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,312
Speaker 1: There's a. there's a mighty Moses like comic book coming.

391
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:33,795
Speaker 0: what I feel like I need to read that Go ahead and buy this is like was my favorite Simpsons character for like three seasons.

392
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:36,607
Speaker 1: Oh the comic book store again I'll be out in like a month or two.

393
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:36,908
Speaker 1: Now.

394
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:38,575
Speaker 0: You're thinking of a guy with two knives.

395
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:55,827
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But the music that not only is this a musical but it is a story about Characters who make music and characters who are invested in music and the power of music The literal magical power of music.

396
00:26:55,887 --> 00:26:56,068
Speaker 1: like.

397
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:59,580
Speaker 1: it's not one of those things where like, you know, they talk about the power of music.

398
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,836
Speaker 0: It's like don't make don't don't ever sing songs by the water cuz the fucking mermaids will come.

399
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:07,289
Speaker 0: get you and it's true That is literally the plot.

400
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:21,153
Speaker 1: the mermaids like hey I see you got an electric guitar there and then you play music for the mermaids and then they cast a spell and make everyone dance, yep, like Literally happens not some sort of you know, oh metaphorical thing.

401
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:21,755
Speaker 1: It's like no.

402
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:25,703
Speaker 1: Yep that straight up magic but The.

403
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:33,904
Speaker 0: so the movie on a face value tells a really good kids story like for this is a fantastic Movie for a kid to see.

404
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,225
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

405
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,810
Speaker 1: I mean it was at the children's film.

406
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:51,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it it is perfectly understandable within the bounds of Masaaki Hwasa and And straightforward on a direct face value reading because we talk about that a lot with you Tana and our antenna analysis show how you can something.

407
00:27:51,442 --> 00:28:04,060
Speaker 0: the the mark of good allegory is when you have a show or a movie or a work that Works completely on a face value and works completely on its higher order metaphorical or allegorical level.

408
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:14,260
Speaker 0: this movie does that very well and The metaphors in the allegory that are addressed are actually pretty complex and some of them are pretty subtle.

409
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:25,120
Speaker 0: it is very easy to read the simple concept of mermaids as Presented in this movie as a direct metaphor for death and loss or for immigrants.

410
00:28:25,563 --> 00:28:32,590
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, and both of those stories work entirely self consistently and do not conflict with each other.

411
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,295
Speaker 0: or the face value story of.

412
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,485
Speaker 0: there are literal mermaids in this town where For literal specific reasons.

413
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:45,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also, you know, this all the sub stories Right also have their own sort of like messages and arcs right all the way.

414
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,589
Speaker 1: You know the smallest one being like.

415
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,360
Speaker 1: there's a girl who does the PA system for the town.

416
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:56,699
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the fact that she had her holes arc and story and the echoing came back at the end, right?

417
00:28:57,081 --> 00:29:11,186
Speaker 1: It's like she's this character You never see except for like near the end when one of the main girl like visits her for like a minute And I but you get her whole deal and she helps in the end and does a thing and this person is maybe in the Movie for a total of like two minutes,

418
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:12,189
Speaker 0: but my man

419
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,139
Speaker 1: her her story not only matters to the plot And she helps save the day or whatever.

420
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:23,100
Speaker 1: But you know, she has like this message about like what you should you do with your life and such in meaning and whatnot.

421
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,880
Speaker 1: Like, you know just her thing, you know has another message to to give right?

422
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,220
Speaker 1: It's not like this one big message of the movie with everything contributing.

423
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:35,675
Speaker 1: It's all these small separate messages that are all delivered separately.

424
00:29:35,695 --> 00:29:43,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they all Sort of resonate together to form a wave of like this higher-order metaphor, right?

425
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,160
Speaker 1: They all they all like peak in climax and resolve together, right?

426
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:59,220
Speaker 1: the big and one of the bigger ones is like You know this battle in the town for like trying to get more tourism money because it's a it's a small town But nothing going on and all the kids want to leave because there's no future there.

427
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,339
Speaker 0: But it also peaks with the literal battle of the the old lady and her allies with spares trying to kill mermaids.

428
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:18,186
Speaker 0: Yep There's there's a lot going on and I was very impressed with the ability for all those stories and characters to work and not feel Disjointed or distracting or plotting.

429
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,350
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

430
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,315
Speaker 0: I mean, I really like this movie.

431
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:25,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like character wise you've got like.

432
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,893
Speaker 1: the main character is just.

433
00:30:26,954 --> 00:30:29,664
Speaker 1: you know, you seem sort of like a Cliche.

434
00:30:29,684 --> 00:30:30,674
Speaker 1: you see an anime a lot.

435
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:30,835
Speaker 1: Yes.

436
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:34,007
Speaker 0: He's the Dude, who's boring?

437
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,651
Speaker 1: He's almost like Takumi.

438
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,416
Speaker 1: He's really good at a thing.

439
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:38,880
Speaker 0: He's just Shinji Takumi.

440
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:42,496
Speaker 0: Yeah takes Shinji and Takumi mix him together talking me from initial D.

441
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:52,577
Speaker 1: If you don't know we're talking about Yeah, really bored really good at something but doesn't care also makes but then you know discovers mermaids and is like Oh now he's got a thing going on.

442
00:30:52,759 --> 00:31:04,940
Speaker 0: Yep You know unleashes his driving power or his robot fighting power or whatever music making but he also makes all the same Very poor decisions for dubious reasons, but the reasons make sense in the context of he's a dumb kid, right?

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,092
Speaker 1: But all the other characters are all crazy and fun, right?

444
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:09,879
Speaker 1: So you got this main girl who's sort of wacky.

445
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got.

446
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:11,618
Speaker 0: she's like Pinkie Pie.

447
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:20,599
Speaker 1: You got me got main energetic friend who reminds me of like Skeeter from Doug But his I guess his dad owns the is a shrine as a monk in the shrine or something like that.

448
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:23,775
Speaker 0: Oh, yes does remind me of Skeeter, right?

449
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:27,959
Speaker 1: Yeah We talked about the girl with the PA system.

450
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,599
Speaker 1: We got the like dad who's like, you know that the go to school do a good job do something.

451
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,095
Speaker 1: I love your life dad, but that dad was in a rock band.

452
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:35,920
Speaker 1: It was a hidden past.

453
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,230
Speaker 1: You got grandpa who's making umbrellas, but you don't know why.

454
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,755
Speaker 0: until then you find out why.

455
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,188
Speaker 0: but then that ties into Grandpa's like.

456
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,560
Speaker 1: don't go messing around with their mermaids.

457
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,670
Speaker 1: Grandpa clearly knows something about magic and isn't saying anything.

458
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,600
Speaker 0: grandpa's umbrellas tie into the death metaphor.

459
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:55,420
Speaker 1: He's a lot like the grandma and witches flower, right?

460
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,300
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, is that old character who is in on the magic deal, but they have the scenes they're done with it.

461
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,140
Speaker 1: It's part of their past but now the young kid is experiencing it.

462
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,435
Speaker 0: but they always have the scene where they see the evidence of the young kid interfacing with the magic.

463
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:10,239
Speaker 0: and they always go like Mmm, like the knowing.

464
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,435
Speaker 1: But they let it go because they know they turned out.

465
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:13,817
Speaker 1: All right.

466
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,325
Speaker 1: Yep You obviously have the crazy mermaids.

467
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:21,640
Speaker 0: the mermaid dad the giant hilarious that mermaid dad is is my second favorite character.

468
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:23,266
Speaker 0: Yeah is so great.

469
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:30,619
Speaker 1: You've got the the people who own like the fishing company in the town What you think is the main girls family, but to give you an example of like how?

470
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:40,705
Speaker 0: Subtle because there's so little screen time for any of these characters to tell one of these stories that the PA system girl That's got mentioned earlier in The very beginning of the movie.

471
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:46,534
Speaker 0: There's just this disembodied voice coming over loudspeakers Announcing like some mundane crap.

472
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,580
Speaker 0: that's happening in the town.

473
00:32:48,061 --> 00:33:01,056
Speaker 0: It's like the background sound during the panning shots and the establishing shots and it's really annoying and funny Because she says everything like and today today ten here all these echoes.

474
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:09,998
Speaker 0: the town council Will be meeting will be meeting will be and it's like really drawn out and funny this.

475
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:11,865
Speaker 1: and it's a running jet It's a running gag.

476
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,720
Speaker 1: every time she makes an announcement, but then that run you don't know.

477
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,873
Speaker 1: You hear them mention the characters name they're like, oh so-and-so is making the announcements.

478
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:22,184
Speaker 0: you never see this person another characters like Oh, she's back in town.

479
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:23,227
Speaker 0: Wow, that's sad.

480
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:44,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then not only is her arc important, but the specific issue with the echoing is both important in the Literal plot at the end of the movie and is important to explain her arc and the arc of another character To get so much value out of a

481
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:47,279
Speaker 1: running running joke about the town being structured in a way.

482
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,580
Speaker 1: There's a fishing village right and we're talking about Lou over the wall.

483
00:33:50,861 --> 00:34:00,260
Speaker 0: This is literal rock wall in the town that casts a shadow over the town almost like the historical Legacy of the town cast the shadow over the future.

484
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,812
Speaker 1: I was like a legend of like the wall keeping mermaids out or something.

485
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:06,200
Speaker 1: the shadow of the wall is the shrine at the top.

486
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,813
Speaker 0: Is the only reason the mermaids even live here.

487
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:09,940
Speaker 0: the mermaids are?

488
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:11,527
Speaker 0: You see where I'm going with this.

489
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:23,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mermaids get burnt by the Sun like vampires yep, but it's almost like the shadow of history is both Informing the town but also holding the town back.

490
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:28,547
Speaker 1: I mean, oh well is like the easiest metaphor All time right.

491
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,010
Speaker 1: walls and fire are like a two Two go-tos that are so easy.

492
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,159
Speaker 1: It's like the softball is things ever?

493
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,539
Speaker 0: So you should see this movie.

494
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,833
Speaker 1: If you're an anime fan go see this movie kids to see.

495
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,139
Speaker 1: I don't know how you can see it.

496
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,760
Speaker 1: I'm sure it'll be available streaming or star somehow at some point.

497
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:51,018
Speaker 1: I kind of want to see it subtitled instead of L dub just to see.

498
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:55,487
Speaker 0: yep I didn't want to get into spoilers at this point because I feel like we just see this movie But I do want to.

499
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:56,739
Speaker 0: it's not really a spoiler.

500
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:14,016
Speaker 0: But the only thing that bothered me at all, but it did bother me was that they coded Lou the mermaid pretty young like very young child But simultaneously framed it as almost a sasami situation of technically.

501
00:35:14,056 --> 00:35:14,558
Speaker 0: She's 900 years old.

502
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:27,323
Speaker 0: but they also coded her relationship with the main character as both childlike wonder big brother like show me the world and Romantic.

503
00:35:27,705 --> 00:35:33,063
Speaker 1: I read it more as a The.

504
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:36,417
Speaker 1: the girl is like some sort of alien and she doesn't really.

505
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:44,412
Speaker 0: I did too I know and the movie does go out of its way to make it clear that They that they the mermaids do not understand humans.

506
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,800
Speaker 0: They are these ageless weird beings.

507
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:55,711
Speaker 0: they are utterly alien, but at the same time she acted like a little kid and then this Much older kid was very much romantically interested in right.

508
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,777
Speaker 1: well imagine of Lou is like a teenager.

509
00:35:57,797 --> 00:35:58,680
Speaker 1: that would have been also

510
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:04,119
Speaker 0: Now if Lou was also a teenager that would have been more monster girl that would have been more much more, okay

511
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:09,679
Speaker 1: Mmm, but then you got to start like, you know I think it'd be creepy because like then you start putting boobs on there and shit.

512
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,037
Speaker 0: She could have been a little coated a little older.

513
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:17,040
Speaker 0: but That's interesting because not really a spoiler again.

514
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Speaker 0: But like I said, the mermaids are very clearly also used as a metaphor for death.

515
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:29,560
Speaker 0: like there's a scene early on where he takes Lou around and They garner an animal shelter where there's a bunch of dogs.

516
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:34,114
Speaker 0: It is clear those dogs were going to be put down like that is obvious.

517
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,840
Speaker 1: Yep, so don't to adults.

518
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:41,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lou bust open the wall Turns all the dogs into mermaid dogs.

519
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,357
Speaker 1: The mermaid dog is the best character in.

520
00:36:44,377 --> 00:36:48,972
Speaker 0: the mermaid dog Continues to be an important part of the story all the way to the.

521
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:51,060
Speaker 1: yes, but the mermaid dog is the best character.

522
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:58,277
Speaker 1: It's a cute doggie that's super excited but instead of two leggies he's got a little mermaid tail where the plushies.

523
00:36:58,537 --> 00:37:01,565
Speaker 1: I want to see them not without giving spoilers.

524
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:10,716
Speaker 0: just trust me that there there are many points where the idea of someone becoming a mermaid is very Specifically tied to the idea that that person has died.

525
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:18,639
Speaker 0: Yep Simultaneously that is reinforced by Lou Saving all the dogs in the shelter by turning them into mermaids.

526
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:27,115
Speaker 0: During that scene Lou when the main character isn't looking Almost turns him into a mermaid.

527
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:43,736
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm There is a reading of this that this kid was depressed in contemplating suicide maybe not at the point of actually consciously contemplating it but on that road and That's pretty apparent the way he interacts with everyone and the way other characters are all sort of worried about

528
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:43,997
Speaker 1: him.

529
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:52,569
Speaker 0: and because it's Japan Yeah, so that is the tip of the iceberg of the Interesting things to read into this movie.

530
00:37:52,609 --> 00:38:06,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the situations in which the mermaids turn humans into Mermaids, you know killing saving them right our situations in which that human is in dire life-threatening danger And that's why it seems like they're saving them.

531
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:10,111
Speaker 1: It's like oh, they're gonna die I'll turn them into a mermaid so they don't die.

532
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:15,509
Speaker 1: or but turning into a mermaid is dying And it's hard to really like.

533
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,660
Speaker 0: I promise we could back the things we're up saying up quite a bit more.

534
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,147
Speaker 0: But just see the movie.

535
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,780
Speaker 0: I don't want to like ruin all these little tiny details.

536
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:26,492
Speaker 0: You'll you'll get it and it's real good and it's definitely worth seeing.

537
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:30,346
Speaker 1: it's worth seeing more than any other anime movie I've seen in recent months.

538
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,720
Speaker 0: This is the best anime movie I have seen since.

539
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:35,945
Speaker 0: What what is the?

540
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,792
Speaker 0: what's the last movie paprika?

541
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:39,479
Speaker 1: No, you're going that far back.

542
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:45,059
Speaker 0: What's the movie since paprika that we would say is better than this better than that.

543
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:46,742
Speaker 1: I need to look at it.

544
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:48,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did it.

545
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:51,870
Speaker 0: Nothing immediately jumps to mind for an anime movie at least.

546
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,029
Speaker 0: hmm, I Might be able to name an animated movie.

547
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,120
Speaker 1: I like summer was more than this.

548
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:01,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think summer wars was a simpler story.

549
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:07,080
Speaker 0: Yes, but somewhere this is in the same level of quality as summer wars.

550
00:39:07,281 --> 00:39:08,547
Speaker 0: I'll definitely agree with that.

551
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:09,392
Speaker 1: It's real close.

552
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:18,265
Speaker 0: Yeah the in terms of animation It's also summary in war Z and I will say if the only way you can see this in the theater is a dub Dub is totally fine.

553
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:18,726
Speaker 1: It's not.

554
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:19,448
Speaker 1: game won't kill you.

555
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:20,913
Speaker 0: the dub works.

556
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,260
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I'm not seeing it.

557
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the double the dub did not sound like an anime dub.

558
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,980
Speaker 1: It sounded more like a character who's clearly also voiced by someone who does voice them a little pony.

559
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that is still didn't sound like an anime dub.

560
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:43,590
Speaker 1: it sound more like a normal cartoon voiceover I think for the first few minutes cuz I don't watch a lot of dubs the Disjointedness of the voices plus the mouth movement.

561
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it put me in that dub.

562
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:49,180
Speaker 1: It gave me that dub feel in my body, but then it went away.
