00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,124
Speaker 0: It's Monday March 1st.

00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:11,966
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:17,940
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight getting people to actually read the words on the screen.

4
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:32,820
Speaker 0: Had a weekend of skiing that was half epic win and half epic epic fail.

6
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,514
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there was the whole fail with like the renting a car.

7
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:37,600
Speaker 1: Is there more fail than that?

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,764
Speaker 0: There is more fail than that.

9
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,350
Speaker 0: So I should have stayed home.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,800
Speaker 1: We could have played some games watch some hockey.

11
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:43,725
Speaker 0: I was worth it.

12
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:45,133
Speaker 0: in the end though rental car fail.

13
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,220
Speaker 0: There was a bunch of snow.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,135
Speaker 0: So the rental car place is just like yeah, you know what we closed.

15
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,039
Speaker 0: you're not gonna get your car.

16
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:51,819
Speaker 1: He could have taken the skiing bus.

17
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:59,376
Speaker 0: Yeah the skiing bus that's $85 a person and as I saw gets there kind of late and had some other trouble.

18
00:00:59,416 --> 00:00:59,917
Speaker 0: because you see

19
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:02,068
Speaker 1: point if it gets there Late and you want to scale

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:08,659
Speaker 0: we get there right and as we're pulling up We're running like a few minutes late and I wanted to get there right when the slopes open But I see how the lift isn't even running yet.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,708
Speaker 0: Obviously, they're having a late start.

22
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:11,251
Speaker 0: This is good.

23
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,860
Speaker 0: getting here earlier would have been a mistake.

24
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:15,710
Speaker 0: Oh, there was no power on the mountain all night.

25
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:17,778
Speaker 0: Oh, they just got power.

26
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:22,600
Speaker 0: now Most of the lifts aren't working and there are record crowds.

27
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:23,747
Speaker 0: What do they do?

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,660
Speaker 0: sell everybody lift tickets?

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,178
Speaker 0: Let them get in line and they get them all pissed off.

30
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:35,420
Speaker 0: There are people screaming and hunter-mountain employees in line demanding refunds screaming that they're gonna charge back their credit cards.

31
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:40,400
Speaker 1: I would demand a refund, you know, if I have a ticket and then lift doesn't work.

32
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:44,260
Speaker 1: It's like if I go to Disney World and you know Space Mountain is closed.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,641
Speaker 1: That's it.

34
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:45,966
Speaker 1: That's you know, sure.

35
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,812
Speaker 1: That's it happens sometimes right?

36
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,300
Speaker 1: I got a Disney World and every ride is closed.

37
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:58,240
Speaker 0: There's a ton of lifts But there's only one lift from the bottom all the way up to the top and that one was running then.

38
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:07,438
Speaker 1: But the wait to get up it was like an hour Because it was basically every single person was lined up and it only goes person two people.

39
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:16,515
Speaker 0: Yep I don't get in this line and I wait an hour and I go up to the top and I find out that none Of the other lifts are working up there and the backside of the mountains is completely fucked.

40
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:17,197
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:20,600
Speaker 1: So How could skiing?

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,655
Speaker 1: Get stopped by snow?

43
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:31,160
Speaker 0: You know how that happens if you ski in New York, there really aren't any really actually good ski places.

44
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,577
Speaker 0: They're all a little bit chintzy.

45
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:37,499
Speaker 0: I mean I look at a blue or a black and the places that my friends at work all ski.

46
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:41,180
Speaker 0: And it makes Hunter Mountain look like this tiny little baby mountain with tiny little babies.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,149
Speaker 1: Why don't you go where the people are workers skiing?

48
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,046
Speaker 0: because I have to fly out there and spend like a week to make it Worth it.

49
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,346
Speaker 1: Oh They're flying in like Colorado.

50
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:49,510
Speaker 0: They're going to Colorado.

51
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,895
Speaker 0: Oh, they're closest.

52
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,120
Speaker 0: They're going is Vermont.

53
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,929
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Vermont is actually huge with skiing.

54
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,973
Speaker 1: Yeah gigantic.

55
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,220
Speaker 1: You can go to Poconos, I think right?

56
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:59,497
Speaker 0: So here's the problem.

57
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:05,095
Speaker 0: though I was I would have just charged back my credit card said fuck all this and hang out in the lodge drinking all day and Then gone home.

58
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,200
Speaker 0: But the snow was the best snow New York State has probably ever seen.

59
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:14,560
Speaker 0: It was like two feet of like awesome powder and moguls and bumps everywhere.

60
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:25,580
Speaker 0: So I stuck with it and after about three hours They got everything working enough to where I could ski the rest of the day And they kept the lifts open an extra half hour at the end of the day to make up for it.

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,700
Speaker 0: So all in all I'm not super mad because the skiing was pretty good.

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,998
Speaker 0: But here's the epic fail and this did not involve me at all.

63
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:33,827
Speaker 0: The lift on the back mountain.

64
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,599
Speaker 0: they got power back on so they turn that lift right back on.

65
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,939
Speaker 0: Bunch of people are on the lift, you know going down the West Mountain.

66
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,420
Speaker 0: Scogel and I are like, hey, let's go down the West Mountain.

67
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:46,015
Speaker 0: We're just about to go down the run when this guy's like stop.

68
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:46,337
Speaker 0: Stop.

69
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:46,618
Speaker 0: Stop.

70
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:47,100
Speaker 1: Don't go down.

71
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,986
Speaker 0: The lift just broke.

72
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,435
Speaker 0: There's no way back up if you go down there And we look and we see all these people sitting on a lift.

73
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:55,020
Speaker 0: Stop going.

74
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:56,816
Speaker 0: Better better better better.

75
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,966
Speaker 1: So you're about to get on a lift.

76
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,676
Speaker 0: well, we were about to go down the back of the mountain.

77
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:12,865
Speaker 0: the only way Anywhere from the bottom of those runs is up the lift that broke or walking two miles through the mountains back to the main lodge Around the base of the mountain.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,519
Speaker 1: Whoa, they don't have like an emergency service road or anything.

79
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:16,923
Speaker 0: They do.

80
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:21,366
Speaker 0: but you got to walk two miles on it and damned if they're gonna drive a car down It's a service road.

81
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,618
Speaker 1: They're gonna drive us like a snowmobile back there.

82
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,000
Speaker 1: something.

83
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a hundred two hundred people down there.

84
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,607
Speaker 0: So they just made them all walk.

85
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:30,380
Speaker 1: really they fixed it for long enough to get 200 people down there.

86
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,339
Speaker 0: No, cuz you can go down you just couldn't get back up.

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,251
Speaker 1: So all these people went down when the lift wasn't running.

88
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,680
Speaker 0: they went down just as the lift had started up.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,086
Speaker 1: 200 people went down.

90
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,192
Speaker 1: a lift starts 200 be one.

91
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,578
Speaker 0: Sheesh basically.

92
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:44,480
Speaker 0: Yeah This was the most crowded ski weekend like ever.

93
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,107
Speaker 1: Like people are just like.

94
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:49,466
Speaker 1: hundreds of people were standing there a lift Activated and they all went.

95
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:56,540
Speaker 0: basically and in fact show Joe and I we're standing there right and we're like, oh What are the odds that the lift will start up in the next few minutes?

96
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,140
Speaker 0: You think we can just go down anyway, because that was the one I wanted to do that run.

97
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,458
Speaker 0: It would have been worth it almost.

98
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,768
Speaker 0: So that's not the real epic fail.

99
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,261
Speaker 0: The real epic fail is captain snowboard Mm-hmm.

100
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:09,846
Speaker 0: We're on the lift like the main lift.

101
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:18,936
Speaker 0: going back up means go Joe and we see you know a snowboarder who's not doing so well Way up in front of us and he is he on the lift or is he?

102
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:19,720
Speaker 0: he's actually snowboard?

103
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,209
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz I saw a video on the internets of a snowboarder on the lift who fell off the lift and landed face-first in The snow for the holes.

104
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,380
Speaker 0: I think I saw that same video.

105
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,350
Speaker 0: Okay, and those friends are like is he okay?

106
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,034
Speaker 0: and he didn't move.

107
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:31,140
Speaker 0: Yeah video ends.

108
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,512
Speaker 0: So he's coming down the mountain.

109
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,460
Speaker 0: He hits a mogul.

110
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,725
Speaker 0: He clearly didn't know what to do.

111
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:39,980
Speaker 0: and he flips over and disappears in like a sea of powdery snow.

112
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,585
Speaker 0: So we're all laughing on the lift.

113
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:48,097
Speaker 0: People's are clapping and then his snowboard comes flying out of the debris down the mountain.

114
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,341
Speaker 0: Hit.

115
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,370
Speaker 0: somebody in the skis flips him away.

116
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,399
Speaker 1: So a snowboard just did poop.

117
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,359
Speaker 1: Yes, the guy was still in the snow.

118
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,768
Speaker 0: The guy was in the snow snowboard no longer on.

119
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:01,702
Speaker 0: the guy going down the mountain snowboard just popped out going down the mountain like A rocket.

120
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:03,949
Speaker 1: how could it go so fast on its own?

121
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,485
Speaker 0: because it's going straight down and there's no guy on it anymore No one controlling it.

122
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:13,149
Speaker 0: I mean when you ski you kind of go left right left right around the buff You don't go straight down the mountain.

123
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:13,894
Speaker 0: That's how you die.

124
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:14,276
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,247
Speaker 0: So it's picking up speed.

126
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:17,735
Speaker 0: it takes one guy out.

127
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:22,411
Speaker 0: at this point Everyone that lift is yelling look out look out and I look down.

128
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 0: it goes past us and there's this whole chain of people skiing And it it's going straight for the person in the front and you hear in the distance as the guy sees it Oh shit, and then it hits his skis knocks him down all the people behind him running to him.

129
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,564
Speaker 0: It's this giant disaster.

130
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:37,747
Speaker 0: It keeps going.

131
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,860
Speaker 0: it took out like five more groups of people and disappeared in the distance.

132
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,433
Speaker 1: So how did the snowboarder get down the mountain?

133
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,319
Speaker 1: so on his ass.

134
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:53,597
Speaker 0: So I you know get up to the top we ski back down and I see this guy Walking down the mountain slowly and carefully and I'm like lose your snowboard.

135
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:57,919
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah You see where it went and I was like, there's probably gonna be some police waiting for you at the bottom.

136
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,315
Speaker 0: He's like what it do.

137
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,577
Speaker 0: That's exactly what he said what it do.

138
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,351
Speaker 1: Would they really police make you an arrest?

139
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,356
Speaker 0: He actually he broke.

140
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,546
Speaker 0: he didn't break a lot I don't think but one.

141
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 0: you're not supposed to let your snowboard come off and to you have it.

142
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,707
Speaker 1: No, he can help it.

143
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,118
Speaker 1: Did he take it off on purpose?

144
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:17,420
Speaker 0: is the thing?

145
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:27,740
Speaker 0: You can't use devices on a ski resort like on a slope that don't have Arresters on like my skis if they pop off like if I screw up and flip over and I just happened a couple times.

146
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,717
Speaker 0: These things pop out of the ski like brakes so it can't actually go down the mountain.

147
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,282
Speaker 0: It stops Uh-huh.

148
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:34,647
Speaker 0: He did not follow the rules.

149
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,140
Speaker 0: They probably were waiting down there with his snowboard to cut his lift ticket off.

150
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:41,600
Speaker 1: All right, yeah.

151
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:42,900
Speaker 0: So that was some of the epic fail.

152
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:49,619
Speaker 0: Also, the road was closed on the way down when we were trying to leave not due to the snow But did a brawl at the pub.

153
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:53,199
Speaker 1: Of course, what are pubs for?

154
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,554
Speaker 0: Brawling and getting adventures.

155
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,730
Speaker 1: Yes So I spent this weekend.

156
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,684
Speaker 1: I put together a home theater Computer.

157
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,370
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah how that thing turned out.

158
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,815
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I want my.

159
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,500
Speaker 1: basically he was my situation, right?

160
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,960
Speaker 1: It was like, okay, I can get another Mac Mini.

161
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:14,618
Speaker 1: The problem with the Mac Mini was that I had to get special cables to make the HDMI and stuff work.

162
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,369
Speaker 0: pros We know the form factor is great already.

163
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,377
Speaker 0: It's basically silent and tiny and looks good.

164
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,692
Speaker 0: pro We know all that Apple stuff works really really well.

165
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know boxy runs on it.

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,699
Speaker 0: Yeah cons it costs more money than everything else Yeah, and it needs a special cable to hook up to the TV and it can't emulator anything unless you buy BS.

167
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's.

168
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,490
Speaker 1: this is the thing here, right?

169
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,707
Speaker 1: All it could really do is play Video, right?

170
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:50,520
Speaker 1: It can't do other things Like, you know, I wanted to play Street Fighter which I bought on Steam right on my TV Even though I bought it for the computer which I could do if I had a computer connect to my television.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:09:00,392
Speaker 1: But the Mac Mini even if I put Windows on it with the boot camp not powerful enough to really play Street Fighter 4 Right or trying trying was another game trying to the ps3 only game.

172
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:03,365
Speaker 1: and if you saw the news today good read good thing I don't have a ps3.

173
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:12,191
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah we'll talk about that next week once we find out the end run, but You know, the thing is I want.

174
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,376
Speaker 1: I bought trying on steam.

175
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,260
Speaker 1: I want to play it on the TV.

176
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,754
Speaker 1: So I needed a. I wanted something that could you know play.

177
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:22,286
Speaker 1: it didn't need to play like, you know The crisis or whatever.

178
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:31,880
Speaker 1: It just needs to play, you know regular old, you know Middling, you know has that a middle-of-the-road 3d ness so it could play those kind of games on the TV, right?

179
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:38,020
Speaker 1: Otherwise Right, if I'm not gonna get that middle-of-the-road 3d ness to play games on the TV.

180
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:40,729
Speaker 1: I might as well not even get a Mac Mini.

181
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,100
Speaker 1: I should just get the Nvidia ion net top.

182
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:44,984
Speaker 1: Well, that

183
00:09:45,346 --> 00:10:06,915
Speaker 0: is the crux of the issue that there are a million devices now That'll do like home media in some degree like some sort of connected to your TV like I have the Roku and the Mac Mini was one too, but You should either Figure out these specific things you want and buy a device that just does that and accept the fact you're gonna have a bunch of Devices to do different things or go all out and get the full-on general-purpose device.

184
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:08,400
Speaker 0: that will do everything, right?

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,274
Speaker 0: I want to minimize box, which is also cheaper than the Mac Mini.

186
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:11,797
Speaker 1: That's right.

187
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:17,003
Speaker 1: So The Mac Mini would have been like seven hundred dish and then a cable It could have.

188
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:19,359
Speaker 1: it would have been an eight hundred dollars ish in total, right?

189
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,372
Speaker 0: Yep, plus you need a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse or something to go right.

190
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:23,934
Speaker 1: exactly.

191
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:28,792
Speaker 1: the Nvidia ion computer Right would have been like four hundred maybe even five hundred dollars.

192
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,560
Speaker 1: when all was said and done right way cheap.

193
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,052
Speaker 1: But again, it would basically do the same thing.

194
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:38,260
Speaker 1: the Mac Mini did play video But it would be a little bit flaky because the CPU is an Intel atom.

195
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,480
Speaker 1: It's not that powerful, but it has the Nvidia ion chip.

196
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,800
Speaker 1: So it could play 1080p videos right smoothly.

197
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:48,760
Speaker 1: But it really would depend on if you can get the hardware acceleration working.

198
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:51,920
Speaker 1: So even though it works it pretty much just works.

199
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:56,274
Speaker 1: But there might be a few cases of trouble here and there where you couldn't.

200
00:10:56,354 --> 00:11:03,417
Speaker 1: you had a video that you couldn't Accelerate the decoding with the GPU and it would be flaky and you couldn't get it to run smoothly on the 1080p.

201
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:09,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's a little bit risky But it's so much less money and in 90% of the case is gonna work.

202
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,488
Speaker 1: So if all you want is video right.

203
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,802
Speaker 1: Nvidia ion was the winner right now, so I'm like, okay I'm on.

204
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:20,160
Speaker 1: the Mac Mini is now out right and the Nvidia ion is the choice.

205
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:23,532
Speaker 1: But I kind of want to be able to play these games.

206
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:32,920
Speaker 1: so I investigated and I'm like, okay What if I try to make my own Nvidia ion computer and put like a PCI Express graphics something like that, right?

207
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,600
Speaker 0: Now I did discounted that in the past because the last time I looked at the like the mini AT cases and all the things I could use or micro ATX.

208
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:48,144
Speaker 0: They weren't nice enough or at least I didn't trust them because I didn't know anyone who'd used one and I couldn't find power supplies That were quiet enough.

209
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,900
Speaker 1: Well, the Nvidia ion is actually mini ITX, right?

210
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,098
Speaker 1: And the thing with mini ITX is that all the Kate, you know There was some cases that were small and kind of nice.

211
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:09,012
Speaker 1: ish Right and some of the motherboards were actually had everything you need right on the board, you know There's no reason to buy like an aces triple-e because you can just build your own But because it's mini ITX and everything is weird.

212
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,960
Speaker 1: It's like is this really gonna work?

213
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,693
Speaker 1: You know if I buy one of these it's like what power supply do I get?

214
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,500
Speaker 1: and they were like all these weird power supplies.

215
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,246
Speaker 1: You know, there wasn't really a set step.

216
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:25,464
Speaker 1: like I saw an ITX motherboard with an ATX, you know power supply connector but the case was like 60 watt power supply.

217
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:31,950
Speaker 1: and I'm like why you know that gonna work with this motherboard and you had to get you couldn't put a Big hard drive in there.

218
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,099
Speaker 1: You get a tiny one.

219
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,079
Speaker 1: So I'm like if I get a tiny one, you know, is that gonna work?

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,540
Speaker 1: Am I gonna have the right serial ATA connectors, you know everything gets weird when you go into the micro ITX.

221
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:48,499
Speaker 0: I think that's partly I'll showing our age because remember back in the day We were willing to accept a lot more BS like that a long time ago.

222
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean remember when I mean a computer like will this motherboard work was a concern of any computer?

223
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:54,352
Speaker 0: Yeah

224
00:12:54,661 --> 00:13:08,200
Speaker 1: I mean if I did enough research I could have figure out a Combination of parts that would have worked or I could have thrown up my hands and bought, you know An already built NVI on which is probably gonna be just as good in the end Maybe even with a nicer case because the parts would have been packed in more close.

225
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,370
Speaker 0: There is a third option that we have not everyone has.

226
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:14,173
Speaker 0: you could have crowdsourced it to the listeners Find out what they would have been.

227
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:22,026
Speaker 1: I was basically like Alright, so, you know, I said I specked when I was like, okay, so then I'm like, alright Let's look at like another option.

228
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:25,760
Speaker 1: The other option was to get a micro ATX board, right?

229
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:35,275
Speaker 1: Which is you know, it's an eight, you know, basically I don't really see a reason why anyone today should buy An ATX motherboard, right?

230
00:13:35,596 --> 00:13:40,311
Speaker 1: I mean they're really So Few people need right.

231
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:50,773
Speaker 1: all the extra, you know All you really get with a full-size ATX motherboard these days is a bunch of extra PC eyes and PCI Express slots that most people do not need.

232
00:13:50,974 --> 00:14:04,244
Speaker 0: well to be fair when I was looking at mine For what I wanted I couldn't find a micro or a mini case that I liked that would have worked with my setup that's true, but remember you can always put a A micro.

233
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,820
Speaker 1: most ATX motherboards you can put a micro ATX motherboard in there.

234
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, though at the because I wanted I had some weird requirements.

235
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:11,974
Speaker 0: I wanted Intel.

236
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:19,740
Speaker 0: I'm done with using like I have Intel Yep, but for what I wanted specifically I couldn't find a micro one that had what everything else I want.

237
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,799
Speaker 0: I want to get into the details of it.

238
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,977
Speaker 0: But I couldn't find basically a micro or a mini motherboard that had everything exactly that I wanted.

239
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,530
Speaker 0: that was also Reasonably priced compared to the ATX ones that did the same.

240
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,440
Speaker 1: So I got a hundred and twenty five dollar aces motherboard, right?

241
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:33,528
Speaker 1: It can take an i7 i5 or i3.

242
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,732
Speaker 0: It can take up to 16 gigs of.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,388
Speaker 1: There's four slots, right?

244
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,094
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's only the dual channel.

245
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:42,977
Speaker 0: Not that that matters.

246
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:43,880
Speaker 1: None of the matters.

247
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,820
Speaker 1: It's got six serial ATA ports, right?

248
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,447
Speaker 1: It's got a PCI Express slot for the.

249
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:51,855
Speaker 1: for the video card the x16 onboard sound.

250
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:55,879
Speaker 1: Yeah onboard sound All right with optical out HDMI out, right?

251
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,470
Speaker 1: What I learned though is the HDMI out is actually you.

252
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,538
Speaker 1: it's this integrated graphics, right?

253
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:02,200
Speaker 1: It's not that great.

254
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,600
Speaker 1: It's Intel integrated graphics, but the Intel integrated graphics is in the CPU.

255
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,199
Speaker 1: So if you get a CPU that doesn't have it, it won't work.

256
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:16,752
Speaker 1: I mean the CPU will still work but the integrated graphics would just be like you don't have an integrated graphics Processor because you didn't buy a CPU that had one in it.

257
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:17,817
Speaker 0: So what do you need like an i5 i7?

258
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Speaker 1: We know and I three, you know.

259
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,347
Speaker 1: You just had to look certain.

260
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:25,567
Speaker 1: as long as you buy the right i3 i5 i7 It will have the iGPU.

261
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,837
Speaker 0: and see I didn't bother with any of that research.

262
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:31,060
Speaker 1: when I built my compound Using the iGPU I bought a video card.

263
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:38,604
Speaker 0: basically all I did was look at I'm I want to buy at the plateau of price for the i7 and the plateau was the like $270 chip.

264
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,450
Speaker 1: this motherboard is optical out.

265
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,393
Speaker 1: It's got.

266
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:41,894
Speaker 1: it's pretty.

267
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,118
Speaker 1: it's got DVI VGA.

268
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:43,820
Speaker 1: It's got everything.

269
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,981
Speaker 1: It's got USB 3. right for reals USB 3.

270
00:15:47,981 --> 00:16:00,699
Speaker 1: So when USB 3 stuff comes out, like if I can get a USB 3 external drive, I'm set All right, so I bought this fancy motherboard that it's basically a. it's a perfect motherboard period if you're built Even if you're building a desktop, it just happens to be micro ATX.

271
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I got the i3 CPU because I don't need it to be that powerful, right?

272
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,138
Speaker 1: I don't need this.

273
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,716
Speaker 1: I didn't need to spend the extra hundred two hundred dollars even more to get the i5 or i7.

274
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:16,320
Speaker 1: You know, the only advantage of getting the i5 is that it has that, you know automatic overclocking feature.

275
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:17,664
Speaker 1: I didn't need that right?

276
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,812
Speaker 1: I got this ultra quiet PSU.

277
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:23,640
Speaker 1: I got you know, four gigs of RAM.

278
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,374
Speaker 1: I basically built a $900 computer.

279
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,920
Speaker 1: The only thing is I got this case that was a horizontal case that was designed for home theater PC.

280
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,187
Speaker 1: So it looks like a piece of home theater equipment.

281
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:38,020
Speaker 0: So that's my real real question because I don't trust those things for shit.

282
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:39,913
Speaker 0: How was it actually build inside of the thing?

283
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:40,879
Speaker 1: It's a. what do you mean?

284
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,300
Speaker 0: Like was it easy to install the motherboard and everything?

285
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,300
Speaker 1: It was incredibly easy to install the motherboard easier than my to do it in my mid tower.

286
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,749
Speaker 0: See now that that that basically solves.

287
00:16:49,890 --> 00:17:03,780
Speaker 0: I had this suspicion because my other computer, you know The old one that was in geek night sound before it was at the time like one of the better rated like full tower cases But it was kind of a pain in the ass to like route all the cables and everything in it my current mid tower.

288
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:10,987
Speaker 0: It took me like two minutes to put everything in and I think it's just a fact that in the last year or so Every case now is just fine.

289
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:13,075
Speaker 1: Yeah this case it was a Lian Li case.

290
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,291
Speaker 1: So it's you know, it's high quality Yeah, and basically all it is was you open it up and it's just.

291
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,834
Speaker 1: it's just.

292
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,045
Speaker 1: it's basically an empty box Really?

293
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:20,829
Speaker 1: I mean it was.

294
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,440
Speaker 1: there was nothing in there, right?

295
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:29,656
Speaker 1: Except for you know the stuff on the edges Right, and the only thing in there was a tiny metal crossbar that you would remove to put the motherboard in.

296
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:29,916
Speaker 1: now.

297
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:43,540
Speaker 1: that metal crossbar You know gave the case some structural integrity and it also sort of had this hard one single hard drive bracket attached to it Right and then in the front near the CD-ROM exit there was another bracket other than that.

298
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:49,390
Speaker 1: It was basically an empty box and you just take the crossbar out You drop the motherboard in you drop the power supply in.

299
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,760
Speaker 1: you got some extra room between the power supply.

300
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,311
Speaker 1: Does it have IR integrated?

301
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:56,139
Speaker 1: There's no infrareds.

302
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,925
Speaker 0: No, I was.

303
00:17:56,985 --> 00:18:05,300
Speaker 0: I wandered because I didn't see a lot of things that have that I mean every motherboard or anything I saw that had integrated IR was either weird like really weird or old.

304
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:09,360
Speaker 1: Now see I am actually having some trouble with controlling this computer, right?

305
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:18,940
Speaker 1: I have a wireless USB mouse that I you know that it was extra that I've been using right but for keyboards It's like I don't you know, it's like I could go and try to use.

306
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,187
Speaker 1: The motherboard doesn't have Bluetooth.

307
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:25,571
Speaker 1: so I could try to use a Bluetooth dongle and use a Mac keyboard Which would be okay if it worked.

308
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:26,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's too much.

309
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,188
Speaker 1: It's gonna be too much fiddling to.

310
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,859
Speaker 0: what about paying for one of those iPhone apps?

311
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,894
Speaker 1: Well, there are you know, there are many free iPhone apps.

312
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:33,880
Speaker 1: There is a Logitech.

313
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,123
Speaker 1: let me see what's it called.

314
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:42,832
Speaker 1: Logitech has a free iPhone app that allows you to Use your iPhone as a mouse and keyboard with any computer.

315
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:43,896
Speaker 1: Logitech touch mouse.

316
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:44,920
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you were showing that to me.

317
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:53,581
Speaker 0: There's a really crappy chintzy thing like that for the pre but so does not appear to install the free Logitech touch mouse server on your computer.

318
00:18:53,642 --> 00:19:07,060
Speaker 1: and then you install the free Logitech touch mouse app on your iPhone or iPod touch and as long as these your iPod your iPhone is on the same network as the computer You can use the iPhone as a mouse and keyboard to control the computer.

319
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:16,596
Speaker 1: The problem with this is that it doesn't work until you log in Right, and then if you have like, you know, one of those UAC things pop up.

320
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:17,459
Speaker 1: that's like admin.

321
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,008
Speaker 1: Yes No, you can't.

322
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,089
Speaker 1: suddenly the iPhone doesn't do shit Because it's locked out right.

323
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:26,199
Speaker 1: so but other than that the touch mouse works All right.

324
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:35,954
Speaker 1: the boxy boxy has a free app for the iPhone iPod touch that basically turns the iPhone iPod touch into a remote, you know up down left right?

325
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,459
Speaker 1: Okay back, you know You basically get those buttons and you get a keyboard.

326
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:48,129
Speaker 1: So when I'm running as long as I start I can start boxy with the wireless mouse and then use the boxy app on The iPhone to control boxy, which is pretty great.

327
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,216
Speaker 1: But as soon as the exit boxy, it's like.

328
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:57,000
Speaker 1: well now now What about you know, so I I've been taking my USB keyboard back and forth across the room because I don't have a spare.

329
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:08,009
Speaker 1: But I'm looking for you know, some sort of keyboard solution the boxy official boxy remote Thing the hardware one that is announced.

330
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,470
Speaker 1: right.

331
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:16,020
Speaker 0: if they just sell that on its own I would pay a lot of money to buy Right, so I'm pretty sure they are gonna sell it on its own.

332
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,767
Speaker 1: I think boxy made this big mistake.

333
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:23,111
Speaker 1: is they wanted to have the stuff to show at CES, which is good But they they're not able.

334
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:23,915
Speaker 1: where is it?

335
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:24,780
Speaker 1: It's we're waiting.

336
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:33,480
Speaker 1: It's like you Apple as I think one thing Apple does that's very smart for all the stupid things They do is they announce something at the last second and then they give it to you, right?

337
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,627
Speaker 1: So there's none of this.

338
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 1: forgetting about it, right?

339
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,636
Speaker 1: There's none of this, you know people when the excitement is at the max here.

340
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:45,375
Speaker 1: It is buy it right now Big excitement excitement drops off.

341
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,942
Speaker 1: Oh, you can buy it And we didn't.

342
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:48,367
Speaker 0: here's the trouble the box.

343
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:51,920
Speaker 0: boxy would have had a lot more excitement if they'd come to the game sooner.

344
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,560
Speaker 0: But I mean the Roku's been around for a long time already.

345
00:20:54,902 --> 00:21:01,475
Speaker 0: But the only thing boxy has going for it the boxy box At least not the boxy software is that their remote comes with it and it just comes with boxy.

346
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:02,820
Speaker 0: any nerd can just put boxy.

347
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:09,950
Speaker 1: Well boxy, you know wants you to just put boxy on anything, you know, but you know They want to sell the boxy box mostly to people who can't just put.

348
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,636
Speaker 1: you know, guys.

349
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:12,740
Speaker 1: They're smart nerds like us.

350
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,400
Speaker 1: I went to their event, you know, but I think they are gonna sell the remote on its own.

351
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,946
Speaker 1: They just aren't doing it yet.

352
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,070
Speaker 0: Well what now?

353
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:20,616
Speaker 1: I got the computer now, I need the remote.

354
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,861
Speaker 0: now what I imagined They have.

355
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,645
Speaker 0: they have two markets.

356
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:25,840
Speaker 1: if I buy something else then why would I buy this remote later?

357
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,179
Speaker 0: They're going to sell the remote to people like us.

358
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:34,667
Speaker 0: They're going to sell the boxy box along with the remote to people like us that we are then going to set up for our Parents.

359
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:43,833
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so to make the law to end this story right because the case is all home theater case I needed to get a low-profile video card.

360
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:50,620
Speaker 1: and the thing is, you know The I basically bought the best low-profile video card, which is an ATI something something and it works.

361
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,126
Speaker 1: It plays the games.

362
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,035
Speaker 0: Well, you're not gonna install Linux.

363
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,200
Speaker 0: It's probably okay.

364
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,348
Speaker 1: Well, no you want it.

365
00:21:56,368 --> 00:22:04,856
Speaker 1: All right, so here right, you know I was talking all you know the smack and the ATA fanboys in the forum came back at me like oh You're just full of shit, right?

366
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,998
Speaker 1: Because I was saying stuff like remember back in the day when we tried when you had the original Ubuntu computer in the living room and we couldn't use the ATI.

367
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:13,468
Speaker 0: There was the.

368
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:19,620
Speaker 0: it had an a video out as video out But you could not turn it on in Linux because the driver was so shitty, right?

369
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,080
Speaker 1: And because the car right but with the Nvidia card you would turn the computer on and immediately the video output would just work.

370
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:25,642
Speaker 1: Right.

371
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:25,963
Speaker 1: Yeah.

372
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:26,626
Speaker 1: Okay.

373
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,899
Speaker 1: So this ATI card was a little bit better than that old ATI card.

374
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:30,200
Speaker 1: a turn.

375
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,462
Speaker 1: I plugged in HDMI.

376
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:36,069
Speaker 1: I never plugged in VGA or DVI and boom and immediately showed up on the TV.

377
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:37,702
Speaker 0: It was but Right.

378
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:38,927
Speaker 0: There's clearly a buck here.

379
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:41,920
Speaker 1: Of course after I installed the Windows driver, right?

380
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,950
Speaker 1: Which is really shitty compared to the Nvidia one.

381
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,716
Speaker 1: I don't care what you people say, right?

382
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:47,700
Speaker 1: Guess what happened?

383
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,842
Speaker 0: Stop working.

384
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:53,679
Speaker 1: No, the image was still 1080p, but there was like a two inch black border around the screen.

385
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,757
Speaker 1: So I had to go into a hidden area and you know difficult to find so difficult to find.

386
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:11,480
Speaker 1: I had to google for How to find it right area of the ATI driver and find this over scan setting to Basically get the image to take up the entire size of my television.

387
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,481
Speaker 0: Wait, that doesn't seem to make sense because to me over scan used to be on SDTVs.

388
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:20,580
Speaker 0: you have that little extra area that wasn't technically supposed to be there.

389
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:32,680
Speaker 0: But you could turn on over scan support if you knew that you had those extra like, you know 30 or 40 or whatever quote-unquote pixel I mean, I basically put the over scan up two clicks because it was sort of dead discreet, you know settings.

390
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,844
Speaker 1: It wasn't a smooth slider.

391
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:40,004
Speaker 1: Yep, and it was then exactly the same size as my television and it's definitely 1080p for reals.

392
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:40,666
Speaker 1: It's not like.

393
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:43,395
Speaker 0: that sounds like a case of a bad into a bad.

394
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:44,760
Speaker 0: a non-intelligent default.

395
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:58,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't you know you at fanboys may have it correct, you know ATI talking about, you know 3d performance Versus price, you know for the card ratio if you discount, yeah, ATI might be currently winning.

396
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:09,533
Speaker 1: However, right ATI and I'm you know AMD they still fail on these fundamental Things, you know, does the product work?

397
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:11,400
Speaker 1: Does the video output correctly?

398
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:16,640
Speaker 1: You know that the basics you have to get all those fundamentals are far more important than your performance.

399
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:21,909
Speaker 1: I'll take an Intel chip Right over an AMD one every day.

400
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:27,107
Speaker 1: if an AMD one might be faster and it might be half the price It doesn't matter because you know what.

401
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:32,672
Speaker 1: if I take the heatsink off the Intel one, it'll just slow down And if I put the heatsink back on it'll speed up again.

402
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:35,636
Speaker 1: if I take the heatsink off the AMD one It'll just set on fire.

403
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:37,786
Speaker 0: now Stupid are you sure?

404
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:40,037
Speaker 0: I mean that was a problem with the old Athlons.

405
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:41,583
Speaker 1: That's true And you know what?

406
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:42,907
Speaker 1: That's enough is to be fair.

407
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:49,306
Speaker 0: your knowledge on on ATI and AMD is about Vintage.

408
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:55,980
Speaker 1: the last time you built a computer I just built a computer the other day the time before the ATI video card in it and it had a problem.

409
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,228
Speaker 1: Just the kind the exact kind of problem.

410
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,697
Speaker 1: I predicted it would have a fundamental problem.

411
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:01,560
Speaker 1: Not a lack of yes.

412
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,820
Speaker 0: I'm only calling you out on the set on fire.

413
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,791
Speaker 0: I don't think modern AMD set on fire as quickly as the old Athlons.

414
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:12,465
Speaker 1: quiet is probably true, but it doesn't Change the fact.

415
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:17,519
Speaker 0: when my first you're you're correct and the facts are in your favor But that does not change my opinion.

416
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:29,157
Speaker 1: My first computer was an in was in Pentium 3 with an Intel 440 and I'll back that up with an outdated Anecdote and that computer was 100% rock solid a bygone era that I cannot even prove.

417
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:33,440
Speaker 1: every computer I had after that up until recently was an AMD Athlon.

418
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,180
Speaker 1: I had an a. we had the solely based on personal anecdotes, right?

419
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,525
Speaker 1: I had multiple Athlons.

420
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:40,695
Speaker 1: all remember all that whole pile of computer parts.

421
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:41,960
Speaker 1: That was all Athlon equipment.

422
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,814
Speaker 1: How many different motherboards and Athlon processors.

423
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:46,020
Speaker 1: and duron process easy?

424
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,277
Speaker 0: I'm gonna step in right now because my anecdotal evidence is that the problems weren't the processors.

425
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:53,204
Speaker 0: in the end It was the motherboards.

426
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:56,779
Speaker 0: I remember yours one with aces because they were a little more stable and I was with.

427
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:56,839
Speaker 0: no.

428
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:58,246
Speaker 1: I tried a bunch of different ones.

429
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,050
Speaker 1: I had a bit.

430
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,960
Speaker 1: I had aces I had all different Kyle.

431
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,380
Speaker 0: I think it was other people in the crew that always went aces.

432
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,681
Speaker 0: I think.

433
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:11,940
Speaker 0: maybe Pete I forget but I always went a bit because they were a little faster Little less stable and I remember I'd spend like hours tweaking the BIOS and overclocking.

434
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:15,053
Speaker 1: I think I had a bit and then a bit again.

435
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:19,230
Speaker 1: only my newest The computer I just bought.

436
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,724
Speaker 1: the HTPC was aces But before that it was all.

437
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:32,513
Speaker 0: my only anecdote is thus every computer I have ever built until this current one and an a bit motherboard and I would tweak the BIOS like crazy and Overclock and do all that stuff to make it work and do special stuff.

438
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,340
Speaker 0: and there are all these advanced functionalities.

439
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,190
Speaker 0: I learned how they all work.

440
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:42,465
Speaker 0: I Always had some weird problem some weird hardware incompatibility Weird stuff like really weird stuff.

441
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:49,005
Speaker 0: power supply with proper voltage doesn't work because of a weird bug that only affects this one power supply And there's one motherboard.

442
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 0: Yep, but I finally switched to an Intel full-on motherboard.

443
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,660
Speaker 0: It was the first time I've ever built a computer and it posted on the first try.

444
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:58,223
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

445
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:04,860
Speaker 1: I got to say, you know, yes, the a bit is a little weird like that You know with all those weird overclock settings.

446
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,250
Speaker 1: But the aces I just bought with the weird overclock settings.

447
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,792
Speaker 1: No problem.

448
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,560
Speaker 1: My current desktop is a gigabyte motherboard.

449
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:11,683
Speaker 1: No problem Right what?

450
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:17,962
Speaker 1: the difference in my experience of all the computers I've built is the as long as it isn't in all the Intel computers I've built.

451
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:21,900
Speaker 1: no problem because they had Intel chipsets even though none of the motherboards are made by Intel.

452
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:34,376
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll chip sets were Intel and the processors were Intel all the ones that were AMD processors AMD chip sets or you know Viya or whoever else made, you know Nvidia chip sets even the g4 the end price.

453
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:36,622
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah the n-force Computer.

454
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:41,719
Speaker 0: I went with a bit n-force and I had all these weird troubles that still plagued the computer to this day.

455
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,312
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, my my Intel everything down there humming like a champ.

456
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:49,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, n-force not not really that great in the end.

457
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:51,185
Speaker 0: Well, well, well, well Every.

458
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,795
Speaker 0: we have nothing but anecdotal evidence to back this up.

459
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:54,799
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter right?

460
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,371
Speaker 1: I mean, this is my experience.

461
00:27:56,392 --> 00:28:00,729
Speaker 1: all the Intel computers I've made we're freaking rock solid rock hard awesome.

462
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:07,358
Speaker 1: and all the AMD computers I've made and I've made a bunch rock hard Basically broke not rock solid rock hard.

463
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:19,965
Speaker 1: Yes So, you know I got Just now I bought a brand new computer all the Intel parts right or Intel related parts because I did get an i3 Right just fine.

464
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:24,280
Speaker 1: The only thing that any flakiness is always is one ATI video card, you know.

465
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,972
Speaker 1: And the thing is, you know, I'm not it was.

466
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,220
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna regret the decision.

467
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:41,335
Speaker 1: I don't wish I had picked a different video card because at the current point in time that is the best low profile 3d card and if I would have gotten any other I couldn't have gotten a non low profile card because then I would not have been able to you know, get the gaming.

468
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,279
Speaker 1: and then what would have been the point?

469
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,738
Speaker 1: and You know, there wasn't a better low profile card to go for yet.

470
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:50,720
Speaker 1: Maybe in the future a year or two down the road a better low profile card will come out.

471
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,259
Speaker 1: I could put in there and replace this one but not right now.

472
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,634
Speaker 1: So it was still the right choice, but it had problems.

473
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:57,578
Speaker 1: It wasn't perfect.

474
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:58,060
Speaker 0: you went on.

475
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,927
Speaker 0: I couldn't make my really really lame joke.

476
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:05,058
Speaker 0: There was one thing that was rock hard about my last a bit motherboard the fluid in the capacitors.

477
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,111
Speaker 0: So we went on a long time for that.

478
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:10,540
Speaker 0: so I don't want to talk about this a lot.

479
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,420
Speaker 0: I'd rather I think do a show on it instead pan uncovering plagiarism authorship and social software misuse.

480
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:38,219
Speaker 0: They have a cool project that is basically they're trying to make systems that will automatically determine when someone is vandalized a website like Wikipedia as opposed to having added a legitimate update and It's kind of like taking catches to the next level and not just making someone prove They're a human before letting them post but making a post itself prove that it is meaningful

481
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:39,543
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

482
00:29:40,005 --> 00:29:57,547
Speaker 0: and the only argument I've seen against this sort of thing so far Is that it might weed out people who are making legitimate or trying to make legitimate updates to things, you know blog post Wikipedia update whatever but are not you know super competent or are not super Good at expressing their thoughts?

483
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:05,075
Speaker 0: and you know the capture problem where as captors get more complicated there are humans who cannot pass the capture legitimately.

484
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:05,657
Speaker 0: mm-hmm.

485
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:09,729
Speaker 0: and I feel the same way about this that I feel about those things.

486
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:21,682
Speaker 0: if you cannot get through the plagiarism and Abuse detection system and you are a human your post did not deserve to make it through anyway That's true.

487
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:24,110
Speaker 1: But I mean the sit, you know, that's giving the system.

488
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:26,940
Speaker 1: you're basically assuming that the system is perfect.

489
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:34,630
Speaker 1: I mean, what if you know you posted like a really intelligent essay legitimately like, you know some right and then it says You know, we've to take this as abuse.

490
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:36,399
Speaker 1: There's a false positive then what?

491
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:37,122
Speaker 0: well The thing is?

492
00:30:37,142 --> 00:30:40,899
Speaker 0: you have to tweak it because they're all they're gonna be false positives and definitely have to about.

493
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,314
Speaker 1: yeah You definitely have to balance it for no false positives and let a few bad ones through.

494
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 1: but I suppose to balancing it for Cuz I mean letting a few bad guys through and just marking them as spam is a lot better than some guy put writing a Big essay in it not getting through the goal of balance it for the other side.

495
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,220
Speaker 0: I think the goal of this primarily is detect, you know, those people who randomly insert the word penis just into an article.

496
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:03,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if he's writing it?

497
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:04,980
Speaker 1: It's a actual article.

498
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,716
Speaker 0: So you have to use statistics and heuristics to figure things out.

499
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:13,560
Speaker 0: like alright The word penis was added to an article that has nothing to do with biology or genitalia and is between two.

500
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,049
Speaker 0: You know these parts of speech.

501
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:18,290
Speaker 0: it does not seem to fit things like that.

502
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,907
Speaker 0: I Mean mine would never fit.

503
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:24,060
Speaker 1: So when you come up with that algorithm will be rich.

504
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,728
Speaker 0: So so here's the way to do it.

505
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,154
Speaker 0: the same way Google does.

506
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:37,957
Speaker 0: they're doing, you know Crowdsourcing it and statistically, you know saying alright Let's look at these your hundred thousand edits that humans decided were bad word.

507
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:38,960
Speaker 0: Nothing, but abuse.

508
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:42,579
Speaker 0: Let's find statistical correlations and then make an engine based on that.

509
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:54,610
Speaker 0: They're even talking about using the Mechanical Turk to outsource the I Guess crowdsource the generation of the data set so they can use human statistics to then come up with a mechanism Determining abuse and different level.

510
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,514
Speaker 0: It's a really cool article.

511
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:56,599
Speaker 0: I recommend you guys check it out.

512
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,924
Speaker 0: Wow, we went on a while things of the day.

513
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:14,443
Speaker 0: Nikolai Tesla's Letterhead, I have no idea if this is legitimate or not, but legitimate.

514
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:15,908
Speaker 0: I want this to be my letterhead.

515
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:18,449
Speaker 0: Good God This is like the best letterhead I've ever seen.

516
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:20,435
Speaker 1: I want a letterhead.

517
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:24,490
Speaker 1: perhaps, you know, the thing is letterhead is sort of pointless now.

518
00:32:24,571 --> 00:32:25,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is But this is.

519
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:31,530
Speaker 0: I kind of want a letterhead just for purposes like I don't know writing a letter to someone.

520
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:32,737
Speaker 1: When would you do that?

521
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,810
Speaker 0: Here's whenever we do press stuff, right?

522
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,011
Speaker 0: I don't?

523
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,175
Speaker 0: you never run afoul of this.

524
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:48,250
Speaker 0: most media places or people that accept press Registrations require a letter from the editor or the producer on the company's letterhead Stating the assignment of the reporter.

525
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:55,010
Speaker 0: So you realize I have a long file of geek nights Letterheads and letters from me saying that you and I are on assignment.

526
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:59,030
Speaker 1: I love how people like, you know, because there's a letterhead it must be right.

527
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:06,614
Speaker 1: I could just go down to the kinkos print out letterheads for New York Times NBC CBS ABC.

528
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:11,430
Speaker 1: figure out who executives are put their names on the letterhead fake a signature find their signature.

529
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:12,829
Speaker 0: You don't even need to fake it.

530
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:31,781
Speaker 0: I know a guy he where he's a friend to someone who works at my company Who goes to a lot of Major League Baseball games for free by showing up because he knows where all the press guys goes in Here is the same like color shirt that they all wear and he pretty makes a credential that is perfectly real in that He's endorsing it himself.

531
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:32,505
Speaker 0: He's not lying.

532
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:33,350
Speaker 0: He's not fraudulent.

533
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:42,924
Speaker 0: He's just saying like, you know Me is covering this event for me and no one checks and he signs the thing and he stands down on the field watching the game as press.

534
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:46,881
Speaker 0: yeah, I Want to do that, but I'm also kind of afraid of getting arrested.

535
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,830
Speaker 1: Would you really get arrested though?

536
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,432
Speaker 0: See, here's the thing.

537
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:51,061
Speaker 1: I'll bet is it against the law?

538
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:52,570
Speaker 1: bet me they would just kick you out, right?

539
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:59,056
Speaker 1: I don't mean the worst that might happen is they might ban you from the stadium part, you know for life Which well, I'll bet it's not.

540
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:02,030
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know it might not be illegal because he's not committing fraud.

541
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:03,488
Speaker 0: He's not saying I am from NBC.

542
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:09,350
Speaker 0: He's saying I am Joe Schmo my real name from just Joe Schmo's blog or a blah blah blah.

543
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,797
Speaker 0: And I have a fancy press credential.

544
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:13,270
Speaker 0: that is for Joe Schmo's blog and I sign the thing.

545
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,217
Speaker 0: I sign all my real contact information.

546
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:19,050
Speaker 0: I in no way misrepresent myself and then you gave me access.

547
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,270
Speaker 0: Yep, so I think that's his angle.

548
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:24,429
Speaker 0: I kind of want to try it sometime for some investigative reporting.

549
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,902
Speaker 1: The thing is I would try to be willing to try it at a stadium.

550
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:31,266
Speaker 1: I did not care to return to like Yankee Stadium.

551
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,797
Speaker 1: You Know the worst part is like I can't.

552
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:38,280
Speaker 1: you know, it's.

553
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,021
Speaker 1: it's like the thing is to do it at a stadium I don't want to return to is a game.

554
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:47,967
Speaker 0: I don't want to see unless it's the Mets and the Yankees Would you?

555
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:54,250
Speaker 1: The thing is at a big game like that the odds of getting in trouble try to sneak in and the security your way up.

556
00:34:54,431 --> 00:35:00,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to do it at like, you know an afternoon Sunday game against like the Pirates.

557
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:00,790
Speaker 1: No one gives.

558
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,035
Speaker 1: That's when you got to do it.

559
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:04,562
Speaker 1: No one gives a shit.

560
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,984
Speaker 0: No security game course in a game like that They might notice cuz you're the only press guy who bothers to show up.

561
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:17,829
Speaker 1: No, because there's always you know people that go to every single game because you never you know Someone's got to get the pictures of all those crazy highlights and whatnot.

562
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you show up with a gigantic DSLR with that, you know, oh he does.

563
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:22,790
Speaker 0: that's one of his props.

564
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,897
Speaker 0: He has an awesome DSLR.

565
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,563
Speaker 1: See that's the thing is that's the problem, right?

566
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,076
Speaker 0: So great even so Emily has an awesome DSLR.

567
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:31,517
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

568
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:32,500
Speaker 1: No, you got it.

569
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:35,410
Speaker 1: If you don't that's not the kind of the sports guy.

570
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,334
Speaker 0: Have you seen this thing?

571
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:37,338
Speaker 0: It's good enough.

572
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:40,010
Speaker 0: It's no better than what this guy who gets away with this.

573
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,370
Speaker 0: This guy gets away with it.

574
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,329
Speaker 0: He doesn't have as good a camera as what Emily.

575
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,110
Speaker 1: no But he's got that gigantic lens that friggin goes on the front.

576
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,007
Speaker 1: That's like, you know, then for the price of that lens I could buy season tickets.

577
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:50,584
Speaker 1: So Why?

578
00:35:52,070 --> 00:36:03,868
Speaker 1: Right, you know, well the thing is you couldn't buy season tickets that let you stand like on the edge of the field That's true, but season tickets that let me sit in a normal place and not have to worry about getting caught or finagle.

579
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:05,115
Speaker 0: Here's the probably.

580
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,030
Speaker 0: if you're worrying you're already done.

581
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:07,893
Speaker 0: You've got to be.

582
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:12,590
Speaker 0: so not worried because if you're worried at all your body language might make you look worried.

583
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:13,579
Speaker 0: The people like wait a minute.

584
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:14,710
Speaker 0: What are you doing back here?

585
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,170
Speaker 0: You got to be like that French guy who pulls all those pranks.

586
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,566
Speaker 0: He dresses up like sports players and runs out onto the field and acts like he's part of the celebration.

587
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,202
Speaker 1: season tickets are better anyway.

588
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:28,281
Speaker 1: In my thinking today is a funny video of a Russian guy singing.

589
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:31,590
Speaker 1: I can't tell if this was dubbed over by someone else.

590
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,302
Speaker 1: Was this a thing of the day before?

591
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:37,210
Speaker 1: because it's familiar?

592
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:42,470
Speaker 0: I remember it because I saw it independently of you and I thought wow, that's really weird and I didn't do anything with it.

593
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:43,376
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

594
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,530
Speaker 1: I don't think it's been a thing of the day, but it is familiar.

595
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,695
Speaker 1: I've seen it before.

596
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:47,760
Speaker 1: I was on Boing Boing today.

597
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,050
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was on College Humor at some point.

598
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:51,104
Speaker 1: Anyway, here it is.

599
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:51,570
Speaker 1: It's funny.

600
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,969
Speaker 1: I can't tell if it was dubbed over by someone else if it was dubbed over by him.

601
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,850
Speaker 1: But like the the audio like matches up with his mouth.

602
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:07,858
Speaker 1: But strangely it's like he doesn't move his mouth in a shape that matches the way you would expect the shape of his mouth to be like.

603
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:10,207
Speaker 1: when he says look he's like smiling instead of going.

604
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:20,334
Speaker 0: look like His smile reminds me of like Eric Idol when he does the fake shopkeeper kind of smile in Monty Python like it's so Painfully fake.

605
00:37:20,635 --> 00:37:23,767
Speaker 0: it's the kind of smile that only works like on stage if you're in a play.

606
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:24,630
Speaker 1: Hey, it's a weird.

607
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,505
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a video from pockner, but it's there is no pockner.

608
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:29,690
Speaker 0: ease in it someone out there.

609
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,576
Speaker 0: You totally got to mash this up with something.

610
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:34,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, just watch this.

611
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,630
Speaker 1: it is, you know, it is Internet's.

612
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:40,533
Speaker 0: so so Slashdot article.

613
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:44,770
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna read it, but it made me realize something and we've talked about this off and on.

614
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,267
Speaker 0: We've never actually done a show about it.

615
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:56,335
Speaker 0: The vast majority of people use computers don't read anything that's on the screen let alone really Really you don't say so.

616
00:37:56,596 --> 00:38:01,469
Speaker 0: and from the Slashdot article some Bafa basically says so what do we do like?

617
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:01,910
Speaker 0: seriously?

618
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,690
Speaker 0: What do we do to get people to read?

619
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:09,350
Speaker 0: Is there a way to get people to read the words that are coming out of my mouth on the screen?

620
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,555
Speaker 1: I don't know if there is.

621
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,610
Speaker 1: I mean I was in kindergarten, right?

622
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,874
Speaker 1: There's an Apple to in the classroom and you know Occasionally they would.

623
00:38:15,914 --> 00:38:21,808
Speaker 1: they would take you down the whole class to the lab full of Apple twos, right and the teacher would say Okay, everyone do this.

624
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:27,030
Speaker 1: Okay, everyone do this and ever you're supposed to do things as the teacher said to do them.

625
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:37,749
Speaker 1: I just immediately for the first time ever sat down at the thing read the words on the screen and Not only did I figure out that I could use the up and down arrows and then the enter key to select

626
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:39,358
Speaker 0: But I figured out that

627
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:42,372
Speaker 1: I figured out I can actually press the number of the option I wanted.

628
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:49,745
Speaker 0: but I figured out that there was a shared unprotected network drive and then this was in kindergarten on an Apple to on its own.

629
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,048
Speaker 0: I'm talking middle school here.

630
00:38:52,451 --> 00:39:00,909
Speaker 0: the previous class is already had already done the BS assignment and I just went to the network drive found the teachers copy of what you wanted to look like saved it as my own.

631
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:01,331
Speaker 0: it was Done.

632
00:39:01,593 --> 00:39:03,887
Speaker 0: Yep, and then I played commander keen for the rest of the class.

633
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,468
Speaker 1: That's right So, you know.

634
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:16,270
Speaker 1: but the point is is that I was reading the words on the screen and then Inferring from those words What things I could do and what would happen if I did them, right?

635
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:22,870
Speaker 1: I did have to do some trial and error but not much, you know, the option would say one start playing word munchers.

636
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:24,107
Speaker 1: So I pressed the number one.

637
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,194
Speaker 1: Word munchers starts.

638
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:29,205
Speaker 1: Yes, you know, it said start playing numbers.

639
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:29,606
Speaker 1: That's that.

640
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:29,967
Speaker 1: You're right.

641
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:40,478
Speaker 1: So It seemed like though that few other kids in the class had this ability and even today for you I mean a couple weeks ago.

642
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:46,119
Speaker 1: I upgraded my parents and newer Ubuntu and it was much better from that Boon - I haven't done that in a while.

643
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,027
Speaker 1: All right, the thing is right.

644
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:51,159
Speaker 1: they You know, they there's a new I am client.

645
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,765
Speaker 1: It's not pigeon like default.

646
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,190
Speaker 1: I am client is different, right?

647
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,030
Speaker 1: So they had to create their I am accounts in the you know epiphany or whatever it's called.

648
00:39:59,693 --> 00:40:00,396
Speaker 1: So I'm like.

649
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,642
Speaker 1: they're like, how do I do it?

650
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:03,309
Speaker 1: And I'm like, I don't know.

651
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:13,225
Speaker 1: Just read the words on the screen and you know, look for a word like, you know To create account click here or accounts add new account or something along those lines.

652
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,790
Speaker 1: Just read the words.

653
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,958
Speaker 1: Click on the words that make sense, you know.

654
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,585
Speaker 1: infer from the words what buttons do what.

655
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:27,079
Speaker 1: so and my mom still Was unable to do this Even though I told her read the words on the screen.

656
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,687
Speaker 1: read the words on the screen and she just couldn't.

657
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:43,166
Speaker 0: so here's the thing I I'm gonna read someone else's anecdote from slash dot because we all all of us for tech people We have a million anecdotes of you know Dumbass users like I changed one like change the color of a button and they couldn't do their job.

658
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:46,237
Speaker 0: or the error said Your monitor is unplugged.

659
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,209
Speaker 0: and they and it read it to them out loud and they just didn't know what to do.

660
00:40:49,657 --> 00:41:02,990
Speaker 0: Yeah But this anecdote is the rare occurrence where it seems like it's a techie Who saw the person who was having the problem and got to overhear their conversation with the tech while simultaneously?

661
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,425
Speaker 0: Observing what the user was doing that the real tech on the phone couldn't see.

662
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:08,850
Speaker 1: Oh, man, that's good.

663
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,285
Speaker 0: And this I realized everything that's going on here.

664
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:16,561
Speaker 0: So hungry hobo Your anecdote.

665
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:24,610
Speaker 0: I salute you All right, the most memorable example for me was when I was working part-time as a tote at a racetrack during college a horse racetrack.

666
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,935
Speaker 1: Yes, what does a tote do?

667
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,060
Speaker 0: I don't know.

668
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:27,924
Speaker 1: shovels a horse poo.

669
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,270
Speaker 0: I think they carry stuff around.

670
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,690
Speaker 0: Okay, there was a some significant quote-unquote technical problem which was delaying the races.

671
00:41:35,671 --> 00:41:39,287
Speaker 0: I was in the cash room and the manager was on the phone to the control room as head was wrong.

672
00:41:39,488 --> 00:41:40,010
Speaker 1: She made a heist.

673
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,369
Speaker 0: She asked me to carry down a TV.

674
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:48,890
Speaker 0: So I grabbed one of these dusty little old ones and carry it down thinking one of the displays must have burned out or something.

675
00:41:49,472 --> 00:41:55,383
Speaker 0: I get down to the room and the woman who was in the control room was on the phone with some tech support drone Wherever the company outsores.

676
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:57,173
Speaker 0: this shit too Turned out.

677
00:41:57,273 --> 00:42:02,570
Speaker 0: she told my manager there was something wrong with the monitor and had somehow translated that to TV.

678
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:06,367
Speaker 0: So obviously this is why the guy was asked to carry a TV down to the control room.

679
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:06,729
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

680
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:11,626
Speaker 0: I look at the screen and bouncing slowly around all over the screen.

681
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,610
Speaker 0: There's a big gray box.

682
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:18,670
Speaker 0: It covers half the screen and the only way it could make more of a point was if it was flashing in many colors.

683
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,422
Speaker 0: Yep, current monitor resolution not supported colon 1200 by 1600.

684
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:30,830
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The first thing I assumed was that she had read this to the tech on the other line and there was something deeper wrong.

685
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:33,109
Speaker 0: So I don't do anything just hang out blah blah blah blah blah.

686
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:39,250
Speaker 0: It becomes very clear after a few moments that she had not in fact read this error to the tech.

687
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:42,509
Speaker 0: It's as though there's a massive blind spot where the error is.

688
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:48,261
Speaker 0: This isn't a little error like you get in Windows Whenever it tells you to do something and users ignore and click right through?

689
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:52,836
Speaker 0: this is a fairly unusual big gray box Bouncing around the screen.

690
00:42:53,638 --> 00:43:01,023
Speaker 0: I can hear the tech on the other side asking her if she sees any errors or Messages of any kind and she says no at this point.

691
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:01,947
Speaker 0: The guy is in parentheses.

692
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:02,549
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

693
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:08,050
Speaker 0: All the while the clock is ticking costing the racetrack money per minute?

694
00:43:08,932 --> 00:43:19,230
Speaker 0: I tactfully hint that perhaps I being a computer nerd in the comp sci program who's worked with tech in the past Might be able to help but she's one of those territorial types doesn't want me to intervene.

695
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:20,490
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah blah.

696
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:29,805
Speaker 0: She basically will not let the guy even go so far as to read the error message that he sees on the screen To her or to the tech.

697
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:41,290
Speaker 0: Yep And yeah, I don't want to go through the rest But basically what he's realized here and what I now realize is that people Don't actually see the error messages.

698
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:46,430
Speaker 0: They see something has gone wrong and something is different and the words don't appear to them.

699
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:52,769
Speaker 0: All that appears in their brain is either nothing or a big gray box that is translated in their brain, too.

700
00:43:53,311 --> 00:44:01,763
Speaker 0: There is a problem that I'm 100% unequipped to deal with and I cannot and will not in any way Interact with anything on this device at any point further.

701
00:44:01,783 --> 00:44:03,389
Speaker 0: I need someone to hold my hand.

702
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:06,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, they physically do not see them.

703
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,030
Speaker 0: It's like the error is there and it's not that they read it and didn't understand it.

704
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,435
Speaker 0: It's not that they didn't read it.

705
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:14,930
Speaker 0: It's that they don't even get to the point of recognizing it as a problem.

706
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,378
Speaker 1: Well, let me give another anecdote, right?

707
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:21,050
Speaker 1: So my cousin had a laptop once and it was full of viruses and shit, right?

708
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,219
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, can you help me out?

709
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,975
Speaker 1: So I'm like, oh, we'll just reinstall Windows No problem.

710
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:24,217
Speaker 1: So what?

711
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:25,349
Speaker 1: that's what I did and it was fine.

712
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:27,617
Speaker 1: And you know, I was basically she was.

713
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:30,850
Speaker 1: I was like trying to give her advice and how to not get viruses in the future.

714
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:34,878
Speaker 1: And I was like, yeah, you know You really need to just install all the updates.

715
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,467
Speaker 1: whenever it tells you to that there are updates install them.

716
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:40,337
Speaker 1: She's like, oh Yeah, I see something about updates.

717
00:44:40,357 --> 00:44:46,727
Speaker 1: so she was reading kind of right because she had seen messages about updates But the thing was she would just always click.

718
00:44:46,747 --> 00:44:47,713
Speaker 1: no It's just.

719
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,022
Speaker 1: they just want to make it go away.

720
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:52,790
Speaker 1: anything that pops up Even if they you know read it or kind of read it.

721
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,365
Speaker 1: They just want to make any pop up anything in their way go away.

722
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,675
Speaker 1: Just go away now No matter what it is.

723
00:44:58,716 --> 00:45:01,509
Speaker 1: It could be the computer will kill you in five seconds if you click.

724
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:02,172
Speaker 1: no They'll just click.

725
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:06,490
Speaker 1: no just wanted the whatever button on one hand, right?

726
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,278
Speaker 0: I'm very much enjoy tribes too.

727
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,190
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, I value my bean machine exact.

728
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,588
Speaker 1: I've been back any any message that pops up and gets in the way of someone just doing what they want to do.

729
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:18,959
Speaker 1: right now They just want to make it go away and they'll click.

730
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,844
Speaker 1: Okay cancel.

731
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:22,721
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit There's whatever makes it go away.

732
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,069
Speaker 1: is what they want, right?

733
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:38,037
Speaker 0: but there's this separate problem where they probably don't actually notice or Recognize that the words on the screen will tell them what the problem is or even if they you know read the words Right and partially understand them.

734
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:39,742
Speaker 1: They don't fully understand them.

735
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,110
Speaker 1: Right like my cousin, you know, she saw the word updates.

736
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:55,272
Speaker 1: She understood on some level that this would update something, you know that there would be Software added and she I think she sort of knew also that that would make like a progress bar and involve some waiting And she didn't want to wait for anything Right.

737
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:59,210
Speaker 1: just wanted the message to go as you working and it didn't really connect.

738
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:02,320
Speaker 1: You know just how important that was.

739
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,310
Speaker 1: that it would prevent your computer from being fucked up, right?

740
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,470
Speaker 1: So well because it didn't do anything, you know directly to her user experience.

741
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:19,033
Speaker 1: It was actually making her user experience more negative by giving her all these messages and any updates would have been completely invisible To her behind the scenes.

742
00:46:19,094 --> 00:46:27,840
Speaker 0: see now there are multiple levels going on here because another I keep craving from slashdot notes here, but Maybe it's just the anecdotes from all these other people.

743
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,710
Speaker 0: Give me a like us a bigger experience than the ones we have on our own.

744
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:47,030
Speaker 0: another guy Mikker bids I'm only saying who these people are because I want to give them credit because I'm totally stealing from them Points out a couple of interesting facts that these people probably in many cases like there's one level of they see the error But they don't understand it so they ignore it and want it to go away.

745
00:46:47,531 --> 00:46:51,442
Speaker 0: But there is I think a legitimate lower level of actually do not see them.

746
00:46:51,863 --> 00:46:54,310
Speaker 0: and then he has two examples of quite likely one.

747
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,150
Speaker 0: Car drivers will often many times this has been documented hit a motorcycle.

748
00:47:00,772 --> 00:47:10,063
Speaker 0: But if you look at video of like the accident they looked directly at the motorcycle as they were changing lanes but their brain did not process somehow that it was a that the motorcycle was there.

749
00:47:10,123 --> 00:47:15,910
Speaker 0: because they're not used to seeing motorcycles and Think about when you the first time you drive, you know, you've never driven a car before you're learning how to drive.

750
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:19,120
Speaker 0: There's all this information and it's really hard to parse it all.

751
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,644
Speaker 0: it's kind of bewildering experience.

752
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:25,709
Speaker 0: the first time you're driving in real traffic You're worried about obstacles and people and cars and birds and signs up.

753
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:29,770
Speaker 0: Once you're a good driver your brain kind of breaks these things down into symbols.

754
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:35,830
Speaker 0: So when you're changing lanes, some people who aren't good drivers their brain thinks is there the symbol of a car in my way?

755
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,941
Speaker 0: No, then I can change lanes if there's a motorcycle there.

756
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:39,845
Speaker 0: They don't see it.

757
00:47:39,905 --> 00:47:40,869
Speaker 0: They really don't see it.

758
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, because their brain doesn't say there they don't see obstacle.

759
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:46,230
Speaker 0: They see not a car I can go.

760
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:48,955
Speaker 0: and another example of this is pilots.

761
00:47:49,356 --> 00:47:56,214
Speaker 0: if you do training with pilots and you put like garbage trucks or buses or things on the When they're supposed to land.

762
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:59,423
Speaker 0: that are not the typical obstacles on a runway.

763
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:01,308
Speaker 0: They will often crash right into him.

764
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:01,830
Speaker 0: in the simulation.

765
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:02,854
Speaker 0: They just don't even see him.

766
00:48:03,456 --> 00:48:03,577
Speaker 0: Mmm.

767
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:06,408
Speaker 0: So these two anecdote are these two.

768
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:11,350
Speaker 0: I guess The guy doesn't have citations, but he claims he had citations of studies.

769
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,577
Speaker 0: So if this is true It does make sense.

770
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:19,941
Speaker 1: think about like the things you can do with peripheral vision Like you hold up a green card and it's the corner of someone's eye.

771
00:48:20,242 --> 00:48:25,290
Speaker 1: They look away you swap it for a red card They look back and the card will be green green green.

772
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,910
Speaker 1: They really see green and it'll be red as soon as they're actually looking at it for reals.

773
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,150
Speaker 1: So think about unless someone really looks and concentrates, right?

774
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:35,152
Speaker 1: They're they're.

775
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:42,699
Speaker 1: they're not seeing what is physically there necessarily because their brain is trained You know and has a incorrect expectation.

776
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:46,230
Speaker 1: the brain will just see what it expects to see which is nothing.

777
00:48:46,571 --> 00:49:09,740
Speaker 0: So I think the real problem, you know, the multiple levels the layer one problem is very simple There are some people who for whatever reason are not that good with a task or have oversimplified A task or an interaction like the drivers don't see motorcycles have oversimplified the symbols They're dealing with in their brain into car Sign, you know these sorts of things.

778
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,530
Speaker 0: They literally do not see the pedestrian.

779
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,650
Speaker 0: They literally do not see the motorcycle because their brain is working on says a simplistic symbolic level.

780
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,152
Speaker 0: That's true.

781
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,778
Speaker 0: The same thing happens with computers.

782
00:49:18,818 --> 00:49:21,730
Speaker 0: some people they only know how to do a little bit with a computer.

783
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:28,295
Speaker 0: Their brain is only working on very limited symbol sets and they probably actually do not see Some of these symbols.

784
00:49:28,355 --> 00:49:32,049
Speaker 0: like if the error message doesn't look like what they expect an error to see they just don't notice it.

785
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,890
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean think about right those the the big hubbub on the internet a couple weeks ago about all that.

786
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:47,581
Speaker 1: There was a if you type Facebook login into Google and felt lucky if the top The top result was this blog post about Facebook changing its login.

787
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:48,343
Speaker 0: those comments

788
00:49:48,463 --> 00:50:05,229
Speaker 1: and a bunch of people thought that this was right the Facebook login page and it had changed because they didn't actually read the page or Comprehend that this was a blog with an article talking about the Facebook login or that when you type Facebook login You're actually doing a search, you know.

789
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:12,780
Speaker 1: And people were they all they they may say like ah what changed and they saw a place to comment and they know how to Comment because they know how to do things on Facebook.

790
00:50:13,182 --> 00:50:16,779
Speaker 1: So they commented and we're like Why is Facebook red?

791
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:17,422
Speaker 1: What did you do?

792
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,210
Speaker 1: I just want to log into my Facebook.

793
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:20,174
Speaker 0: Think about this.

794
00:50:20,215 --> 00:50:23,510
Speaker 0: This is the same thing that happens to young kids who are learning language.

795
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:34,247
Speaker 0: Like they're learning to read but they learn how to read not phonetically not with phonics But through like word recognition or first character last character recognition, which is the common way kids learn.

796
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:42,390
Speaker 0: if they're not guided properly Kids will see like a word starts with M and they'll assume it's mom but the word might be massive or mononucleosis.

797
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,499
Speaker 0: But they say mom because they've they've.

798
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:52,310
Speaker 0: they've basically taken this symbolic mental shortcut And they didn't see the rest of the word because their brain made a decision before they got to that point.

799
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:54,657
Speaker 0: and I think it's the exact same thing.

800
00:50:54,697 --> 00:51:14,029
Speaker 0: these the the symbols your brain is using if they're misapplied or So simplistic that you like things that don't fit into the symbols don't exist Then you get into the weird situation where you'll you won't be able to react properly to a symbol that is well I guess a real data or datum that is presented to you because your symbology is messed up.

801
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:19,086
Speaker 0: I think this I think they saw they their their symbology was Facebook login page.

802
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:20,150
Speaker 0: It looks different.

803
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:25,977
Speaker 0: so they misapplied the alternate symbology oops of Posting to a blog or commenting.

804
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:36,050
Speaker 0: so they applied the commenting symbology to the wrong situation Because they understood these two disparate contacts, but did not realize that they were two actually different situations.

805
00:51:36,854 --> 00:51:40,090
Speaker 1: This is why we have the geek nights book club and this is why reading is important.

806
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:42,442
Speaker 1: And this is why audiobooks I don't care.

807
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:44,712
Speaker 1: what you people say is not reading Right.

808
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:57,233
Speaker 1: the ability to look at words and have words appear at you and to always be able to process those words No matter what context they appear in and process them correctly is what separates smart people from Vegetables.

809
00:51:57,254 --> 00:51:58,900
Speaker 0: you guys saw that that post in the forum.

810
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,944
Speaker 0: I was talking about literacy.

811
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:05,942
Speaker 0: how a good third of Americans Cannot parse simple information from simple paragraphs.

812
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:08,430
Speaker 0: and I'm talking like bill has five apples.

813
00:52:08,772 --> 00:52:09,840
Speaker 0: Joan has six apples.

814
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,249
Speaker 0: How many apples does bill have?

815
00:52:12,491 --> 00:52:19,810
Speaker 0: And furthermore only 15% of Americans according to many metrics can actually be considered to be fully literate in the English language.

816
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:25,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they have what they say the literacy rate like if you look at the almanac or whatever is 99% You know.

817
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:28,402
Speaker 1: that means that people can you know read stop signs?

818
00:52:28,503 --> 00:52:29,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can read.

819
00:52:29,305 --> 00:52:30,790
Speaker 1: well the people didn't read a stop sign.

820
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,136
Speaker 1: It's just a big red sim.

821
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:35,550
Speaker 1: I don't like you don't read a stop sign like they can read street signs.

822
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,770
Speaker 0: They can read like, you know signs like mall this way that sort of thing.

823
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:45,530
Speaker 0: They understand words, but there's a whole different measure of literacy of being able to to take words put them together and figure out meaning.

824
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:46,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, take it.

825
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,179
Speaker 1: You know a lot of words and a lot of different contexts.

826
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,070
Speaker 1: put them together and extract the correct meaning from them.

827
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:59,621
Speaker 1: You know and I mean the first thing you need to do if you're going to do that is to be able to see the Words, if you can't see them, you can't read them.

828
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:01,630
Speaker 1: and then after you see them you need to read them.

829
00:53:01,952 --> 00:53:03,021
Speaker 1: You need to know what they all mean.

830
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,171
Speaker 1: You need to read them correct, you know It's.

831
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:12,153
Speaker 1: it's actually quite difficult and most people in the world You know, most people can do it, but they can't do it Well enough.

832
00:53:12,695 --> 00:53:16,208
Speaker 1: or you know in all context or is it all context?

833
00:53:16,228 --> 00:53:16,650
Speaker 0: That's the key.

834
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,301
Speaker 0: These are a lot of people are very smart in one realm But in the computer we're at realm.

835
00:53:21,482 --> 00:53:29,250
Speaker 0: they miss apply some brain Symbology or some brain process to a completely unrelated process in the computer because they don't understand what's actually going on.

836
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,936
Speaker 1: I mean the thing is like look look at me, right?

837
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:34,510
Speaker 1: I don't really know, you know, I know science, but I'm not a scientist.

838
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:40,790
Speaker 1: I don't really know science, you know, if you give me some like, you know medical handbook, it's just like blub blub blub, right?

839
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:41,231
Speaker 0: Yep Like.

840
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:43,530
Speaker 0: I can tell you all the phases of mitosis.

841
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,080
Speaker 1: But I can I can take it and I can like.

842
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,850
Speaker 1: it is a chapter about some crazy bacteria, right?

843
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:49,617
Speaker 1: And I can read it.

844
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:50,850
Speaker 1: I can look at it.

845
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,106
Speaker 1: I'll be slow at reading it but I can read every word and I can sort.

846
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,056
Speaker 1: I can extract as Much meaning as my vote.

847
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:01,570
Speaker 1: I'm only limited by my vocabulary because I don't know some of the terminology.

848
00:54:02,752 --> 00:54:14,189
Speaker 1: So I could you know if you I can say I can read a sentence in a medical journal and say oh well proper noun A that I don't know what that is, you know Does this verb that I don't know what it is to proper noun C?

849
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:21,630
Speaker 0: well So if I learn the vocabulary I can tell you what it means got back in the day when I took the ACT test Which is like the SAT that the rest of the country uses.

850
00:54:22,396 --> 00:54:31,050
Speaker 0: But you know I don't know if it's changed since then has a science section that a lot of people had tons of problems with like it was Considered to be very difficult and a lot of people did very poorly on it.

851
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:37,270
Speaker 0: But all it consisted of was they would give you a short paper or a short explanation of some topic.

852
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:38,930
Speaker 0: You didn't need to know anything about it.

853
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,585
Speaker 0: They would give you all the information you needed and then ask you questions about it.

854
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:43,810
Speaker 0: It was basically sounds like fun.

855
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,291
Speaker 1: I won't do that.

856
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:49,706
Speaker 0: It was basically reading comprehension, but it was all scientific principles and people just couldn't.

857
00:54:49,947 --> 00:54:52,750
Speaker 0: but all that aside Oh, we've gone on a very long time.

858
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:54,529
Speaker 0: I think we can break it down to users.

859
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:56,459
Speaker 0: Level one like the level one.

860
00:54:56,479 --> 00:55:02,730
Speaker 0: problem of people not reading the screen is that they literally Do not see what's on the screen due to some weird brain symbology problem.

861
00:55:03,352 --> 00:55:07,209
Speaker 0: level two is they read it but do not understand the importance and just want it to go away.

862
00:55:07,229 --> 00:55:12,410
Speaker 0: and Then layer three is you're already 99% on the way to being able to solve your own problems.

863
00:55:13,012 --> 00:55:13,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that you know.

864
00:55:14,036 --> 00:55:17,470
Speaker 1: level four is if you can read well enough to you know.

865
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,675
Speaker 1: See type it into Google.

866
00:55:18,756 --> 00:55:20,684
Speaker 1: you can type it into Google and that's then.

867
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,135
Speaker 1: as soon as you can do that You're on our level.

868
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:25,504
Speaker 1: I mean I started out in kindergarten.

869
00:55:25,544 --> 00:55:26,910
Speaker 1: I had an apple - I read the screen.

870
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,736
Speaker 1: That's how come of a computer scientist.

871
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:31,445
Speaker 1: That's all I'm not a genius computer scientist.

872
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:32,368
Speaker 1: I'm not Donald Knuth.

873
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,817
Speaker 1: All right I don't know fancy calculus.

874
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:36,041
Speaker 1: I don't know fancy maths.

875
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:37,407
Speaker 1: I mean, I know Matt even start.

876
00:55:37,447 --> 00:55:38,290
Speaker 1: I don't know fancy math.

877
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:39,575
Speaker 1: I can't integrate anymore.

878
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:42,545
Speaker 1: really that much in my only kind of kind of like.

879
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:45,193
Speaker 0: the other day someone asked me How do I make this group?

880
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:49,744
Speaker 0: in my regular expression greedy as opposed to non greedy and I was like, uh I don't remember offhand.

881
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:50,666
Speaker 0: I was like Google.

882
00:55:50,786 --> 00:55:51,889
Speaker 0: Oh duh put a question mark here.

883
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:52,150
Speaker 0: You're done.

884
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,026
Speaker 1: Uh-huh question mark doesn't make something.

885
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:57,132
Speaker 0: Anyway, it does if you're grouping versus lazy.

886
00:55:57,794 --> 00:55:58,135
Speaker 0: Oh, you're.

887
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,920
Speaker 1: well, you're using a pre anyway.

888
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:16,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a completely different use of the question mark, yes anyway But the fact is it's something I use reg exes every day But many many things that are part of my daily job or part of my expertise in computer science and information technology.

889
00:56:17,483 --> 00:56:18,366
Speaker 0: I look up on Google.

890
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:19,209
Speaker 0: I look up syntax.

891
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:21,619
Speaker 1: Basically all I do all day, right?

892
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,300
Speaker 1: I went to school for five years to learn, you know programming.

893
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:29,339
Speaker 1: All I do every day is literally I have to do this.

894
00:56:29,962 --> 00:56:33,540
Speaker 1: I read and read and read and read and read until I figure out how to do it.

895
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,000
Speaker 1: It's the same thing I did with the Apple - oh, I want to play word munchers.

896
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,471
Speaker 1: I read until I can figure out a word muncher.

897
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:41,460
Speaker 0: There's the other way that is equally important.

898
00:56:41,783 --> 00:56:43,019
Speaker 0: Keep trying shit till it works.

899
00:56:43,561 --> 00:56:45,567
Speaker 1: I also keep trying shit and you know what.

900
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:49,819
Speaker 1: every time I try something words usually come out and I read them.

901
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:59,140
Speaker 1: So I type some code in and it says error Integrity error in the database and I go ha there must be something wrong with the database when I do this.

902
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,454
Speaker 0: So I came under what it could be.

903
00:57:01,575 --> 00:57:08,374
Speaker 0: before we end I think we should do a separate show later some day or something on What can we do to force people to read if they don't.

904
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:09,580
Speaker 0: but I think I have an easy answer.

905
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:15,440
Speaker 0: If you have an error message in your program and your program is aimed at people who are not technically confident.

906
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:28,000
Speaker 0: You need a capture a modal window that pops up and gives them the error message and basically Does not let them make that go away until they take some action that proves that they understand.

907
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,969
Speaker 1: That's the opposite of the Steve Jobs philosophy.

908
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:32,520
Speaker 1: The Steve Jobs philosophy is there are no error messages.

909
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:35,131
Speaker 1: You never have to read anything ever this.

910
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:37,160
Speaker 1: we're never gonna put an error message in your face.

911
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:46,240
Speaker 0: What if when your internet internet connection is down right and this is like just makes a frowny face on a network cable if it Pops a window that says your net internet internet connection is down?

912
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:48,494
Speaker 0: Do you understand what this means?

913
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:54,459
Speaker 0: and if it says yes Then it gives you a list of things that could have caused it and it forces you to like answer quest Windows sort of.

914
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:54,942
Speaker 1: does This?

915
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:59,689
Speaker 1: when you know Windows Vista and Windows You can just keep clicking.

916
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,840
Speaker 0: Okay, and yes and no and yes and no and eventually all the windows go away.

917
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:03,403
Speaker 1: That's true.

918
00:58:04,027 --> 00:58:07,425
Speaker 0: You need it to be like, alright, you know It says the network is down.

919
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:08,088
Speaker 0: Do you understand?

920
00:58:08,128 --> 00:58:10,800
Speaker 0: if you say yes, then it says what went down?

921
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,467
Speaker 0: And it gives you a multiple choice question.

922
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:14,496
Speaker 0: It is like the internet connection.

923
00:58:14,777 --> 00:58:19,247
Speaker 0: your mother Maybe just insult the users to you've.

924
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,089
Speaker 0: they've got a type stuff.

925
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,140
Speaker 0: ask him like what is your what is your username that you logged?

926
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,128
Speaker 0: In with you cannot proceed until you type it.

927
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,920
Speaker 0: I think type what you see on the screen.

928
00:58:27,981 --> 00:58:28,580
Speaker 0: It shows him a picture.

929
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:32,085
Speaker 1: I think actually a large part of this problem Right is the mouse.

930
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:47,160
Speaker 1: if we never if we didn't have the mouse and we just for eat the keyboard Right was how you interacted with the computer people either, you know They just they wouldn't be able to even use the computer period unless they you know had much better reading ability.

931
00:58:47,242 --> 00:58:53,300
Speaker 0: It's tricky though Because while everyone says the mouse causes a lot at least a lot of older school people say the mouse causes all these problems.

932
00:58:53,962 --> 00:58:58,540
Speaker 0: I put forth that watch someone who has not grown up with technology try to use a computer keyboard.

933
00:58:58,821 --> 00:59:00,427
Speaker 0: They understand like that mouse.

934
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:01,411
Speaker 0: Am I the guy?

935
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:01,953
Speaker 0: is that me?

936
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:03,920
Speaker 0: Is that me over there moving around?

937
00:59:04,462 --> 00:59:08,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is they don't use the computer they don't you know, they don't use the keyboard.

938
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,600
Speaker 1: even though they understand the keyboard.

939
00:59:09,741 --> 00:59:10,807
Speaker 0: They do not grok.

940
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:11,632
Speaker 1: They do not.

941
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,060
Speaker 1: they don't use it, right?

942
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,243
Speaker 1: This is a they'll go to.

943
00:59:14,323 --> 00:59:20,384
Speaker 1: they'll go to they'll click on the save icon a hundred times and they'll go to file save file Save edit copy edit paste.

944
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:30,056
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't see that that it says control s right next to the save word and that on my keyboard There's a control and an S. Well Scott, they don't read they don't that word.

945
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:30,920
Speaker 1: They don't see that there.

946
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,740
Speaker 0: They see but they do not witness.

947
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:43,087
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.

948
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:48,294
Speaker 0: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brand ok for the logos.
