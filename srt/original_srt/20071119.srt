1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,886
Speaker 0: It's Monday November 19th.

2
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,291
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,320
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,825
Speaker 0: We begin a series about Google by talking about the world before Google.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,409
Speaker 0: Well, we're still alive.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, the weekend didn't go quite as badly as it could have.

8
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,130
Speaker 1: no it could have been much worse.

9
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:49,223
Speaker 0: I was very tired yesterday, but I slept a whole lot because somehow yesterday You know I find it interesting that you see we went to this party which now if Last year's or the last time a party like this happened was to be believed.

10
00:00:49,885 --> 00:01:00,270
Speaker 0: We were expecting to Basically have to fend off a horde of Visigoths or in this case Possibly Ostrogoths in the corner of the house hoping not to be vomited upon.

11
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:01,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, that I mean this.

12
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:06,648
Speaker 1: this exact party has happened once before and we didn't go because of other reasons.

13
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,578
Speaker 0: well because the we came Out and we were here to get it.

14
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:21,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, but oh wow Yeah, it was exactly a year ago, so Yeah, because the we as I think a year old today or something like that Regardless the the same party happened before and the tails were Vomitacious.

15
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:27,248
Speaker 0: they were they were of a myth vomit ik widis All right, they were vomitoriums.

16
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:34,319
Speaker 1: And so we expected that since we're going to the party for the second time It's ever happened that it would be a similar event.

17
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,253
Speaker 1: yet It was not.

18
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:44,661
Speaker 0: it was quite enjoyable, but I think that the most telling thing was that at the end of it all Scott did not drink and Alex did not drink.

19
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:50,990
Speaker 0: I drunk quite a bit But yet in the morning and the rest of the next day the three of us had the same hangover.

20
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,111
Speaker 1: Yeah, there wasn't too much sleeping going on now not so much We had.

21
00:01:57,332 --> 00:02:01,470
Speaker 0: we stayed up until like three the first night playing apples to apples then arguing about crap.

22
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:09,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, I generally just got the same bad feeling you get whenever you don't get enough sleep and do too much stuff And then the next night we were gonna go to bed at like three.

23
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:14,673
Speaker 0: everything was all set And then we stayed up another hour arguing with some guy about Comics.

24
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:18,949
Speaker 0: now issues are kind of to suck and collecting comics is kind of dumb if you're trying to make money off of it.

25
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:30,130
Speaker 1: yeah, especially if you're doing it for money, but The point is is that you know I had to drive home and everyone else is sleeping in the car And then he finally got home, and then we went out to eat.

26
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,901
Speaker 1: We came home, and it was actually really early like nine ish.

27
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,115
Speaker 1: so after finishing reading the the book I was reading which didn't take very long.

28
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:46,870
Speaker 1: I actually went to sleep stupidly early, and I got enough sleep to revive and Thanksgiving I'll need to work two more days before I'm off again, so yeah, and I got the Friday off.

29
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,670
Speaker 0: So I'm doing my annual go out to Rochester go to Millennium kind of pilgrimage.

30
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:53,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what we want there.

31
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:58,890
Speaker 0: I'm gonna email the Millennium guy ahead of time and see if he can get me a copy of Dune before I get there.

32
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,296
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good call.

33
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,241
Speaker 0: I'll pretty much sell him.

34
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,446
Speaker 0: I'm willing to pay up to like 150 bucks.

35
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:06,350
Speaker 0: That's a good call, but anyway, let's just get into the news.

36
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,342
Speaker 0: I kind of want to get done with the show and go to bed.

37
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, super tired.

38
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,039
Speaker 0: I just actually want to continue to be well-rested.

39
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,830
Speaker 1: I just want to read a bunch of manga and stuff.

40
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,430
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get so much reading and coding stuff done with the Thanksgiving and all the business and no it's gonna be good times.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,120
Speaker 1: but for now Tech news always slow in late November.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,290
Speaker 1: I mean every tech podcast is like oh, what are we talking about?

43
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,181
Speaker 0: But what about all those rumors of a 14 or 13 inch MacBook?

44
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,875
Speaker 1: Those were like a weeks ago.

45
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:34,436
Speaker 0: I know.

46
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,400
Speaker 0: and whatever happened to that?

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,590
Speaker 1: the rumors don't believe anything until you see it people.

48
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:39,173
Speaker 0: Oh, I know.

49
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:39,756
Speaker 0: I don't believe it.

50
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,190
Speaker 0: But at the same time not that Apple cares about me.

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,744
Speaker 0: But I have to say if that comes to be true I'm probably going to buy one pretty quickly if it's true.

52
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,090
Speaker 1: It's probably not a bad purchase.

53
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:56,795
Speaker 1: I might have purchased one if I had needed a laptop when around now instead of around back And I kind of need one now.

54
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:04,247
Speaker 0: now that I'm really happy with what I got now that I'm once again a flushing money And anything that I can spend money on that'll make my life better is worth it.

55
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,965
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so what kind of news you got over there?

56
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:15,449
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I got to start Alright, so I find this interesting because I saw this article on slashdot and I read it and I had thoughts about it.

57
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:24,714
Speaker 0: Meanwhile Scott read an article on dig that was about something that actually happened because the article on slashdot was basically just Wouldn't it be bad?

58
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,684
Speaker 0: if is it stupid - should we worry about?

59
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,250
Speaker 0: and Scott's article was?

60
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,596
Speaker 0: X happened it sucked.

61
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,479
Speaker 0: We should have worried.

62
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:36,610
Speaker 1: I don't know about the reliability of either of that article, but whatever I didn't read it.

63
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,172
Speaker 0: I didn't see it.

64
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:38,115
Speaker 0: Scott told me about it.

65
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:47,730
Speaker 1: I just saw a headline and I inspected it very cursor Lee Uh-huh, so but he definitely did it what there was an article that did say what we're about to say.

66
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:53,147
Speaker 0: But anyway, you might be familiar with these websites like tiny URL at Alia.

67
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,170
Speaker 0: There's a million of these things.

68
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,810
Speaker 0: It's you know, you type in your most popular.

69
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:02,110
Speaker 0: You type in a URL on the little site and it'll give you back a shorter URL like I type.

70
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:06,808
Speaker 0: www.scott makes inappropriate URLs that imply homosexuality.

71
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:17,452
Speaker 0: calm and shortly good gobbledygook gobbledygook gobbledygook gobbledygook and it shortens the two tiny URL comm slash Uh-huh.

72
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,918
Speaker 0: I hope that isn't something real.

73
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,182
Speaker 0: I don't even I'll go see.

74
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,507
Speaker 1: it is something I'll go find out.

75
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:37,208
Speaker 0: but These sorts of services are kind of a mixed bag and even though tiny URL is kind of known and respected and trusted at the same time my personal opinion is that there is really never been a Useful purpose for anything like this.

76
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:42,450
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of P. and the worst thing is I see people using it not even for the real.

77
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:58,509
Speaker 0: I guess the only legitimate thing I could see it for which is trying to tell someone a URL over the phone or trying to tell someone a URL in a radio show or something, but I See people posting tiny URLs in Forums because they don't know how to make a link.

78
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:04,890
Speaker 0: So instead of using HTML or bbcode or whatever they post a tiny URL in text in a forum.

79
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:15,290
Speaker 1: Well, it'd be easier would be a website where you go to and you You just type in the crazy URL and then it makes you an HTML link that you can copy and paste.

80
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:17,817
Speaker 0: That is kind of sad if you need that.

81
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,560
Speaker 0: It's the internet.

82
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:29,770
Speaker 0: I know I know I'll be perfectly but to me HTML or at least bbcode is pretty much the language You need to understand to be wiki code to count at the internet.

83
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,729
Speaker 0: You don't count if you can't do one of those as far as I could tell.

84
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,669
Speaker 1: Well, at least not at the internet but on the web.

85
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:41,630
Speaker 1: But you can't you cannot operate on the web if you don't at least know the basics of HTML and or bbcode.

86
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,613
Speaker 1: It's just not gonna happen.

87
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,366
Speaker 1: You need to know how to at least make a link a href whatever.

88
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:55,770
Speaker 0: but I mean I mean, I'll say pretty much straightforward I feel that people who use these services use them poorly and stupidly and I really see no legitimate reason to bother with them.

89
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,106
Speaker 0: James Randi always uses it I know and he shouldn't.

90
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:07,850
Speaker 0: The worst thing in the world is when there is ever a link in a website that uses a tiny URL Why all you did was add a layer of possible failure?

91
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if tiny URL goes down now your link doesn't work Even if the site that you were trying to link to in the first place is still up.

92
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:21,417
Speaker 0: also I'll say that I just in principle do not click on those kinds of URLs because Who knows where they can go?

93
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:27,222
Speaker 0: I don't know what's on the other side and while I am NOT I was going to say immune but then I said not and I'm so.

94
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:33,290
Speaker 0: I am NOT immune to Being Rick rolled because I'm on to Linux and to Firefox.

95
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,789
Speaker 0: But nonetheless if I see a URL and I can't tell where it goes I'm not going to risk going to a site that might try to Rick roll me.

96
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you part a very important security feature of web browser.

97
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:58,802
Speaker 1: You hold the mouse over the link and the URL shows up in the bottom and you know You look at that URL of where the link is gonna go and you say aha I know where this link is going and if it says the link is going to like yahoe.com You're like yahoe.com.

98
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure that's totally legitimate and free of evil.

99
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,941
Speaker 0: Sorny magnet box.

100
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,310
Speaker 1: Oh Look at all these great name brands.

101
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:17,090
Speaker 1: but yeah, so the fact if you you can take a tiny URL and Point that to say some horrible evil website of doom and then someone hovers over and they go Oh tiny URL.

102
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,075
Speaker 1: I guess I have to click.

103
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:27,169
Speaker 0: granted evil someone who trusts tiny URL Probably wouldn't have figured out that yahoe.com slash gobbledygook is somehow bad.

104
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

105
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:34,510
Speaker 0: or the famous microsoft.com slash whole bunch of stuff that actually just redirects you to evil.com.

106
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,332
Speaker 1: Ten euro useless We don't.

107
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,801
Speaker 1: if you're using it stop just learn how to make a link.

108
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:45,041
Speaker 0: The wonderful thing is there's this slash dot article I'm linking to where people are all.

109
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,270
Speaker 0: should we worry?

110
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,237
Speaker 0: Is this gonna break the internet?

111
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,668
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna answer all those questions one.

112
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,250
Speaker 0: Should we worry?

113
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:54,090
Speaker 0: No, it only hurts people who suck - will it break the internet?

114
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,427
Speaker 0: No, in fact, it'll make the internet better because if you link to it with a tiny URL probably wasn't worth linking to.

115
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:03,098
Speaker 0: yeah Three and this is my favorite thing.

116
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:19,865
Speaker 0: a lot of people on slash dot and other places discussing this Effectively made this point that I see coming up a lot all the time on the internet and it's always always made by high school kids or Freshman IT CS people where they'll say oh well

117
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:20,427
Speaker 1: tiny

118
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:28,154
Speaker 0: URL blah DNS broken blah DNS bad blah DNS last legs blah something something DNS Obsolete.

119
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:31,146
Speaker 1: people don't understand the DNS like the open DNS guy.

120
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:35,740
Speaker 0: Yeah DNS is just fine and even worse is the.

121
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:49,043
Speaker 0: the one argument I saw that it was infuriating and I had to resist the urge To type furiously at this person was well, maybe we didn't use all these so-called content management systems that make Indecipherable URLs.

122
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,513
Speaker 0: now I don't know.

123
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:55,854
Speaker 0: for some reason a URL that includes the date of the post or the title of the post isn't so Indecipherable to me.

124
00:09:56,236 --> 00:10:08,517
Speaker 1: I think the problem is is that a lot of the context but content management systems Right are built on top, you know, people are running these things on Apache and it's it's quite difficult to you Know you need an HD access file.

125
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:20,407
Speaker 1: You need to do extra work to get clean URLs on You know with an Apache web server Because one I mean unless you're doing something clever with the URL like delicious or the.

126
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:21,330
Speaker 0: all those sites.

127
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,706
Speaker 0: All the web 2.0 slash something does something for you.

128
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:30,050
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm People don't need to know the URLs of specific things.

129
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,941
Speaker 0: DNS you only need to know the top page.

130
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,370
Speaker 0: if you ever want to go deeper than the top of something.

131
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,156
Speaker 0: Why didn't you bookmark it?

132
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,501
Speaker 0: Maybe you're following a link.

133
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:44,440
Speaker 0: No one calls you and says hey, man You should go to devour ag org slash blog.

134
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,084
Speaker 0: They said they will one.

135
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,987
Speaker 0: you shouldn't call someone.

136
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:47,970
Speaker 0: tell them URL anyway.

137
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,719
Speaker 1: Yep, you just email them.

138
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:50,222
Speaker 1: send my link.

139
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:55,130
Speaker 1: if they're on the internet and they can go to the link You can email or I am it to them or they'll see it in a forum or something.

140
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:07,298
Speaker 0: Yep, podcasters and fury me with this as well since a lot of podcasters will be like they'll mention something in the show And they say oh, yeah, I go to tiny URL something now Why not just put the link in your show notes?

141
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:15,230
Speaker 0: because if they if the person listening can get to the internet To follow that tiny URL that you just told him they can get to your website.

142
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:21,797
Speaker 1: And if they're good, there's more likely that they're going to remember the website of the podcast They listen to often than it is.

143
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:27,289
Speaker 1: they're going to remember the URL that was said in the middle of a podcast That they listen to often.

144
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:39,130
Speaker 0: So yeah Tiny URL is kind of dumb and I guess it was useful for like a span of six or seven months Back before email and I am kind of evolved to being working as opposed to not working.

145
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,879
Speaker 0: But they didn't really exist back then.

146
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,603
Speaker 0: so it doesn't matter.

147
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:43,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's never been a use.

148
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:49,710
Speaker 1: No, tiny URL bad useless stupid if anyone can think of actually legitimate use for it.

149
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:59,410
Speaker 1: I'd like to hear that I defy you to give me a legitimate use of tiny URL and You know pretty much the only thing you're gonna come up with is makeup for user and confidence.

150
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,488
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was another story on slash.

151
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,480
Speaker 0: that Another story on slash.

152
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,430
Speaker 1: when it when it's slow tech news Slash that is the only place you can go because they are the only people who have somewhat real tech news every day.

153
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:17,650
Speaker 0: Not only that but it updates on a set like it just updates on this regular like tick tick tick.

154
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,424
Speaker 0: It's not a precise tick like every 1.8 hours.

155
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:31,950
Speaker 0: There's a story but you know Especially from people like us back when slash dot was the only real game in town if you're bored sitting somewhere You know how much time has gone by and you think well, it's about time for a new slash dot story.

156
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:32,873
Speaker 1: Yep.

157
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:33,556
Speaker 1: Okay.

158
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,745
Speaker 1: So there's a story on slash that says the fat.

159
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,914
Speaker 1: it's called the fastest processor You can't run.

160
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:49,475
Speaker 1: and basically what they're talking about is like Oh, man's AMD put out this Barcelona chip and Intel is trying to push it out of the news by releasing the Intel core 2 extreme ship.

161
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,930
Speaker 1: that's crazy fast and it's $1,200.

162
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:59,430
Speaker 1: but it's stupid because you can't even use the Intel core 2 extreme shit because it won't work in any motherboard.

163
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,075
Speaker 1: And that way.

164
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,203
Speaker 1: that's what the story on slash that is saying.

165
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:08,936
Speaker 1: the first thing I have to say is That the story is wrong.

166
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:11,464
Speaker 1: You can get a motherboard that can hold that chip.

167
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,310
Speaker 1: I'm looking at one a new egg right now.

168
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,362
Speaker 1: Let's see aces p5e3 deluxe.

169
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:20,138
Speaker 1: Oh look front side bus 1600 megahertz.

170
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,427
Speaker 1: What was this chip again?

171
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,380
Speaker 1: 1600 megahertz front side bus.

172
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,774
Speaker 1: there on the slash start article It says the fat.

173
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:32,888
Speaker 1: blah blah blah the lack of any motherboards that support a 1600 megahertz at front side bus.

174
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,515
Speaker 1: a new egg 1600 megahertz front side bus.

175
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:40,548
Speaker 0: Well was that statement made in the submission or by some editor in the submission?

176
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,933
Speaker 0: Oh Outstanding.

177
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember how I laughed?

178
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,582
Speaker 0: Yeah double that.

179
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:45,224
Speaker 1: Yeah.

180
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,730
Speaker 1: Well, here's the other thing.

181
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:54,962
Speaker 1: I got to say this because this is alright while in this particular instance This chip is actually runnable on a ludicrously expensive motherboard.

182
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:57,790
Speaker 1: It's a ludicrously expensive chip that you should not buy.

183
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,464
Speaker 1: I'm not saying anyone should buy this.

184
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,109
Speaker 1: do not do that.

185
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,506
Speaker 1: Unless I guess if you win the lottery and you're a nerd you might want to buy this.

186
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,249
Speaker 1: but that's about it.

187
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:13,322
Speaker 1: anyway people have been selling Unusable computer parts at ludicrously high prices for a long time.

188
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,030
Speaker 1: specifically or most of all is memory.

189
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,702
Speaker 1: I go on new egg right now and let's see Patriot.

190
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:24,656
Speaker 1: memory is selling the Patriot extreme Performance two times one.

191
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,178
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

192
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,246
Speaker 0: How many X's are in the name extreme one?

193
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,850
Speaker 1: Yes, it's actually spelled correctly.

194
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,959
Speaker 0: Oh They're selling to one less thing to make fun of.

195
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:43,327
Speaker 1: they're selling to one gig sticks of DDR 3 1866 RAM, which is PC 3 15,000. ha ha ha it runs.

196
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,459
Speaker 1: get this Faster than a 1600 megahertz bus.

197
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,286
Speaker 1: this RAM goes faster than any motherboard can handle.

198
00:14:52,306 --> 00:15:01,775
Speaker 1: oh And by the way, this motherboard that can handle a 1600 megahertz bus only does that with you know the overclocking Huh?

199
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:02,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, huh?

200
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:17,610
Speaker 1: So Like it's officially supported overclocking, you know, so this motherboard can handle DDR 1800 memory but this is DDR 1866 memory and It caused ludicrous amounts of money and it's completely useless.

201
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:23,150
Speaker 1: I don't understand who buys these sticks of RAM that are faster than any motherboard can handle.

202
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,922
Speaker 1: It's like on the same website on new egg comm.

203
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:31,679
Speaker 1: they are selling a stick of RAM That is faster than any motherboard on new egg comm can use.

204
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,796
Speaker 1: I Don't understand it.

205
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,208
Speaker 1: It's just crazy Stupid nerdy people who they just like to have.

206
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,406
Speaker 1: you know The best computer because it means they've a bigger penis or something.

207
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,029
Speaker 1: I don't know.

208
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,539
Speaker 0: I've just I've always bought kind of.

209
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:59,663
Speaker 0: you know, there's the curve of diminishing returns or you know Dollars per unit awesome and you know It comes up like a hump and then it goes back down in terms of how worth it Actually is and right before it peaks is right where you want to be.

210
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know the.

211
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,735
Speaker 1: What are the people thinking?

212
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:09,571
Speaker 1: who are buying the stuff that's ludicrously expensive and marginally faster or not faster You know what?

213
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:27,079
Speaker 0: They're thinking they're thinking well with this computer if I turn off half the settings I might be able to play crisis Things of the day.

214
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,819
Speaker 0: So last week I kind of said that I wanted to you know only do awesome stuff that isn't already on the top of dig and already on the top all those sites.

215
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,320
Speaker 0: and That's kind of hard to do because even if something isn't on those sites It will be long before I get to talk about it tonight.

216
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:52,530
Speaker 1: not only that but think about how much time it would take you to Dig the pun not intended through all the you know What video sites and stuff to find a thing of the day.

217
00:16:52,711 --> 00:17:09,760
Speaker 0: actually my secret what I really need to find an obscure thing of the day has been pretty much to go to the Hot sites of yesteryear that for some reason still exist and they post stuff that's so old or so out there That no one knows about it and no one who reads dig goes to those sites anymore.

218
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,839
Speaker 0: I mean if you ever really want to find something obscure just go around through meme pool.

219
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean before dig back in the olden day there were other sites that would collect links to cool stuff And BB spot mostly yes sites like that.

220
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,526
Speaker 1: So if you're looking for things of the day that you know are not elsewhere That's that's the business,

221
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:41,397
Speaker 0: but I'm gonna try a different tack now with my things of the day Instead of trying to find things you haven't seen no matter what and then telling you to watch them I feel like I'll just talk about the best thing I've seen which you probably have seen.

222
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:46,013
Speaker 0: if you go to dig I don't know every couple of weeks because it doesn't update so frequently anymore.

223
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,743
Speaker 0: Well, the videos don't anyway the only part I care about now.

224
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:53,480
Speaker 0: Yep, but um, well, I'll go back to a whole commentary where I assume you've already seen it.

225
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,952
Speaker 0: now you can hear my thoughts on it.

226
00:17:55,739 --> 00:18:00,280
Speaker 0: and What better to start with than one of my new favorite music videos Knights of Cydonia?

227
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:01,901
Speaker 1: All right.

228
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:06,800
Speaker 0: So Knights of Cydonia is a song in guitar hero 3 and I really like the song.

229
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:15,359
Speaker 1: Yeah I was playing through all the songs in guitar hero 3 and I knew most of them because they're legends of rock but this is One that I did not know and liked a great deal.

230
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,027
Speaker 1: Well is what I was looking for?

231
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:23,793
Speaker 0: sadly guitar hero 2 a lot more of those than three does as Gojo and Lara proved to us by showing it to us at their party.

232
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,640
Speaker 0: the music video to this.

233
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,979
Speaker 0: now This isn't some like fan made a music video.

234
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:37,060
Speaker 0: This is the music video Let's see kung fu Western unicorn laser guns robots.

235
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,906
Speaker 0: It's up my alley.

236
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,291
Speaker 0: The only thing I can say though.

237
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,455
Speaker 0: The only bad thing.

238
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:43,700
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's good in a way.

239
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,732
Speaker 0: I found out who stole my mustache.

240
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:50,153
Speaker 0: I Mean his isn't quite as majestic as mine was.

241
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:55,000
Speaker 0: it's a little bit raggedy But at the same time describe your former mustache is majestic.

242
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:58,240
Speaker 0: I got one picture where it's quite majestic the one where I'm wearing that tiara.

243
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,800
Speaker 0: It's not in that picture that mustache is majestic.

244
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,442
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

245
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:08,211
Speaker 0: it only became non majestic when it started rolled around the side and became more of a molest ash Instead of a mustache.

246
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:17,040
Speaker 0: It was always a molest Is either molest ash or a Hitler's - what it was only a Hitler's - when I finally shaved it off and I'd never.

247
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:21,133
Speaker 0: I'd never shaved my must my nose where mustache goes my entire life.

248
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:26,920
Speaker 0: when I finally shaved it the first time Of course, I shaved a Hitler's - yeah, and then you shaved her as well.

249
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:40,199
Speaker 0: I I wore the Hitler's - for like four hours and my landlady came in and said She she looked like she was about to act like she was offended and she was about to say something Like what but she cracked up before she could.

250
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:42,015
Speaker 0: It was great.

251
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,772
Speaker 0: Alright, I feel bad that Hitler ruined that.

252
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,440
Speaker 0: yeah, it used to be the chaplain.

253
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,605
Speaker 1: He ruined a lot of things.

254
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,593
Speaker 1: like the swastika was okay before Hitler.

255
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,239
Speaker 0: Yeah now people freak out about it.

256
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, even the backwards one.

257
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:58,830
Speaker 1: Well, you know It's like anyway You know anyone who you can you anything can be misused and demonized.

258
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,087
Speaker 1: that anything that some bad things can also be glorified and made I guess to appear good.

259
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah aggressive and militaristic Germany Hitler got rid of that.

260
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,080
Speaker 0: No one will stand for that anymore.

261
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:13,900
Speaker 1: The real thing that's bad is what you know, swastikas and Hitler mustache is symbolized not the things themselves not these symbols.

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,903
Speaker 1: You know, I mean like.

263
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:18,576
Speaker 1: even if Christianity is bad the cross is just a cross.

264
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,989
Speaker 1: It's not hurting anybody It's just a crime.

265
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:32,239
Speaker 0: Well, I believe The exact Unless they're using it on you in the prescribed manner.

266
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,426
Speaker 1: Right, you know, I can't do my thing Dana.

267
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:42,609
Speaker 0: No, so this video is Excellent most excellent, it's pretty excellent.

268
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,599
Speaker 0: And this is the kind of thing that's up my alley and I'll leave it at that.

269
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,505
Speaker 1: Wow, it's a great commentary.

270
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:48,930
Speaker 0: All right, what else can I say?

271
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,053
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

272
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:54,998
Speaker 1: If you disagree with me, you're not awesome All right, so, you know the Mona Lisa, right?

273
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,078
Speaker 0: Some paintings some famous guy did it baby something like that, right?

274
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:03,512
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, you know people like me you're not so knowledgeable in the ways of the arts.

275
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,220
Speaker 1: knowledgeable is computers not so much the arts.

276
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,652
Speaker 1: So I know the Mona Lisa is all great and important and whatever.

277
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:11,920
Speaker 0: Well, it's really hard to get arts installed and working properly.

278
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I did freaking conflicts and viruses whatever.

279
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:19,465
Speaker 1: but so is a cool video I found on the YouTube.

280
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,488
Speaker 1: I might have found it on dig.

281
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,940
Speaker 1: I don't remember and it's basically called Mona Lisa.

282
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:25,165
Speaker 1: Why so famous?

283
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,172
Speaker 1: and this guy explains to.

284
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:37,909
Speaker 1: he puts a picture of the Mona Lisa up there And he explains to you in as much detail as any common person should know Why it's important and why it's awesome.

285
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:48,332
Speaker 1: and it I guess now after seeing this video the Mona Lisa is more awesome to me than it was before and If you ever wanted to know you could go watch this video.

286
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,180
Speaker 1: It's like five minutes.

287
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:54,020
Speaker 1: It won't hurt you and you guys look at the Mona Lisa, which is nice looking.

288
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:54,804
Speaker 0: Is it just?

289
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,629
Speaker 0: I haven't watched you yet.

290
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,218
Speaker 0: Is it just one shot of the Mona Lisa?

291
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:57,640
Speaker 0: Does he pay?

292
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,798
Speaker 1: No, like he's moving the camera around and he's like drawing easy, you know superimposing things on it to demonstrate things.

293
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:12,460
Speaker 0: and well I can just imagine that he's drawing on it like Much like the most recent Perry Bible Fellowship.

294
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:18,100
Speaker 1: No, he's superimposing on you know, an image of the Mona Lisa to demonstrate why it's superimposed.

295
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:23,560
Speaker 1: And you know, he has other imagery he uses to explain why it's so awesome and important and everything.

296
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,200
Speaker 0: I'll probably watch it before I go to bed tonight.

297
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:32,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, well go downstairs and watch it after the show cuz I want to see it again - I guess Re-instill some of the ideas in my brain.

298
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,999
Speaker 0: That's why I really want to see what that Van Gogh movie that's coming out.

299
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:36,204
Speaker 1: This is a Van Gogh movie.

300
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,795
Speaker 0: Not the Van Gogh movie the DeGoya movie.

301
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:39,859
Speaker 1: I don't know who DeGoya is.

302
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,580
Speaker 0: You can see how much we know as Emily just corrected me.

303
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:56,876
Speaker 0: But yeah all I remembered was I saw a preview for a movie that was said a long time ago and involved guns in Spain and art and religion and Historical drama which is also up my alley almost as much as Cydonian Nights and their mustaches.

304
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,745
Speaker 1: All right, Netflix Q it is I don't know.

305
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,820
Speaker 0: I kind of want to see that in the theater, right?

306
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,173
Speaker 0: So speaking of seeing things in the theater Google Google Google.

307
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:06,976
Speaker 0: All right.

308
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:07,317
Speaker 0: Good night.

309
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:07,798
Speaker 0: All right.

310
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:14,040
Speaker 1: So we needed some show ideas and we came up and Emily actually we sat down.

311
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,527
Speaker 0: We're like, what are we gonna talk about this week?

312
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,054
Speaker 0: Cuz we're only doing three shows this week.

313
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,339
Speaker 0: hate to break it to you.

314
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:24,540
Speaker 0: But in America, there's this holiday called eat until you feel sick and that's Thursday.

00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,780
Speaker 0: I wish I hadn't ate so much.

00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:38,816
Speaker 1: You're gonna hear Turkey leg in football.

320
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:41,807
Speaker 0: I Get to watch the Lions lose.

321
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,700
Speaker 1: Well, no, I get to you know, you know, you know happen on Sunday?

322
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,997
Speaker 0: Did the Lions lose to the Giants?

323
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:52,775
Speaker 0: Oh, man I never said that I'm a fan of the Lions.

324
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:56,019
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter my city I don't root for the Lions.

325
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:03,160
Speaker 0: The Lions are nothing more than a Thanksgiving tradition in my family where we watch them wear their old-ass uniforms.

326
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,810
Speaker 1: They're actually, you know did in all seriousness.

327
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,340
Speaker 1: They're actually better this year than they've been in like a zillion years.

328
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,963
Speaker 1: They're not great.

329
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:12,480
Speaker 1: They're not win the Super Bowl or anything, but they're better than they've been in a long time.

330
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,567
Speaker 1: So you might see them win on Thanksgiving.

331
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,975
Speaker 0: that that would ruin a tradition of my.

332
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:17,999
Speaker 1: I don't know who they're playing.

333
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,663
Speaker 1: It does matter.

334
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,227
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

335
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:22,531
Speaker 0: They're not gonna win.

336
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,433
Speaker 0: It's Thanksgiving.

337
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,980
Speaker 0: I've seen them be up by like 30 and then lose it.

338
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, it happens, but they might anyway, uh, wow.

339
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:30,416
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

340
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:31,580
Speaker 0: The geeks are talking about football.

341
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:42,700
Speaker 0: Okay, so we were trying to come up with ideas and the original idea was good But we spawned that off into like a bunch of shows to do later, but we could just talk about Google.

342
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:54,656
Speaker 0: We realized we've never talked about Google straight up in terms of you know What it is really where it really came from why it's awesome Why all those SEO people can die in a fire, but at the same time why Google is awesome?

343
00:24:54,676 --> 00:25:01,310
Speaker 1: because they always thwart them Mm-hmm, but then I said hey Why don't we do a show about what it was like before Google?

344
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,520
Speaker 1: and then people fully understand why Google is awesome now.

345
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,776
Speaker 0: We have talked about this often in the past, but I don't think we've done an actual show about it.

346
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,439
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

347
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,082
Speaker 1: So maybe we should all right, so oh by the way Detroit's gonna is playing Green Bay on Thanksgiving.

348
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,645
Speaker 1: so uh, yeah, they're gonna lose.

349
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:19,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

350
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:20,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

351
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:23,735
Speaker 0: Okay, but they're gonna eat like a 13 legged turkey.

352
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe 1230 on Fox.

353
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:28,960
Speaker 0: Right.

354
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:39,498
Speaker 0: So, you know back in the day the internet was a collection of you know, 14 to 16 things Mm-hmm, and that was pretty much it.

355
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,829
Speaker 1: Well, are you talking about the web or the Internet?

356
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,340
Speaker 1: because the Internet was like well, you know what different things.

357
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,143
Speaker 0: It's true for both because originally the Internet was a very small number of computers that could talk to each other That's true.

358
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,133
Speaker 0: And then they added stuff to it.

359
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,420
Speaker 0: And then there was the way I mean.

360
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,437
Speaker 0: I guess we should really talk about what the web is.

361
00:25:56,518 --> 00:26:04,559
Speaker 0: briefly I mean people always a lot of people use the web or the world wide web to be synonymous with the internet and that is Absolutely, not true.

362
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:11,200
Speaker 0: The web is just if nothing else the easiest most obvious most well-known thing that the internet is used for.

363
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,828
Speaker 0: The web came long after the internet.

364
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,172
Speaker 0: the web was newfangled.

365
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:16,596
Speaker 0: for a long time the web evolved.

366
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaker 0: the web used to not have pictures.

367
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:26,628
Speaker 1: Yep The internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other on a network and they can send data to each other in in many ways and They're they you can do.

368
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,180
Speaker 1: you can have all sorts of different methods of sending data.

369
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,205
Speaker 1: I mean I could connect from one computer to another computer with SSH.

370
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:33,908
Speaker 1: I do it every day.

371
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:37,965
Speaker 1: I can connect from one computer another computer with IRC protocol.

372
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,469
Speaker 1: I don't do that very often at all.

373
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:39,729
Speaker 0: Gopher!

374
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,932
Speaker 0: I could use gopher.

375
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:41,815
Speaker 1: You could use gopher.

376
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,877
Speaker 0: I did use gopher.

377
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,786
Speaker 1: You could use Telnet you could use shoutcast.

378
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,551
Speaker 1: You can use all sorts of different protocols.

379
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,333
Speaker 0: RSH.

380
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:55,259
Speaker 1: Yeah all sorts of things and HTTP is just one of those things.

381
00:26:56,003 --> 00:27:05,976
Speaker 1: However, HTTP which is the hypertext transfer protocol Which in my age is the web which basically will send usually HTML which is an SGML.

382
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:09,627
Speaker 1: Yes HTML is hypertext markup language.

383
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,660
Speaker 1: So HTTP is a transfer protocol for the transfer of HTML.

384
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,668
Speaker 1: So basically the web is.

385
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:27,780
Speaker 1: there are servers and you go to the server and with HTTP There are pretty much three things that there used to be more things that you could do with HTTP like put.

386
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:30,739
Speaker 1: But nowadays all you can really do is get and post.

387
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:33,399
Speaker 1: Get says give me that page.

388
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:40,996
Speaker 1: So you go to a web server and you say get and the web server And the web server sends you the HTML.

389
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:45,391
Speaker 1: so when you type in google.com Your web browser sends packets to Google.

390
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:55,224
Speaker 1: that says get and then Google sends you Google.com the front page in HTML format and then your browser goes get get get get get to get the pictures and then loads the Pictures and that's it.

391
00:27:55,927 --> 00:28:06,390
Speaker 0: So and also the only other thing I really say is that www the acronym stands for the World Wide Web, but www.something does not mean you're on the web.

392
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,679
Speaker 0: that www is the name of the computer that is called www that is at the rest of that URL.

393
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:20,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just so happens that people often name computers with web servers running on them www because it kind of makes sense, don't you think?

394
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe so take that Godot.

395
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,380
Speaker 0: Who wouldn't listen to me and argued with me on Gmail for a while about that and not the Phoenix Wright guy?

396
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:37,920
Speaker 0: No, not the awesome guy Who's also awesome, but loses points for arguing with me about an IT issue when he's a juggler.

397
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,160
Speaker 0: Also, why does he have time to argue with me?

398
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,170
Speaker 0: I I was just some guy on the internet and yet he just kept responding because he makes his living Juggling at once a night.

399
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,720
Speaker 1: He doesn't do anything all day.

400
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:54,395
Speaker 1: He has time to bike the Tour de France on a stationary bicycle in his house.

401
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:56,120
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, I forgot about that.

402
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,482
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:57,024
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

404
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:59,033
Speaker 0: I remember Penn Jillette used to have a podcast.

405
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:00,037
Speaker 0: It was kind of good.

406
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,639
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so forget all that the web.

407
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:05,932
Speaker 0: How do you find stuff on the web?

408
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:11,700
Speaker 0: I mean back in the day You could go to the bookstore and this was before I even had access to the internet.

409
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:20,194
Speaker 0: This is back when I had prodigy but there was an internet that I theoretically could have gotten to though I didn't know how you could buy yellow pages of the internet that pretty.

410
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:24,579
Speaker 0: they were in the bookstore and they had Pretty much every website in the world.

411
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:36,240
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean there weren't that many of them only so many people had the ability to set up a web sir and the knowledge to Set up a working web server get it connected and keep it running properly you might say in the world.

412
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,160
Speaker 0: What about the rest of the world outside of the US?

413
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,860
Speaker 0: There really was no internet to speak of at least not like it is today.

414
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,952
Speaker 1: Was made in the US and it's still.

415
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,779
Speaker 1: most of it is in the u.s.

416
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,000
Speaker 1: U.s.

417
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:49,435
Speaker 1: Now it's spread out.

418
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,303
Speaker 0: the u.s Invented it.

419
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:50,706
Speaker 0: the u.s.

420
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,538
Speaker 0: Has the majority of its infrastructure.

421
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:56,994
Speaker 0: the u.s Has the majority of the control over it and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

422
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,294
Speaker 0: No, not really but back then I mean it was just.

423
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:06,842
Speaker 0: There were very few things that weren't just websites in English and you could go buy a book and you could search for Games.

424
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:12,900
Speaker 0: and under games you find like six URLs and they were all there and they didn't change.

425
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,540
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz I mean people who did set up a web server.

426
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,587
Speaker 1: I mean there wasn't that much advanced stuff you could do.

427
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,277
Speaker 1: you could pretty much set up static pages that didn't change.

428
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:30,394
Speaker 1: not like you Know you go to Amazon you can reload the page and it's different because it's a computer is automatically Generating that HTML based on data in a database and other information.

429
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,260
Speaker 1: They didn't have that technology originally.

430
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,880
Speaker 1: It was just someone made a web page and put it there.

431
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,931
Speaker 1: so it was basically like that would be.

432
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:44,496
Speaker 1: it was easily the same as Downloading a Word document and reading it and that Word document never changed unless someone manually changed it with their hands.

433
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,465
Speaker 0: and remember in the early Web, there weren't pictures There was nothing here.

434
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:54,894
Speaker 1: You were lucky if you had colors let alone pictures and of course escape 2.0 gold.

435
00:30:54,914 --> 00:31:03,382
Speaker 0: I Don't know if this is gonna turn to an ossiligist fest for blink tags and and Java's.

436
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:11,633
Speaker 0: remember those early like chat boards that were in a website that just Basically, we're a web page that refreshed every 10 seconds with what everyone had posted.

437
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:12,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then crashed.

438
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:17,139
Speaker 0: Yeah I used to hang out in those things all the time.

439
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,903
Speaker 0: Geoshitties.

440
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:22,405
Speaker 0: All right, but I had a Geocities site, but based on me to stuff at least realm It was a ROM site.

441
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:23,992
Speaker 1: I was in Times Square Castle.

442
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:29,733
Speaker 0: I was in Times Square dungeon Mm far 8716 I don't remember.

443
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:35,680
Speaker 1: but anyway The point is is that there were web servers and you needed to know the URL of the web server.

444
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:40,850
Speaker 1: And if the web server had multiple pages You needed to know the URL of those pages and it was.

445
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,327
Speaker 1: there was no way to find this out and mean less someone told You or how would you know?

446
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:48,340
Speaker 1: How would you know the URL of something?

447
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,668
Speaker 0: I mean, so, you know how people got around the internet.

448
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:56,871
Speaker 0: there was there's a term that was used in the 90s And it's pretty much ceased to exist.

449
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,060
Speaker 0: It is not a thing that people do anymore.

450
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,684
Speaker 0: It's kind of this archaic terminology.

451
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,349
Speaker 0: You didn't just use the internet.

452
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 0: people used to surf the web which been very specifically Go to a website.

453
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:11,506
Speaker 0: every website had a links page because that's how the internet was.

454
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,388
Speaker 0: and after you know, I'm looking at this web page and I'm bored with it.

455
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:15,933
Speaker 0: I'm done with it.

456
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:16,377
Speaker 0: I read it.

457
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,386
Speaker 0: What now internet like?

458
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:27,160
Speaker 0: click on links and it was usually a collection of things that were either related or Things that the person who made that web page thought himself or herself were interesting.

459
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:38,087
Speaker 0: So I'd go Oh bunnies I click on that and I'd read this page about bunnies for an hour and then I'd look down and say huh a link to a site on Military something something that sounds interesting.

460
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,497
Speaker 0: click and you just go website to website in a line.

461
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:42,380
Speaker 0: There were no tabs.

462
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:52,217
Speaker 0: you could open multiple windows, but Good luck with that with your 16 megabytes of RAM About three windows before it crashed if your dialogue didn't go first.

463
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:56,569
Speaker 1: Yep In addition to that people eventually made web rings.

464
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:58,314
Speaker 1: now what a web ring was?

465
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,280
Speaker 0: is you a collection of broken links?

466
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,320
Speaker 1: Basically, you would let's say I was I made a website about video games.

467
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:17,760
Speaker 1: I would go and I would find a web ring for video game websites and I would paste this code on my website and That so on my website to be this giant block of HTML like this big table and it would say video game web ring.

468
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:18,389
Speaker 1: click here.

469
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:30,080
Speaker 1: and basically, what it would do is Everyone else who joined that web ring would have this web ring thing on their site and you would click next on the web ring And we take you to the next site in the ring.

470
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:35,060
Speaker 0: Yep Next previous or random or you can look at the list but the list never worked on any of those stupid things.

471
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:48,567
Speaker 1: yeah, most of the sites were broken, but you could go around and go to every website of People who had joined this particular web ring and the idea was that hey if our sites are similar We all put this thing on our site.

472
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,680
Speaker 1: anyone who comes to any one of our sites will go to all of our sites.

473
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,532
Speaker 1: But I keep clicking next next next next next.

474
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,252
Speaker 1: I Put web rings on my old Geo city site for a while.

475
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,800
Speaker 1: I never went through a web ring.

476
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:03,120
Speaker 0: I went through web rings all the time partly because I wanted to find out stuff about anime.

477
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:14,231
Speaker 0: So I went on all these anime web rings and I download picture galleries that I didn't do the anime until I find like a MIDI File of the opening theme to Tenchi and that was hot shit.

478
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:18,672
Speaker 1: Yep now also in this day Eventually there came like there was.

479
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,040
Speaker 1: what was that called link exchange?

480
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,049
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah exchange was basically like the beginning of banner ads.

481
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:28,826
Speaker 1: what you did is you went to link exchange and you made a banner in MS Paint or whatever.

482
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:39,960
Speaker 1: you uploaded it and you put your URL in there and Then you would put this link exchange thing on your site and whenever anyone visited your site It would randomly select an image to show in the link exchange banner.

483
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:57,475
Speaker 1: It would be a random banner and the ideal was if you allowed a random banner to show up on your site every time someone visited then your banner would randomly show up on other people's websites and Hopefully someone would clink on the click on that random banner and end up at some other websites

484
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:59,360
Speaker 0: or they'd clink after the modem died.

485
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:09,100
Speaker 1: But yes but basically the point was There were people were trying to get more links to URLs on the web because it was impossible to find anything any other way.

486
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,509
Speaker 0: Now I do want to point out something.

487
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 0: I don't want to go into detail about this.

488
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:18,459
Speaker 0: this is obviously a topic for another show, but Notice how nothing we've said generates revenue for jack all anyone.

489
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:22,131
Speaker 0: yet Not so much talk about ads or anything like that.

490
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:22,994
Speaker 1: Look the only.

491
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,258
Speaker 1: where's some ads going on?

492
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:24,479
Speaker 0: many.

493
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,374
Speaker 0: But look the only thing we're talking about here that was close to an ad was this kind of open Free thing that people mutually used to try to help each other out.

494
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:34,920
Speaker 0: No one made money off of that.

495
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,093
Speaker 1: I think you could pay the link exchange.

496
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:45,820
Speaker 0: eventually at one point It all became about money but much of the web was pretty much just people posting interesting things and linking to other interesting things.

497
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:47,188
Speaker 0: There weren't pop-ups yet.

498
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:48,697
Speaker 1: No, not yet.

499
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:49,240
Speaker 1: Not yet.

500
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,679
Speaker 0: Anyway, no one had even thought what if I made a pop-up?

501
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,122
Speaker 1: I wasn't.

502
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:54,599
Speaker 1: it's like an escape three or four that says stuff was going on.

503
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,994
Speaker 0: Those were dark times because there's no way out.

504
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:59,440
Speaker 0: Yeah There's popovers.

505
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:10,780
Speaker 1: so the next thing that happened was Yahoo came about and Yahoo was a big deal because Yahoo was one website that you could go to And they had so many links to other websites and most of them were good and not broken.

506
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:11,984
Speaker 1: It was amazing.

507
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:18,643
Speaker 1: and the way Yahoo worked originally was you would submit a website to Yahoo with a description And everything.

508
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:31,420
Speaker 1: you had to fill out this form and people at Yahoo would manually look at that site Decide if it was good enough to be on Yahoo and if it was they would add it to Yahoo in the appropriate category.

509
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,865
Speaker 1: So when you're looking for gaming sites Gaming area on.

510
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:41,969
Speaker 1: Yahoo had like 50 links to different gaming websites and that was a big deal Especially when like new links showed up there you'd be like all man's.

511
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,080
Speaker 0: so up and the internet started getting bigger.

512
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:46,510
Speaker 0: There were more things around.

513
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,759
Speaker 0: things started changing moving.

514
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,331
Speaker 0: Suddenly pretty much every link on Yahoo was broken Yeah, and and new sites appeared far faster than they could keep up.

515
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:56,875
Speaker 0: Yahoo became nothing.

516
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,435
Speaker 0: it just became so useless pretty much.

517
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:06,506
Speaker 1: It was like for a time you would use Yahoo and then after a while you would go there to be nothing new for you at all.

518
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:13,039
Speaker 0: and You just like oh, but at the same time it didn't matter that much because internet culture was different.

519
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,719
Speaker 0: back then I would have a list of like 20 or 30 sites that I hung out at.

520
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,827
Speaker 0: Those were the sites that I went back to.

521
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,255
Speaker 0: I went to websites on purpose now.

522
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:23,760
Speaker 0: I just go to content aggregators.

523
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:28,420
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so then there was stuff like Alta Vista and web.

524
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:31,229
Speaker 0: Really fuzzy about the chronology because you don't care.

525
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:35,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure we're saying things chronologically out of order But that doesn't really matter.

526
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:41,188
Speaker 0: Well, what I'm saying is that there was kind of then this Power vacuum where suddenly there's no real.

527
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,860
Speaker 0: I mean you could use this Lycos thing which searched the internet in one way.

528
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:53,467
Speaker 0: I think their claim to fame was that we have more pages index than anyone else because we did by it was it was all About the number of pages you had.

529
00:37:53,547 --> 00:38:12,980
Speaker 1: right because there were certain numbers of pages on the internet and the way people were making these Search engines that the primitive search engines was with crawlers and the crawler would visit one website Then visit every website that that website linked to and so on and so forth and it would keep track of every website It could see and try to make a giant database of every website.

530
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,680
Speaker 1: There was so that way, you know the more sites they had in their search engine because there weren't so many sites.

531
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,000
Speaker 1: I mean there was a lot of sites thousands upon thousands and thousands But there weren't so many that there would be something about everything, you know.

532
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:35,020
Speaker 1: So that the idea was that the more sites we have indexed if you search for something You're likely to find what you're looking for with our search engine because we have more sites in day.

533
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:44,091
Speaker 0: However, you couldn't find dick and the reason was computers weren't that fast back then and search algorithms weren't all great back then And no one had been done anything really clever.

534
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:53,080
Speaker 0: So most search I mean, how does a website that's gonna search determine whether or not this site about kittens or this site about kittens is better?

535
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,234
Speaker 0: The only metric most people could come up with back Then was the number of times the word kittens appeared on the website and

536
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:07,080
Speaker 1: people are doing things like they would say All right Everyone put these meta tags at the top of your page with the keywords that you want to be known for.

537
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,709
Speaker 0: So then other sites would weight those things really highly.

538
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:16,977
Speaker 0: like if I make a video game ROM site my meta tags were video games ROMs illegal where's?

539
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:28,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, and literally in those days you could make a website right and at the top of the website you could be like meta space Keywords equals video games video games video games video games video games video games video games, etc.

540
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,046
Speaker 1: Like a hundred times.

541
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:35,948
Speaker 0: and then do slash meta and then at the bottom your website You got a white background in white text.

542
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:43,371
Speaker 1: You have the word video games a million times Yep, and basically now any sir almost a bunch of search engines.

543
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:48,044
Speaker 1: if someone typed in video games your site would be on top And that was how it worked.

544
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:58,375
Speaker 0: and right about then is also when ad sites started really springing up and there was the whole Dark age of advertising on the internet that we could probably do a separate show about.

545
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:04,688
Speaker 1: probably let's not talk about the advertiser no, let's talk about the searching right and The search engines were largely useless.

546
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:11,920
Speaker 1: and the worst thing about the search engines was that you would search for something and even if it Looked like a good link showed up link would be broken.

547
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:15,415
Speaker 1: It would just be you click and it would take you nowhere before or for.

548
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:17,282
Speaker 0: search engines were not Intelligent.

549
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:24,216
Speaker 0: if you type cats and the best cat site in the world had cats in it But never said the word cat you're not gonna find it.

550
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:27,800
Speaker 0: Nope, and Also, you really had to know your logic.

551
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,536
Speaker 0: A lot of people didn't realize that you know you this and this or this.

552
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,400
Speaker 0: you had to really.

553
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:38,673
Speaker 0: It was kind of an art and a science to craft a search that would find what you want What you wanted.

554
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:39,359
Speaker 0: you would never find it.

555
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,934
Speaker 1: Yeah The way you searched was a lot like the way you searched on the original CD-ROM encyclopedias.

556
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:49,419
Speaker 1: you had to say I want websites that have cats not pets.

557
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:53,929
Speaker 1: Yes Eating and try to find out like what wild like.

558
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,872
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

559
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:57,018
Speaker 1: maybe if you're trying to find out like what what?

560
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:02,731
Speaker 1: cats eat as opposed to what pet cats eat something like that.

561
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:11,557
Speaker 0: and of course in addition to all that this was right about the era where a Good quarter of the time any link you clicked on was actually pornography.

562
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:20,438
Speaker 0: unexpectedly All sorts of crazy porn out there and it was low-resolution Pornography - but porn would just pop up all the time no matter where you went.

563
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:28,140
Speaker 0: Yeah Like whenever I searched I had a club text thing open and anytime I search I type my search terms.

564
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:40,900
Speaker 0: They're like plus kittens plus kibble and then I'd paste Minus sex minus porn minus xxxx minus hot girls minus a million things to try and see a little bit less porn.

565
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,465
Speaker 0: Well, I searched for kittens and kibble.

566
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:51,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was how it was and all the way all the searches were kind of Eventually, I think Alta Vista was probably the best one.

567
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,301
Speaker 0: I don't

568
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:58,199
Speaker 1: know that but like you'd come up with a search and you would try it at all the different search engines because they'd All give you completely different results and maybe you'd get lucky

569
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:15,140
Speaker 0: And even then you'd have to dig down you'd pretty much assumed that the top four pages were useless and I'd be going to like the 80th page of links and Lycos and Yeah, and Alta Vista was pretty much the best of them and all the I guess geeky smart people tended to use Alta Vista.

570
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:18,731
Speaker 0: Failing that they use Yahoo pretty much or Lycos.

571
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:21,300
Speaker 0: the Lycos turned into a porn crawler web crawler.

572
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,439
Speaker 1: There was hot spot that right.

573
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,985
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of stuff.

574
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:33,788
Speaker 0: and then people made things like I think dogpile is the one people knew best where all it did was Submit your search to all the search engines I thought and it would search through those results.

575
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:35,655
Speaker 1: a dogpile is still around and there are many.

576
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,036
Speaker 1: there were.

577
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,258
Speaker 1: there were many sites like dogpile back in the day.

578
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:44,479
Speaker 1: So then eventually right Yahoo started getting a lot more users and it was actually they.

579
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,699
Speaker 1: you know They stopped doing the directory and it started doing search.

580
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:51,422
Speaker 0: Well, they still had the directory to decide the directory for a while But they remote.

581
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:52,205
Speaker 1: they were doing search.

582
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:54,654
Speaker 1: now real search and at first I think they'd had.

583
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:58,469
Speaker 1: the search was powered by the hotspot But later you would go to the bot.

584
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,060
Speaker 1: you would search on Yahoo because it was pretty much became the best.

585
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,371
Speaker 1: He would scroll to the bottom and it would say Yahoo powered by Google and I was you know You'd see that down there.

586
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:12,520
Speaker 1: You'd be like, okay There's some people named Google that are making Yahoo work and eventually people figured it out.

587
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:20,700
Speaker 1: They clicked on that word Google down there and it took him to Google and the internet was never the same not ever again.

588
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,100
Speaker 1: basically, Google was Always the same as it is now pretty much in terms of the search engine.

589
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:31,757
Speaker 1: It was a text box and a button with no shit in the way.

590
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,955
Speaker 1: pretty much I didn't what you wanted and you got what you want.

591
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:35,599
Speaker 0: anyone who?

592
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,207
Speaker 0: Went to Google and search for something.

593
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,240
Speaker 0: pretty much never used another search engine again.

594
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:46,377
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean you typed in what you want and there was the best thing in the world right at the top every time.

595
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:51,300
Speaker 0: and I Think we'll end on that that and think of this as part one of a fair.

596
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:54,179
Speaker 1: You want to talk a little bit about why Google was that way?

597
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,042
Speaker 0: I don't know.

598
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,080
Speaker 0: I kind of want to save that for the show about Google.

599
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,627
Speaker 0: Just talk about Google for the whole show.

600
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:02,623
Speaker 0: All right, you know why it's good why it's still good Why it was good.

606
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:16,900
Speaker 1: and I have to study my Wikipedia.
