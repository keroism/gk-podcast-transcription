Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:16,806
Speaker 0: It's a trivia battle.

5
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:17,950
Speaker 1: It's gonna be bad.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,192
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:25,340
Speaker 1: I went to the doctor today.

8
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:27,167
Speaker 1: Cut me.

9
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:28,399
Speaker 1: he cut me so bad.

10
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:30,068
Speaker 1: I wish you know cut me so bad.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,584
Speaker 0: was this like an accident like you tripped with the scalpel Or did you get something cut off?

12
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:38,100
Speaker 0: No, so I had this cuz I got stabbed with a needle by a nurse who tripped once.

13
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:40,718
Speaker 1: whoa smell practice anyway.

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:48,600
Speaker 1: No, so my in my family the Rubens we get I guess these things called I don't know if it's lumb poma or limb poma.

15
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:51,551
Speaker 0: Basically, I don't think it's lymphoma not lymphoma.

16
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,575
Speaker 1: It's a poma.

17
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,092
Speaker 1: know the lipoma I know what those are something like if I don't know how exactly it's pronounced.

18
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, like lipoma lipoma.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it is.

20
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,008
Speaker 1: Li poma, I guess.

21
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,775
Speaker 0: anyway, so basically the poma dangerous.

22
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,579
Speaker 1: No, it's not really annoying It's not dangerous anyway.

23
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:13,100
Speaker 1: Normally when you get fat on you the fat spreads out and like a layer, right?

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:20,325
Speaker 1: but sometimes you get a blob of fat in one spot and it's like you got a blob in your body and it's just Annoying and it can grow.

25
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:23,876
Speaker 1: and like my remember my grandpa had one on the back of his neck.

26
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,302
Speaker 1: That was like enormous Right.

27
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:32,900
Speaker 1: It was like it looked like a like a big fat snake around half of his neck in the bag Yeah, and he couldn't lean his head backwards or anything.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:44,959
Speaker 0: So I understand people who don't have access to health care but I've known a lot of people in my life who have Excellent access to health care who have things like this and just never get them dealt with.

29
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,752
Speaker 1: dude There are like I'll be watching.

30
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:59,423
Speaker 1: I forget who it was but like I was watching a immense game and one of the players had this huge mole type thing like near his ear like a big Like really crazy kind of thing that could easily almost definitely be removed Doctor.

31
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:07,029
Speaker 1: so maybe it couldn't be but it looked like it could be and he's a baseball player Which means it minimum he's making hundreds of K's a year.

32
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,340
Speaker 0: Hey, that might be a load-bearing mole probably millions, right?

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,296
Speaker 1: So it's like he could have had any.

34
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:19,900
Speaker 1: you know There's no reason for someone who's like a wealthy professional athlete to like, you know not remove.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,919
Speaker 1: So I could understand like maybe you have a scar from getting hit with a hockey puck in the face and you don't want to Get plastic surgery like fix it up.

36
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:29,712
Speaker 1: But if you've got like really, you know.

37
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:36,700
Speaker 1: or like if you've lost some teeth and you don't want fake ones All right, you know, but like if your teeth are all janky, it's like you can afford orthodontia.

38
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,128
Speaker 0: Well when you're an adult, that's a lot more invasive.

39
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:45,048
Speaker 1: I'm just saying but like if you got something growing on you You could get it removed.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,677
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's not hard.

41
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:51,415
Speaker 1: So it's like You know, I can't look at any guts or anything cuz I'll get nauseous.

42
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:52,460
Speaker 1: So I haven't looked at it.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,366
Speaker 1: It's under this bandage.

44
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,291
Speaker 1: There's some stitches.

45
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:55,378
Speaker 0: I guess I'll look at it.

46
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:56,602
Speaker 1: I can't.

47
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,851
Speaker 1: I can take it off tomorrow shower or whatever.

48
00:02:58,871 --> 00:02:59,373
Speaker 1: I should be.

49
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,704
Speaker 1: I hope I should be able to look at it by Tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:04,200
Speaker 0: I'm just shockingly on the squeamish when it comes to that kind of stuff.

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,264
Speaker 1: I'm not like.

52
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:13,120
Speaker 1: I'm just sitting there and I'm not looking and dude just cutting my arm open And yeah I can feel like my skin being tugged and I can feel him try to squeeze it out.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,929
Speaker 1: And I looked at it once.

54
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:16,340
Speaker 1: it was in this little plastic jar.

55
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,713
Speaker 1: That wasn't a problem because it was just like a little blob of fat.

56
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:25,916
Speaker 1: It looked like someone cut it off a steak You know and but not a problem I just can't look at like a hole in my arm cuz.

57
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:33,320
Speaker 0: then I'll be like, whoa I mean I was literally in the woods like with a bicycle spoke through my leg and I was just laying there like well, fuck me.

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I saw that pull that out like bike home, there was no pain whatsoever No, and in fact, he also liquid nitrogen.

59
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:41,812
Speaker 1: this war on my finger.

60
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,533
Speaker 1: So I was trying to remove how you got the twofer Right.

61
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:45,698
Speaker 1: Yeah That's why I did it too for it.

62
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,342
Speaker 1: Right because I didn't.

63
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:46,885
Speaker 1: I wanted.

64
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:49,576
Speaker 1: I was going in for the wart primarily because I've been trying to.

65
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:52,286
Speaker 1: I tried to remove the war Three different ways you go.

66
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:56,961
Speaker 1: said the duct tape method was gonna work and I don't disbelieve her because I guess she removed one with duct Tape.

67
00:03:57,082 --> 00:04:00,760
Speaker 0: I have removed them with duct tape in the past - it didn't work for me the duct tape.

68
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:04,554
Speaker 1: I also before I tried the duct tape I was trying compound W from the drugstore.

69
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:06,000
Speaker 1: that didn't work either.

70
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:12,255
Speaker 1: so this time I went for the liquid nitrogen method from the doctor and That hurt way more than getting.

71
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:20,560
Speaker 0: Yeah No as a kid, I got a planter's ward and one of my feet like in the middle of it on the bottom and It took two years to get rid of that motherfucker.

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,786
Speaker 0: I went back like the first.

73
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,639
Speaker 0: they did the like the norm the UV burn then the UV burn again.

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,486
Speaker 1: It's gonna work.

75
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 0: and then they cut it out and it grew back again.

76
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:35,540
Speaker 0: and then the liquid nitrogen did and took like a Centimeter chunk out of my foot and I have a scar and a hole and pain to this day.

77
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,060
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that the liquid nitrogen in the finger is just gonna permanently work here.

78
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:48,080
Speaker 1: But it's like he sprayed it on there for like 15 seconds Right and it stung while he was doing it and now it's kind of sore.

79
00:04:49,023 --> 00:05:00,488
Speaker 1: and he says what's gonna happen is eventually just keep band-aiding it and Eventually, it's gonna just fall off on its own and underneath will just be skin and it'll be totally cool Yeah, and they'll be like a scab or whatever.

80
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:03,620
Speaker 1: Just you know, just keep band-aiding it and ignoring it until it falls off.

81
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:08,879
Speaker 1: So I'm like, okay, that's what I'll do But I gotta go back and get the stitches removed from the armhole on the other side.

82
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:13,636
Speaker 0: There I have an annoying vein in my body that could be remain.

83
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,385
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like internal But why would you remove a vein?

84
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:17,629
Speaker 1: because it's something I'd.

85
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,874
Speaker 0: it's an annoying vein.

86
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:19,556
Speaker 0: that does nothing.

87
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:22,485
Speaker 1: What's I found out about?

88
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:23,369
Speaker 1: is it a hemorrhoid?

89
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,453
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

90
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:25,919
Speaker 1: I am right is a vein.

91
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:29,717
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll tell the story in a separate time, but I have a vein in a place.

92
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:30,400
Speaker 0: That is annoying.

93
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,517
Speaker 0: Doctor was like that junk, baby.

94
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:35,893
Speaker 1: And he was it's it's it on the sack.

95
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:36,817
Speaker 1: You gotta get a sack.

96
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:37,300
Speaker 1: It's in there.

97
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,366
Speaker 0: It's in the left sack.

98
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,659
Speaker 0: It's like a bunch of extra vein in there.

99
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,300
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and the doctor was like I went when I was a kid.

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,224
Speaker 0: I was like is this fun?

101
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:45,108
Speaker 0: is this cancer?

102
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,619
Speaker 0: and I go to the doctor and he's like no it actually isn't it's.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,180
Speaker 1: I mean, I got a vein on my sack and my junk and it pumps blood to fill up my junk.

104
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,644
Speaker 0: This is like an extra vein and they were like you can get it cut out But it involves not surgery.

105
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,751
Speaker 0: and I was like, yeah, I'll let it be.

106
00:05:59,494 --> 00:05:59,634
Speaker 1: Yeah.

107
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:01,039
Speaker 1: This is just on my forearm.

108
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:01,300
Speaker 1: It was.

109
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:03,545
Speaker 1: It was not like a giant.

110
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:07,340
Speaker 1: if there's a lump of fat on my nuts that should have been removed when it was tiny.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,446
Speaker 1: No, it was like.

112
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:10,899
Speaker 1: I mean, it was still tiny but I just want.

113
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,294
Speaker 1: you know It got a little tiny bit bigger since like last year.

114
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:17,628
Speaker 1: I've had it for years and I'm like Let's remove this before the grandpa sighs.

115
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:21,987
Speaker 0: Well, I got on my left wrist - I got a Gideon's lump and that thing comes and goes.

116
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:26,986
Speaker 0: it's actually kind of big now compared to normal and Surgery seems to be ineffective.

117
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,472
Speaker 0: So I decided to never bother.

118
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:29,175
Speaker 1: It's a book thing.

119
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me hit it with the book.

120
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,780
Speaker 0: No, I smashed it once and I made it go away for like four years, but then it came back.

121
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:35,443
Speaker 1: I'll smash it.

122
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,072
Speaker 1: It'll be I'll smash it hard enough for eight years.

123
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:37,534
Speaker 1: Yeah.

124
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:38,580
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to break my wrist.

125
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:42,660
Speaker 0: I'll put up with the Gideon's lump instead of the risk of breaking my wrist.

126
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:44,724
Speaker 1: I'm really precise.

127
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,366
Speaker 1: It's smashing.

128
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:47,573
Speaker 1: So anyway, he's my ball peen hammer.

129
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,577
Speaker 1: So super precise.

130
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:53,711
Speaker 0: I am always Oddly afraid of any use of a ball peen hammer.

131
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,641
Speaker 1: I'll use my regular hammer Precise.

132
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:59,030
Speaker 0: you remember what a ball peen hammer is for cuz we leave it up.

133
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, you remember a peening is I guess Shaping metal somehow.

134
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,175
Speaker 1: that's all in vaguely.

135
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:17,820
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so the biggest news this is actually pretty big news Even though it only affects a subset of this is big enough that my co-workers brought it up Right like rim message it to me and then I saw it was in my slack at work.

136
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:18,904
Speaker 1: I'm like well like this.

137
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:33,820
Speaker 0: cut through cuz if you're in the stage like, you know that even like Pure normal like joyous like Sonic the Hedgehog of OC fanfiction knockoff parody account Will remind you that shits bad politically in the u.s.

138
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,959
Speaker 0: Like you can't get away from it.

139
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,127
Speaker 0: Like that is like the undercurrent of everything.

140
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:41,340
Speaker 0: and yet this cut through all of that and filled my feet.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,641
Speaker 0: See

142
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:56,134
Speaker 1: that kind of makes me happy because usually that's the kind of thing that I really pay attention to are like Really specific features that have been added to or removed from software that is I use or is used You know by many yep, and that's like important news because even though

143
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:57,600
Speaker 0: in tabs appeared in web browser

144
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:09,358
Speaker 1: Right, like some small feature added to a software, especially if it's a frequently used popular software It could actually be like completely changing the everyday lives of the people who use that software

145
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:15,480
Speaker 0: or more importantly They're a bellwether of a huge iceberg of change that you don't know about

146
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,122
Speaker 1: Right.

147
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:20,460
Speaker 0: It's like it's a feature that everyone wanted but couldn't happen because of some complicated reason.

148
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:31,216
Speaker 1: These features that when they're released seem just sort of like like people might make fun of them or scoff or who just ignore them And up can change the world even like when cameras are in phones.

149
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,039
Speaker 1: room was like man.

150
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,491
Speaker 1: But meanwhile cameras and phones has changed the whole world.

151
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,900
Speaker 0: I was not mad on the concept.

152
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,943
Speaker 0: I was mad about the fact that in that era any phone that had a camera in it Ram was like.

153
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:41,707
Speaker 1: I don't need that.

154
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,134
Speaker 1: any browser with tabs is stupid.

155
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:44,179
Speaker 1: I was open to more windows.

156
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,387
Speaker 0: I went to tabs right away.

157
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:51,967
Speaker 0: I know you didn't but in that era Cameras and phones were Garbage.

158
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:53,015
Speaker 1: you get like nothing.

159
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:55,692
Speaker 1: you'd know Many a video.

160
00:08:55,993 --> 00:09:00,000
Speaker 1: that is garbage quality because the content outweighed the fact that the quality was garbage.

161
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,185
Speaker 0: But it wasn't just that.

162
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:09,700
Speaker 0: in that era most phones unless you bought an expensive Weird dongle or did a bunch of hacking you could not get the pictures off your phone without paying money.

163
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:11,749
Speaker 1: My foot I got the dongle on my phone.

164
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:17,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, my dog with a dongle for my phone was $70 and it was not worth it.

165
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,483
Speaker 1: I think I bought it for like five bucks My phone.

166
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:25,849
Speaker 0: it was $70 and there was a hack way you could do it and I tried the hack way And it did not work, and then I gave up.

167
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,174
Speaker 0: hmm, but anyway.

168
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,620
Speaker 0: This is one of those features.

169
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,809
Speaker 0: This is it's a big deal.

170
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,620
Speaker 0: that is a big deal, and we don't even know the details of it yet.

171
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,783
Speaker 1: We don't need to know details.

172
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:35,425
Speaker 1: Netflix

173
00:09:35,746 --> 00:09:39,897
Speaker 0: announced kind of out of nowhere that they're gonna have basically airplane mode

174
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:59,545
Speaker 1: right so that means Instead of having to be connected to the internet while you're watching your Netflix you can while you're home Download an episode or season or whatever of some amount of Netflix content And then watch it when you don't have an internet connection like if you're somewhere where there can't be internet like the middle of the woods Or in the subway.

175
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:05,748
Speaker 1: or you know it's basically the same thing that Spotify just sort of does automatically only Netflix.

176
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:15,829
Speaker 0: now first Here's a big deal for the UX like you don't understand like you unless you really think about it the wide range of Applications for this that will really make things good for people.

177
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:28,653
Speaker 0: for one people with metered bandwidth you can pre-download a bunch of shit when the bandwidth is cheaper if you're in one of those places or You download a bunch of shit at the end of the month and then watch it the next month

178
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:31,422
Speaker 1: right people using their wireless data Right.

179
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:36,499
Speaker 1: right now Verizon and whatnot is charging them a fortune because they're watching videos like in the car using LTE.

180
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:50,640
Speaker 1: Instead right now they can be at home with their free or much cheaper Wi-Fi use that data And then when they're in the car basically you know this is gonna cost Verizon AT&T T-Mobile Sprint a lot of money.

181
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:56,140
Speaker 1: People actually use this feature enough and wisely.

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,933
Speaker 1: They're gonna be selling a lot less data's and making less money's.

183
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 0: or even if say your internet is Unreliable or slow so that streaming is low-quality like even like here with my.

184
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:11,636
Speaker 1: You can't get HD's because you have crappy internet, and you live in the woods.

185
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:20,740
Speaker 1: well now when you go to bed You can just say hey Netflix download this and the next day is done And then you can watch it in full HD's even though you have a shitty internet with like satellite internet or some garbage.

186
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:28,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in my life right now a big part of why I don't watch a lot of anime in particular Is that what I would like to do?

187
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,260
Speaker 0: because I have like a half-hour commute each way.

188
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:33,068
Speaker 0: It's just watch it on my commute cuz I got nothing else to do.

189
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,780
Speaker 0: like it's read watch something listen to something sleep.

190
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:38,567
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do nothing.

191
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,559
Speaker 1: I used to watch like whole seasons of anime on the train.

192
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,500
Speaker 0: That was a laptop, and I'd even sometimes that was mine.

193
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:46,985
Speaker 1: I was my iPhone 3g.

194
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:56,480
Speaker 1: what I would do is I'd rip DVDs or download stuff convert it with handbrake And then put it on to the storage of the iPhone and watch it in the default iPhone video player.

195
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:02,600
Speaker 0: But the crunchyroll doesn't have this and it's not like I want to download stuff to keep forever or like pirate or whatever.

196
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:14,497
Speaker 0: I literally just want to watch the like one punch man on my way to work instead of having to be at home or Above-ground to watch it like let me time shift for an hour, and I'm good yep.

197
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:26,131
Speaker 0: So on the back end what makes this really important is that the only reason this feature did not exist Everywhere immediately in the streaming world is because of licensing.

198
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:33,979
Speaker 0: the people who made content were by and large Adamant against any possibility of downloading anything ever mm-hmm.

199
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:49,635
Speaker 0: That's why YouTube does not have a download button even though people who work at Google have in many times Told me these specific downloader services to use yep, because they know yeah There's there are YouTube extensions for Chrome like that.

200
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:55,580
Speaker 1: let you download YouTube videos And they're not officially approved by Google or either not Google made.

201
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,931
Speaker 0: But but the winks is good as a nod to a blind bag.

202
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,779
Speaker 1: You can totally trust the good ones.

203
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:12,428
Speaker 0: so Netflix has rolling this out for their own content, and it'll be very interesting to see what other Content that is licensed from other people gets.

204
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:22,284
Speaker 0: this treatment versus doesn't right because you'll be able to infer a lot about the state Of the licensing industry by seeing what gets that little download widget And what doesn't right.

205
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:27,001
Speaker 1: and YouTube actually if you pay for YouTube red you can do this Onto.

206
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:34,631
Speaker 1: you're like I. if your iPad or your iPhone or whatever you just can't do it to a computer It's like in my I I pay for YouTube red.

207
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:44,424
Speaker 1: so in my YouTube official app on my iPad I could download something and keep it in there to watch it in the subway, but YouTube doesn't have like entire series of things I want to watch.

208
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,047
Speaker 1: it's not how I use YouTube so it's not a feature I end up using.

209
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:57,059
Speaker 1: unless like there's a rare case I'll use it which is if I start watching something long in the morning, and I see something when I wake up That's kind of long, and I don't want to watch it right away.

210
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,860
Speaker 1: No, you know and I think if I'm I usually just add it to watch later.

211
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:04,839
Speaker 1: But if I plan to watch it later on the train I'll also push the download button.

212
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,729
Speaker 0: But it also serves a sort of quasi area between like.

213
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,157
Speaker 0: I don't really care that much about owning media anymore.

214
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,890
Speaker 0: like I'm fine with Ephemeral nature of the streaming world.

215
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,211
Speaker 1: I don't want to own any physical objects I don't and I don't care about the.

216
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,637
Speaker 1: you know semantic.

217
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:25,732
Speaker 1: You know like Ideological difference between owning a license to what you know.

218
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,140
Speaker 0: there is a practical difference though as I think someone pointed out.

219
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,123
Speaker 0: I saw much of screenshots.

220
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:32,473
Speaker 0: It's actually really hard to legally watch the old Evangelion again.

221
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:34,199
Speaker 1: I got it.

222
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:36,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have DVDs that I ripped.

223
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,311
Speaker 1: yeah who don't got it?

224
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,580
Speaker 0: anyone who didn't buy the DVDs when it was out?

225
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,687
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can just buy DVDs.

226
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,432
Speaker 0: No out of print hard to get expensive.

227
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,860
Speaker 1: You can just buy DVDs on eBay.

228
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:49,679
Speaker 1: I'm sure this bootleg ones, but that are exact rips of the real ones.

229
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,510
Speaker 0: Let's see that's three dot 33. you cannot redo.

230
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,058
Speaker 1: They're working on the final one for 44 whatever.

231
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:00,891
Speaker 0: so once four Dot four dot four dot four four four final rebirth.

232
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,195
Speaker 1: There's volume one.

233
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,520
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a box set.

234
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,668
Speaker 0: Here's the old pre remastered box.

235
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,731
Speaker 0: That's a perfect collection.

236
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,916
Speaker 1: What's not perfect about that.

237
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:09,140
Speaker 0: That's not the platinum edition.

238
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:09,946
Speaker 0: It says perfect.

239
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:11,075
Speaker 0: That's the old box.

240
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:14,974
Speaker 1: then I Mean you can get it if you want to easily.

241
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:15,820
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a platinum one.

242
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, one hundred and seventy two dollars.

243
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:18,207
Speaker 0: Well.

244
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,455
Speaker 1: I mean that's what someone's trying to charge for it.

245
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:24,750
Speaker 0: You can 14 offers 172 hundred and it's all in the hundred and seventy.

246
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,180
Speaker 1: you should sell yours because it's already been ripped.

247
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I threw away the case though.

248
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:30,916
Speaker 0: I just have the DVDs.

249
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:33,269
Speaker 1: sell it for 150 Yeah, or a hundred.

250
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:41,035
Speaker 0: I feel like worthless plastic Like a human being who would buy a season of anime for $200 or even $100 on Amazon.

251
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,711
Speaker 1: doesn't exist Which is why they're all still for sale and not sold.

252
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,139
Speaker 0: is the kind of person who?

253
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,078
Speaker 0: Needs the collector aspect of it as opposed to just watching it?

254
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,630
Speaker 1: Listen anytime.

255
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:52,760
Speaker 1: I want to watch Evangelion.

256
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,265
Speaker 1: I'm confident that it will be available for me to watch in the form I desire to see it It's not.

257
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:05,077
Speaker 0: there are things that are hard to get and watch though They're slightly rare and I just kind of collect those and I even have the video file for stupid.

258
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:05,920
Speaker 1: nothing lasts forever.

259
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:10,120
Speaker 1: So if I can get that from that Australian TV rip, I know anything.

260
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:14,910
Speaker 0: So pay attention to this.

261
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,958
Speaker 0: the fact that this happened is Kind of a big deal and you're gonna see a lot of real life either.

262
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,804
Speaker 0: you're going to see Doesn't have this.

263
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:23,428
Speaker 1: I wish they did.

264
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm probably gonna because of this feature.

265
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,527
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna.

266
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:28,100
Speaker 1: you know one South Park season is done.

267
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,239
Speaker 1: I'm gonna end my Hulu and get a Netflix for a while.

268
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:38,849
Speaker 0: Oh more importantly I want crunchyroll to do this because anime is like my go-to Watch long series that I like.

269
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,980
Speaker 1: it would be real convenient cuz one anime episode is like one subway ride.

270
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,420
Speaker 0: Yeah I could basically watch two to three episodes of some rando show a day every day.

271
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:52,563
Speaker 0: And the only reason I don't do that now is that as soon as I get home like oh now I'm home now I can watch anime.

272
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,760
Speaker 0: I got overwatch to play mmm, and I got geek nights to record I guess

273
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:06,637
Speaker 1: Mmm, so actually Something I've noticed a lot lately is there's you know You know There's certain things that like come up and it's like wow people have been talking that about that a lot lately.

274
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:09,339
Speaker 1: or man people have Been using that new word a lot lately, right?

275
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,619
Speaker 1: The thing I've that's lately has come up more often is like theme parks for some reason.

276
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:17,803
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz the other night we were all talking about like Thanksgiving.

277
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:24,969
Speaker 1: we're talking about Universal and Disney cuz like they were watching on ABC like the Disney Thanksgiving Whatever thing at the right.

278
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:31,437
Speaker 1: and then yeah, you know, my sister lives in LA So she has like a season pass to Universal cuz it'll close to her house.

279
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:34,993
Speaker 0: for a couple months I've been rumbling with Emily and Jason some other people that next summer.

280
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,239
Speaker 0: We're going to fucking cedar point.

281
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:37,982
Speaker 0: Clock is ring.

282
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:50,140
Speaker 1: I'm just saying so there's a news that happened that makes me want to hold off going to any of those places because Nintendo has made a deal to make Nintendo theme park shit at the universals.

283
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:54,940
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna wait until that shit is done and then I'm going and going hard.

284
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:57,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I'm gonna ride the Mario ride.

285
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,345
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be all up in that curvy ride Where I turn into a ball.

286
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:10,270
Speaker 1: if this Of that Harry Potter stuff that shit will be lit and it's like man It's like yeah that hurt Harry Potter.

287
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,960
Speaker 1: shit is like they go so deep, right?

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,482
Speaker 1: You can buy.

289
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:21,717
Speaker 1: they have like multiple flavors of like butter beers and I don't read any Harry Potter's but I know what that is Right and you could drink that shit there and I probably won't like it cuz I don't drink

290
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,940
Speaker 0: that I mean granted It's interesting because like the Harry Potter land is super.

291
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:26,108
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

292
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 1: If that's what they got at the Harry Potter land, right?

293
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,484
Speaker 1: What's the Nintendo land gonna have?

294
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:32,234
Speaker 1: like every different Yoshi's cookie to eat right?

295
00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:35,635
Speaker 0: It's like oh, man Yoshi's cookies kind of bad though.

296
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:39,291
Speaker 1: Listen, if they cookies at the theme park will taste good.

297
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also Yoshi's cookie is good and you're a bad person.

298
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:43,624
Speaker 1: What I mean?

299
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:46,213
Speaker 1: and can you imagine the Pokemons that are gonna be in there?

300
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,120
Speaker 0: Pokemon land will be its own thing.

301
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:51,929
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like There's so much Nintendo shit.

302
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:56,093
Speaker 1: You could make the greatest theme park ever Like you could just make a whole theme park Nintendo only.

303
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:57,240
Speaker 0: well like already, right?

304
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,732
Speaker 0: So the Harry Potter thing like you buy one of their stupid wands.

305
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:07,480
Speaker 0: then all over Harry Potter land You can do certain motions and cast spells like make it happen and I mean like, you know, the link dragon themed roller coaster.

306
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:14,980
Speaker 0: You buy the special you buy the master ball and then you can do AR games and fight trainers like in the fall man.

307
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:20,367
Speaker 1: You go down the pipes and you come out and like it's a slide Takes you to underground Mushroom Kingdom.

308
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:23,799
Speaker 1: Yep, and you go down there and there's music playing like doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Really?

309
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,803
Speaker 0: The only problem the only rule is you have to eat a bunch of food before you go into that park and do not eat Until you leave.

310
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,690
Speaker 0: that is like the only problem.

311
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,320
Speaker 1: I want to eat the delicious Nintendo food like magic mushrooms.

312
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:37,478
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah eat the snacks, but don't eat real food, but the sandwich.

313
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,607
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

314
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:49,440
Speaker 0: I found this a while ago and I just thought it's really cute and funny.

315
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,178
Speaker 1: And this is a good thing of the day because it's simultaneously internet II like the shit rim likes.

316
00:19:54,198 --> 00:20:01,388
Speaker 1: that sucks But not so internet II like a homestuck that a normal person or a normal nerdy person At least is gonna be like.

317
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,420
Speaker 1: what the fuck is this crazy nonsense for 12 year old?

318
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:11,689
Speaker 0: So I am glad you brought this up Scott because I just on the patreon Remastered an old beta episode of geek nights.

319
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,136
Speaker 0: All right, and we started doing our things of the day.

320
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,687
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I my thing of the day.

00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,340
Speaker 0: Like you're really into my thing of the day.

323
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,084
Speaker 1: What was your thing today?

324
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,439
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's not relevant right now.

325
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:26,691
Speaker 0: It was the holographic augmented reality gorillas concert.

326
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:32,173
Speaker 0: Not bad your thing of the day Mm-hmm was the most horrific internet shit.

327
00:20:32,494 --> 00:20:33,660
Speaker 0: It was so painful.

328
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,228
Speaker 0: And you so you in this episode.

329
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,017
Speaker 0: I play some of it in the episode because we want like.

330
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:42,172
Speaker 0: we listen to it and watch It and I am the whole time being like Scott.

331
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:42,916
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

332
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:43,600
Speaker 0: This is painful.

333
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,188
Speaker 0: Oh, how could you and meanwhile you're like shut up.

334
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:46,930
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

335
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,291
Speaker 1: What is it?

336
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:57,067
Speaker 0: It is the all your base Mm-hmm, like that story Sung filk style to the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody.

337
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:57,888
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good.

338
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:03,310
Speaker 0: It is So bad and painful I could have internet.

339
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,937
Speaker 1: It's not as bad as your time.

340
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:07,101
Speaker 0: We will not know.

341
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:07,924
Speaker 0: make your time.

342
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,590
Speaker 1: It's not potato conditions.

343
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,568
Speaker 1: If I may at least it makes sense.

344
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:23,689
Speaker 0: if I had used this without telling you that this was your thing of the day from 2005 as my thing of the day today You would probably have said it's terrible internet shit garbage.

345
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,030
Speaker 1: It's not as terrible as potato conditions.

346
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,958
Speaker 1: It's not just nonsense, I mean it might be poor.

347
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:31,860
Speaker 1: I haven't listened to it right.

348
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:38,056
Speaker 1: I could I concede it may be poorly sung Cringe-worthy filkness, right?

349
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:42,609
Speaker 1: It's filky and in that sense it is bad, but conceptually, right?

350
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:49,330
Speaker 1: It's not just in unintelligible nonsense or an internet shouty guy or a 12 year old garbage, right?

351
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,012
Speaker 1: It's actually the.

352
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:53,630
Speaker 1: conceptually it's you know a remix which is just fine.

353
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:56,263
Speaker 0: Just saying that's my bar.

354
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:56,563
Speaker 0: now.

355
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:04,267
Speaker 0: that thing of the day from 2005, you know also, you know 11 year ago Scott was what 20.

356
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:04,790
Speaker 1: what for?

357
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:10,245
Speaker 1: right 24 and 25 year olds like bad days.

358
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:11,230
Speaker 1: You can't trust them.

359
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,330
Speaker 0: So anyway my thing of the day today, this is just a cute series of shorts.

360
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,061
Speaker 0: It is the fantastic adventures of Bellsprout.

361
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:19,788

00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,099
Speaker 1: But not it's like.

Speaker 0: no you never upgrade those guys.

370
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:36,160
Speaker 0: I like my time Bellsprout Oddish.

371
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,970
Speaker 1: Oddish starts out cuter than Bellsprout but gets uglier.

372
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:45,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bellsprout starts out just fine but gets not as ugly as Oddish gets but still ugly that you wouldn't want it.

373
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,544
Speaker 0: I want my team to be all cute little guys.

374
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:50,753
Speaker 0: So Bellsprout Stupid game.

Speaker 1: I'm walking around and you know this Pokemon that people just have standing next to them.

376
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:58,047
Speaker 1: But they're just like you talk to those Pokemon and they go squirt or whatever you want.

377
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,232
Speaker 0: those Pokemon There's.

Speaker 1: they got fucking core solas everywhere and I'm like, man, I need a rods I can catch me a core Sola, that's like the ultimate cute Pokemon.

380
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:08,635
Speaker 1: It's a little pink coral guy.

381
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:09,418
Speaker 1: He's like the cutest.

382
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,309
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, nothing beats combi and I don't even have a water.

00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:15,975
Speaker 1: Pokemon combi is way cute Thing of the day, right?

384
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:16,358
Speaker 1: Yep.

385
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,665
Speaker 1: What the hell was my thing of the day?

386
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:18,630
Speaker 0: All right, it was a test.

387
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:19,561
Speaker 1: It is a test.

388
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:20,310
Speaker 1: This is a good test.

389
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:26,398
Speaker 1: I'm a little short on things of the day lately because the people are so upset on the internet They're not producing good stuff.

390
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,947
Speaker 1: So get back to work internet.

391
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:31,725
Speaker 0: But all right, this is the one with the cute Guma girl.

392
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:41,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, so There's many many paper Mario games And Mario RPG type games and the best of all of them if you don't know is thousand year door for the game of cube.

393
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:46,009
Speaker 1: People make fun of that game cube, but I had like this thing ridiculously incredible game for it.

394
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:50,690
Speaker 1: This was like a normal old RPG that kept my attention like in the college days.

395
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:55,129
Speaker 1: I played it like crazy Until I beat it and then even played it some more cuz it's just so damn good.

396
00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:00,304
Speaker 1: now I'm actually thinking about playing it again, especially because every sequel has been not as good.

397
00:24:00,324 --> 00:24:01,868
Speaker 1: It's just it's like it's just.

398
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:11,509
Speaker 1: there are other good Ones right the Mario and Luigi games for the you know, GBA DS many of which are excellent or you know varying in quality But many of which are excellent, especially the first one, right?

399
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:19,281
Speaker 1: But this is the best of all the best Mario themed RPG type video games and here's a task of it.

400
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:20,464
Speaker 0: and tool assisted.

401
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:21,627
Speaker 1: right tool assisted.

402
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:22,329
Speaker 1: in what time?

403
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,673
Speaker 0: To 2930 let's.

404
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:32,044
Speaker 1: that's less than three hours for a game that probably took me Weeks playing every day because it was so good.

405
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,070
Speaker 1: I played it every day.

406
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:43,186
Speaker 0: So quote from the video It's actually faster to say no because it skips an animation of Mario nodding his head Jesus XD.

407
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,188
Speaker 0: I love speedruns.

408
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:44,690
Speaker 1: Yep.

409
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:50,874
Speaker 1: But yeah If you want to see this game without putting in all those hours You can watch this test.

410
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:58,239
Speaker 1: or my recommendation is play the game because it's so incredible Beat it and then come back and watch this.

411
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,846
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone cosplay as that cute Goomba girl.

412
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:02,070
Speaker 1: go for it ever.

413
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:06,530
Speaker 1: That's like one of the best side characters that might be the best side character.

414
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:15,510
Speaker 1: It's actually some of the best things about all of the Mario RPG type games is that they're not afraid in those games to bring in a whole bunch of characters and make new characters.

415
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:26,090
Speaker 1: I know like Koopas and Goombas that are like individualized and you know Like that's specific really bad about killing all those generic ones right like a specific new toad guy.

416
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:31,390
Speaker 0: Does she know that Mario has killed probably millions of her brothers and sisters, right?

417
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:38,658
Speaker 1: But it's like they just make up tons and tons of characters for these things and a lot of those characters are really cool And cute and never get used again in any game ever.

418
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:39,040
Speaker 0: Yep.

419
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,729
Speaker 0: I mean Super Mario RPG kind of like kick that off Yeah, so I can play that again, maybe plenty of materials.

420
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,860
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment book the book is Rebecca.

421
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,066
Speaker 1: I finished playing doom.

422
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,490
Speaker 1: So now I can read Rebecca.

423
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,958
Speaker 0: I'm almost done with the third Oryx and Craig book.

424
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:57,583
Speaker 0: It all came together.

425
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:58,988
Speaker 0: Everybody fucking knew Jimmy like.

426
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,999
Speaker 0: That seems to be what the story is like.

427
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,822
Speaker 0: everybody knew him.

428
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,929
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah that guy what's his deal?

429
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:07,612
Speaker 1: What is it?

430
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,138
Speaker 1: Oh, he's got to tell them all the truth.

431
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:09,881
Speaker 1: They don't know.

432
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:12,410
Speaker 0: they all actually do know it's interesting.

433
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,716
Speaker 0: Yes, it's it's.

434
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:16,790
Speaker 0: it does not go the way I expected it all to go.

435
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,088
Speaker 1: It's actually interesting makes you want to read it.

436
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:21,037
Speaker 0: then Yeah, like what?

437
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,970
Speaker 1: so the best second and third books just as short as the first one.

438
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:32,016
Speaker 0: They're a little longer, but I'll say this so they keep telling the crackers stories like Jimmy did And you know the crackers like that.

439
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:37,246
Speaker 0: if they say oh Jimmy like they say oh when they're talking about a person like Oh Toby Oh you yep.

440
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,997
Speaker 0: So at one point a character says oh fuck.

441
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:44,810
Speaker 0: and then they like get obsessed with who fuck is and they want to meet fuck.

442
00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:47,719
Speaker 0: And then people start having tell stories about who fuck is.

443
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,424
Speaker 0: so they won't keep bothering them.

444
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:55,783
Speaker 0: and fuck is now part of the mythology Trickster spirit who helps people out and you summon him by saying oh fuck.

445
00:26:55,984 --> 00:27:00,739
Speaker 0: because if someone says oh fuck it means that they need Some help and fuck will come and save the day.

446
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be a check-offs fuck.

447
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:09,816
Speaker 0: I think it might be If you subscribe to the guys.

448
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,059
Speaker 0: patreon one of the things is in.

449
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,611
Speaker 0: there is the remastered beta episodes of geek nights from before October 31st 2005.

450
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:18,165
Speaker 1: that's a good reason not to pay for that patreon.

451
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:18,989
Speaker 1: No one's listening that shit.

452
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,853
Speaker 1: There's a reason.

453
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,860
Speaker 1: there's a reason it was hidden from the world.

454
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't dig too deep.

455
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:24,750
Speaker 1: We learned that lesson.

456
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,949
Speaker 1: How come people never learn lessons except guys?

457
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:30,830
Speaker 1: I'm the only person who learns lessons and actually abides by what we learned.

458
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,364
Speaker 1: This is where everyone else learns a lesson and this is and forget what we learned.

459
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:35,730
Speaker 0: you guys listen to Daryl Surratt.

460
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:40,390
Speaker 0: How many times do you tell you not to watch an anime because it's bad and then one of you decides to watch it?

461
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,205
Speaker 0: Cuz you'll have like oh watch the bad anime and then you realize that there's a reason.

462
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:46,922
Speaker 1: he told you not to watch the person Who says okay and doesn't watch it.

463
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:47,890
Speaker 1: cuz I'm the smart person.

464
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,409
Speaker 1: You don't be like me the smart person and not like rim the dumb person.

465
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:55,589
Speaker 0: But You will get to hear Scott defending that old thing of the day.

466
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,176
Speaker 0: He's really invested in it.

467
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:01,450
Speaker 0: He's also really invested in Alan Greenspan and Elliot Spitzer.

468
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,013
Speaker 1: Elliot Spitzer.

469
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,580
Speaker 1: he was so good before he was so bad.

470
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Fitzgerald you talk a lot about him, too.

471
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,015
Speaker 1: I forget who that is.

472
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:10,064
Speaker 0: I know you knew a lot back then.

473
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:14,490
Speaker 1: I was paying attention But I knew I didn't realize it was a waste of time to pay attention.

474
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:17,790
Speaker 0: Also, we talked a lot about how someday they'll be murdered by drone.

475
00:28:19,415 --> 00:28:20,163
Speaker 1: That hasn't changed.

476
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:23,057
Speaker 1: yeah Talk about that recently as well.

477
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:26,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've also talked about committing murder by drone, but only jokingly.

478
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:33,072
Speaker 0: It was quite a bit more theoretical maybe not so jokingly in early October 2005.

479
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:35,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you know murder by drones a real deal.

480
00:28:35,704 --> 00:28:38,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, it happens Otherwise.

481
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:41,289
Speaker 0: we're going to be at Pac South where you're going to be at mag fest.

482
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:43,208
Speaker 1: Magfest is way soon.

483
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:50,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, also my magfest friend who volunteers at magfest swore to me there was a rampart there last year and the year before.

484
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,320
Speaker 1: How did we not see it there?

485
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,285
Speaker 1: I think he's lying.

486
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:54,130
Speaker 0: He has to be lying.

487
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:58,710
Speaker 1: I'm like there's no way that none of us would have seen it if it was there.

488
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,112
Speaker 1: He's like.

489
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:06,410
Speaker 1: no I swear I played it there, and I'm like I don't know because you realize if there's a rampart machine We're just gonna hog it and ignore all arcade etiquette.

490
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:10,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the Azans who play the initially machine and don't let us play.

491
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:12,076
Speaker 0: We're gonna be bad for rampart.

492
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's playing rampart, but us.

493
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:18,823
Speaker 0: unless you're coming into our rampart tournament It'll be you me and randos you keep getting kicked out of the game.

494
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,510
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson and chase could take turns.

495
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, Alex or Pete can get in a game.

496
00:29:23,082 --> 00:29:24,729
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, that's it well after.

497
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:25,733
Speaker 1: well I don't know.

498
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:26,396
Speaker 1: be there he can play.

499
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,118
Speaker 0: well man.

500
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,330
Speaker 0: We'll have to do some serious like friend-only ladder tournaments.

501
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess other people feel che we could teach them to play rampart.

502
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:34,749
Speaker 1: I don't think they played.

503
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:35,030
Speaker 0: yeah.

504
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,768
Speaker 0: Also, it doesn't count unless it's got the eight balls in there.

505
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,855
Speaker 0: Yep, it's got to be the full-on Experience three-track ball.

506
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:43,642
Speaker 1: good to joystick garbage.

507
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but might as well not even have the machine there.

508
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:47,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, just just leave some poop in the car.

509
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,684
Speaker 1: That is what might as well.

510
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:49,669
Speaker 1: Just be like a mr.

511
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,769
Speaker 1: Do machine if you're gonna bring me that stick ramp.

512
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:54,311
Speaker 0: Man.

513
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:54,793
Speaker 0: magfest.

514
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:59,730
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about this like I remember remembering what magfest is like as it gets closer.

515
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:03,010
Speaker 1: It's like oh, I hear the distance Again louder.

516
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:06,570
Speaker 0: So we'll have shows in the future.

517
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:15,136
Speaker 0: but we're in the situation yet again where Scott and I have independently consumed a lot of different Wednesday media and There has been no overlap at all.

518
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:19,750
Speaker 1: Well, so you just you can you consumed Wednesday media and used it all on your stupid patreon.

519
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:23,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is true I consumed Wednesday media that you just haven't consumed.

520
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,910
Speaker 1: like I want to see miss Hokusai when you're in Australia.

521
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,427
Speaker 0: I've done a patreon episode about miss Hokusai.

522
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,676
Speaker 1: No Do anything.

523
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:32,484
Speaker 1: and then you know, I read a bunch of comics that you didn't read.

524
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,656
Speaker 0: I just watched Doctor Strange last night But that's not an anime.

525
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:36,380
Speaker 0: It's a comic.

526
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:37,988
Speaker 1: It's a movie.

527
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:41,250
Speaker 0: arguably It is a movie that is more animated than live-action.

528
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,050
Speaker 1: I mean do you I mean if you want to do something like that?

529
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,858
Speaker 1: We could talk about like, you know spider-man his amazing friends.

530
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:50,530
Speaker 0: All right, so Emily had an idea and we expanded upon it.

531
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:57,920
Speaker 0: I don't know if this will work, but I'm kind of feeling it partly because I just I just think we're lacking material is the problem.

532
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:02,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think now if we had the questions pre-prepared This could totally be awesome.

533
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,530
Speaker 0: So this is more like the pilot.

534
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,410
Speaker 0: This is a lot like those early beta episodes of geek nights because we would we tried all these like bullshit concepts.

535
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,570
Speaker 0: We had this idea in early geek nights.

536
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:13,390
Speaker 0: It was actually Scott's idea and we did it for a while.

537
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:14,357
Speaker 0: It was real bad.

538
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:16,029
Speaker 0: then we agreed it was bad and stopped it.

539
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,110
Speaker 0: But we did a sig at the end of every episode like a catchphrase Like wubba lubba dub dub, I don't remember this.

540
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:28,330
Speaker 0: It was your idea to had to sign each podcast like it was a post in a bulletin board.

541
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:30,097
Speaker 0: Okay, now people had their cigs.

542
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,895
Speaker 0: No, you don't remember that like an email signature But before I do.

543
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,363
Speaker 1: but I don't remember this idea for the.

544
00:31:35,504 --> 00:31:41,375
Speaker 0: not only was it your idea But you insisted we do it and we did it for a while and we both agreed It was lame and bad and killed it.

545
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:43,083
Speaker 0: Okay, and it was good.

546
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:44,549
Speaker 1: That means that we we learned.

547
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:45,776
Speaker 0: now We were a little bit self-aware.

548
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:47,990
Speaker 0: We had some bits that did not make it to the final format.

549
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:54,948
Speaker 0: I feel like this is workshopping toward not a. I wouldn't run this as a real like actual game show like.

550
00:31:54,968 --> 00:32:08,803
Speaker 0: remember we used to do Challenger on fire at anime cons and it turned out that fucking nobody Even people who claim to know stuff could actually answer any questions or compete in any sort of game show Unless it was 100% rigged and faked.

551
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:09,548
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

552
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:17,017
Speaker 0: So I feel like this is the kind of thing that if we needed like a sixth anime Boston panel someday We could just sort of fake it.

553
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:21,997
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like because we're one of the ideas we have for anime Boston this year You know, we do the judge anime by its cover.

554
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:25,270
Speaker 0: I think the theme is like old-school like old-school anime.

555
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:32,452
Speaker 0: So maybe we should do a judge anime by its cover, but literally do it for like 70s and 80s anime Mm-hmm.

556
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:33,596
Speaker 1: We could do that.

557
00:32:33,757 --> 00:32:37,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it's just not enough anime per season back then.

558
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:39,767
Speaker 0: Well, you know you just do like generic old.

559
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:51,810
Speaker 0: basically It's just an excuse to expose the audience to like 20 old anime They should probably watch but doing it in a contrived format that allows us to play ignorant, you know Not really, you know that kind of thing.

560
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,990
Speaker 1: But anyway, so there's two ways to make trivia interesting.

561
00:32:54,051 --> 00:33:01,540
Speaker 1: All right The first way to make trivia interesting is to have questions that are hard to answer but people who are so knowledgeable That it's like actually like a good competition like.

562
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:10,213
Speaker 0: oh then it has to be two people who are do claim Express that they have knowledge in a very narrow and similar and you need to have really good prepared questions Which we don't have.

563
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:11,117
Speaker 1: we didn't prepare shit.

564
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:11,378
Speaker 1: Nope.

565
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:14,150
Speaker 1: So what I think the format we got to go for here, right?

566
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically you have to think of a very small topic you want to discuss.

567
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:28,870
Speaker 1: that's really specific to one comic or anime And then just ask a contrived trivia question that will allow you to tell this story.

568
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:35,014
Speaker 1: So for example, I might ask you What's a good question?

569
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,363
Speaker 1: So, you know how spider-man right?

570
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:40,955
Speaker 0: I don't shit about spider-man, but okay He had that black costume.

571
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:42,158
Speaker 0: Oh boy venom.

572
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,043
Speaker 1: No poison, right?

573
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:46,870
Speaker 1: Where did he get that black costume from?

574
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:50,260
Speaker 0: Didn't he fly to the moon and sew it?

575
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:52,690
Speaker 1: it's pretty close to the truth, right?

576
00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:00,096
Speaker 1: So see now I can tell the funny story about where this comes from because you will not believe it and if you haven't read Comics, you won't know.

577
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:04,390
Speaker 0: actually this works because if you look at the audience of a typical panel at a con, right?

578
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,359
Speaker 1: It's like I can't do a geek nights episode about.

579
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,630
Speaker 1: where did spider-man get his ridiculous costume.

580
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:11,420
Speaker 1: Well awesome costume but the ridiculous story of how.

581
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,784
Speaker 0: nor can I even come up with a good like.

582
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:15,696
Speaker 0: I guess the panel would be Ten crazy fucked up things.

583
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,503
Speaker 0: You didn't realize from comics, right?

584
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:18,205
Speaker 1: So check this.

585
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:23,750
Speaker 1: right back in the nowadays There's all all these superhero comics have events for all the heroes get together, right?

586
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,469
Speaker 1: But back in the day, it wasn't like that.

587
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,699
Speaker 1: Every hero is in their own separate deal.

588
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,230
Speaker 1: way back except Wolverine putting them all together.

589
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,274
Speaker 1: That was later right.

590
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:40,007
Speaker 1: putting them all together in one comic like the fact that Superman and Batman would be in the same comic Was a crazy idea until like the 80s even and seven like way later, right?

591
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:47,777
Speaker 1: You know things like the Avengers did like the Fantastic Four was like one of the first team Comics there ever was in terms of superheroes, right?

592
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:57,710
Speaker 1: So Marvel their first major major major event They ever had was the secret war and the story of the secret war is so ludicrous and stupid.

593
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,124
Speaker 1: It was like basically the most contrived way to just get superheroes together.

594
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:15,148
Speaker 1: and what they did is they're basically like There's someone there's a bad guy and the bad guys in another dimension and the bad guy opened these portals and dragged all the heroes Into his other dimension where he could make them fight the and then they fought

595
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:19,386
Speaker 0: Plot to a fighting game like that's

596
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:19,890
Speaker 1: a mortal counter.

597
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:30,629
Speaker 1: It basically is right and it was so contrived like at the end They tossed them all back and they're like look this won't affect any of the individual stories because at the end We'll just toss them all back where they came from like they all go in a portal and they fight.

598
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:31,775
Speaker 1: now I'll go back out of the portal.

599
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:42,610
Speaker 1: Alright, so in this other dimension that they were in They stumble upon like some room that's got all this technology shit in it and there's something that's basically a fucking sewing machine.

600
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:51,395
Speaker 1: yeah, effectively and Spider-man uses it with this goop to make a new costume But it's out of annual.

601
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:59,630
Speaker 1: and then afterwards right like after the secret war was over He brought this costume with him because it was black and a white spider on it.

602
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it turned out to be this living evil thing.

603
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,602
Speaker 1: You know, they they like turned it into a plot point.

604
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,050
Speaker 1: where is this living evil thing?

605
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,202
Speaker 1: And you know, they kept using that thing for a long at his time.

606
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,590
Speaker 1: It stuck around for super forever.

607
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:18,257
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's just way way interesting that like yeah It was just a sewing machine.

608
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,268
Speaker 1: and if they ever tried to do that in a movie I think they did but I didn't see that movie You probably have to turn it instead into like it's a nano.

609
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:32,050
Speaker 1: whatever People complain nerds complain at least when the movies or adaptations don't stick to the original story.

610
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:32,514
Speaker 1: But it's like.

611
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:33,949
Speaker 1: how can you stick to that?

612
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,403
Speaker 1: How could you possibly make a movie where spider-man goes up to a space sewing machine?

613
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:41,670
Speaker 1: Yeah and makes a new costume out of it.

614
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,598
Speaker 1: How do you shoot that Adam West Batman?

615
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:45,726
Speaker 0: imagine sitting in the theater Adam West Batman.

616
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:51,528
Speaker 1: you sit into the theater 15 bucks to see this on opening night and you see in Peter Parker at a sewing machine.

617
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:52,150
Speaker 1: go like digga-digga.

618
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,539
Speaker 1: Hey, it's like what the fuck.

619
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,162
Speaker 1: you can't do that.

620
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:58,876
Speaker 0: All right, so You you've read the old Doctor Strange.

621
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,484
Speaker 1: I read some old many dot various.

622
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:02,286
Speaker 1: I've never read like.

623
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:08,572
Speaker 0: specifically like doctors I've been many things because I'm curious how well it lines up with the movie I just saw.

624
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:17,570
Speaker 0: cuz I actually finally saw the movie Doctor Strange, which is actually way better than I expected Is a way cool character, but he is a character I actually have not read any of his comics.

625
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,097
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about the best.

626
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,262
Speaker 0: I know more about dr.

627
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:22,009
Speaker 0: Orpheus who is a parody of dr.

628
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:22,190
Speaker 0: Strange.

629
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,093
Speaker 1: So the best dr.

630
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:24,737
Speaker 1: Strange comics are two kinds.

631
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:27,505
Speaker 1: number one the old psychedelic kind because they were psychedelic.

632
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:28,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

633
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:41,025
Speaker 1: and secondly, dr Strange he's basically like the side character for everything because if you're say spider-man or Captain America or any superhero whatsoever Can't punch a ghost right and you got some problems with something spiritual.

634
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,069
Speaker 1: you basically call dr.

635
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:42,390
Speaker 1: Strange.

636
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:43,514
Speaker 1: He's not hard to call cuz.

637
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:48,310
Speaker 1: he lives in a mansion in Manhattan and it's like dude who has a mansion in Manhattan.

638
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,355
Speaker 1: Are you fucking kidding me?

639
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, how rich is this dude?

640
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:52,549
Speaker 1: It doesn't even have to go to work.

641
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,521
Speaker 0: Don't pay him Doesn't doesn't the that organization?

642
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,750
Speaker 0: cuz aren't there two other sanctums?

643
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,770
Speaker 1: He was originally like a surgeon so that makes a bunch of money, but not enough for a Manhattan mansion.

644
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,029
Speaker 0: So he had a Manhattan man.

645
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:09,590
Speaker 0: So in the movie at least he had a Manhattan mansion just from his surgery money.

646
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,297
Speaker 1: But that's not enough money for a Manhattan mansion.

647
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,483
Speaker 1: He he was inherited that shit.

648
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:21,921
Speaker 0: He is so you know the the doctor in Nothing monster.

649
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:23,833
Speaker 0: yes He was.

650
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,923
Speaker 0: he's like a hundred times better than that doc.

651
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:26,907
Speaker 1: It's a similar story.

652
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:27,108
Speaker 1: Yes.

653
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:33,683
Speaker 0: I'm aware Yeah But in the movie in the most time basically I'll ask you some questions That I would answer based on the movie and we can see.

654
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:36,698
Speaker 1: if the comic answer is different I might get the comic answer wrong.

655
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:37,180
Speaker 0: That's fine.

656
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,969
Speaker 1: I'm just curious because I don't remember that much.

657
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,438
Speaker 0: So what magic items is dr.

658
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,745
Speaker 0: Strange typically use or carry about him?

659
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:45,290
Speaker 1: He's got he's got a cloak all right.

660
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,458
Speaker 1: What's the magic cloak?

661
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:47,524
Speaker 0: What is it called something?

662
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,350
Speaker 1: I don't do anything.

663
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,073
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

664
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:52,006
Speaker 1: I think he can hide inside of it or transport with it or something.

665
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:53,050
Speaker 0: in the movie.

666
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,509
Speaker 0: It's just the levitation cloak.

667
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,077
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that's it and it literally hasn't like that.

668
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:02,636
Speaker 0: basically it literally has a mind of its own and they use it for some Somewhat slapstick comedy.

669
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,865
Speaker 1: He also has the amulet of agamotto.

670
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:06,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, which he in the movie.

671
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:07,775
Speaker 0: How does he get that amulet from?

672
00:39:08,036 --> 00:39:08,619
Speaker 1: I think he doesn't.

673
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,750
Speaker 1: he like kill some evil demon like agamotto and take it from him.

674
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:14,158
Speaker 0: In the movie, he literally remember.

675
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:17,410
Speaker 0: he goes to the library to sit in there and no one's paying attention.

676
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:22,430
Speaker 0: So he steals it and cast spells with it and they're about like a moto is basically a god, right?

677
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,911
Speaker 1: So it's.

678
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,542
Speaker 1: I think he took it in a battle or so.

679
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:25,964
Speaker 1: He stole.

680
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,350
Speaker 1: I don't remember I could be wrong.

681
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,741
Speaker 1: Maybe he did steal it from a library.

682
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:29,789
Speaker 0: What about his ring?

683
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,557
Speaker 1: Isn't the I?

684
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:33,482
Speaker 1: I think there's a guy.

685
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:34,970
Speaker 1: Mandarin was Mandarin in the movie.

686
00:39:35,432 --> 00:39:38,885
Speaker 1: No, so Mandarin is basically this dude whose power is.

687
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 1: I have a bunch of magic rings.

688
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:51,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a villain and the only time I ever remember anything about dr Strange having a ring it was like I think I read some comic where he fought the Mandarin or took it from him where Mandarin Took it from dr.

689
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,060
Speaker 1: Strange or something like that.

690
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:54,245
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

691
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,514
Speaker 0: Okay in this movie He's got they like.

692
00:39:56,554 --> 00:40:05,365
Speaker 0: it's a big Chekhov gun everywhere, but every one of these monks cuz there's a lot of them He's just like one of many has a sling ring and it's the only way to teleport.

693
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:08,095
Speaker 0: and if you don't have the ring You can't teleport.

694
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,219
Speaker 1: That's like a Green Lantern thing.

695
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,528
Speaker 0: And that means also that you can't get out of the mirror dimension Okay, which is where you can have a Mortal Kombat battle and not hurt anything outside of it.

696
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:21,670
Speaker 1: Yep I think he also in he had some magic items that he couldn't carry around with him.

697
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:22,293
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

698
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:25,890
Speaker 1: it was like I could just be totally misremembering cuz my memory is garbage.

699
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:33,396
Speaker 1: But I remember maybe like an hourglass or a sundial or some or a mirror or some kind of you know Object like that.

700
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:36,030
Speaker 1: that was like in his mansion that he couldn't bring with him.

701
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:42,720
Speaker 0: All right, so in the mansion that he ends up taking there's windows that each go to like a different dimension And oh, yeah, he has the big stained glass window.

702
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,404
Speaker 1: That's all crazy.

703
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:44,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like a dial.

704
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,816
Speaker 0: You can just change like what dimension it's all.

705
00:40:46,836 --> 00:40:47,659
Speaker 0: that was the dial.

706
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,083
Speaker 1: It wasn't a sundial.

707
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:50,326
Speaker 1: It was a yeah.

708
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:50,867
Speaker 1: Okay.

709
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,114
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, Dr.

710
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:54,037
Speaker 1: Strange the other Dr.

711
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:56,164
Speaker 1: Strange comic yeah, he's cool whatever.

712
00:40:56,424 --> 00:40:57,829
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm more a fan of dr.

713
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:58,230
Speaker 0: Orvis.

714
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:02,128
Speaker 1: Alright, let me think of a different trivia, right?

715
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:06,061
Speaker 1: So You know, there's a lot of Leiji Matsumoto animes.

716
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:07,446
Speaker 1: Oh, right gun frontiers.

717
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:07,887
Speaker 0: my answer.

718
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:17,130
Speaker 1: Yeah now There are many characters in them But those characters they have their same story told many different ways many different times.

719
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:21,550
Speaker 1: You notice you if you read if you watch Captain Harlock, you know, you'll see Captain Harlock.

720
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,942
Speaker 1: But then you watch Galaxy Express and Captain Harlock will appear.

721
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:25,650
Speaker 1: but it won't make any sense.

722
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:31,988
Speaker 1: You won't be able to combine that with like the real Captain Harlock TV show cuz it doesn't line up, right?

723
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:39,043
Speaker 1: so my favorite guy is You know tochiro right now not Tetsuro.

724
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,810
Speaker 1: Tetsuro is the kid in Galaxy Express.

725
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,678
Speaker 1: Tochiro is the guy doesn't become the ship.

726
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, he becomes the ship.

727
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:46,687
Speaker 0: right spoilers.

728
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:47,529
Speaker 0: I guess yeah.

729
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:52,519
Speaker 1: But You don't see tochiro a lot and most things.

730
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,510
Speaker 1: you only see the ship like in Captain Harlock the TV series.

731
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:58,969
Speaker 1: He's already in the ship like, you know, you don't know much about right?

732
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,602
Speaker 1: So, I guess I got to think of a trivia question related to tochiro.

733
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:09,234
Speaker 1: yeah sure in Galaxy Express.

734
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:12,002
Speaker 1: the second I think is the second Galaxy Express movie.

735
00:42:12,082 --> 00:42:22,786
Speaker 1: I do Galaxy Express or maybe it was the first movie But basically he's on this planet and he's somehow still alive even though Tetsuro already has his hat and gun.

736
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,892
Speaker 1: I Forgot it.

737
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,483
Speaker 1: Oh, it's hard to think of a trivia question.

738
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's just awesome.

739
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,468
Speaker 0: No, I'm racking my brain cuz a lot of the ones I can come up.

740
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:33,244
Speaker 0: one I you can see my monitor so I can't try not looking at your monitor.

741
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:34,650
Speaker 1: Nah, my eyes are closed.

742
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:35,413
Speaker 0: I heard.

743
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,762
Speaker 0: oh, actually the other problem is I came over.

744
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:38,163
Speaker 1: Okay, fine.

745
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:43,650
Speaker 1: Who is a tochiro married to Tochiro?

746
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:46,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you even know?

747
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:46,415
Speaker 1: Okay.

748
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,602
Speaker 1: I can't believe you don't know this easy question.

749
00:42:48,623 --> 00:42:49,967
Speaker 0: I probably don't know.

750
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,380
Speaker 0: I don't know I'm our eldest That's right.

751
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay Don't trick me I Mean, I guess I could be like met you do know.

752
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,434
Speaker 1: But that's also.

753
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:14,550
Speaker 1: it's like a huge plot point because like on all these things You'll see like if you're watching something and he's not alive in it or he's not already in the ship in it Like they're always alluding to like emeraldus is looking for someone or oh he's or he's remembering someone you're supposed to know.

754
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:14,971
Speaker 1: it's him.

755
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:24,810
Speaker 1: and the craziest thing is like you'll be watching something the emeraldus is in and There'll be allusions to him without ever saying his name without mentioning him, right?

756
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:31,198
Speaker 1: And if you haven't seen all this other stuff, they'll never let you know Who the hell she's worried about whatever.

757
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,569
Speaker 1: It's just like oh, she's worried about someone and that's it.

758
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:41,176
Speaker 1: But if you know from watching other things like oh shit son Alright in Trigon.

759
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:41,698
Speaker 1: Yeah.

760
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:44,227
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a good idea going for things that are more like that.

761
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:51,748
Speaker 0: How Many people did vashta stampede directly kill Mert like dead?

762
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,552
Speaker 1: Yeah one.

763
00:43:53,572 --> 00:43:54,154
Speaker 1: Yeah.

764
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:54,655
Speaker 0: Yeah.

765
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:55,497
Speaker 1: I was right.

766
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:55,858
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:43:55,979 --> 00:43:56,279
Speaker 1: Okay.

768
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:57,984
Speaker 0: Do you remember that guy's name?

769
00:43:58,004 --> 00:43:59,428
Speaker 1: is the guy never 13, right?

770
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,256
Speaker 0: Or is it he killed that guy?

771
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:02,819
Speaker 0: Did he actually?

772
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,770
Speaker 1: was that the guy he killed or was it the guy?

773
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,756
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

774
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:11,050
Speaker 0: It's spoilers I guess but it doesn't spoil the real purpose of the show.

775
00:44:12,313 --> 00:44:13,770
Speaker 0: Who did vashta stampede kill?

776
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:18,824
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was like the final.

777
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:19,970
Speaker 0: I know who you're thinking.

778
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:26,896
Speaker 0: It was like the most evil gung-ho gun guy of all because the guy you're thinking about is the guy who kills all the people In the town and there's that.

779
00:44:26,936 --> 00:44:33,750
Speaker 0: that's like one of the past episodes because is funny up to that point and then he has to Get evil, but no he Bremer He breaks the guy's mask and the guys laying there.

780
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,945
Speaker 0: He's got his gun in his face and he's just like you killed those people.

781
00:44:36,186 --> 00:44:36,690
Speaker 0: They're dead.

782
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,523
Speaker 0: Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you that episode, right?

783
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't kill that guy I must.

784
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:44,082
Speaker 1: it's the most evil gung-ho gun guy like at the end.

785
00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:44,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

786
00:44:44,764 --> 00:44:46,330
Speaker 0: Is it the most evil the second most?

787
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,393
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it depends.

788
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,120
Speaker 1: It's not the final boss.

789
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,010
Speaker 1: It's the you know, the final gung-ho gun guy.

790

Speaker 0: You don't remember that guy's name at all.

00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,689
Speaker 0: She usually stands there, but does she ever sit at one and touch a button?

847
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:28,974
Speaker 1: I'm sure she'd purchase some buttons.

848
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:29,857
Speaker 1: That's a point.

849
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:33,330

Speaker 0: Uh man, you know These aren't good trivia questions, but good questions for the like.

867
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:31,786
Speaker 0: the conceit of that panel would be like Alright, what the fuck was kaji up to with that briefcase like those?

868
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,030
Speaker 1: I know exactly what he was up to.

869
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,250
Speaker 0: I think everyone who watch Ava like super closely knows what was up, right?

870
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,014
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

871
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:39,809
Speaker 1: if you don't know the story even Joe and I'm just gonna spill it out for you.

872
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:47,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in the first well the first impact right way back in the day way back in ancient history, right?

873
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:56,630
Speaker 1: There were these aliens and aliens were like yo We have like swear we know everything and also we're super powerful and that's too dangerous.

874
00:48:57,274 --> 00:48:59,830
Speaker 1: So we're gonna do is we're gonna send out into space like Superman.

875
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:12,566
Speaker 1: Right these pods and some of the pods are gonna have beings of like unlimited You know like health and life or whatever like the s2 engines and all that nice and right and some of them are gonna have Knowledge, right?

876
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,194
Speaker 1: Like and then.

877
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:21,870
Speaker 1: so it's just like Adam and Eve right, you know Lilith the tree of knowledge Which you can't eat from and Adam the tree of life, right?

878
00:49:22,111 --> 00:49:24,378
Speaker 1: So and never the twain shall mix.

879
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,070
Speaker 1: so they send these aliens out in these ships to land on planets.

880
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:42,750
Speaker 1: so of course Adam smashes into the earth and You know, so does by accident Lilith and it's like oh shit - you know one of each side landed on earth at the same time and We have so we can't in case this happens, right?

881
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,718
Speaker 1: we don't want these two things to be combined ever.

882
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:53,490
Speaker 1: we built in a system to where they'll self-destruct and Everything will be totally chill because we won't have ever to mixing again anywhere on the universe.

883
00:49:54,595 --> 00:50:03,630
Speaker 1: so Of course what happens is the Lilith one lands on earth and a bunch of life spawns from Lilith, which is humans, right?

884
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:13,770
Speaker 1: but then the second impact was when The Adam one wakes up and that's what killed, you know, miss Otto's dad and everybody a second impact, right?

885
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:20,470
Speaker 0: The second impact so that's Adam woke up basically and it was like oh shit They woke Adam up right and it might not have woken up if they didn't go poke him.

886
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:27,373
Speaker 1: The point is is that there were two on the same planet and you know Adam and basically turned off or whatever because you know what.

887
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:35,299
Speaker 1: not so Because they were you know, the mixing of the knowledge and the power Boom impact dope to prevent this from happening.

888
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:39,715
Speaker 1: So Akaji had in the briefcase was actually Adam left over.

889
00:50:39,876 --> 00:50:40,839
Speaker 1: Oh, look, he's still here.

890
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:43,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, he got his leftovers here, right?

891
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:47,439
Speaker 1: It's all the angels that are coming right to fight.

892
00:50:47,459 --> 00:50:53,597
Speaker 1: are The spawns of Adam right which is why they're fighting against, you know, they're trying to basically get to.

893
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:56,305
Speaker 1: you know That's like the fail-safe system, right?

894
00:50:56,325 --> 00:51:03,577
Speaker 1: They're trying to get to the remains of Lilith down underneath the nerve headquarters yeah, and destroy it to prevent the combining of the two.

895
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:26,159
Speaker 1: and when there's the episode where able towards the end where Ava one goes nuts and it beats the totally awesome angel and takes the engine out of it and absorbs it into itself and they say something like We're trying to protect the earth not make a god oops Right, cuz that's Ava one does what's not supposed to be done and combines the two and becomes.

896
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:28,225
Speaker 0: That would have been a good trivia question.

897
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:32,116
Speaker 0: Who's whose mom is in each one of those Ava's your mom.

898

Speaker 1: It's like.

938
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:15,380
Speaker 1: this is like a very generic Anime TV series from the generic 90s era of anime like that.

939
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,640
Speaker 1: But you know, it doesn't have even though it has like these anime tropes and whatnot.

940
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,408
Speaker 1: It executes them, but it doesn't have bad anime things like, you know, moe's.

941
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:34,270
Speaker 1: It's like it's just completely normal and totally funny and Points has fantasy adventure.

942
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,943
Speaker 0: It's got everything cat armor, but Jedi Like.

Speaker 1: He is a funny, dude.

946
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,551
Speaker 0: However, remember we were qualifying this only the first OAV.

947
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:50,620
Speaker 0: Yeah now watch the TV show cuz it's terrible.

948
00:53:50,902 --> 00:53:53,160

949
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:59,495
Speaker 0: So in chaos entry beasts, tell me anything about the three main characters this bird guy.

950

Speaker 0: There's old McNinja the clone.

1007
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:18,164
Speaker 1: Oh, you remember it old McNinja the old McNinja the trick question Had a farm.

1008
00:56:18,204 --> 00:56:18,345

00:56:18,385 --> 00:56:22,680
Speaker 0: Yeah ninja came back in the like final bat.

1010
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,672
Speaker 1: I think I got somewhere near that part.

1011
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:32,879
Speaker 0: So it's not as basically dr McNinja is important right now because like the the boss fight hack, you know, the dude has other work to do.

1012
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,525
Speaker 1: You know, he's ending dr.

1013
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,613
Speaker 0: McNinja because it's time to end that.

1014
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:38,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he wanted to give it a proper ending.

1015
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:46,260
Speaker 0: So we just had this like giant epic arc tying up every end and bring everything together into the final battle.

1016
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:57,093
Speaker 0: We're basically it's like at our JRPG like they went in like there's a part where they went into like the final dungeon Mm-hmm, and then there's the final battle which just happened pretty epically.

1017
00:56:57,113 --> 00:57:06,227
Speaker 0: and now the square boss is happening and I think the panel that is up as of the taping of this episode is like The P like right after like.

1018
00:57:06,247 --> 00:57:10,379
Speaker 0: the next panel is going to be the climax square boss fights.
