1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,672
Speaker 0: It's Monday January 2nd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:16,178
Speaker 0: We talk about food, and we have a special guest.

3
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,488
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:26,679
Speaker 0: so happy new year Happy 2006. yep, we're back after our short slight hiatus, and we're tired as hell.

5
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:35,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had a lot of people over for a crazy party all weekend And they're all still here, and we're upstairs locked in a bedroom doing the show.

6
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:36,278
Speaker 2: well some of them are still here.

7
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:39,857
Speaker 0: Yeah So we started off the new year with a brand new.

8
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:44,397
Speaker 0: well You know the exploit that we talked about a couple shows ago the WMF.

9
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:51,340
Speaker 0: in Windows It's an image file that if you display it or access it at all it can infect your computer with anything like full access.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:01,805
Speaker 2: no Matter what program you're using if you a picture can be displayed by that program And it displays a picture in this format and that picture has the bad stuff in it Then your computer will be screwed.

11
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:04,072
Speaker 0: and well somebody made a worm.

12
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:05,155
Speaker 0: That's exploiting this.

13
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:06,519
Speaker 2: well there you go.

14
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,649
Speaker 2: I found Windows exploit use.

15
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:17,140
Speaker 0: it's an I am worm and it spreads through Microsoft Messenger right now, and I don't really need to get all the details.

16
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,469
Speaker 0: But it's not so simple as it shows you the image.

17
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:21,779
Speaker 0: it shows you a link to a JPEG image.

18
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:32,675
Speaker 0: But the dot jpg is actually an HTML which links to the WMF which then gives you the virus Which is a collect credit card numbers and send them to someone randomly.

19
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:37,352
Speaker 2: thing great Yeah, can't they just see where the credit cards are being sent to and catch the guy?

20
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:43,533
Speaker 0: usually these things are sent to like anonymous Unmoderated IRC channels that then disappear on like shadow IP addresses.

21
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:50,480
Speaker 0: Oh, that's not very good Yeah, but basically this vulnerability is not patched not easily patchable.

22
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,825
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people have said that there's a patch for it And that's kind of true.

23
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:59,224
Speaker 0: some dude and like Gibson that security guy looked at it and said yeah, this is okay This isn't a bad patch.

24
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:16,199
Speaker 0: they it mitigates the vulnerability it makes it less easy To be exploited, but there's really no way to do it because the vulnerabilities in a certain DLL file that all of Windows uses You under link that DLL which most people don't even know how to do Windows will likely not work.

25
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,973
Speaker 2: Well, you'd have to modify the DLL, but of course it's part of Windows.

26
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:20,736
Speaker 2: It's closed source.

27
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,599
Speaker 2: No one knows what's in it.

28
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,030
Speaker 2: Modifying it would mean disassembling it and it's pretty tricky.

29
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are decompilers and they exist.

30
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:37,660
Speaker 0: But for anyone who doesn't code and doesn't know about this sort of thing Decompilers which take compiled code and like try to recreate the source code for it don't really work.

31
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:39,319
Speaker 2: They don't work well at all.

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,427
Speaker 0: They give you just this mess of useless garbage that if you run a decompiler and then you immediately try to recompile that code It usually just won't even work.

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,180
Speaker 2: Hmm most of the time Yeah, I mean a lot of CS students will try to cheat with decompilers.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,656
Speaker 2: They'll be like aha the teacher has given us a working solution to the problem But we don't have any source code and the goal is to write source code.

35
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:01,520
Speaker 2: that does the same thing.

36
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,846
Speaker 2: The example program does.

37
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,211
Speaker 2: they're like, I'm so smart.

38
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 2: I will decompile it and just copy the source code.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,174
Speaker 2: Well, there's a reason the teachers don't care about giving you the sample solution and trust me.

40
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,037
Speaker 2: They're CS teachers.

41
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,160
Speaker 2: They know about decompilers.

42
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,040
Speaker 2: Yeah, you they really don't work so well, they won't help you.

43
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:26,059
Speaker 0: I mean basically if you're a computer science student and you cheat to get a good grade if you cheat well enough to where you Didn't get caught by one of these CS professors you deserve to pass because you're smarter than they are.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,648
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean if you manage to get a decompiler working even if it to the point where it's the best decompiling job That can possibly be done.

45
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,279
Speaker 2: Let's say you set that up somehow, right?

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,320
Speaker 2: And then you're still gonna have to do a lot to that decompiled code to make it something you can submit.

47
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,679
Speaker 2: And if you can do that, then you could probably have done the assignment in the first place.

48
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:51,960
Speaker 0: Well, you know the situation of a criminal who puts more effort into stealing money than it would take to just get a frickin.

49
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:57,548
Speaker 2: Yeah Yep exactly that situation.

50
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,658
Speaker 0: but we don't want to scare monger or you know.

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,157
Speaker 0: Just really work this up and really not gonna talk about this exploit anymore because it's in the news.

52
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:05,740
Speaker 0: You can see it.

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,258
Speaker 0: We've talked about it twice already.

54
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:14,699
Speaker 0: But watch out like seriously don't go to websites You don't trust and don't click on links if you don't know where they go or who sent them to you.

55
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:18,079
Speaker 0: You know, this is a bad vulnerability and it will screw you.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,963
Speaker 2: I just don't get it.

57
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:21,031
Speaker 2: Like this is the third or fourth time that we've said.

58
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,760
Speaker 2: This is the last straw for Windows.

59
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:30,010
Speaker 2: Here is a security hole that is easily exploited Difficult to protect from and it pretty much screws you over.

60
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,835
Speaker 2: don't use Windows anymore.

61
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,439
Speaker 2: It's your only hope only hope.

62
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:34,795
Speaker 0: You'll be one.

63
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:35,637
Speaker 2: Kenobi You know what?

64
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,360
Speaker 2: People are still using windows and the camel's back has not yet been broken despite being smashed on with many sledgehammers.

65
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:44,704
Speaker 0: well part of I mean Two factors here.

66
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:51,219
Speaker 0: one is that people don't seem to realize how much this spyware and adware that they get infected with affects the performance of their computers.

67
00:04:52,022 --> 00:05:01,232
Speaker 0: I mean a clean Windows XP system with all the service packs with old XP without all the crazy patches preventing You know security else but even with all the patches, it's not that bad.

68
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,600
Speaker 0: It's pretty stable and it's generally pretty good.

69
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:11,057
Speaker 0: But most people have so much spyware on the machines and they don't realize it and that slows the computer down to the point that They think they need to buy a new one.

70
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,813
Speaker 0: Yep, and to a lot of a lot of infection.

71
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:19,280
Speaker 0: if an infective agents now They're they don't tell you that your computer is infected.

72
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,378
Speaker 0: They don't do anything to you.

73
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:30,220
Speaker 0: all they do is they spew garbage out of the network port and other people's computers or They hold where's files for other people to get later or they steal your credit card number?

74
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,846
Speaker 0: which you wouldn't realize right away.

75
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:38,360
Speaker 2: and people complain about a lot of things like ads and You know spam and all that sort of stuff going on.

76
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,492
Speaker 2: But most of that is because your computer isn't secure.

77
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,266
Speaker 2: if your computer is secure and set up properly Ads and spam really don't happen.

78
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,500
Speaker 2: You know, most spam comes from people whose computers who were all infected.

79
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,767
Speaker 2: That's where the spam comes from.

80
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,860
Speaker 2: It's you you're sending the spam, but you don't know it.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Speaker 0: There was a guy at work at my work who doesn't read slashdot and he said he didn't read it because of the ads.

82
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:02,419
Speaker 0: and I said what those are like the most unobtrusive ads ever and if you really wanted you could block them.

83
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:07,079
Speaker 0: and and I and he was like unobtrusive their pop-ups and pop-unders and they pop all over the place.

84
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 0: and At this point I was like what slashdot doesn't have pop-ups.

85
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,467
Speaker 2: It never will and never did.

86
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,131
Speaker 0: it never will.

87
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:16,754
Speaker 0: even if slashdot turned evil They wouldn't use pop-ups because they're not stupid.

88
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:17,178
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:26,615
Speaker 0: So I look at his computer and he's got just like pop-up spyware and apparently it was just randomly It happened to pop up a lot of the ads when slashdot was open and he assumed that slashdot was the cause.

90
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:39,076
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, I couldn't even fix it because ad aware is not free to corporations and this is work computer and You can use Microsoft anti spyware, but it's none of the spyware.

91
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:40,180
Speaker 2: things are complete enough.

92
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,640
Speaker 2: There's no way to 100% protect yourself and it's just not worth the effort of protecting.

93
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:51,343
Speaker 0: So I guess if you need a New Year's resolution and you're a computer guy at all or computer girl If

94
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,938
Speaker 2: you use your computer more than once a day

95
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:59,159
Speaker 0: Try to learn Linux get an Ubuntu CD or a Linux any sort of Linux live CD and just play with it.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,380
Speaker 0: Because within a few years you might need to move off of Windows if things get bad enough.

97
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,624
Speaker 2: Yeah, you might just.

98
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:16,595
Speaker 2: you know, if you depend on your computer for your business or especially for your business But for your entertainment or for anything Then you know Windows just might not cut it in a few years.

99
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:21,334
Speaker 2: if Vista, you know It's all DRM like they say it's gonna be in such now.

100
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,046
Speaker 0: We're not trying to be Linux L. It's like oh use Linux open source.

101
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,533
Speaker 2: We can get an apple if you got mad money.

102
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:26,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get an apple.

103
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:26,980
Speaker 0: apples are fantastic.

104
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:28,575
Speaker 0: We're thinking about buying one to do this show.

105
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:39,880
Speaker 0: Yeah But this is just it's good advice from us to you You really knowing Linux in the over the course of the next couple decades is going to be a very useful skill in the world.

106
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,620
Speaker 0: And even if you don't think it will be you'd be surprised.

107
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:57,938
Speaker 2: Yeah, even if you're not even a computer guy or anything if you're just you know, some normal person You know, this is a nerdy thing that is gonna come and affect you, you know A lot of people are like, you know They're in some profession and they say oh the things in my profession affect other people and they don't even know it.

108
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,240
Speaker 2: and then You walk around seeing other people getting screwed by that thing.

109
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,848
Speaker 2: You know, like if you're a florist and you see people buying bad flowers, you know, like man, you should really know this You wouldn't buy bad flowers.

110
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,077
Speaker 2: It's affecting you in a bad way.

111
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:18,779
Speaker 2: You know florist doesn't know about computers but you know if other people bought better flowers that would make the florist happy and it would make the people a lot more happier.

112
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,025
Speaker 2: because You know, they just don't know.

113
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:21,694
Speaker 2: this is the thing that you should know.

114
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,418
Speaker 2: they can help you out.

115
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,040
Speaker 2: So in Japan they have these hotels I think are really cool.

116
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:33,539
Speaker 2: They're called the capsule hotels and basically it's like this tube like a tube just big enough for a person to fit in.

117
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,813
Speaker 0: They're actually a little bigger that you can kind of sit off.

118
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:36,980
Speaker 2: if you're not you can kind of sit up.

119
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,385
Speaker 2: It's not really just that small.

120
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,250
Speaker 2: It's not like a coffin.

121
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,620
Speaker 2: No, it's a little bigger than that, but it's not big at all.

122
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,820
Speaker 2: I mean they stack these things up vertically and horizontally and everything and it's pretty much a cheap hotel.

123
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:59,407
Speaker 2: So if you're one person on a business trip and you want to save money You know you pay a very small fee and you get a bed and like a little TV next to your head for the night and it's very Practical and efficient.

124
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:05,580
Speaker 0: Yep, and usually in the building or next door There's a bunch of public showers and things so you can shave and shower and do all that stuff before you go to sleep.

125
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:34,443
Speaker 2: Yep not like these American hotels where you have like all this space and you have to pay huge amounts of money and go through a Whole ordeal and you get furniture you don't use and all this kind of stuff like, you know The kind of space you would need if you were staying for weeks and weeks and weeks, you know Some people do need but most people will stay in hotels for maybe like a weekend and you don't really need all that stuff you know, there's no point to it, so someone is finally taking this idea out of Japan and into London and They're calling it.

126
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:38,383
Speaker 2: Well the company I think they're calling it Yotel Y-o-t-e-l.

127
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,670
Speaker 0: Yep, Slashdot called them coffin hotels.

128
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,635
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not quite coffin sized.

129
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:44,440
Speaker 2: It's actually bigger than the Japanese hotels.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,220
Speaker 2: They're 10 meters by 10 meters squared in floor space and the ceiling is actually as high as you know.

131
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,043
Speaker 2: A normal ceiling is.

132
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,480
Speaker 0: they're about the size of you ever lived in the on the East Coast on like the Jersey Shore.

133
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,180
Speaker 0: There used to be all these like maybe 10 years ago.

134
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:10,705
Speaker 0: There used to be all these little like tiny beach houses like on the beach and in Britain London They have these things a lot there not in London But in Britain these tiny little beach houses and they're just big enough for like one person to crash on the floor on a little And change into a swimsuit,

135
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:14,540
Speaker 2: yep, well these hotels are 10 feet 10 meters squared.

136
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:24,856
Speaker 2: they come with the sofa that turns into a bed, you know, it's a couch bed couch bed and It doesn't really have a real television, you know, but what it does come with is a sofa.

137
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,006
Speaker 2: I already said that Desk that you pull down.

138
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,897
Speaker 2: So it's like you pull it out of the wall and you can put something on it.

139
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,838
Speaker 2: Closet space very small amount of closet space.

140
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,250
Speaker 2: Some mood lighting which is always cool, you know.

141
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:51,380
Speaker 2: a shower very useful Wireless internet the most useful an iPod connection so you can plug your iPod into the hotel room and the sound comes out of the Speakers in the hotel room and there's a flat-screen TV, which saves a lot of space.

142
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:57,899
Speaker 2: And you know these things are gonna put them in airports and all kinds of other places where hotels are used very often.

143
00:10:58,502 --> 00:10:59,908
Speaker 0: But they're also places like that.

144
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:02,820
Speaker 0: those hotels are used very often, but they're used for like one night usually.

145
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:13,795
Speaker 2: Yep, if you stay in an airport hotel, that's because your flight got canceled and you're stuck there or it could be because you came on a trip and You know, you have to make a transfer the next day - that's international.

146
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:20,420
Speaker 0: Yeah So why do you want to pay 300 bucks for a huge hotel room that you're gonna be in for like a few hours while?

147
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,883
Speaker 0: You're asleep.

148
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:23,539
Speaker 2: You're only gonna use like the bed the shower and maybe the TV.

149
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:24,904
Speaker 2: You don't it means here.

150
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:36,980
Speaker 2: has anyone here ever actually used the the the nightstand Anything other than the telephone and the clock and once once I unpacked my clothes into the dresser of a hotel.

151
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,433
Speaker 0: Wow, but I stayed in the same hotel room for a week a week.

152
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,337
Speaker 2: I can understand a week.

153
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:46,460
Speaker 2: Yeah But anyway, they say it's gonna cost about 70 bucks a night, which is real cheap.

154
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:55,717
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean we go to Baltimore every year for that Otakon and The cheapest cheapest hotel rooms are over $100 a night and usually we spend about 300 a night.

155
00:11:55,957 --> 00:12:06,920
Speaker 2: and they say you can also Book it for four hour periods Which is real useful if you have like a transfer or you want to just take a little nap before your flight or you got To the airport way early and breeze through security, you know, you can go take a nap there

156
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,370
Speaker 0: Yep, or you're on the road.

157
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,256
Speaker 0: You want to take a shower?

158
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:17,562
Speaker 2: Yep Now it's not quite, you know The perfect thing that I've been looking for which is even smaller and in New York City Which.

159
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,957
Speaker 2: but this could if it succeeds in Britain come over which would make me very happy.

160
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:36,440
Speaker 2: Yes I mean, there's nothing I need more in New York City than a place where I can just either crash for the night for like a hundred bucks or Spend 20 bucks take a shower, you know and shave and change my clothes.

161
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,769
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be so freaking.

162
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,179
Speaker 0: you like say you woke up late for work.

163
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,020
Speaker 0: It'd be so much better to go to go on the same normal train.

164
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,940
Speaker 0: You always go on and then get to the city and then like shave and shower and everything there and then go into the building.

165
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,520
Speaker 2: Yep, I mean and think about this, let's say I go to work for the day, right?

166
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,274
Speaker 2: I'm wearing my work clothes, but after work, I want to go hang out with some people.

167
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:56,920
Speaker 2: so I spend 20 bucks.

168
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,119
Speaker 2: I could take a shower to get my work off of me.

169
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:02,840
Speaker 2: You know, I can change into fun clothes and get off the work clothes.

170
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:08,654
Speaker 2: I can put all my stuff in a locker that I rent out, you know, and I'm good to go.

171
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,547
Speaker 2: Maybe I'll take a little nap if the.

172
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:14,727
Speaker 2: if I'm going to like a concert that's later at night or maybe a hockey game or Something, you know, who knows?

173
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,619
Speaker 0: Yes, I'd love something like that.

174
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:32,528
Speaker 2: But as it stands if I wanted to go to a concert or a hockey game after work I have to carry a backpack to said hockey game or concert or event or meeting or whatever You know and I got to change my work clothes in the work bathroom and I'll be all stinky from work You know and it's just a pain in the ass.

175
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:32,969
Speaker 0: Yep.

176
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:40,499
Speaker 0: So if any venture capitalists are out there listening to the show Either give us some money and we'll do it or give someone who wants to do this money so we can use it.

177
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,616
Speaker 2: Yeah, then, you know, we've got life great and it's glad.

178
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:51,200
Speaker 0: it's good to see that The idea is finally spreading and actually I'm glad that it's starting somewhere like London because this is kind of a stereotype.

179
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,382
Speaker 0: But I I get this impression that a lot of foreigners as opposed to Americans would be more open to at least trying something like this Mm-hmm.

180
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,800
Speaker 0: So if it succeeds in Britain because people might try and go oh, this is cool.

181
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:07,320
Speaker 0: And then it comes over here then they can say yeah people in London use this and it's great instead of our at America.

182
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,662
Speaker 0: Here's this weird thing that is kind of weird to you guys.

183

245
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:16,070

246
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:16,836
Speaker 2: It's like hibachi.

247
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,410
Speaker 2: So they kind of figured it out.

248
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:26,223
Speaker 2: They look at how many people we've got and they're like, uh, and then we're like, no no no For for those uneducated and if you're not educated you should be about this.

249
00:18:26,284 --> 00:18:26,504
Speaker 1: but how?

250
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,150
Speaker 1: bocce is basically like a big table.

251
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,637
Speaker 1: that's also a oven and everybody sits around the table and a Chef is there.

252
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:43,454
Speaker 1: they do all kinds of cool things with the food like They spin eggs on on their little spatulas and they throw food around and they cook it and they serve it to you right there And it's really hot and good.

253
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:47,388
Speaker 1: So it's like half show and half restaurant and they make lots of fire.

254
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,847
Speaker 2: Yeah everyone likes fire.

255
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,010
Speaker 0: Only sad thing about is we do it so often that like I'm not impressed by it anymore at all.

256
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:57,674
Speaker 2: Yeah I have.

257
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,575
Speaker 2: I'd have to go around like Finding different hibachi.

258
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:01,559
Speaker 2: guys have different things.

259
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:12,124
Speaker 1: they do like some guy like cuts an egg open like burns it on fire lights his hands On fire does like a thing with it and you're like, yeah, yes Last time I was here impressed me man, like light someone here on fire.

260
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,049
Speaker 1: Let's see you do that smart guy.

261
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,589
Speaker 2: Yeah, they really you know, but it's weird because the guy like knows us.

262
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,550
Speaker 2: It's like we went in with a new person and he's like, oh you're the new person.

263
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:21,007
Speaker 2: I will do special attention to you.

264
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:34,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the real reason that these two guys brought me in here was partially because I'm their friend and partially Okay, they left the front parts like oh, yeah, we're friends, huh, right?

265
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:42,250
Speaker 1: No, they wanted me to tell a story about Eating in Japan because I had spent some time in Japan one summer and it was lots of fun.

266
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,048
Speaker 1: And if you're ever a chance to study abroad do it because it's it's pretty fun.

267
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:53,650
Speaker 1: But there's this place called a yaki Yaki, Niku, which literally means cooked meat and the way it's set up is you pay by the hour.

268
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,350
Speaker 1: So like let's say you're gonna go eat with a bunch of friends for like an hour and a half.

269
00:19:56,872 --> 00:20:00,704
Speaker 1: It's like 15 bucks and you can eat all you want for an hour and a half.

270
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:06,649
Speaker 1: and there's a little conveyor belt that goes around All the tables and it's like comes out in an island in the middle of the restaurant.

271
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,659
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't think places like that actually existed.

272
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,181
Speaker 1: Yeah.

273
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:17,410
Speaker 2: Yeah, just not here because I mean here, you know You have like filthy children who like The place is like a square or a circle and everyone sits around and all the food is in the middle.

274
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,579
Speaker 1: Yeah it's a think of like a w-shape and the food goes around.

275
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:26,865
Speaker 1: this w-shape like around the side and then around the middle and then Around the side then goes back into the kitchen where we don't know what happens.

276
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:27,690
Speaker 2: I got it.

277
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,028
Speaker 0: So if any of you venture capitalists from the previous segment are listening give us money for that too.

278
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,248
Speaker 2: Yes, sir Yeah, we'll make one of those with the hotel attached and have a LAN party inside.

279
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,916
Speaker 1: But so and the food comes out.

280
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:42,670
Speaker 1: it's usually like frozen like so like when the beat when the meat starts coming around.

281
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,080
Speaker 1: It's like these frozen like slices.

282
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,610
Speaker 2: So you don't want to sit at the beginning.

283
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:46,235
Speaker 1: What's that?

284
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,745
Speaker 2: You see don't want to sit at the beginning part?

285
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,350
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Even if the food goes around it's it's it's supposed to be frozen.

286
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,525
Speaker 1: So it keeps cold until you cook it.

287
00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:00,910
Speaker 1: Because what you do is you take it off and you put it in this little burner grill that's in the middle And you cook it there like this suction that sucks the smoke off of there.

288
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,698
Speaker 1: So you're not like filling the entire place with smoke.

289
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:13,470
Speaker 1: now something to understand is that in Japan beef is really expensive Like you don't find $20 steaks you find like a 30 or 40 dollar steak in his like hamburger meat.

290
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,886
Speaker 1: it's like it's ninja food like the ninja food story - if you want.

291
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:23,541
Speaker 1: but So this foods going around and we're Americans going to the Japanese place and we're like, oh, yeah It's just it's just beef.

292
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:24,227
Speaker 1: we cook it we eat it.

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:35,610
Speaker 1: So we sit down and we didn't know also at the time that They don't clear your plates as you're eating because all the food comes around these little like the five inch in in radius dishes.

294
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:45,769
Speaker 1: so they're going around and we're taking food and we're eating and we're taking food and reading and These plates start piling up at the table and they're piling up and they're piling up and the waiters are sort of looking at us.

295
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:49,287
Speaker 1: funny Because you know, they've never seen like an American person like ever I guess.

296
00:21:51,514 --> 00:22:04,530
Speaker 1: And and you know the plates are piling up and we see them talking to each other and one of one of the guys there spoke a lot of Japanese because he was like advanced and he was like they're asking each Other whether or not they should clear our plates and I was like, oh my gosh, what's why are they doing that?

297
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,102
Speaker 1: We found out later that they don't clear the plates until after you leave.

298
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:08,489
Speaker 1: like did the help and you don't see them?

299
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:14,087
Speaker 1: So eventually they like they're like chuckling at us and laughing and they're taking away the plates and we were there for like the full hour and a half.

300
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:22,122
Speaker 1: But when you put four Americans with small amounts of beef in front of a grill and just have them eat There's never like a filling because you're digesting as you're eating.

301
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:22,885
Speaker 1: so these.

302
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:26,015
Speaker 1: we ate something like 132 between four guys.

303
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,298
Speaker 1: Wow 32 plates of food.

304
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,948
Speaker 1: I think you'll imagine this place being like, oh, we just lost so much money.

305
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:43,350
Speaker 1: Oh, no So, you know and we're eating like desserts everything we walk out of there and as soon as we leave These guys are like laughing their asses off and pointing at us as we leave like we're like, wow, that was cool We gotta go back next time.

306
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,813
Speaker 2: No, you know what?

307
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,537
Speaker 2: They were laughing at.

308
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,510
Speaker 2: was the guys in the back on the other end of the conveyor?

309
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:52,873
Speaker 1: That's something else we notice is that the meat started out like soft and as we were there the meat started getting like more and more Frozen.

310
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,061
Speaker 1: so we figure the guys in the back are going.

311
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,290
Speaker 1: Oh my god, what's happening to all the meat?

312
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,745
Speaker 1: Shave some more meat off put it on the thing And you know last we went back again like three days later with like eight people.

313
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:09,184
Speaker 1: the same thing happened Except we like 400 plates of food Like all right, no more guide you.

314
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:15,270
Speaker 1: yeah, seriously They're like sorry you guys can't say this long anymore because we're losing tons of money on you for eating our really expensive beef.

315
00:23:15,914 --> 00:23:23,890
Speaker 2: I mean, I've heard of business mails file Failing against new technology, but business mails failing against new nationalities.

316
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,136
Speaker 1: They didn't count on the American.

317
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:30,890
Speaker 1: It was like it was, you know, you think barbecue you eat at a barbecue, you know You keep on grazing you go around.

318
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:35,390
Speaker 1: So this is like instead of the grazing the food just kept coming to us and we're like hey more beef thrown on the Barbie.

319
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,723
Speaker 0: I can feel like the moment you guys sit down the beef just stops coming back around.

320
00:23:38,743 --> 00:23:39,787
Speaker 1: It's like all vegetables.

321
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:42,469
Speaker 1: It's like damn Yeah, they found us out.

322
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,457
Speaker 1: The ninja food was kind of was kind of amusing.

323
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:54,208
Speaker 1: do like if you go to Japan ever or any other country that doesn't have Like native food like a lot of people think like American Italian restaurants are like Italian food.

324
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,227
Speaker 2: Not at all They're wrong.

325
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:56,093
Speaker 1: You know.

326
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:57,299
Speaker 1: the same thing happens in Japan.

327
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:04,108
Speaker 1: if you go to Japan like the only American food you're gonna get Or even anything close is gonna be like McDonald's and that's not really American food.

328
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:04,650
Speaker 1: That's like just.

329
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:06,214
Speaker 0: It's not food.

330
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:06,837
Speaker 1: It's not food.

331
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:09,290
Speaker 2: It's not food to begin with but it's like pretend American foods.

332
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,088
Speaker 1: it's it's meat flavored food type product.

333
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:16,606
Speaker 1: and We Went to this Italian restaurant because they were like, oh we want some Italian food.

334
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,009
Speaker 1: So the Japanese were like, okay We'll go to the Italian restaurant.

335
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,677
Speaker 1: What we didn't count on was the ninja food.

336
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,342
Speaker 1: see ninja food is food.

337
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:26,010
Speaker 1: That is Japanese food trying to be other food.

338
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:30,490
Speaker 1: So like I ordered I think like spaghetti and something like that spaghetti meatballs.

339
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:37,169
Speaker 1: And it was like obviously chopped up bits of hamburger with like soba noodles and really really thin like tomato sauce.

340
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:39,154

Speaker 1: Like, you know like here you can get ramen for like at a nice restaurant.

347
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,032
Speaker 1: It'll cost you like five bucks in Japan will be like a buck fifty Like the equivalent.

348
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:05,046

Speaker 2: Wow, what do people actually eat that and like it though?

351
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:12,675

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,130
Speaker 1: I mean it must the horrible things they do to pizza there.

Speaker 2: You know.

364
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:47,219
Speaker 2: all the food you eat in any particular country is you know or 90% of it Anyway is food of that country and if they say it's food of a different country It's just pretending to be that of the country.

365
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I like like the Japanese snacks.

366
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:50,934
Speaker 1: Japanese snacks are awesome.

367
00:25:50,954 --> 00:25:51,496

371
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:05,010
Speaker 0: Oh, yes Sorry, I mean I assume people who listen to geek nights know what wasabi is but it's this wonderful green substance.

372
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:10,352
Speaker 0: It's like a mash and it tastes like mint and I recommend you eat a bowl of it No once.

373
00:26:10,372 --> 00:26:13,502
Speaker 1: yeah, real men can eat a whole bowl without even flinching.

374
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:19,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually it tastes like burning Like, you know those firecrackers those those mentally retarded guys ate.

375
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:21,584
Speaker 0: Oh god, I saw that on far.

376
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,310
Speaker 0: What really wasn't a joke.

377
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,650
Speaker 1: Yeah There was something like some story on FARC about like in was a Beijing or something like that during the New Year or something.

378
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:34,350
Speaker 1: It was some Asian country and it was like during the New Year's like two guys died because they ate firecrackers.

379
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,410
Speaker 2: Well, it's what did the firecrackers say on them like food?

380
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,550
Speaker 0: You know what if there's a fuse coming out of your food, don't?

381
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:44,461
Speaker 1: If there's a fuse coming out there's something else up.

382
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,230
Speaker 2: did they light him first and then eat him.

383
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,401
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

384
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:48,350
Speaker 1: I didn't read the whole story.

385
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,097
Speaker 1: I was like, I was just.

386
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,470
Speaker 1: you know, you read FARC half the time.

387
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,840
Speaker 1: We don't need to read this exploding.

388
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,646
Speaker 2: Yeah, labor drtf.

389
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,632
Speaker 1: I think it is.

390
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:59,339
Speaker 0: in fact if you read the story a lot of times it ruins it because the headlines funny and then you read The story is like wow.

391
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:04,510
Speaker 0: That was a horrible thing that happened to whoever that was Emphasis on was or that was boring.

392
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,629
Speaker 1: That wasn't at all what the the article was.

393
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,696
Speaker 2: Yeah I hate it when headlines are misleading.

394
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:19,985
Speaker 0: that just pisses me off all the time except the fake headlines on FARC the ones that are there just to trick news anchors and Morning radio news guys who like to just read FARC for the living.

395
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,453
Speaker 1: Those are the disappointing I know.

396
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:30,070
Speaker 1: just also like on my local wacky radio Wacky DJ radio show like back in Maryland where I used to live You just have Elliot in the morning and they they would always get all these funny news stories.

397
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,421
Speaker 1: I was like, aha funny news stories and then I was like, wait a minute.

398
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:33,546
Speaker 2: He's reading FARC.

399
00:27:33,606 --> 00:27:34,369
Speaker 1: It's all just awful fun.

400
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:41,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, every now and then FARC will put like a fake story and then in the comments It'll be like alright the story is fake or This?

401
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:43,690
Speaker 0: we just made this up or we link to a parody site.

402
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,369
Speaker 0: We know it's fake and then it's just kind of a game to see how many news people reported as truth.

403
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:48,191
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

404
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,247
Speaker 2: It's always good and then they'll be like, you know W whatnot reported.

405
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:52,789
Speaker 2: This is true.

406
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,265
Speaker 2: Okay, something something something said.

407
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:55,710
Speaker 2: this is cool.

408
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,988
Speaker 2: This morning radio guy reads FARC, so does this one.

409
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:07,090
Speaker 0: They all know we read FARC and we're not on the radio, but unless we get some pirate radio going at some point.

410
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,057
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think pirate radio is necessary.

411
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:12,167
Speaker 1: when you have podcast that calls for an mp3 that we need the pirate radio mp3.

412
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:14,469
Speaker 2: now It's anyway food.

413
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the interesting food stories of how we run across recently.

414
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:19,253
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.

415
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:21,990
Speaker 2: We've had a lot of food trouble lately trying to you know, have a party.

416
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:25,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've learned that like we said previously.

417
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:26,929
Speaker 0: Yes, our friends can eat all the food we have.

418
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:36,619
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean we never really we've had parties before but we never really provided food because we were poor and It wasn't so many people.

419
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:43,793
Speaker 0: for an extended period of time People would come and go and they'd walk like they bring their own food or we'd like go to someone else's apartment raid their Fridge and then leave.

420
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:47,408
Speaker 2: Yeah, but now you're expecting to have dinner from anywhere between like 10 and 30 people.

421
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:54,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, because a half of our friends are cool and we're like, yeah We're coming to your party and half of her friends just disappeared off the internet for the two weeks before.

422
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,483
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean keep your communications up, especially if you want free food.

423
00:28:57,764 --> 00:28:58,025
Speaker 0: Yes.

424
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:01,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz we had free food We got actual catering and it came and we ate it.

425
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,033
Speaker 2: But anyway, we had.

426
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,498
Speaker 2: we had no idea how much to get.

427
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,969
Speaker 2: so we pretty much just did a crapshoot saying well We'll learn this time and get it right the next time.

428
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:12,845
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, no one said I'm hungry after we ate.

429
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:13,890
Speaker 1: there's no plenty left downstairs.

430
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,030
Speaker 2: We just called the pizza guys and we said bring two trays of this and a tray of garlic knots and all those garlic knots.

431
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should have gotten twice as many of those.

432
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,950
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know why we got so I didn't realize there were a lot Of garlic knots and I opened it up and I said that'll be gone.

433
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,345
Speaker 1: I had like one and there was like a whole plate of so someone was like scarfing someone.

434
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,620
Speaker 2: I had three or four So we're like there were like 50 in there.

435
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,083
Speaker 1: Somebody just just jacked like a whole bunch of them once.

436
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:37,108
Speaker 2: it must have been.

437
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,798
Speaker 2: But I didn't eat the the chicken.

438
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:42,330
Speaker 2: I only ate the noodles, which is very very good.

439
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:46,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, the chicken Marsala was okay, but a lot of people like did like mushrooms and wouldn't eat it.

440
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,034
Speaker 1: I dug the mushroom.

441
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,885
Speaker 1: I definitely dug the ziti when I dug the Marsala.

442
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,186
Speaker 1: Yeah.

443
00:29:51,226 --> 00:29:52,210
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll learn next time.

444
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,670
Speaker 2: We won't get the chicken Marsala again, especially because it made a big mess.

445
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have I have.

446
00:29:55,673 --> 00:30:00,550
Speaker 1: I have serious concerns about any food that is so much slathered in sauce that it is its own soup.

447
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

448
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:08,509
Speaker 1: yeah I want to eat the chicken But I got to find it like I got to dig around in there first under the brown to find where the chicken is.

449
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:16,270
Speaker 0: The one issue that we had and we didn't realize we had it until right before we ordered the food Was that one of our friends and only one is a vegetarian?

450
00:30:17,073 --> 00:30:20,204
Speaker 0: So we planned out all the food and then we looked and we're like, wait a minute.

451
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:23,900
Speaker 0: every single piece of food We're providing has meat in it somewhere.

452
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,483
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

453
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:25,850
Speaker 0: Like alright crap.

454
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:26,993
Speaker 0: What are we gonna do?

455
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:32,810
Speaker 0: and we're the most places who provide food like catering food don't seem to have vegetarian food.

456
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,613
Speaker 0: That doesn't suck.

457
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:34,557
Speaker 2: Yeah.

458
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:37,490
Speaker 2: Well, at least the problem is is that we can't really ask.

459
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:42,008
Speaker 0: At the party I made that salad in a pair of boxers like earlier in the day.

460
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,334
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, I've never.

461
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:46,050
Speaker 1: I've never had salad that has been mixed inside of boxers before.

462
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:47,825
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't eat it.

463
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:52,709
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is that you know, we as meat-eating people look at vegetarian food and go that's not good.

464
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:56,642
Speaker 2: But then the vegetarian people might think differently, but we can't really order for them.

465
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:01,381
Speaker 1: Oh, well, oh speaking of vegetarian food I told this story earlier today, but I should probably tell it again.

466
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:07,430
Speaker 1: an old roommate of mine Was was dating a girl who was a vegetarian and this is in college.

467
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:22,261
Speaker 1: so I had three roommates at the time and one of them was dating a girl who was vegetarian and one of them was very Considerate and decided that she was going to make dinner for everyone when she when this girl came over and she was going to make vegetarian vegan lasagna.

468
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:29,590
Speaker 2: and Well, I'm not sure if anybody knows I mean I think important ingredient in lasagna is meat.

469
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:39,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know an important ingredient in everything that is vegan and not including meat is usually soy Or tofu or some other soy based product.

470
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:45,050
Speaker 0: So unless you're a Neville level 9 vegan a level 9 vegan that's a militant vegan.

471
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,529
Speaker 0: No, you're only allowed to eat things that don't cast a shadow.

472
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:59,342
Speaker 1: So anyhow, she decided that tofu would make a good replacement for the ricotta cheese in lasagna and That it's wrong with cheese.

473
00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:00,450
Speaker 1: I don't know.

474
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,839
Speaker 2: It's from a. So you can't do that.

475
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:09,893
Speaker 1: vegans are like, oh no, you're stealing from it's from vitamin D from Vegetarian.

476
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,930
Speaker 0: is I don't eat animals vegan is I don't eat animals or things that come from animals?

477
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,522
Speaker 2: Well, I thought it was just they didn't eat like eggs and things.

478
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:17,330
Speaker 1: Yeah eggs come from animals milk come from man.

479
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,356
Speaker 2: I mean, I know vegetarians who do eat eggs, you know, but Vegan was just not egg.

480
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,081
Speaker 2: I didn't think it was not milk.

481
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:27,210
Speaker 0: Either vegan is a step more militant and a step more restrictive.

482
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got I got sworn it by a vegan once and I was like screw you heavy.

483
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:32,388
Speaker 1: I'm higher for the food chain Got a job.

484
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:42,686
Speaker 1: But so she makes this this thing and one of the properties of tofu and this is sort of like little known is that it will absorb the flavor and odor of anything that it is cooked with.

485
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,633
Speaker 0: and so Hmm.

486
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,930
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I like about tofu is that it doesn't really taste like much except for the flavor you put into it.

487
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,630
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you just want to you have a sauce that you really like and you just want to eat it straight.

488
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,938
Speaker 2: I just pour it right on there.

489
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,830
Speaker 1: You know, you could like make spaghetti with meat sauce.

490
00:32:57,032 --> 00:33:03,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, instead of meat just throw in some like, you know Maybe meat flavoring of some sort and then throw in some tofu and hey, you got like fake meatballs.

491
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,133
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can.

492
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,443
Speaker 2: I love it when you just want to eat teriyaki for dinner.

493
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:07,829
Speaker 2: You just know tofu little teriyaki.

494
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:19,890
Speaker 1: So anyhow, she decides to cook the this this ricotta Not ricotta tofu with broccoli mix and I'm not sure if anybody here has ever smelled like steaming broccoli.

495
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,762
Speaker 1: But go ahead and do it sometime and but it smells.

496
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,506
Speaker 1: nothing like broccoli.

497
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:24,390
Speaker 1: taste it smells.

498
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:29,149
Speaker 0: I don't even know what it smells like the things that aren't in the broccoli when you eat it.

499
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,376
Speaker 0: That does not smell good.

500
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:36,072
Speaker 2: There must be some chemical in the broccoli that breaks down when you heat it and it evaporate comes out In the air.

501
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:36,995
Speaker 1: Yes, I agree.

502
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:46,272
Speaker 1: I think I think it pretty much smells like ass like like ass and old socks Like that have been up and ass smells like sweat and dead haws Something like that.

503
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:48,540
Speaker 1: So yeah, so the tofu.

504
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:49,844
Speaker 1: she makes this whole dish right.

505
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:58,342
Speaker 1: then I'm like, I'm gonna be like the anime hero I'm gonna go and you know, I think it's gonna taste bad, but I'm gonna eat it and I'll swallow it down and I'll be whole and she'll think I'm a nice guy.

506
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:01,197
Speaker 1: and I wasn't trying to like Mack on her or Anything was just trying to be a nice guy, right?

507
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,328
Speaker 0: You weren't trying to Mack on her a god.

508
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,138
Speaker 1: No We won't go into that.

509
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,548
Speaker 1: That's that's for another show.

510
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:23,190
Speaker 1: But uh, so she makes this stuff and she serves it and you know She serves me first and then she serves, you know my my other roommate and his girlfriend who's the vegan and she serves herself and I go and take a bite out of it and I cannot explain how bad this tasted.

511
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:28,170
Speaker 1: I mean the tofu had absorbed the smell and converted it into taste.

512
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:29,833
Speaker 1: so you had.

513
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:37,822
Speaker 1: you had semi tasteless broccoli with ass flavored tofu and Like some red sauce between like coot noodles and stuff.

514
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:40,297
Speaker 1: So I take a bite and I'm like, I'm like I'll just I'll.

515
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:46,190
Speaker 1: just took it down took it down I tried to swallow it now just like put like right back on the plate and she looked at me like horrified.

516
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,074
Speaker 1: She was like, what'd you do that for?

517
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:53,210
Speaker 1: I was like, I'm sorry, but just just try it please and I won't feel so bad.

518
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:53,652
Speaker 1: And I went.

519
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:54,217
Speaker 1: I was like, I'm sorry.

520
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:54,679
Speaker 1: I have to do this.

521
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,969
Speaker 1: Don't just scraping it off into the garbage.

522
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,538
Speaker 1: She was like, it can't possibly be that bad.

523
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,750
Speaker 1: I said just just try it and she tries it.

524
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,783
Speaker 1: This is the girl who cooked it and she goes.

525
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:06,388
Speaker 1: Oh Right back on the plate.

526
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:10,770
Speaker 1: And so naturally, you know the other two people are like no they got to be screwing with us.

527
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,144
Speaker 1: It can't possibly be that bad.

528
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:20,987
Speaker 0: So naturally So pizza was There's just like when you see someone they eat something there and they make a bad face like oh god.

529
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:22,039
Speaker 0: and then they like want Some.

530
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,234
Speaker 1: That's a guy thing.

531
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:26,184
Speaker 1: It's like this tastes awful.

532
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:26,747
Speaker 1: It tastes like ass.

533
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:27,068
Speaker 1: try some.

534
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:39,452
Speaker 2: I'm always worried about like spitting out food because there's only two times I spit out food or like if You know There's something in my mouth and I'm coughing and I'm gonna time lick or something or if like I can't chew it Like.

535
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:44,776
Speaker 2: that happens a lot where this food is just tough and I can't chew it enough to the point where I can swallow it Even if it tastes good.

536
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:50,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, like half the stir-fry we try to make yeah And then I'm just trying to find a way to spit it out like nicely.

537
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,704
Speaker 0: You know what the best technique is because I can actually get a good nap in on mouth.

538
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,588
Speaker 2: is that my mouth.

539
00:35:54,648 --> 00:36:00,501
Speaker 0: you dab the Mouth and you go put and then you just kind of put the napkin aside kind of crumpled So you can't see the giant wad of food.

540
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:01,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do the five-year-old thing.

541
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:06,298
Speaker 1: We just sort of go like bridal and you just lay it right there on the plate Someone else's house.

542
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,105
Speaker 0: You spit under the table.

543
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,476
Speaker 1: They won't notice Only if they have animals pets or something.

544
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:11,279
Speaker 0: I don't know.

545
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,145
Speaker 0: just pile your Calvin and Hobbes.

546
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:14,349
Speaker 1: Have you ever had meat gum?

547
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,218
Speaker 0: Wait meat gum.

548
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,470
Speaker 1: This is this is not meat flavored gum.

549
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:33,870
Speaker 1: This is a term I came up with that was to my mom had made a veal Feels good veal or pork chops or something and had made it Poorly, yeah, I distinctly remember walking around the house chewing and not being able to like break it down in my mouth.

550
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:39,029
Speaker 1: And I said mom you made meat gum And I'm not sure if that had any effect on her, but she never made it after that.

551
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:45,010
Speaker 1: Mom, I'm sorry if I if I killed your your your cooking in the veal area.

552
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:49,006
Speaker 0: We have a serious problem with our stir-fry and basically meat gums.

553
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,010
Speaker 0: we now have a word for it.

554
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,155
Speaker 2: I don't know my stir-fry doesn't end up as meat gum But it's not much.

555
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:54,683
Speaker 2: doesn't taste anything like stir-fry.

556
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:55,950
Speaker 2: I get it real places of awesome.

557
00:36:56,411 --> 00:37:03,251
Speaker 0: We've watched professional chefs do stir-fry and we try to do like we do make the exact same motions and not the same thing comes Out.

558
00:37:03,953 --> 00:37:04,715
Speaker 2: I just don't know what it is.

559
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:09,870
Speaker 1: It's it's you've probably done the British thing and just cook the flavor right out of the food.

560
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:12,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I don't cook it that much then it's like uncooked chicken.

561
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:17,109
Speaker 0: Yeah It pretty much goes from raw to black in one second.

562
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:27,269
Speaker 2: Wow, I think it's just a large part of it is because we have an electric oven and yeah every stir-fry guy I've ever seen do something well had some sort of fire.

563
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:34,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually the Culinary Institute people who do the all the cooking in my cafeteria at work They use.

564
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,797
Speaker 0: it's an electric But it's that cool ceramic electric.

565
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:39,409
Speaker 0: where it's like ceramic pad and then the whole thing heats up at once.

566
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,196
Speaker 1: No words like down in the oven.

567
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,401
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's up.

568
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,609
Speaker 0: It's just like a pad that ceramic and it gets hot.

569
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:47,250
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not sure what the mechanism is for getting hot.

570
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,874
Speaker 1: Probably electricity.

571
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

572
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:58,870
Speaker 2: No a little a little like hamsters on fire That's ceramic is very good because I reheated up a lot without it breaking or melting or anything.

573
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, hence, you know the ceramic tiles a lot a lot better than metal.

574
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:04,159
Speaker 1: Okay, metal spaceships over.

575
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:11,340
Speaker 1: well except dolomite God does that count as inside?

576
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,187
Speaker 0: I don't know.

577
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,857
Speaker 0: Futurama is one reference to dolomite.

578
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:21,830
Speaker 1: I said I I was trying to explain He the Hebrew hammer to somebody and I said, oh god the Hebrew ham.

579
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:27,702
Speaker 1: I was trying to explain it as juice playtation to a co-worker who was black and I was like It's just like a blacks playtation only its juice playtation.

580
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:28,950
Speaker 1: and he was like, what's blacks playtation?

581
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:33,159
Speaker 2: I'm gonna admit something so everyone can laugh.

582
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,626
Speaker 2: I have no clue what dolomite is.

583
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,288
Speaker 1: Okay Well, I could see not knowing what dolomite, you know blacks playtation is though, right?

584
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:40,916
Speaker 2: Of course I'm a huge fan of blacks.

585
00:38:40,956 --> 00:38:42,242
Speaker 0: Well, then you should see dolomite.

586
00:38:42,262 --> 00:38:42,663
Speaker 0: He's one.

587
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:44,310
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a movie called dolomite.

588
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,535
Speaker 2: That is a blaxploitation film.

589
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,810
Speaker 0: I don't know the movies called dolomite, but there's a character named dolomite.

590
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:55,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I think there is actually a movie called dolomite in which the character is Dolomite.

591
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:59,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, and in Futurama they make a reference to dolomite at some point.

592
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, geeks know we're talking about.

593
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:02,060
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:03,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're not a geek should be listening anyhow.

595
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,830
Speaker 0: Three comments in the forums like yeah, it's seasoned blah blah blah in the last four minutes.

596
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:10,590
Speaker 2: I'm a dolomite calm and it is quite awesome.

597
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,590
Speaker 1: Another thing of the day I feel bad.

598
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,380
Speaker 1: I feel like I should have a thing of the day, but I had nothing.

599
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,829
Speaker 1: rim took mine that I sent him.

600
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:24,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sushi thing was given to me by Adam and it was given to him by his girlfriend Mike and you know what?

601
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:24,596

00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:30,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see her there.

606
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:30,463
Speaker 0: You know what?

607
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:36,449
Speaker 0: She can't talk cuz we're on the air live Now she's trying to gesture to me and I can't tell what she's trying to tell me to say.

608
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,001
Speaker 0: Now she's acting like she's eating something.

609
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:40,508
Speaker 1: She's saying either eat me or bite me.

610
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:42,387
Speaker 0: one of the two I don't know, but now she's giving up.

611
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:51,678
Speaker 2: So in a reverse non sequitur when you're searching for dolomite reverse Don't type in do lo mit.

612
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:56,010
Speaker 2: that's that's the name of a mineral discovered by some French mineralogist.

613
00:39:56,552 --> 00:40:00,806
Speaker 2: It's sedimentary search for dolomite like do le like Bob Dole.

614
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:01,026
Speaker 0: is.

615
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:02,070
Speaker 0: what about ammo night?

616
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,347
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think so.

617
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:09,358
Speaker 2: I'm definitely checking this movie out though.

618
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:10,241
Speaker 1: What don't?

619
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:11,386
Speaker 1: yeah check out here hammer, dude.

620
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:11,908
Speaker 1: That's a cool one.

621
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:16,930
Speaker 1: Yeah I know I always mean to but I think the Hebrew hammer that's a holiday treat for the whole family.

622
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:22,597
Speaker 0: Well, we've still got Black Samurai which is supposed to be a blaxploitation about samurai I mean still have yet to watch it.

623
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:25,450
Speaker 2: like we could watch like we've just been saving it and saving it and saving it.

624
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:27,323
Speaker 0: We could watch it after we do the show.

625
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,910
Speaker 1: Oh my god You have something next time to talk about again.

626
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:35,643
Speaker 0: Or we could just save it forever and never actually watch it because it's probably Running now than it will be after we see it.

627
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:36,950
Speaker 1: You see I thought that you were talking.

628
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:42,134
Speaker 1: I thought you were explaining the show earlier when you were talking about like the guy getting off the plane and being attacked by ninjas All the time.

629
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:43,082
Speaker 0: No, that's a different move.

630
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:43,929
Speaker 2: That's a different movie.

631
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,870
Speaker 2: We love this box set of DVDs.

632
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:53,870
Speaker 0: This set is just ninja movies movies involving ninjas and I've discovered that while I like ninjas almost every movie involving them is terrible.

633
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,811
Speaker 2: Yep,

634
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,622
Speaker 1: like you just scroll

635
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:57,769
Speaker 0: or three ninjas

636
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:00,694
Speaker 2: Stop making movies.

637
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:11,387
Speaker 2: a bunch of people in Hong Kong and other places made a whole crap ton of crap movies with people like Bruce Lay Bruce Lee Bruce lie Bruce lie, but Bruce Lee spelled differently Bruce low.

638
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:12,410
Speaker 0: and they're all these guys.

639
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:22,170
Speaker 2: They look like Bruce Lee, but they're not as good Yeah, or they're close to Bruce Lee But some of them are good and some of them are but they were just like Bruce Lee clones And they just try to imitate him and make those kind of movies.

640
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:28,568
Speaker 1: Brandon Lee met that horrible fate and he was pretty cool, too Which is damn shame because he could have been like the next like American martial arts guy.

641
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,154
Speaker 0: Yes There's that new guy the like.

642
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:33,424
Speaker 0: it's the Filipino kickbox or songs on Bock.

643
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:35,090
Speaker 2: Well, that's that's the name of the movie.

644
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:36,209
Speaker 2: Is that his name actually?

645
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:42,210
Speaker 2: I watched a trailer for that movie and I said that looks awesome, but I haven't seen the movie.

646
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:51,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it looked like normal fighting like Jackie Jackie Chan style fighting and then they're like, yeah, no stuntman It's just like Jackie Chan only there was also explosions and it looked serious instead of funny.

647
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,385
Speaker 1: Then you have the other end of the spectrum, which is like the the Steven Chow.

648
00:41:55,008 --> 00:42:03,835
Speaker 1: Oh God Yeah, we and we were pointed out today that like oh, yeah We watched was a kung fu hustle and that was awesome and challenge soccer was awesome and God of cookery was strange But awesome, you know what?

649
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:08,171
Speaker 0: That's a nice reverse non-sequitur Cookery.

650
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,259
Speaker 1: I must have leveled up in radio or something.

651
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,862
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're not.

652
00:42:10,902 --> 00:42:11,906
Speaker 2: well God of cookery.

653
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:12,810
Speaker 2: Hey, we're talking about food again.

654
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:13,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

655
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:23,796
Speaker 0: So if you need to see a movie and you're bored and it's I think it's on Netflix This movie is called God of cookery and it is quite literally about the God of cooking Like you think.

656
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,024
Speaker 1: it's just like oh the guy is so good.

657
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:25,366
Speaker 1: He's got.

658
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,842
Speaker 1: no no There's actually a God of cooking in the show that appears and it's it's it's.

659
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,133
Speaker 1: it falls along the lines of Steven Chow's movies and his Ridiculousness.

660
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:41,639
Speaker 0: I mean if you like Iron Chef because a lot of geeks are fans of Iron Chef for some inexplicable reason This movie is up your alley You have no idea.

661
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had some good time.

662
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:45,506
Speaker 1: The Steven Chow movies I think are there's.

663
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:56,650
Speaker 1: this thing going backwards is something that what he pointed out is that there are tons and tons and tons and tons of Steven Chow movies and 90% of them suck and I don't know why I Mean, I've seen three of his movies and they were all awesome.

664
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:59,640
Speaker 0: So I thought all right I'm gonna look up and see what other movies I can get.

665
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:01,690
Speaker 0: and he has like 40 movies in Netflix.

666
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:04,720
Speaker 0: So I added them all to the queue and then we watched.

667
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:08,374
Speaker 0: I watched like one and it was like the worst movie I've ever seen.

668
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:08,454
Speaker 0: Hmm.

669
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:12,010
Speaker 0: It just went on and on and on and there was this thing with a mole and it wasn't cool.

670
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,350
Speaker 2: It could have been funnier if they cut out a lot of the dumb scenes.

671
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,341
Speaker 2: Maybe it was just like maybe better editing.

672
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,111
Speaker 1: who's like his early stuff or something Like?

673
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:23,330
Speaker 1: maybe maybe he's later stuff that we know that we know what love is good and his early stuff like sucked.

674
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I know kung-fu hustle is kind of new and very natural.

675
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:27,644
Speaker 1: It's new.

676
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:29,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, God of Cookery is kind of new, too.

677
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,233
Speaker 1: You're Beijing.

678
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:32,303
Speaker 1: I think was it from Beijing with love.

679
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:33,770
Speaker 1: There's another one that I have them watched yet?

680
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,413
Speaker 1: I don't know.

681
00:43:34,453 --> 00:43:35,418
Speaker 2: not I have to see that one.

682
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:40,730
Speaker 2: I think that was like in the late 90s even if it's any good To do the third reverse non-sequitur.

683
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,363
Speaker 2: He actually hires like the same actors for a lot of his movies.

684
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:50,575
Speaker 2: like if you just watch all the recent ones You'll see like the same actors over and over again And people like the Beast.

685
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:55,270
Speaker 2: the Beast is actually one of those old Bruce Lee clone guys that he thought was good.

686
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,185
Speaker 2: So he hired him and turned him into not a Bruce Lee clone.

687
00:43:58,266 --> 00:43:58,788
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

688
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,722
Speaker 2: Yeah There's a lot of guys like that like that woman the the fat.

689
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:08,990
Speaker 2: what the landlady and her husband Shallon soccer she was in a lot of other stuff like that was old and crappy.

690
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:20,968
Speaker 2: So he brings back people who actually like have some martial arts movie talent and puts them in his somewhat good or even better movies You know so that they can fix their reputation for making a bunch of crap movies.

691
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:28,410
Speaker 0: now If you need any kind of impetus to watch God of Cookery There is a scene where they introduce these seven or the nine or some number.

692
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:45,446
Speaker 0: I'll just go with nine because I don't remember the nine brass monks and Basically the main character trained with these monks for a long time and They show the training and basically every time he screws up the monks would punish him and by punishing him They would all appear like on the screen and they would do like these crazy.

693
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:46,330
Speaker 0: You know kung-fu movies.

694
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:50,608
Speaker 0: I'm about to do awesome kung-fu setup, and then they would just run over him hit him with a chair.

695
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:54,173
