39
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:12,608
Speaker 0: Well, I was already only halfway from the car, so I drove home, and I actually when I got home I said I have to do something in this time.

40
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,314
Speaker 1: What did you do?

41
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,246
Speaker 0: well cuz well first I said you know what I would.

42
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,210
Speaker 0: maybe I won't go.

43
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,195
Speaker 1: I would have gone back to my car either.

44
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:27,749
Speaker 1: I would have gone back to my car and Set my cell phone alarm and taken a nap yeah, or I can't sleep in the car.

45
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:29,777
Speaker 1: I have often slept in my car.

46
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:31,102
Speaker 1: many a road trip.

47
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:32,849
Speaker 1: It's the worst road trip of my life.

48
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,987
Speaker 1: Well the worst solo road trip in my life the worst road trip in my life.

49
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,530
Speaker 1: you were driving But the word the worst solo road trip of my life.

50
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:48,190
Speaker 1: I was so tired, and I had so many more miles to go That I pulled over on the side of the road and just went to sleep.

51
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,096
Speaker 0: That's an attic.

52
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:50,850
Speaker 0: It's not a bad idea if you're tired.

53
00:02:50,950 --> 00:03:03,599
Speaker 1: And no it's a terrible idea because I woke up in the car And I'd been so used to fighting to stay awake the whole time I was on the road that I woke up realized I was behind the wheel Screamed and tried to stop the stop.

54
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,490
Speaker 0: you're supposed to sleep in the passenger seat.

55
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think of that.

56
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:11,479
Speaker 1: plus then I would have I would have done the same thing But simultaneously would have yelled where the fuck's the steering wheel?

57
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,750
Speaker 0: now Jesus am I in London?

58
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:17,419
Speaker 0: Right?

59
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,289
Speaker 0: so I drove home.

60
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:20,739
Speaker 0: I said Maybe I just won't go.

61
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,865
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have gone if I got.

62
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:28,245
Speaker 1: no if I'd gotten home I wouldn't go back to that train station, so I'm sitting there, and I'm thinking is should I go?

63
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:29,830
Speaker 0: should I not go?

64
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,958
Speaker 1: Will he stay or will he go now?

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:41,130
Speaker 0: I remember that the at work We just merged our domain with the other domain so the email was funky all right, so don't go you're not missing anything.

66
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,049
Speaker 0: I didn't do anything at work today, so why'd you go?

67
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,336
Speaker 1: Well, you know

68
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:59,439
Speaker 0: I went, but when I got home I knew I said I had to do something so I actually cleaned up all the shit off my floor in my room and put on my dirty clothes clean clothes away and also the dirty clothes away and Then I said all right fuck it.

69
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,815
Speaker 0: I went you know See speaking of which.

70
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:07,840
Speaker 1: actually I was thinking you know what how many vacation days I got left I want to take like a day or two off around New Year's.

71
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,337
Speaker 1: to you know all the people are gonna be around get ready for the giant annual FRC New Year's bash.

72
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,070
Speaker 1: so I go to the HR person.

73
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,264
Speaker 1: I'm like hey, how many vacation days do I have left?

74
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,149
Speaker 1: She's like give me a minute.

75
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:18,874
Speaker 1: I'll let you know.

76
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:19,760
Speaker 1: come back after lunch.

77
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:26,159
Speaker 1: I come after lunch, and she's like Yeah, you've got 16 All right, like what she's like.

78
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:33,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't really use that many this year And I can only roll five of them over to the next year, so I got to take 11 days off.

79
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,557
Speaker 0: Oh, they let you roll over.

80
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:37,110
Speaker 1: I realize the hospital that you roll over infinitely.

81
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:39,790
Speaker 0: I can't roll over anything not even a single day.

82
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:46,130
Speaker 1: There were people who wouldn't take a vacation day for like five years running and then disappear for a long time.

83
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,541
Speaker 0: If I could roll over I would use sick days.

84
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,490
Speaker 0: I would use all my sick days to go to conventions.

85
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,803
Speaker 0: I take all these Fridays off and the next year.

86
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,050
Speaker 0: I would just go away for a month.

87
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,704
Speaker 1: That's not what sick days are for.

88
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:58,617
Speaker 1: plus luckily Every company I've ever worked for.

89
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,922
Speaker 1: sick days did not count.

90
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:00,845
Speaker 1: they were just infinite.

91
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,969
Speaker 1: if you were sick don't come in.

92
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,759
Speaker 0: They were infinite where I work and so we got bought.

93
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,482
Speaker 0: we got bought.

94
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,566
Speaker 0: yeah, everything changed.

95
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:12,444
Speaker 1: well actually the hospital It was complicated because they gave us flex time that counted for any time you took.

96
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:16,236
Speaker 0: flex time is supposed to mean Work 40 hours.

97
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:17,340
Speaker 0: We don't know which hour.

98
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,157
Speaker 1: I also had that and I had as long as I worked well build 37.5 hours per week I was in the clear.

99
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,810
Speaker 0: Uh-huh even if it was Monday Tuesday, and that was it theoretically.

100
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, see I love that.

101
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:35,545
Speaker 1: well the thing is at the hospital because of the independent nature of my work There are very few people who would have noticed if I was not there like I could have.

102
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:42,449
Speaker 1: just I once near the end like after I Resigned myself to quitting I didn't show up one day.

103
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:47,070
Speaker 1: You know I was actually like kind of sick, so I just didn't go in and I emailed the HR person whatever.

104
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,620
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that the HR person.

105
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,970
Speaker 1: I emailed had quit like a month before.

106
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:57,570
Speaker 0: So basically no one knew I didn't set up the email to forward to the new HR person.

107
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,093
Speaker 1: There's a reason.

108
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:03,317
Speaker 1: I'm working for this other company now right, but like no one noticed I was gone well at.

109
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,910
Speaker 0: I took so far this year ten vacation days, and I have two left.

110
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:10,510
Speaker 0: I also have two and a half sick days because now we don't have infinite sick days anymore.

111
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,357
Speaker 0: They gave everyone two and a half because they bought us in June the middle of the year And they usually give five.

112
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:26,309
Speaker 1: so I thought I used a lot more than I did But then I realized that I had five rolled over from the previous year Right and then I was trying to figure out what the actual holiday days off were.

113
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:38,009
Speaker 0: Apparently this company gives you know Christmas Day, New Year's Day, but they also have four Christmas holiday days pretty much that the days between Christmas and New Year's.

114
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:47,830
Speaker 0: So I think I can use my four and a half days and get you know basically the end of the year off and then Cuz after New Year's it's a new year, and there's that one Friday in there.

115
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,680
Speaker 0: I can I can use the next year's day to get that off.

116
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:57,570
Speaker 1: - see I think I actually have to work the Friday after New Year's because everyone else in my company is taking that day off, but I got all these vacation days to burn.

117
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:08,500
Speaker 1: So I'm probably gonna take like the week before it off And I'm gonna spend the rest of the day's skiing like I'm just gonna like take every Wednesday off in December also in the middle Of November you know when a whole company goes to Puerto Rico.

118
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:11,270
Speaker 0: I have two days, so it's gonna be good, too.

119
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:13,039
Speaker 1: So you don't have to go to Puerto Rico.

120
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,150
Speaker 0: no, I just you know I said ours.

121
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,053
Speaker 0: I RSVP'd.

122
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:16,936
Speaker 0: no and that was it.

123
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:20,710
Speaker 1: oh all this drama and everyone's like hey Scott going is Scott going?

124
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,496
Speaker 1: I guess that's the answer.

125
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:22,382
Speaker 0: It's not it's not.

126
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:23,470
Speaker 0: what was the drama?

127
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:24,073
Speaker 0: It was just.

128
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:28,050
Speaker 1: you know the dresser was drama for everyone, but you apparently anyway.

129
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:30,483
Speaker 1: There's actual video game news that kind of.

130
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:31,690

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:43,128

134
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:47,538
Speaker 0: the problem I'm having right is not that there's no Games to anticipate.

135

Speaker 1: that game was like the best game.

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,866
Speaker 1: I played since portal hands down.

152
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:25,178
Speaker 1: Oh my God, and I'm excited almost surprisingly About punch-out for the Wii.

153
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,750
Speaker 0: now you might want you to be excited for punch-out.

154
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:29,079
Speaker 1: I wasn't.

155
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,530
Speaker 1: I didn't really like the Super Nintendo.

156
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:35,226
Speaker 1: I usually liked no iteration of punch-out other than Mike Tyson's punch-out.

157
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,570
Speaker 0: What's wrong with Super Nintendo punch-out?

158
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,434
Speaker 1: It just wasn't as good.

159
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 1: It didn't have as much character.

160
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,299
Speaker 1: I mean it had Gaby J. Gaby J. Yeah But there was something about Mike Tyson's punch-out.

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,483
Speaker 1: none of this, Mr.. Dream.

162
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:55,928
Speaker 1: I'm talking Mike Tyson's punch-out, but Basically Nintendo has been screwing me left and right with new games like

163
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:57,114
Speaker 0: WarioWare

164
00:08:57,134 --> 00:09:08,510
Speaker 1: for the Gamecube was one of the best games that has ever been on a Nintendo platform and of course Nintendo had no idea why it was a good game and thus The same game released on the Wii was one of the worst games Nintendo has ever released.

165
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,541
Speaker 1: But you know I expected them to do the same thing with punch-out.

166
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,710
Speaker 1: I expected it to be some like waggle Bs.

167
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:17,329
Speaker 0: I expected to have like probably is going to be waggle Bs.

168
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:22,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, see if it is that I'm probably not going to be excited anymore But of course it's going to be happy.

169
00:09:22,777 --> 00:09:34,690
Speaker 1: Nintendo has this history of getting the right things wrong and the wrong things right in like every remake of a game they make with rare exception and I was really worried that punch-out was going to be generic.

170
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,910
Speaker 1: It was going to be all like me's fighting each other and none of the original charm.

171
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:53,324
Speaker 1: The trailer for punch-out on the Wii came out and if any of you have not seen it I recommend that you stop listening go click on that link and watch it because let me tell you all The racism is there and it's surprising, but that excites me more.

172
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:57,634
Speaker 1: well not racism Nationalistic stereotypes.

173
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:05,850
Speaker 0: you see that's the one part of the game that they could have removed And I wouldn't have been upset you know as long as they had the quality gameplay of the original.

174
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,470
Speaker 0: You know the the simple yet complex nature of a boxing game where you only have you know five?

175
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,343
Speaker 0: Attacks and like you know three or four dodges, and that's it.

176
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,410
Speaker 0: and that that's what I was looking for.

177
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,535
Speaker 0: See it's kind of like that.

178
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:21,790
Speaker 0: They brought back these hilarious nationalist stereotypes.

179
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:28,330
Speaker 1: There's conflation like in jeans where like the jeans for something like red hair might be conflated with the jeans for something else.

180
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:33,470
Speaker 1: People with one genetic trait will often exhibit another seemingly unrelated genetic trait.

181
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:56,186
Speaker 1: Games are the same way, and I feel as though by getting that right by having the croissants flying through the air out of glass Joe after you knock him out and Such and by having the Kaiser and King Hippo in the game And it the game looks like it's just basically a straight up remake of the original punch-out.

182
00:10:56,687 --> 00:11:03,830
Speaker 1: by getting that right I'm confident that they have gotten all the right things right and the wrong things also right because they're not there.

183
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:08,870
Speaker 0: See thing is I've been deceived by you know the images too many times.

184
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,539
Speaker 0: I no longer fall for that.

185
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,524
Speaker 1: like what I mean.

186
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:12,730
Speaker 1: why are you aware for the Wii?

187
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:13,814
Speaker 1: We weren't.

188
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,464
Speaker 1: we were deceived by the name.

189
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:21,670
Speaker 1: there was no image There was no like thing where I said oh look they know what they doing except the dancing cats.

190
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:26,450
Speaker 1: See the thing is I already knew the game was bad by the time I got to the dancing cats.

191
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,275
Speaker 0: There's.

192
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,519
Speaker 0: There's been plenty of games out there that you know.

193
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:31,780
Speaker 0: they.

194
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,151
Speaker 0: they get the visuals of the audios right you know But

195
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,315
Speaker 1: the

196
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,719
Speaker 0: gameplay isn't very

197
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:50,689
Speaker 1: specifically that they kept the nationalistic stereotypes They kept but like the thing that you expected them to drop first They kept the hardest and that that gives me more hope than anything anyone ever could have said.

198
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,810
Speaker 0: no Hope because you know it's gonna be some waggly controlled thing.

199
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,165
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be you know it actually well controlled thing.

200
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,920
Speaker 1: It's I don't think so I'll bet.

201
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,950
Speaker 1: what's what it's gonna Be is there's probably gonna be some sort of waggle option and maybe you waggle to do like the super punch or something.

202
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:10,305
Speaker 1: But I'll bet that there is an option just hold that controller sideways in fact.

203
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:11,870
Speaker 1: I'll bet ten bucks.

204
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,099
Speaker 0: I'm not betting against it, but I'm not too confident about.

205
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,790
Speaker 0: I'm ten dollars confident, and you know what I can wait on it.

206
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:26,056
Speaker 0: I got plenty of games going on right now like for example You know the WarioWare Whatnot?

207
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:26,742
Speaker 0: what's it called?

208
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:27,529
Speaker 0: not WarioWare?

209
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,383
Speaker 1: There's only one good WarioWare game.

210
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:31,489
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

211
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,630
Speaker 0: Wario what they call it the shake Wario shake, which is the business?

212
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,746
Speaker 1: It's a I don't even know the name of the of your favorite current game the game.

213
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,770
Speaker 1: You're currently playing.

214
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,416
Speaker 0: I'm not actually currently playing it.

215
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,370
Speaker 0: I'm semi currently playing it concurrently playing it with many other games.

216
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:53,866
Speaker 0: I'm playing natural selection Zelda 3 playing that.

217
00:12:53,886 --> 00:13:10,781
Speaker 1: yeah I've resolved not to because I've tried to replay that game like six times since I originally played it as a kid And I'll get about halfway through the dark world, and I'll just like Something will rise in my gut and suddenly I'll go god damn it never mind and just put the controller down and give up

218
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:11,824
Speaker 0: and playing some.

219
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:15,314
Speaker 0: you know that Tetris game I guess Tetris party.

220
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:18,385
Speaker 1: yeah, that's really not a single-player game though.

221
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,830
Speaker 0: It has single-player mode?

222
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,014
Speaker 1: I don't know.

223
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,462
Speaker 1: I'm done with playing Tetris by myself Tetris.

224
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:25,910
Speaker 0: That's why you suck at it cuz I don't practice.

225
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:29,447
Speaker 1: I know I know could I beat you in like almost all of those modes.

226
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,975
Speaker 1: We played Handily.

227
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,544
Speaker 0: no no you ruined us.

228
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:34,715
Speaker 0: in the co-op mode I noticed.

229
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,432
Speaker 0: and the modes you beat me and we're not Tetris II modes They were.

230
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:42,890
Speaker 0: you know racing required much higher level cortical input.

231
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:47,734
Speaker 0: Oh, oh the racing mode was so much better than the Father's me.

232
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:52,618
Speaker 1: about the racing mode Scott is that it was Trivial to be like it took.

233
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,370
Speaker 1: I could have beaten it with my eyes closed one hand.

234
00:13:55,682 --> 00:14:04,039
Speaker 0: Yeah the only the only reason you won is because at the start I was trying to figure out how it worked and you just held Down right away, and that's that tiny head start.

235
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:09,036
Speaker 0: I could not catch up because that's the one at the same speed realize That's the reason why I tend to.

236
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,606
Speaker 1: I have a record of when we get a new board game.

237
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:19,724
Speaker 1: I'll win like oh In the first instance of that game like 90% of the time But then I'll lose like the next four because I've in every game.

238
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,310
Speaker 1: I just hold down immediately.

239
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,310
Speaker 1: I don't care what the rule.

240
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,441
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna hold down because you'll probably win the first round that way.

241
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,850
Speaker 0: yeah, you're depth first that I'm breath first.

242
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:34,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if I only play every game ever once I'll be the undisputed champion of every game, and I'll retire.

243
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,141
Speaker 0: Well as long as you're playing as people have never played before.

244
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,190
Speaker 1: yeah, so you guys are doing breath first.

245
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:43,989
Speaker 1: Like you I have to play brand new games and only play them once.

246
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,073
Speaker 0: Right.

247
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:52,842
Speaker 1: all I have to say is I am excited about this that the video Gives me confidence more confidence than I would expect.

248
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:59,210
Speaker 1: and also I point out that One of the most played games on our we even today is Mike Tyson's punch-out.

249
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:04,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that punch-out the old NES one But it's good.

250
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:05,880
Speaker 0: the fact that it has a good control.

251
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,101
Speaker 0: with the you know as opposed to the uneven on the NES They game controlled very you know difficultly.

252
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:11,864
Speaker 1: It's just.

253
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:13,994
Speaker 1: it's a perfect Game like.

254
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:17,027
Speaker 1: it's the perfect implementation of that specific game like you.

255
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,975
Speaker 0: just pick it up I mean and put it down.

256
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:25,389
Speaker 1: you could have made a better game, but that game itself I don't think there's anything anyone could say is wrong with it.

257
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,227
Speaker 0: It doesn't have more guys.

258
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:33,586
Speaker 1: That's that's like saying that citizen the Australian guy because it should have been longer.

259
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:36,235
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, what do you have for me?

260
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:37,940
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not for you.

261
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:39,444
Speaker 0: Who says it's for you.

262
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:39,545
Speaker 1: Well.

263
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:41,310
Speaker 1: I want some news here.

264
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,434
Speaker 0: I mean, I got news.

265
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,381
Speaker 1: It's not seem so interested in my news.

266
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,043
Speaker 1: What do you got?

267
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:45,344

270
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:58,393
Speaker 0: no my mom's a lot older than 30. all right My mom was 30. that means she had me when she was 3 or 4.

271
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,582
Speaker 0: How about that?

272
00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:00,509
Speaker 1: there could be a time to?

273
00:16:01,532 --> 00:16:03,429
Speaker 0: Anyway, don't be talking about that.

274
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:11,196
Speaker 0: 30 years ago today in The MMO was bored.

275
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:14,166
Speaker 0: now a lot of people think oh, no they first time.

276
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,400
Speaker 0: Oh, you know ask some kid What was the first MMO?

277
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,610
Speaker 0: who'd be like EverQuest?

278
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,170
Speaker 0: Or maybe he'll say Asher ons call or maybe you'll be smart and say something like meridian 59.

279
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they say the realm.

280
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,086
Speaker 1: They're smart because that is the answer.

281
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:29,980
Speaker 1: that is the first Graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,110
Speaker 0: you know there were ones with graphics before the realm.

283
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,149
Speaker 0: I just weren't ready.

284
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:39,635
Speaker 0: The realm wasn't really 3D It was yeah, it was.

285
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,582
Speaker 0: it was you know a first-person perspective.

286
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:41,682
Speaker 0: Well.

287
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:42,344
Speaker 0: No it wasn't.

288
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:44,070
Speaker 0: no no meridian 59.

289
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,586
Speaker 1: Uh the realm was not a first-person was an ultimate online older than now.

290
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:50,750
Speaker 1: the realm was the first one.

291
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:53,101
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to go look that up anyway.

292
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:54,370
Speaker 1: the point is out of my shirt.

293
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,777
Speaker 1: Oh, don't debate me on this.

294
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,004
Speaker 0: debate you easily here.

295
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:57,486
Speaker 0: We go.

296
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:58,089
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

297
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:00,648
Speaker 0: I'm going to look right now mister.

298
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,964
Speaker 1: All right, so we got to kill air time.

299
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:10,941
Speaker 0: while you go to Wikipedia I see the realm came out five months before meridian 59. yes Which was in?

300
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:24,282
Speaker 0: Yes, hold on come on December 31st 1996. yes, Ultima online released Okay, 97.

301
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:25,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was that?

302
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:26,608
Speaker 1: What was that?

303
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:27,852
Speaker 1: What was that?

304
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:28,975
Speaker 1: Did I just win?

305
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,000
Speaker 1: the point is competitive tonight?

306
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:31,837
Speaker 0: Is that none of those?

307
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,774
Speaker 0: Those games are not the first mo MMOs.

308
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:47,437
Speaker 0: the first MMO was mud one at Essex as in Essex the college in Britain and that game came out in 1978 and all it was for.

309
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,229
Speaker 0: you know I don't think a lot of people out there know what muds are.

310
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:54,705
Speaker 0: you know they might have heard of muds and mud is a Multi-user dungeon basically the first mud.

311
00:17:55,126 --> 00:18:05,787
Speaker 0: they took the dungeon mode in zork right which is a basically text adventure game right and They just made it so that multiple people could move around in The dungeon at the same time.

312
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,536
Speaker 0: and the way it worked is.

313
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:08,280
Speaker 0: they'd be a server.

314
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:13,706
Speaker 0: you would tell that to the server and You know in your terminal right.

315
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,573
Speaker 0: so this one computer a pdp-11 or pdp-10.

316
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,220
Speaker 0: You know old ass you know digital machine.

317
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,708
Speaker 0: everyone on their terminal connects to the machine and You go around the dungeon.

318
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:31,680
Speaker 0: You know north east south kill rat kill rat Kill other guy and everyone else is also in the same place.

319
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,120
Speaker 0: So if you go into the same room that someone else happens to be in it says rim is here all right all right.

320
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,937
Speaker 1: So what's the difference between?

321
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,198
Speaker 1: massively multiplayer and multiplayer?

322
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:48,170
Speaker 1: there's a massively multiplayer and multiplayer because you can't just say you stateful stateless because you could have a Little a game like I don't.

323
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,635
Speaker 1: you can have any kind of game this multiplayer That's stateful, and you can meet each other in a. you could have a mod that only two people play.

324
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,588
Speaker 0: the difference is The number of players.

325
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:59,400
Speaker 0: you see in a multiplayer game something like counter-strike, right?

326
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,096
Speaker 0: You have many many many servers and each server has this limit of you know say 30 players.

327
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:11,954
Speaker 0: so even where tribes 2 Has a limit of 60 players or there's some other games out there I've seen some FPS is where the servers have a limit of a hundred something players.

328
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:12,416
Speaker 0: all right.

329
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:13,540
Speaker 0: It's not massive.

330
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:16,079
Speaker 0: What's massive is when the server takes?

331
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,531
Speaker 1: Infinity play, but modern MMOs don't do that.

332
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:22,804
Speaker 1: they break people up into separate servers Which is BS.

333
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:28,933
Speaker 0: back in the olden days you join a mud and just people could keep joining the mud and keep joining it Until the server crashed.

334
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,064
Speaker 1: well yeah And the realm was like that too early.

335
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:36,039
Speaker 1: MMOs were and they changed that because no hardware could scale to deal with it.

336
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that the real I could.

337
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:48,538
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about the technical solution to that which is obvious and has not yet been executed uh-huh, but Needless to say that the mud is 30 years old today.

338
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:57,583
Speaker 0: Everyone out there who's thinking about you know or who is now if you've only ever played say wow Or if you've never played any of these games There's still muds.

339
00:19:57,603 --> 00:20:00,154
Speaker 0: you can go to the mud connector and mud still exists.

340
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:01,700
Speaker 0: you can tell them that to them very easily.

341
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:03,749
Speaker 0: Don't become involved in muds.

342
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,340
Speaker 0: That's gonna waste a lot of your time like I wasted in high school.

343
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:20,091
Speaker 0: But go find a mud and explore it and see what it's like and learn and you will see how scarily similar the muds are to the WOWs out there and the Tabula Rasa's and all those other grindy games out there.

344
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,600
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the same exact game.

345
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,144
Speaker 1: Well, there's one difference.

346
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:29,784
Speaker 1: most muds that I hung around in the maximum level wasn't 60 or 70 or 100.

347
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,240
Speaker 1: It was like five thousand.

348
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:36,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it would take you like a year to get while level at some of the higher level.

349
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,734
Speaker 0: the worst part Right was that a lot of these muds.

350
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:45,240
Speaker 0: You would go around the mud and you would go and you would eventually be fighting the strongest bad guys in the game.

351
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,806
Speaker 0: It'd be no way to level up So strong.

352
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:53,340
Speaker 0: you would kill like the guards in town in one hit and then be like what the hell am I supposed to do?

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,164
Speaker 1: And they're okay.

354
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,292
Speaker 0: get any better equipments.

355
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,440
Speaker 1: I got to level 70.

356
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,635
Speaker 1: I could kill the king killer on the baddest ass in the game trivially.

357
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,960
Speaker 1: He gave me two experience.

358
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:03,919
Speaker 1: I needed a thousand to get up a level.

359
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:12,999
Speaker 0: All you could do right was make another character level up just as far and then have you two characters kill each other to get Experienced but when they died they lost experience.

360
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:15,607
Speaker 0: It was good times.

361
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:18,335
Speaker 1: now a quick quiz because you know muds weren't the only thing.

362
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:24,093
Speaker 1: there was this whole, you know back when Avatars and shared spaces were kind of the thing on the internet.

363
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:24,995
Speaker 1: There were just muds.

364
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,500
Speaker 1: There were mucks mushes moves.

365
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:30,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, well those came later the mucks mushes and the moves quick.

366
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:31,157
Speaker 1: What's a move?

367
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:34,863
Speaker 0: It's a Multi user.

368
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,012
Speaker 0: object oriented is just object oriented.

369
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:38,674
Speaker 0: That's what I mean.

370
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:44,787
Speaker 1: Usually people call them moo, duh Because dungeon or whatever at the end But basically that would.

371
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:45,632
Speaker 1: those were like people.

372
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:49,974
Speaker 1: programmers would hang out and code Like rooms or code things like.

373
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:51,240
Speaker 1: everything was object oriented.

374
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,087
Speaker 1: That's that's the best way I'd explain it.

375
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:56,420
Speaker 1: and mushes were like a role-playing and I was no no moves.

376
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:58,084
Speaker 0: It didn't stand for a multi-user.

377
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:00,511
Speaker 0: It stood for mud object oriented.

378
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:01,233
Speaker 1: that made sense.

379
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:09,077
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you remember the original, you know Muds were written, you know is written for like this old crappy mainframe computer.

380
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:11,779
Speaker 0: Well, not crappy You know, the pdp-10 is not a piece of crap.

381
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:24,680
Speaker 0: Well, at least it wasn't in the day, but you know when object oriented programming came around with object oriented programming You know the having a text adventure built on that type of probe made a lot easier to make a dungeon.

382
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:27,720
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of it sort of fits, you know with all these objects in it.

383
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:35,647
Speaker 0: If you ever played a game like, you know gemstone 3 on AOL or whatever you could really tell.

384
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,642
Speaker 0: you know with all the different crazy stuff going that you can make custom items and stuff like That.

385
00:22:39,682 --> 00:22:48,076
Speaker 0: and that was you know, those sorts of features were easy for the people to program into the game because they were using an object oriented programming language.

386
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:55,764
Speaker 1: and I forget the exact Difference between a mush and a muck, but I think they were the ones where there were no rules and role players would go Role-playing.

387
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:56,748
Speaker 1: usually they were scared.

388
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:03,652
Speaker 0: Well mushes are more like social kind of things Right where there's supposed to be role-playing going on, I guess theoretically.

389
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:08,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I mean, I'm not gonna look it up It's like multi-user shared something.

390
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,745
Speaker 0: Yeah and most I think it was social something.

391
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:16,825
Speaker 0: and I think muck was chat Kingdom and I don't I don't remember the point of what Those are supposed to be.

392
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:17,869
Speaker 0: I just remember his check.

393
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:18,934
Speaker 1: It was for people who was.

394
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:20,360
Speaker 0: I thought the chat Kingdom was cool.

395
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:24,333
Speaker 1: Maybe they were just too cool for IRC or IRC was too cool for them.

396
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,540
Speaker 1: I it's hard to tell which yeah.

397
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:35,100
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you don't know about muds and I think a lot of people out there don't you really should to understand You know gaming history and internet history properly.

398
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:39,999
Speaker 0: You should really investigate them and you know poke at a few to see what the deal is.

399
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,973
Speaker 0: I still would say now on the 30th anniversary.

400
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:48,700
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call them MMOs because that word has really come to mean something pretty specific nowadays.

401
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,679
Speaker 1: Well, MMO RPG means something very specific nowadays, and I really would say that well I do.

402
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:53,880
Speaker 1: writing.

403
00:23:54,321 --> 00:24:02,500
Speaker 1: I would say that from the realm to today is the same era of massively multiplayer games and everything before that Was this entirely different era?

404
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,843
Speaker 0: I do agree that it's sort of.

405
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,535
Speaker 0: it's a different thing now because it's you know, graphical but really not.

406
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:11,147
Speaker 0: the underlying game Is the exact same thing.

407
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:13,054
Speaker 0: this it's so it's only it's.

408
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:15,468
Speaker 0: it's so the exact same thing But it's the same.

409
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:24,308
Speaker 1: look at all like people say You know first gen platformer second gen platformers or like the NES days the SNES days The fundamental concepts of the games are the same.

410
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,540
Speaker 1: all that's changed is the technology the presentation, you know all those sorts of things.

411
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,930
Speaker 1: No, I do things were made possible by technology.

412
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:34,199
Speaker 1: It's just the NES era the SNES era.

413
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,377
Speaker 0: The thing is when you look at something like say compare Super Mario Brothers to Mario 64, right?

414
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:41,829
Speaker 0: You know, it's still a platformer.

415
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,399
Speaker 0: It's still jump on the bad guy, etc.

416
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:48,900
Speaker 0: But the 3d me the 3d ness of it like was game-changing.

417
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:56,767
Speaker 0: The graphics, you know added to the to the mud to make the end, you know, the modern MMORPG Didn't really change.

418
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:57,834
Speaker 0: the game is the same game.

419
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:01,208
Speaker 0: We just look at it I think instead of typing see there's something.

420
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:04,699
Speaker 1: the complexity has gone to the point where I would call it a different game.

421
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:08,427
Speaker 1: just because The interface allows so much more The interface allows less.

422
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:21,371
Speaker 1: a text-based interface is the most flexible of all Interfaces except for the fact that the the vast majority of mods you could type up down left right kill Equip unequip like it was still very rigid.

423
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:29,140
Speaker 1: And in fact the fact that it was text-based Prevented most people from playing it like in terms of who played why they played how they played.

424
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:30,906
Speaker 1: Everything is completely different now.

425
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,335
Speaker 1: different kinds of people play for completely different reasons.

426
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:33,756
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

427
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:34,720
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

428
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:39,780
Speaker 1: I just I feel like it's really worth it to use the terms to differentiate between these two eras.

429
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know if those terms are right.

430
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,706
Speaker 0: Well that definitely should be.

431
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,478
Speaker 0: you know a way to differentiate between the two.

432
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,524
Speaker 1: say this Those terms are.

433
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,279
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say this the terms are right and I say they're right because that's how everyone in the world uses them.

434
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, people there's a you know, there are so many.

435
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,589
Speaker 1: Are you advocating prescriptive language?

436
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:03,535
Speaker 1: No, that's what's happening here.

437
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:04,860
Speaker 0: No, where you go with it?

438
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:26,885
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that there are so many instances in the in the world and especially in the English world and especially on the internet of All sorts of terms being used in literal and non literal and wrong and right and backwards and sideways meanings that I'm really just getting tired of the whole thing and we should just pretty much whatever people using terms weirdly or wrongly Just go out whatever fuck it.

439
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:30,640
Speaker 1: Why so so then I'm right and that's how those terms are.

440
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,533
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying is that there is no right.

441
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:33,520
Speaker 0: just let it be whatever.

442
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:35,904
Speaker 1: Yes, there is no right.

443
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:44,328
Speaker 1: the meaning of language is determined by the users and the users determine collectively that MMO basically means something different from mud.

444
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,715
Speaker 1: Well, so says you RPG.

445
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:48,300
Speaker 1: I think most people will agree.

446
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,451
Speaker 1: I call them two separate arrows.

447
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,118
Speaker 1: We'll leave it at that.

448
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,288
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day.

449
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:14,168
Speaker 1: so Emily showed this to us a long time ago and it's so well executed that I've kind of been just saving it for the day when I would use it as a thing of the Day, and I kind of forgot about it And then I remembered it added it back to my delicious and then I thought hey Didn't I already use this?

450
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:14,994
Speaker 1: I couldn't find it.

451
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:17,945
Speaker 1: So Boot to the head Phoenix, right?

452
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:19,910
Speaker 1: I find this hilarious.

453
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,875
Speaker 1: It's utterly well executed.

454
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:22,657
Speaker 1: I'll leave it at that.

455
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:27,973
Speaker 0: Oh I also have a a Phoenix, right if you will really perhaps.

456
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:28,936
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

457
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,963
Speaker 0: Wait, the site has other things All right.

458
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,672
Speaker 1: Well, you can save those for another day.

459
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,980
Speaker 0: I don't know if I can.

460
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:35,627
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll have to.

461
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,175
Speaker 1: so what's this thing of the day?

462
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:42,959
Speaker 0: Um So, you know, I guess people on Wednesday shows would be more familiar.

463
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,280
Speaker 0: Of course I think most people listen to all our shows or whatever.

464
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:55,360
Speaker 0: You know in Japan, they have the garage kits and basically the idea of a garage kit Is that some super nerd like the nerdiest of all nerdy otaku in the universe?

465
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,670
Speaker 0: Makes their own toy or their own figurine or whatever it is.

466
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,380
Speaker 1: Well their own partially nude semi erotic figurine, right?

467
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:09,932
Speaker 1: Most of the time partially needs Half the time the other times the robots the other half the time.

468
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:12,338
Speaker 1: It's a robot or a mecha most likely.

469
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:22,118
Speaker 0: Yes But As a result in Japan, they also just make really high quality toys You know mostly because you got to be able to compete with the garage.

470
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:33,306
Speaker 0: kids here are four amazing-looking at least as far as I'm concerned Phoenix Wright figures and There's an Emma sky.

471
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:39,037
Speaker 0: I think I gotta be gotta be sending some monies It's.

472
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:43,059
Speaker 0: But actually if you look around on the side of this site, I didn't notice.

473
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,927
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of other figures.

474
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:53,954
Speaker 0: I did not notice previously to just two seconds ago including a Lupin and G again in spacesuits.

475
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:54,658
Speaker 1: Oh snap.

476
00:28:54,678 --> 00:29:05,019
Speaker 0: All right I'll just check this space helmets and show and and possibly the best has any Miku figure I've ever seen I might have to send even more money across the ocean.

477
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:10,079
Speaker 0: Anyway Phoenix Wright toys that if you're a Phoenix Wright fan, you'll want the end.

478
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:22,095
Speaker 1: So up, there's a company a video game company called introversion software And if you're not familiar with funny how we're we're not really introverted Huh, huh.

479
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,164
Speaker 1: So, how would that be funny?

480
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:28,054
Speaker 0: We're talking about introversion, but we're all extroverted.

481
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:31,691
Speaker 1: That's that's like saying huh funny You're talking about apples.

482
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:32,520
Speaker 1: You're not an apple.

483
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,267
Speaker 0: No, it's more like funny.

484
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,311
Speaker 0: you're talking about apples.

485
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:37,014
Speaker 0: you're an orange.

486
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:38,480
Speaker 1: that's not any.

487
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:44,848
Speaker 1: Doesn't work anyway If you don't know who they are.

488
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,940
Speaker 1: and I'll admit that I didn't for the longest time.

489
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,895
Speaker 1: But Darwinia Defcon uplink multi winnia all made by the same company.

490
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:58,091
Speaker 0: right way back in the day I don't know not too far back in the day There was a game called uplink and uplink is a pretty cool game.

491
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:04,113
Speaker 0: because if you ever watch a movie right movie like hackers Or something right or what was that the net remember that movie?

492
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:05,498
Speaker 1: Ah, man the net.

493
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,240
Speaker 1: that movie Was very rare.

494
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,559
Speaker 0: It was like some hacks and Wolfenstein 3d in the beginning or something like that.

495
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,824
Speaker 1: That game was very.

496
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:17,400
Speaker 1: that movie was very reminiscent of the time period from which it was wrong indeed.

497
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:23,680
Speaker 0: But you ever watch a movie like that and the hacking in the movie doesn't look anything like real hacking.

498
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,254
Speaker 0: You know at least in that one matrix movie like the hacking was.

499
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:40,980
Speaker 0: she did like this You know sort of frequently, you know, well-known SSH crack and it was just a terminal and someone you know Executing a program and that at least was semi real even though it didn't match what they said they were doing.

500
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:49,200
Speaker 0: But you know movie hacking it looks like you're like, you know fucking War games or whatever, you know, it's oh it's a map of the world.

501
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,460
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of lines going across it and you know, someone's tracing you.

502
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,508
Speaker 1: Oh, man war games was actually very realistic in attacking though somewhat somewhat More so than hackers in the net.

503
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:01,796
Speaker 1: at least hackers was what we wish.

504
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,060
Speaker 1: hacking was like hackers.

505
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:06,250
Speaker 1: Hackers is to hacking and computer science.

506
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,020
Speaker 1: What's the craft was to Wicca, right?

507
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:13,339
Speaker 0: so uplink was a game that sort of simulated that.

508
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:22,980
Speaker 0: You know movie hacking like you play it and you're a hacker But you feel like you're a movie hacker because it looks like movie hacking and it's like all vans.

509
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,347
Speaker 0: The game was pretty cool and that game sort of made this company, you know some money and it made them You know popular and well-known.

510
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,000
Speaker 0: it took this indie game company and there was still indie.

511
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,340
Speaker 0: They never didn't make it big, but they made it a little better than the bottom rungs.

512
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:46,473
Speaker 0: They were able to keep going and keep rocking and they made I think the next game was I've never actually played Darwinia.

513
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:53,468
Speaker 0: Darwinia is like a single-player RTS kind of game, you know, it's like.

514
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:55,674
Speaker 1: well, basically I do know this much.

515
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:56,376
Speaker 1: Here's the history.

516
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:57,660
Speaker 1: Darwinia came out.

517
00:31:57,861 --> 00:32:01,040
Speaker 1: Everyone said wow, that would have been a great game if it had multiplayer.

518
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,341
Speaker 1: Well,

519
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:17,500
Speaker 0: it was originally intended to be a multiplayer game, but I guess the technology or whatever at the time prevented them from making it multiplayer it had to be you know, and they ended up just Taking what they did and making the single-player game because that's all they could pull off and around that time.

520
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:26,640
Speaker 0: They also, you know managed to partner up with valve and steam and they got the distribution You know more prominent and whatnot as opposed to just sort of try to sell it out on their website.

521
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,460
Speaker 0: You know uplink was real slow to catch on and sort of bubbled up from underneath, you know.

522
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,753
Speaker 0: But as soon as they you know valve steam came around it was like aha.

523
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:35,596
Speaker 0: Here's those guys.

524
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:38,669
Speaker 1: There they are But we're not gonna talk about all their other games.

525
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:47,418
Speaker 1: I don't really want to talk a lot about the company though some of that will be unavoidable at the end of this because There's kind of a sad tale to multi-winia.

526
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:57,636
Speaker 1: but multi-winia basically Scott played the demo and then he bought it and I basically Based on what I had heard from everyone else bought the game sight unseen.

527
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,697
Speaker 1: I just assumed All right, this game is gonna be great and I just bought it.

528
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:06,800
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, Darwinia was this, you know when I played Darwinia, it was basically I was a little air with the controls.

529
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:07,563
Speaker 0: I mean I played.

530
00:33:07,623 --> 00:33:11,980
Speaker 0: actually a really early versions are winning had like these mouse gestures and weird crap going on and whatnot.

531
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,270
Speaker 0: But it was a game that it was like an RTS.

532
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:17,196
Speaker 0: but it wasn't an RTS, you know.

533
00:33:17,237 --> 00:33:20,399
Speaker 0: instead of you know It's like controlling individual guys.

534
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:26,383
Speaker 0: You sort of had these Darwinians everywhere and you controlled sort of their flow, you know You had.

535
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:31,680
Speaker 0: you would upgrade Darwinians to be like, okay You're now a commander and he would you know say everyone go over there.

536
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,598
Speaker 0: so any Darwinians that were near him would do what he said to do.

537
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:41,000
Speaker 0: and You know, you could do certain things like drop bombs here or send an engineer over there and that sort of thing.

538
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,191
Speaker 0: But but you know, it solved all the problems I had with.

539
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:53,996
Speaker 0: RTS is of the past which was you know really fiddly controls of manipulating lots and lots of tiny things and making it difficult to actually execute a strategy of any sort.

540
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:59,940
Speaker 1: because I've been really I Mean, I love the idea of RTS and I love strategic combat and yeah, it's like it.

541
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:04,137
Speaker 0: It's like a turn-based, you know strategy game a war game, but it's in real time.

542
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,746
Speaker 0: So it's not slow You don't sit there forever and ever and ever.

543
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,793
Speaker 1: I beat both sides of command and conquer.

544
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:12,465
Speaker 1: and yet I really in retrospect Like I kept trying to tell myself.

545
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,067
Speaker 1: This is great.

546
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:13,949
Speaker 1: This is great.

547
00:34:14,472 --> 00:34:16,699
Speaker 1: But honestly, I hated every minute of it.

548
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,079
Speaker 1: It was just a it was absolutely unfun and I hated it.

549
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,949
Speaker 1: I absolutely hated it and I hate most RTS.

550
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:23,973
Speaker 1: is to be perfectly honest.

551
00:34:24,254 --> 00:34:25,358
Speaker 0: I don't hate RTS.

552
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:25,980
Speaker 0: This is weird.

553
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,458
Speaker 0: It's like I actually like them.

554
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:40,600
Speaker 0: The problem is is that whenever I play multiplayer say multiplayer Starcraft, right or even just skirmish spacecraft I pick a map and it's one-on-one, you know me against the computer on the easiest or normal mode, right?

555
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:43,007
Speaker 0: And it's not the campaign to the campaign.

556
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,252
Speaker 0: I can actually get pretty far.

557
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,480
Speaker 0: It's in the you know, just regular battle mode.

558
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, you both start with you know, the one unit and you go for it.

559
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,683
Speaker 0: I Just they.

560
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:53,232
Speaker 0: they kill me every single time.

561
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:55,540
Speaker 0: I can't even get anywhere I just get crushed.

562
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,804
Speaker 0: Well see and I can't.

563
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:03,693
Speaker 0: it's like you have to memorize the exact right order to build the things in and click quickly enough to Build them without wasting any time.

564
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:10,317
Speaker 0: and then you know And the end goal is pretty much build the biggest bestest units as many as you can.

565
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:11,280
Speaker 0: not necessarily.

566
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:14,993
Speaker 1: sometimes it's build a lot of small weak units and send them at your opponent's

567
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:24,660
Speaker 0: if you're the Zerg or you know, but You build whatever it is You're supposed to build and then send it at the enemy and then you win or you might have to do it again.

568
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,699
Speaker 0: You know, it's not it's not a lot of complexity going on there.

569
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:42,100
Speaker 1: The reason I guess I said I hate RTS is that every time I play one I envision strategy I envision, you know I'll send this unit to the north on a scouting expedition to Skirmish and see if there are any bad guys in those woods so I can get those resources.

570
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:49,041
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I want an actual skirmish line here and I want like I have all these supply lines and strategies and I think all this out.

571
00:35:49,061 --> 00:36:09,020
Speaker 1: but then the game either by interface or by design or by just anything about it Will not actually let me play that kind of game and not playing a very different kind of game Where the strategies usually boil down very quickly to either as Scott said clicking quickly or Memorizing a pattern or there's usually a very small number of specific ways to win.

572
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,079
Speaker 0: Yeah that like for example in Warcraft 3 right for any.

573
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:15,040
Speaker 0: My brother played that a lot and he was actually pretty good at it.

574
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,255
Speaker 0: And the thing is basically the idea that game was number one.

575
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,320
Speaker 0: you manage this heroes.

576
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,538
Speaker 0: He had to play this little hero game while you played the.

577
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,560
Speaker 0: you know The regular RTS and basically the goal is to level up the hero because he only had one and not let him die.

578
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:33,480
Speaker 0: All right, the other part of the game was you know build up and you pretty much picked one units.

579
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,930
Speaker 0: Like if you were the orcs say right you could go.

580
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:38,019
Speaker 0: I don't remember the specifics of I'm wrong shoot me.

581
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:42,260
Speaker 0: You could go for like the Torrens or say the dragons, right?

582
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,993
Speaker 0: So the orcs had like, you know, three or four big units to choose from.

583
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:47,960
Speaker 0: she would go for one of those.

584
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:54,340
Speaker 0: So they're actually like four different patterns to choose from but it was more of a rock-paper-scissors kind of thing.

585
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,920
Speaker 0: You know if the other guy picked this thing then it was better for you to pick dragons.

586
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:06,429
Speaker 0: But you have to go and find out and if you spent the time to go and find out you would fall behind in the Race to get you know, your guys built fast enough and whatnot.

587
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:10,460
Speaker 0: and it wasn't really a game of military strategy or anything like that.

588
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,359
Speaker 0: it was a game of remember one of the patterns.

589
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,131
Speaker 0: Execute the pattern that you remembered.

590
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:17,560
Speaker 0: do it as quickly as possible.

591
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:18,544
Speaker 0: Don't let the hero die.

592
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:19,186
Speaker 0: level up the hero.

593
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:19,447
Speaker 0: the end.

594
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:19,688
Speaker 0: but

595
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:34,919
Speaker 1: thus why I always ended up hating RTS is I'd play them Much like when I played WarioWare for the Wii and the whole time I would think This could be so much better than it is and could be so much more than it is and I'd always think about the game I want to be playing.

596
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:37,690
Speaker 1: Realize that the game I was playing was not that game.

597
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:41,705
Speaker 1: turn it off and go play weapons factory Yeah, or counter-strike.

598
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:45,400
Speaker 0: Well, I think the one problem in the of wanting the RTS that you want.

599
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,609
Speaker 0: I also want the RTS that you want, right?

600
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:50,280
Speaker 1: I actually wrote something in high school.

601
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,909
Speaker 1: Oh, it's probably on that stupid hard drive I have that's crashed.

602
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:55,860
Speaker 1: that also has the eight people monologue.

603
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:57,993
Speaker 1: uh-huh, but I wrote this long thing.

604
00:37:58,033 --> 00:37:58,858
Speaker 1: that was basically.

605
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:07,450
Speaker 1: I Set forth all the precursors that would need to exist technologically and programmatically To allow the kind of RTS I want to.

606
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,413
Speaker 0: yeah, I think the bait.

607
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:10,220
Speaker 0: think about right what it takes to do.

608
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:20,709
Speaker 0: You know the real military, you know in real time you have these, you know hierarchy of command, you know One person gives a very generic command but another person breaks it down another person breaks it down.

609
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:23,918
Speaker 0: eventually you have like this squad commander who breaks it down into.

610
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:29,600
Speaker 0: you walk That way you walk that way, you know, I need that whole structure and so an art.

611
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:41,460
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to make a game where you are at the top But yet are you know doing the work of this entire chain of command in real time a turn-based games?

612
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,800
Speaker 0: You can pull it off because you have all the time in the world in a real time game.

613
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:55,569
Speaker 0: It's sort of impossible without incredibly advanced AI or well a whole bunch of physical human players all on the same team all taking money.

614
00:38:55,589 --> 00:39:08,238
Speaker 1: you say that because I had a ten-point list of these are the ten things that must Exist and I remember that I wrote better AI Nine times and most of the paper was talking about all the reasons you need AI to have a true RTS.

615
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:15,620
Speaker 1: exactly I think that multi-winnier I was about to say we should stop talking about RTS is the thing that multi-winnier gets, right?

616
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,247
Speaker 0: Is much like Darwinia.

617
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,000
Speaker 0: You don't control the individual units.

618
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:26,360
Speaker 0: You control very few units who are sort of like you're at the top of the hierarchy of military command.

619
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:50,180
Speaker 0: You command these big Darwinian guys, you know And you have a few other commands you can do and the actual the troops just sort of do what the few big guys You know are commanding them to do and thus you can actually you know control a bigger Your mass of forces in a complex and more strategic way and it's not perfect we're gonna get to that.

620
00:39:50,360 --> 00:40:07,010
Speaker 1: It's kind of like you can set up all your like flows of guys and units and stuff and then you zoom out Watch the situation watch what the other guys doing and then react accordingly like ah I should direct more guys to that Eastern Front because he's really laying it on there or There's a crate over there and I see him going toward it.

621
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,979
Speaker 1: I better send a formation that way to stop him exactly.

622
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:13,849
Speaker 1: and I really wanted to like multi-winnier.

623
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,239
Speaker 1: Like I when I start played through the demo.

624
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,909
Speaker 1: and if Here's where this sad tale really begins.

625
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,056
Speaker 1: I bought multi-winnier installed it.

626
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,280
Speaker 1: I heard great things.

627
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,300
Speaker 0: Well, the sad tale begins with the fact that they were selling multi-winnier right in a pack 20 bucks.

628
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,029
Speaker 0: You get multi-winnier and Darwinian.

629
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:35,580
Speaker 0: I already owned Darwinia now when Valve sold us the orange box and I bought it, right?

630
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:46,181
Speaker 0: I already owned most of the games in it except for portal and tf2 and Half-life episode 2. so they gave me a free copy of half-life 2 and a free copy of half-life episode 1 to give to someone Else.

631
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,990
Speaker 0: now rim did not own Darwinian and I did so.

632
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:56,980
Speaker 0: I thought that by buying the pack with Darwinian and multi-winnier for 20 Bucks, I'd get a free copy of Darwinian and be able to give it to somebody, right?

633
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,803
Speaker 0: No such luck.

634
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:02,720
Speaker 0: I basically have paid for Dart Darwinia twice and only gotten it once.

635
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,586
Speaker 0: That was the beginning of the badness.

636
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:09,344
Speaker 1: now for me the beginning was I install it I Go to the menu.

637
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,409
Speaker 1: I look around.

638
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:19,097
Speaker 1: I spent 10 minutes Trying to find the menu to change my controls and I kept thinking it's got to be here.

639
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:20,140
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm stupid.

640
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta find.

641
00:41:21,504 --> 00:41:36,080
Speaker 0: and normally, you know changing controls and an RTS isn't a big deal because it's you know Just move the mouse around and click on things and sort of a two-dimensional plane and then you know They're you know hotkeys for some shortcuts that not too many people change.

642
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:38,232
Speaker 0: I guess some people change them but not that I.

643
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,600
Speaker 1: you know, I don't know this game.

644
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:40,984
Speaker 1: You basically have your three.

645
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:46,300
Speaker 1: that your two-dimensional movement, you know strafing and moving forward and back and they're hard-coded to WASD.

646
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:56,167
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz it's it's a 3d game and You're most of the controls are camera control, you know turn rotate I will say one zoom in zooming out.

647
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:59,099
Speaker 1: There is no reason for this game to actually be 3d.

648
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,987
Speaker 0: The 3d really isn't.

649
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:05,479
Speaker 0: for the game to be 3d is because of the terrain going.

650
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,300
Speaker 0: You know having highs and lows and the guy, you know moving up a hill and moving down a hill.

651
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:16,773
Speaker 1: That's the reason for the game to be yeah But at the same time you could have had the same effect with the game that was More two-dimensional and thus easier to control and easier to see.

652
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:18,078
Speaker 1: but I digress that's true.

653
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:21,008
Speaker 1: So Alright, I have to use WASD now.

654
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,860
Speaker 1: I've never used WASD like in my entire life.

655
00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,400
Speaker 1: I use completely different sets of control.

656
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,518
Speaker 0: I never used WASD either until I get the happy I can keyboard that I just forced myself to use it.

657
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:30,565
Speaker 0: cuz I said You know what?

658
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:35,110
Speaker 0: You know, I won't have Big arrows like I did in my previous keyboards.

659
00:42:35,572 --> 00:42:37,440
Speaker 0: every game uses WASD by default.

660
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:43,044
Speaker 0: I'll just get used to it even though I hate it and then it'll be real easy to play every game And it's paid off.

661
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:44,711
Speaker 0: I'm kind of I can understand.

662
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:51,580
Speaker 0: if I'd never bought the happy hacking keyboard I'll be right there with rim rim bitching and moaning that it's forces you to use WASD.

663
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:55,600
Speaker 1: I kind of could be okay with WASD except for the fact that W is way off to the left.

664
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,207
Speaker 0: That's that was my problem too.

665
00:42:57,247 --> 00:42:58,231
Speaker 0: That's why I never liked it.

666
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:00,180
Speaker 0: I just forced myself to get used to that.

667
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:02,300
Speaker 1: I just made sure nothing was bound to ease.

668
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,811
Speaker 1: So when I hit E and W at the same time, it didn't cause a problem.

669
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:06,920
Speaker 1: But alright, I can deal with that.

670
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:07,694
Speaker 1: I'll live with that.

671
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,020
Speaker 1: Mouse isn't inverted and that that is much more crippling than I would have expected.

672
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:20,562
Speaker 0: Yeah there I mean I don't use the inverted Mouse unless I'm in a vehicle of some sort usually a flying vehicle and then I must have an inverted Mouse.

673
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:25,120
Speaker 0: but I can understand if someone wants an inverted Mouse in their 3d games and they don't got it.

674
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:32,960
Speaker 1: It seems like I mean a lot of people most new FPSers definitely use the non inverted Mouse and a lot of old FPSers use the inverted Mouse.

675
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,220
Speaker 1: But it looks like it's 50/50 or at least 60/40 in favor of non inverted.

676
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:47,800
Speaker 1: But a lot of people use an inverted Mouse and I remember at PAX we were playing a demo of some you know tribes like game and Of the like 20 people standing around playing there were like 10.

677
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Speaker 1: Well there were more like 8 people gaga who couldn't play because it was not inverted and they couldn't figure out how to make it inverted.

678
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:57,467
Speaker 1: But this game I can't invert it.

679
00:43:57,547 --> 00:44:07,660
Speaker 1: so between the WASD and the fact that I can't invert I really can't play the game because all my muscle memory causes me to always zoom.

680
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:15,455
Speaker 1: I'm okay when I'm like you know standing up the game in the beginning But as soon as I need to be reacting quickly I just cannot control the game at all.

681
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:19,239
Speaker 0: like I can't play multi-winia Yeah, I am able to play it.

682
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,897
Speaker 0: You know I sort of got used even though there are other problems in the controls that I have issue with.

683
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,570
Speaker 0: you know Like it sometimes you can't select the guys you want exactly.

684
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:35,000
Speaker 0: and you know sometimes like it's you'll you'll tell a guy to go in One direction, and he sort of takes a different path.

685
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:51,898
Speaker 0: And you know sometimes you'll tell it's hard to get the guys to make Formations sometimes because the way to make a formation is to click on a guy then click right next to him But if there's something else right next to him you might click on that and you can't always get the formation exactly the way you want it Yeah, and you can't tell the guys to strafe.

686
00:44:52,220 --> 00:45:01,226
Speaker 0: It's like if you want a formation in a particular place facing a certain direction You might actually have to tell him to walk one way then rotate now Then walk another way.

687
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:07,240
Speaker 1: that I agree with because that is though That is the element of the formations that causes them to be so strategic.

688
00:45:07,863 --> 00:45:11,480
Speaker 1: Those are the kinds of concerns that formation fighting has had since the dawn.

689
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:15,170
Speaker 0: I mean phalanx but a form but a formation of dudes.

690
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:18,499
Speaker 0: you could order them in practice and have them all walk, right?

691
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,048
Speaker 1: Depending on the formation maybe not.

692
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,974
Speaker 1: there were a lot of formations that couldn't.

693
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:37,067
Speaker 1: also without that restriction Formations become an order of magnitude more powerful because of the way they're implemented And it really removes one of the few really strategic things in that book one of the few really Tactical things in that game.

694
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:39,497
Speaker 1: the formations being the way they are I think is perfect.

695
00:45:39,979 --> 00:46:01,128
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's just sometimes, you know what you want to execute you can't do and the only other you know complaint in that of that variety that I have is that sometimes like I'll tell a Formation to move and like I'll say formation move like, you know just forward a little bit right and the guy like starts spinning around in his circle and then all the guys a bunch up and It doesn't you know, it's like come on.

696
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:01,932
Speaker 0: This is simple guys.

697
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:03,360
Speaker 0: All right, it just messes up.

698
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,200
Speaker 0: Sometimes sometimes they'll walk into a wall, you know, come on all RTS is walking in the walls.

699
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,846
Speaker 0: I thought we figured that one out at least.

700
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:13,016
Speaker 1: Oh, you know how many men I lost to my own harvesters.

701
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,150
Speaker 1: But anyway, so This is not the problem.

702
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,460
Speaker 1: I mean, these are minor things.

703
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:21,960
Speaker 1: I could even overlook the control thing because the game is what is otherwise good.

704
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,052
Speaker 1: But if you go online right now, you know, you just you have multi.

705
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:36,693
Speaker 1: when you buy it and you say hey I want to play a game with someone and you click on you know servers and you look There is currently one Game of multi when you're going on and it is full.

706
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,220
Speaker 0: Wow one.

707
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:42,320
Speaker 1: There are two other games, but they say beta test and it doesn't look like I can join them.

708
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:43,085
Speaker 1: They're also.

709
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:44,718
Speaker 1: they only have one person in each of them.

710
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of sad.

711
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,859
Speaker 1: No, I can't join them.

712
00:46:49,642 --> 00:47:01,732
Speaker 0: I mean when the game first came out right there were looked like there were a whole bunch of games going on online but really there was a bug that made single-player games show up online and So it looked like there was a lot of games being played.

713
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:07,573
Speaker 0: after they fixed that bug It was sort of barren and not only that but the multiplayer.

714
00:47:07,633 --> 00:47:09,339
Speaker 0: a lot of it just didn't work.

715
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:18,600
Speaker 1: now reports vary but The agreement seems to be that for the first couple days after multi when he was released a lot of people just couldn't play online.

716
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,217
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when Def Con came out Right that also had a lot of problems where it just the multiplayer didn't work.

717
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:37,950
Speaker 0: a lot of times He said connecting one two three and the mistake they made is that you know If you play so look if you want to play something like half-life 2 right someone else set up a server somewhere and everyone connects To it and plays.

718
00:47:38,112 --> 00:47:43,058
Speaker 0: hooray If you want to play, you know, if you try to set up your own half-life server It's a pain in the ass.

719
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,323
Speaker 0: You set up your port forwarding on your router and you got to get a static IP and all the other, you know It's a pain.

720
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:49,309
Speaker 0: It's not it's not easy.

721
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:54,628
Speaker 0: It didn't know about networking at least somewhat Darwinian multi when it being PC games.

722
00:47:54,909 --> 00:48:08,180
Speaker 0: in the modern era where pretty much everyone has a NAT router Alright, and all the NAT routers are different You when you want to play multiplayer you either join which means directly connect to someone else's computer or someone directly connects to you.

723
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:10,148
Speaker 0: The solution to this is do it.

724
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:11,233
Speaker 0: Skype does right.

725
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:12,680
Speaker 0: Skype also has this problem.

726
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:16,898
Speaker 0: The way Skype solved it is they have an intermediary server that does some net busting.

727
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,826
Speaker 0: They did not provide this.

728
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:26,899
Speaker 0: thus you're trying to connect directly connect your computer or Directly host on your computer a server for other people to connect you on the internet.

729
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:31,620
Speaker 0: It's a mess of the port forwarding and the routing and all this network stuff and it they work.

730
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:37,593
Speaker 1: The thing is it worked for a lot of people but it didn't work for everyone and it didn't work for enough people.

731
00:48:37,693 --> 00:48:46,000
Speaker 1: early on to where there was a lot of Bad taste in the mouth of the internet and we only we tried to play a LAN game and it didn't work.

732
00:48:47,043 --> 00:48:48,408
Speaker 0: And we know what we're doing now.

733
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:50,536
Speaker 1: luckily it didn't work and it didn't work.

734
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:52,965
Speaker 1: and then the next day it worked We finally got it to work.

735
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:56,940
Speaker 0: It was, you know, huge pain, but even then just I don't know.

736
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,612
Speaker 1: I feel like the game had such potential.

737
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:01,260
Speaker 1: and I talked more about the game.

738
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:15,160
Speaker 1: You know, I play all the different modes and the game's really fun and I'd like to play it but I think I'm only gonna be playing it with front row crew people or Scott or Alex or people like that because No one's playing it online and the game is basically dead.

739
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:19,661
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's a problem we could talk about a little bit and then I'll talk about the game modes and whatnot And that'll be.

740
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:24,760
Speaker 0: it is that multi, you know online games sort of have this momentum problem, right?

741
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:32,980
Speaker 0: Where if no one is playing the game online No one else will start playing the game because no one's online and you can see this.

742
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,880
Speaker 0: For example, if you look at you know natural selection, right?

743
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:43,671
Speaker 0: If you go look at the list of natural selection servers at any given moment in time Every server will either be empty right

744
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:44,393
Speaker 1: or

745
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:51,840
Speaker 0: it will have a bunch of bots All right, and maybe someone's playing with the bots but not you really or it'll be crazy full and crowded.

746
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,115
Speaker 0: And the thing is no one wants to join the server.

747
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,100
Speaker 0: That's zero.

748
00:49:56,921 --> 00:50:05,520
Speaker 0: everyone wants to join in where there's other people already playing and Thus if no one's playing you have this catch-22 of no one's going to play.

749
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:08,099
Speaker 0: No one's going to start a server if there aren't any out there.

750
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:14,960
Speaker 0: So you might have a million people looking at this list of servers where it says zero and they could be playing with each other.

751
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,074
Speaker 0: But nobody clicks.

752
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:19,120
Speaker 0: play No one because they don't want to join the zero.

753
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:30,246
Speaker 0: You know if I join a natural selection server with zero and get one of you know An FRC person to also join it to get the number to two Suddenly the server fills up every time.

754
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:31,168
Speaker 0: guaranteed BAM.

755
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,034
Speaker 0: the server fills up every time.

756
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:38,652
Speaker 0: so I think that You know multi Winnie is having this problem right now where there's.

757
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:40,640
Speaker 0: you know, the community isn't big by any means.

758
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:44,720
Speaker 0: But there might be 20 people out there looking at this list of zero not playing.

759
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,068
Speaker 1: No, because I every time I make a server no one ever joins ever Ever ever ever.

760
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:51,400
Speaker 0: but it could be the network problem.

761
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:52,542
Speaker 1: Yeah It's hard to say.

762
00:50:52,823 --> 00:51:05,592
Speaker 1: but they what they really needed was an outside server with like a ready room someplace people could chat set of Ladders have state they should have like staged events where they say yeah at five o'clock Everyone join the the big official server.

763
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:07,240
Speaker 0: and well, this is also right.

764
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:23,680
Speaker 0: This is what Nintendo got wrong to is that they didn't do online Multiplayer the way it had been done for ages and the way that it always worked properly the way that you know The way the counter-strike does it the way that tribes even tribes do did it, right?

765
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:25,579
Speaker 0: You know it just they died for other reasons.

766
00:51:25,842 --> 00:51:27,397
Speaker 1: But there are more problems than this.

767
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:31,394
Speaker 1: Even even if you get someone to join your game like someone you buy the game.

768
00:51:31,414 --> 00:51:33,060
Speaker 1: you're new you want to play online with someone.

769
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:40,763
Speaker 1: The only people left playing multi-winning who will join your game are people who are a million times better than you and will crush you Immediately.

770
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:41,447
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

771
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:44,280
Speaker 1: So the game is now almost a hundred percent new bun friendly.

772
00:51:44,844 --> 00:51:45,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one.

773
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:50,030
Speaker 0: that's why a lot of games let you know It's even other RTS is like Warcraft 3 and whatnot.

774
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:57,459
Speaker 0: sort of have this, you know ranking system where it's like aha It'll match you up with someone who's a similar rank and if you keep crushing people it raises your rank up.

775
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:04,060
Speaker 1: You know the Nintendo matchup system for like Mario Kart would have worked better than what multi-winning has now.

776
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually that would have worked better because all you would do is say I want to play multi-winning And then boom you're in a game with someone, huh?

777
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,474
Speaker 0: You know and it tries to match you up with someone or the relative skill level.

778
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:17,120
Speaker 1: I just feel like the game Was a really good concept and great ideas.

779
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,054
Speaker 1: But it's like they forgot all the basics of making a multiplayer game.

780
00:52:21,194 --> 00:52:24,408
Speaker 0: exactly what I'm trying to say Can't change the controls.

781
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:26,720
Speaker 1: That's like the immortal sin of a PC game.

782
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a flash game out right now.

783
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:33,080
Speaker 0: That's that's making the rounds right and it's basically just a platformer.

784
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:47,000
Speaker 0: But it's a little bit parkour esque in many ways and you're basically trying to navigate a you know A platform place and whatnot, but and avoid dangerous robots, but the controls on it are messed up.

785
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,194
Speaker 0: It's it's difficult to make tiny and subtle jumps because of the way the controls are set up.

786
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:54,911
Speaker 0: and so many games these days Are great in many aspects.

787
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:56,460
Speaker 0: They've got the ideas great.

788
00:52:56,783 --> 00:52:58,479
Speaker 0: Even the execution of the idea is great.

789
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:05,200
Speaker 0: But all the fundamental things that are just sort of basic things to come into all games are messed up.

790
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,019
Speaker 0: The controls are not smooth.

791
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:12,499
Speaker 0: You know the multiplayer doesn't work, you know There's basic things like that.

792
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,086
Speaker 0: These people are failing on.

793
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:21,920
Speaker 0: you can't customize the controls and if they didn't fail on those, you know Fundamental things that need to be true and set in a certain way for all games.

794
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:32,538
Speaker 1: There'd be a lot more awesome games out there but making a PC game where you can't just in a menu change your controls in this modern era is Like making a car that doesn't have doors.

795
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:34,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, seriously bad.

796
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:37,096
Speaker 1: when someone complained saying well, what would you want doors for?

797
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:38,020
Speaker 1: No one else has doors.

798
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,486
Speaker 1: Everyone else is fine with outdoors.

799
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:41,616
Speaker 0: It's like NASCAR climbing the window, right?

800
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:42,038
Speaker 0: All right.

801
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:48,180
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, so before just let's talk about the cool game modes and multi winning because multi winning does have cool game modes.

802
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:49,715
Speaker 1: I mean, there's like domination.

803
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:58,160
Speaker 0: just you'll be Is basically there are spawn points where that are you know army generators and you basically try to capture more than the other guys.

804
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,163
Speaker 1: So it's fun.

805
00:53:59,324 --> 00:54:00,809
Speaker 0: Usually the maps are symmetrical.

806
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:10,960
Speaker 0: It's fair, you know, you fight whatever this king of the hill Which is where there's these scoring zones and you try to get more of your guys in the scoring zones per unit time.

807
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:17,120
Speaker 0: So it's not who has them at the end It's you know, every guy you have in there and every second that they're in there you're getting points.

808
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,800
Speaker 0: So you try to just funnel all your guys into these scoring zones to get more points than the other guy.

809
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,128
Speaker 1: I'd say that's the second most fun mode.

810
00:54:24,189 --> 00:54:24,791
Speaker 0: It's pretty fun.

811
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:26,256
Speaker 1: My favorite mode is statue.

812
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,300
Speaker 0: That is pretty good.

813
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,099
Speaker 1: Go grab this statue and your little dudes have to carry it back.

814
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:32,091
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you you have these statues right.

815
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:37,040
Speaker 0: you send guys over to the statue They pick it up and try to carry the statues to the scoring zones.

816
00:54:37,582 --> 00:54:43,480
Speaker 0: And if you want the maps are symmetrical yet again, so you could you know, just play along with the other guy.

817
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,720
Speaker 0: No one fights each other and you just each capture an equal number of statues and the game's over.

818
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:54,359
Speaker 0: But when guys are cat, you know, the more guys you have at a statue the more they lift it.

819
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:56,829
Speaker 0: but guys carrying a statue can't fight.

820
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,639
Speaker 0: so you need to send guys over to defend the statue.

821
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:05,779
Speaker 0: and You know, if you don't have enough guys at a statue, they'll drag it slower or they might even drop it.

822
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:12,900
Speaker 0: So it's really easy to go and attack the other guy carrying the statue and fuck him up and then it gets pretty rough.

823
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:25,580
Speaker 0: one of the modes I like best is sort of like the assault mode where there's big bases that are set up at the beginning and One side is the defender of the base and one side is the attacker and the attacker gets floods and floods of guys.

824
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:34,199
Speaker 0: but the defender has this really good entrenched position with turrets and everything and You're starting to keep them it to basically protect your base until the end.

825
00:55:35,142 --> 00:55:41,393
Speaker 0: And the only other mode that I can remember right now is the the nuke mode Which is actually pretty creative and how it works.

826
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:55,040
Speaker 0: There's these Sort of solar panels and you send your guys out to capture your solar panels and the solar panels fuel your rocket Right, and so you're fighting over all these solar panels in different areas of the map.

827
00:55:55,802 --> 00:55:57,306
Speaker 0: But you've also got the rocket.

828
00:55:57,446 --> 00:56:03,214
Speaker 0: now you want your rocket to get a hundred percent fuel and liftoff before the other guy Does just that.

829
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:03,438
Speaker 0: now?

830
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:12,900
Speaker 0: Even when it gets two hundred percent fuel or even before it gets two hundred percent fuel You can actually attack the other guys rocket directly.

831
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:17,492
Speaker 0: Thus, you know you could the other guy could get to a hundred percent fuel.

832
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:19,138
Speaker 0: then you go blow up his rocket.

833
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:25,606
Speaker 0: now You've got you know, even if you had less solar panels than he did you've got you know, seventy percent fuel He's got zero.

834
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,278
Speaker 0: what's gonna view now?

835
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,826
Speaker 0: Defend that rocket and then you win.

836
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:36,485
Speaker 0: It's so it's actually sort of like this crazy, you know Strategies that can emerge of.

837
00:56:36,705 --> 00:56:41,500
Speaker 0: you know, should I go for more solar panels thus having less guys to defend my rocket?

838
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:55,725
Speaker 0: Should I you know just try to defend my rocket get a few solar panels that he won't bother taking from me and then attack His rocket with a crazy powerful force when it gets close to full but then taking the risk that it takes off and it Gets pretty hairy.

839
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:57,980
Speaker 0: So it is clever game modes.

840
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:04,342
Speaker 0: You have an RTS where you sort of can you don't control things at the minute level so you can actually deal with it And it's fun.

841
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:06,689
Speaker 0: and and you know, not complex strategies.

842
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:10,100
Speaker 0: Well, not uber complex, but decent enough strategies emerge.

843
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:24,620
Speaker 0: It's not just about clicking fast or remembering a pattern, you know, it's about you know, controlling the flow of units Almost more like Tron than like most RTS is You know watching how the other guys flow changes and changing your own flow accordingly.

844
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:36,300
Speaker 0: But the fundamentals of the game the things that are common to all games the network You know the networking changing your control and before basic user and before anyone writes to us with some angry hate mail.

845
00:57:36,962 --> 00:57:40,994
Speaker 1: Yes, I am aware of the hack way to change your controls.

846
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:43,120
Speaker 1: it is hackish to the extreme.

847
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,320
Speaker 1: It still doesn't fix half the things I want to do with the controls.

848
00:57:47,182 --> 00:58:00,055
Speaker 1: it's and that's so newbie unfriendly that Basically if introversion expects that to be the answer to basically have to hack your own game to change the controls You're not gonna make any more sales with hacking.

849
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:00,920
Speaker 0: It doesn't count.

850
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,976
Speaker 0: It's like oh our game doesn't have that problem because you can hack it in.

851
00:58:04,996 --> 00:58:12,451
Speaker 0: if you want to make that Excuse right then I can make the same argument that you know GTA had prod in it because you could hack it.

852
00:58:12,552 --> 00:58:18,120
Speaker 0: right now if something is hacked into a game It's not part of the game and cannot be judged as part of the game.

853
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,789
Speaker 0: It is separate and it does not.

854
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,519
Speaker 0: you know, excuse the fact that you know.

855
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:22,906
Speaker 0: Oh the network works.

856
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,060
Speaker 0: if you just employ this patch that you get from some untrustworthy source.

857
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:29,540
Speaker 0: No, the network doesn't work, you know, you can change the controls.

858
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you employ this, you know incredibly difficult thing over here and you don't bind anything to equals.

859
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:37,368
Speaker 1: God help you If you if you bind anything to equals.

860
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:37,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

861
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,296
Speaker 0: All right, that doesn't work either.

862
00:58:39,397 --> 00:58:51,210
Speaker 1: I guess it's just Introversion kind of dropped the ball on this one and unless they fix all these problems and kind of re-release the game I would already call multi-winning effectively dead.

863
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:52,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is a problem.

864
00:58:52,474 --> 00:58:54,260
Speaker 0: right as you put out a game you have problems.

865
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:58,256
Speaker 0: Even if you fix it, it's really hard to bring a game back from the dead.

866
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:00,739
Speaker 0: You know, you got to From the dead.

867
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:07,621
Speaker 0: You have to find some source of players that will surge into the game and just fill it up as if it were a new Game.

868
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:11,377
Speaker 0: and with an indie title like this that's not uber popular.

869
00:59:11,437 --> 00:59:18,871
Speaker 0: and you know It only appeals to a sort of a hardcore niche off to the side Demographic, you know because it who does it appeal to?

870
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,120
Speaker 0: it doesn't appeal really to RTS people.

871
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,929
Speaker 0: They're going for Starcraft 2 and whatnot.

872
00:59:22,969 --> 00:59:29,266
Speaker 0: It doesn't appeal to you know, you know I guess it appeals to some indie, you know people who are Into the indie game.

873
00:59:29,306 --> 00:59:36,418
Speaker 1: it appeals to introversion fans and it appeals to me But I can't play the game because the controls are on a whack.

874
00:59:37,162 --> 00:59:38,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, that's the thing.

875
00:59:38,928 --> 00:59:42,968
Speaker 0: You're appealing to the heart, you know, if this game was trying to aim for a less heart You know was.

876
00:59:43,049 --> 00:59:45,952
Speaker 0: it was more of a you know a general game for the masses.

877
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:55,495
Speaker 0: you can get away without Inverted mouse because only you know gamers care about inverted mouse, you know to be honest people Self-identified gamers would care about inverted mouse.

878
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:56,300
Speaker 0: No one else would care.

879
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:00,960
Speaker 0: But you know, they know that the only this is only available on like Steam and their website.

880
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:03,048
Speaker 0: It's not like a game you buy at Walmart.

881
01:00:03,389 --> 01:00:05,156
Speaker 0: So you can't leave that shit out.

882
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:07,307
Speaker 0: You're just asking for it Isn't it on the Xbox?

883
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:08,395
Speaker 0: Is it?

884
01:00:08,455 --> 01:00:08,798
Speaker 1: I don't know.

885
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:09,120
Speaker 1: I don't know.

886
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,907
Speaker 0: How could you play it on the Xbox?

887
01:00:10,947 --> 01:00:11,831
Speaker 0: That must be a nightmare.

888
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:14,160
Speaker 1: It would probably be better than what I got going now.

889
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,104
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know if it's Anything else.

890
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:21,460
Speaker 1: if I were them they probably would have done much better to release it on the Xbox if they're gonna make it.

891
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:26,074
Speaker 0: Also, you know Def Con had network problems and so did multi-winning.

892
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:42,180
Speaker 0: if introversion if you don't yeah, if you don't die because of you know, the the lack of success for multi-winning if you're still around to make another game, I Suggest that you you know, write new netcode or come up with some sort of new network thing.

893
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:49,040
Speaker 0: Maybe even you know spend some of your you know short, you know low funds to get some sort of server setup.

894
01:00:49,301 --> 01:00:49,883
Speaker 0: You know to.

895
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:53,437
Speaker 0: you know resolve these network issues so that it's very easy for evil.

896
01:00:53,457 --> 01:00:55,990
Speaker 0: this, you know I'll start the game and play done.

897
01:00:56,011 --> 01:00:56,313
Speaker 0: It works.

898
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:04,079
Speaker 1: You have a server online Populated with servers that are look like real games, but are actually bots from your end.

899
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:13,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, or just trick have people that work at introversion, you know when the game is new Just play the game turn all day.

900
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:17,095
Speaker 0: Yeah Get some interns to play the game to give people someone to play against.

901
01:01:17,155 --> 01:01:31,860
Speaker 0: and you know have them Play on easy mode and help people out and be nice and new friendly, you know I talked about muds at the start of the show and one thing about muds is that when you joined a mud for the first time Even though not everyone in the mud was awesome, right?

902
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:44,300
Speaker 0: They would always be if the mud wasn't dead someone in the mud playing who would stop playing because you know who needs to grind That much and come and talk to you and teach you how to play the mud Even if you'd never played a mud before in your life.

903
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:58,219
Speaker 0: They would show you around tell you what to do give you some items all that good stuff And I think a lot of you know More difficult multiplayer games nowadays could really use something like that and it you know, it just doesn't happen.

904
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:05,615
Speaker 0: Oh, you know doesn't happen on Nintendo cuz there's no chat and it doesn't happen You know here because they don't run any servers.

905
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:14,900
Speaker 1: Oh luckily, I Can still play NS and I've been playing more NS than I have been pretty much any game for the last couple weeks.

906
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,482
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been.
