1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,432
Speaker 0: It's Monday October 30th 2017.

2
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,434
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:20,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this is a very terrifying episode of geek nights because we are.

4
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:30,099
Speaker 0: it is the premiere of geek nights Eve because Halloween is when geek nights first aired back in.

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,259
Speaker 0: Some of you were not even born then.

6
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,999
Speaker 1: And if that's true, are you saying there's 11 year olds listen to eat man.

7
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,432
Speaker 0: I am confident there's at least one 11 year old listening.

8
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:42,014
Speaker 1: You're less than 12 years old.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,068
Speaker 0: This probably should not be listening to our show.

10
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:46,515
Speaker 1: This show is not appropriate for you.

11
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:47,137
Speaker 1: Stop listening.

12
00:00:47,158 --> 00:00:49,183
Speaker 0: Fuck Fuck fuck.

13
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,734
Speaker 1: That's not what makes that's appropriate for all ears and is my opinion.

14
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaker 1: There are other things that make it not appropriate.

15
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:58,852
Speaker 0: We might be providing wisdom to a child who will then come.

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,795
Speaker 0: school doesn't matter.

17
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,863
Speaker 1: That's why yeah Grades don't matter.

18
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:04,709
Speaker 1: unless you want to be a doctor a lawyer some shit.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,619
Speaker 0: your grades matter in so much as you need to Manage them to game the system to get out of school.

20
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 0: But yeah, we've been already people in this chatter like you're actually gonna talk about batteries this time because we have gone down this road before.

21
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,640
Speaker 0: Yes, we were talking about batteries, but first.

22
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:30,206
Speaker 0: So I got an open event Sure for the 12th anniversary episode of geek nights because you remember the other day while ago we had a chili party And I made that chili.

23
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: that was better than anyone expected.

24
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,124
Speaker 1: So a long time ago, right?

25
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:41,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, I've been experimenting with chili since and I had an idea and other people I'll enter a chili contest.

26
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:46,448
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, but I wanted to make a chili Where the base was not onion.

27
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:48,353
Speaker 0: as I typically do I do onion based chilies.

28
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,857
Speaker 0: Usually is like my core stock.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,844
Speaker 0: I Use celery.

30
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:52,808
Speaker 1: Okay.

31
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,780
Speaker 0: Let me tell you it was real goddamn good.

32
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,819
Speaker 0: Okay, like real good.

33
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:04,847
Speaker 0: so take any chili recipe and just replace the part where it says onion with a 50/50 split of onion and celery.

34
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:09,929
Speaker 0: if you're not adventurous, but if you're a if you're a maverick, oh all celery You will not be disappointed.

35
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:19,363
Speaker 0: Uh-huh You got you got to add some cumin or something to bring back that sort of tangy oniony character actual flavor I got.

36
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:24,707
Speaker 0: so the other remember when I make a chili the other thing I do is I put like Five cloves of garlic in there.

37
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,733
Speaker 0: Yeah independent of everything else.

38
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:27,415
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

39
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:31,368
Speaker 0: Also the kidney bean Not that pinto bean kidney bean.

40
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,634
Speaker 1: I'm I'm still black bean.

41
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:35,700
Speaker 1: I like black bean I don't know for a chili black bean.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,689
Speaker 0: But so the recipe I based this on.

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,920
Speaker 0: I did not do because this recipe went a little overboard.

44
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,880
Speaker 0: It wanted the kidney bean the black bean and the pinto bean.

45
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:47,931
Speaker 0: It also wanted both ground beef and ground sausage.

46
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,740
Speaker 0: I want just ground beef and just kidney bean.

47
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,566
Speaker 0: But again, I'm experimenting.

48
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,392
Speaker 0: I'm broadening my chili horizons.

49
00:02:54,934 --> 00:03:00,889
Speaker 0: And if you don't think beans belong in Chile I don't know how you found geek nights or why you're still listening.

50
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:04,456
Speaker 1: Anyway, I went to cafe my so I give you a cafe Maya.

51
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:07,465
Speaker 0: I Miss that kind of Mexican food.

52
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:07,987
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,415
Speaker 0: So you got some news on this Monday.

54
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,399
Speaker 0: This is Monday.

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,885
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

56
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:13,608
Speaker 1: what the hell was it?

57
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,296
Speaker 0: the surge of sites.

58
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,220
Speaker 1: and oh, yeah.

59
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,190
Speaker 1: So here's the thing, right?

60
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,428
Speaker 1: It's bad enough that when you go to a website That you got all these ads popping up.

61
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,493
Speaker 1: Of course, you got ad blocker.

62
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:24,940
Speaker 1: So you're all good, right?

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you don't have an ad blocker get an ad blocker, yeah and way back in the day, you know There was JavaScript they added to browsers because HTML wasn't enough.

64
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,066
Speaker 1: It wasn't just enough to have a website.

65
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,420
Speaker 1: show you something and then have you click links to go to other sites.

66
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,740
Speaker 1: They need to have sites do things that were interactive.

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:55,300
Speaker 1: so you needed some way to code and somehow if you can read about the history yourself JavaScript became the language that's in the browser and In the day people use JavaScript pretty much just for evil like make shit blink and annoy the fuck out of you and make pop Ups and do all sorts of evil with it.

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,180
Speaker 0: Like most people who were smart the kind of people who blocked ads either just blocked JavaScript.

69
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, people just turn JavaScript off because it was only used for evil nonsense And all these.

70
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:08,893
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone was like, oh good web developer.

71
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,297
Speaker 1: Don't use any JavaScript.

72
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:10,959
Speaker 1: Just don't use it.

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, do not use.

74
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:16,392
Speaker 1: but then over time People just couldn't help themselves and they had to use it.

75
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:32,200
Speaker 1: and there were ways and our ways to use JavaScript for good and just about any website you go to these days is using it many ways for good to make the web experience better right and whatnot, but Over time JavaScript is all still been used for great evil.

76
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,850
Speaker 1: And there's one great evil that it is being used for now.

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,800
Speaker 1: see for the most part that even though JavaScript can do all sorts of stuff It can't really do anything like outside the web page.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:53,080
Speaker 1: Browsers have these controls in them such that the JavaScript running on a page can only do certain things and if it tries to do Other things the browser will say no, I'm not gonna let you do that.

79
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, and unless there is a separate exploit like in the browser or something You're not it's not gonna break out of that box.

80
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:03,577
Speaker 0: right now There are exploits like that, but it's not really what we're talking about here.

81
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:10,699
Speaker 1: now It's like, you know It just so happens that there is one very evil thing that it can totally do within the box.

82
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:16,494
Speaker 1: Because I mean if you visit a website The JavaScript has to be able to get information from the website and send it to you.

83
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,682
Speaker 1: and get information from you and send it To the website.

84
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,770
Speaker 1: that's basic obvious functionality.

85
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,720
Speaker 1: You can the JavaScript can communicate with the website you're visiting.

86
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,610
Speaker 1: It's like duh it needs to do that.

87
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:33,720
Speaker 1: Well, someone's like well Let's see what evil can be done with just that seemingly perfectly safe and secure technology.

88
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,715
Speaker 0: Do external I/O and access processing cycles.

89
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:37,640
Speaker 0: That's what I got to work with.

90
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:42,480
Speaker 1: It basically means that well, there's no limits on how much of your CPU it can use.

91
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:43,182
Speaker 1: So

92
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:43,423
Speaker 0: there's a

93
00:05:43,483 --> 00:06:02,219
Speaker 1: lot of websites these days unbeknownst to you that if you visit them without correct blocking and such The JavaScript will completely without you knowing unless you know It wanted to your CPU cycles and notice that when you visit that site your CPUs getting used a whole bunch Start mining some coins and then if any coins get mined by you.

94
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,503
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

95
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,706
Speaker 1: You don't get no coins.

96
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:06,210
Speaker 1: the first website you're visiting.

97
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:13,413
Speaker 1: you're sending all the coins to them whether they be bitcoins or Ethereum's or whatever the fuck coins people using these days doge coins.

98
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:14,095
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

99
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,400
Speaker 1: fuck all them coins.

100
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:20,122
Speaker 1: and that on the one hand is Great evil.

101
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:24,240
Speaker 1: you basically stealing my electricity my CPU cycles ruining my computer.

102
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,460
Speaker 1: I didn't give you explicit permission for this except maybe in the site's terms of service.

103
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:34,856
Speaker 0: You're being all shady which you know About that because of one of the or one of the group one website that is doing this.

104
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,525
Speaker 0: we have some more info about Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,393
Speaker 0: But anyway go on.

106
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:40,650
Speaker 1: Yeah So on the one hand that's bad, right?

107
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,140
Speaker 1: We don't want that and if anyone's doing that you should block them.

108
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,262
Speaker 1: But on the other hand Right.

109
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:49,480
Speaker 1: It's like I don't believe in these coin nonsense blockchain bullshit, right?

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,480
Speaker 1: That's a bunch of get-rich-quick shady scam artists business.

111
00:06:54,464 --> 00:07:02,940
Speaker 0: There are legitimate Interesting uses for blockchain and blockchain like technology, however Cryptocurrencies themselves have fundamental flaws.

112
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:10,985
Speaker 1: Back in the day people would just be running like affiliate scams making websites full of casino ads trying to make money for without doing Work on the internet.

113
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaker 1: Yeah today those same people are doing coin shit.

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:21,385
Speaker 1: Which is it's like this huge amount of people who are just like I need to make money for without doing a lot of work Website.

115
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:35,195
Speaker 0: I did this when I saw when I was in like late middle school early high school There's this thing where you use this special web browser and they would pay you like a penny an hour or so But they'd show you ads constantly while you were using the internet.

116
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,954
Speaker 1: No, no, this is see People using that browsers.

117
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,100
Speaker 1: I might be able making that bro.

118
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:50,790
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But I tried to exploit that browser and I ran a bunch of them on different accounts and had a script that would move my mouse a little bit Anyway, but I made like a couple bucks people all.

119
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:56,908
Speaker 1: if there's any way to try to make real money without doing anything Just by having computers do stuff people will get.

120
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:03,912
Speaker 1: this is class of people that get all over it and those people are currently Keeping the coin business afloat.

121
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:04,595
Speaker 1: That's what they're.

122
00:08:04,635 --> 00:08:05,458
Speaker 1: that's what they're doing.

123
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:14,980
Speaker 1: Anyway And if you actually insert real money into that system, you are the mark Yeah, then they are all competing with their computers to take your real money.

124
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:21,840
Speaker 0: Now if you say but I made tons of money on cryptocurrencies Yeah, a lot of people near the top of a pyramid scheme make a lot of money anyway.

125
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:34,740
Speaker 1: but one Possibly good like aspect of this that I hadn't thought of until someone pointed it out is like well We do have this fundamental problem and that people make content put it online.

126
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,455
Speaker 1: Some people are making legit content and they have trouble making money.

127
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 1: They got a deal with bullshit YouTube.

128
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:41,308
Speaker 1: They got to put ads.

129
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,232
Speaker 0: I mean case in point.

130
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:51,419
Speaker 0: the only reason they got a patreon Geek nice is free because we have money To have covered this shit for so many and it's not that expensive true for us.

131
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:52,243
Speaker 0: But that's cuz.

132
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,194
Speaker 0: we can do a lot of the expensive stuff ourselves with our brains.

133
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,596
Speaker 0: Yes.

134
00:08:55,937 --> 00:09:06,038
Speaker 1: Anyway, um What is it what if we live in a world where you go online and there's just no ads and there's no?

135
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:20,700
Speaker 1: but everything's great Because everyone is mining coins while you're consuming their content Like you're watching a video on Netflix and while you watch it You know It's happening and Netflix is just mining you and that's how you're paying and that's in Netflix will cause zero.

136
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:26,860
Speaker 0: Arguably, that is how we pay for a lot of for example, Google services in that they're mining data from us.

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Speaker 0: They're not mining bitcoins or whatever, but they're getting data about what we do and that's the actual product.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,864
Speaker 0: That's how we pray Google.

139
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:38,540
Speaker 1: but see but date mining data about you has like all these privacy implications, right?

140
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:49,452
Speaker 1: It actually wouldn't be harmful to you really except your electric bill Which is where you'd end up paying which for them to just use your CPU cycles And then that's how you pay them, which is not nothing.

141
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:51,500
Speaker 1: However, because I'm nothing it's not free.

142
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,274
Speaker 1: It's not actually free but you'd be paying for it in a different way.

143
00:09:55,294 --> 00:10:01,611
Speaker 1: That would actually a It could be good for the environment because you'd you'd be.

144
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:10,575
Speaker 0: we manufacture all these CPUs and a lot of them are going underused Because modern CPUs clock down and don't like they use less power when they're not fully utilized.

145
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:18,998
Speaker 1: Yes, but it would still Manufacturing, you know resources of making the CPUs right the silicon and the factory is polluting, right?

146
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:28,500
Speaker 1: You know Google would end up buying less CPUs for their mainframe, you know They're big data warehouses and whatever because they just be using yours, right?

147
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:30,550
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's just.

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,840
Speaker 1: that's at least a little something.

149
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,760
Speaker 0: So right that is because coin hive is apparently the big one in this.

150
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:36,943
Speaker 1: Yeah I've is me.

151
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:44,220
Speaker 1: coin hive is a company that makes a thing where if you're a website maker or owner You can just get coin hive code and put it on your website.

152
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,129
Speaker 1: Well, and now people visiting your site will mine coins for you And I guess coin hive is getting money.

153
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,748
Speaker 0: to quoting this Ars Technica article coin I've presented service as a white way and users can support sites without viewing online ads.

154
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:04,434
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Consents yes, you don't know that you're doing this.

155
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:05,640
Speaker 1: just how how you visit a website.

156
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:13,606
Speaker 1: they could be showing you ads and using your computer to mine for them and - I Really don't think that Legitimate websites are using this.

157
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:16,576
Speaker 0: I would bet that it's mostly scammy websites that are using this.

158
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:17,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's just a guess.

159
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:23,902
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, and malware blockers have already started just blocking coin hive outright saying yeah We don't care.

160
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,880
Speaker 0: if you think you have a legitimate business you have a quote unquote legitimate business.

161
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,364
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but at least there is.

162
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:54,077
Speaker 1: it's like it's illegitimate because the cryptocurrency stuff is all shady bullshit Right, but the fundamental the lower fundamental idea just on its own taking away the sleaziness of bitcoins and whatnot is Hey pay for things by letting the thing the person that created the content that deserves to be paid in some way Borrow your CPU cycles to use them for me.

163
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,586
Speaker 1: But then you're not fucking using them.

164
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:59,214
Speaker 0: they are actually directly charging you that.

165
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:09,100
Speaker 0: the amount of money that electricity costs Which is gonna be more than people will expect it will be more than you expect Will actually be quite reasonable if you consider how much content you consume.

166
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,100
Speaker 0: Ah, but why in directly like that?

167
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:18,151
Speaker 1: If I read a webcomic and I end up paying like ten cents on my fucking electric bill for the time It took me to read the webcomic.

168
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:18,939
Speaker 1: That's a bargain.

169
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:27,132
Speaker 0: Oh, no, so already I'm pretty sure that a lot of these keep running constantly after you visit them Can't have JavaScript running once you close a tab.

170
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:27,735
Speaker 0: I rise.

171
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:28,720
Speaker 0: I was skimming this article.

172
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,047
Speaker 0: I said something about hidden browser window.

173
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,293
Speaker 1: Well, that is shady as fuck.

174
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, can't be doing that.

175
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:45,099
Speaker 1: But also if Most people only use the internet on their phones Yeah, that's a problem because your phone CPU you'd kill your battery, right?

176
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,568
Speaker 1: And well, it's not a good deal.

177
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 1: a lot of people and some phones.

178
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,820
Speaker 0: It does not make their phone battery running out before they get home might as well be a death sentence.

179
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not cool.

180
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,579
Speaker 1: Right because there's a battery situation also and there's not much CPU.

181
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:00,330
Speaker 1: to mine That's a weak-ass CPU even in a high-end phase.

182
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,480
Speaker 0: just kicks a more fundamental problem down the road.

183
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:06,244
Speaker 1: I found X is really fast but it's not as good as even like an i3.

184
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:17,080
Speaker 0: the fundamental problem this kicks down the road is That the social that we lack a social contract for how media should be funded in society.

185
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:25,347
Speaker 0: So the right way to do it now would be for people to pay some token amount directly for their content or to have some other system in place.

186
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:39,888
Speaker 0: the idea of Quietly using a resource people don't understand causing a bill They don't pay attention to to go up by the amount that they would have just paid directly Removes the visibility to those people.

187
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,720
Speaker 0: the fact that there still is a social contract that is funding content.

188
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:49,181
Speaker 0: It hides from them the real cost of content and as long as you hide it from them they will never care about it Right.

189
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:53,000
Speaker 1: I think the way to do this is obviously you have to let the person know that it's happening.

190
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,575
Speaker 1: They can opt in or out and have some other payment method and you know such and such right.

191
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:06,862
Speaker 1: but there is and the other Question is how do you without sleazy coins convert the person CPU cycles into actual money to pay like into my rent if I'm an Artist

192
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:25,949
Speaker 0: also, I would argue that for a lot of P I mean PCs are already not much of a market like that, but between laptops and PCs at least Causing a CPU to clock up and stay clocked up for a while and a computer that is probably not well built or well dusted But it also goes hardware failures and such.

193
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:30,911
Speaker 1: Well, I mean don't have any computer you'll take care of yeah, but again also don't push.

194
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:40,482
Speaker 1: yes, I'm talking about an ethical and Reasonable way of doing this because obviously the only people are doing it right now are doing it evilly and unethically and yeah Fuck them.

195
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:51,780
Speaker 1: I mean, I feel like I'm saying there is a whole a small Hope in this story of evil doing of hey Maybe we can solve this problem somehow by mixing this up and changing in this way.

196
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,436
Speaker 0: I feel that direct microtransactions are better.

197
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:59,379
Speaker 0: indirect Microtransactions just reek of abuse and reek of scams.

198
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:05,540
Speaker 1: sure But what if there is an honest way of you know, somehow turning CPU cycles into fair real money.

199
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,443
Speaker 1: That's not bullshit.

200
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:16,106
Speaker 1: and people who say teenagers who don't have money in credit cards can say yes You know, I agree that this thick cut, you know This video site is YouTube video.

201
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:20,400
Speaker 1: I'm watching can borrow some CPU cycles to pay for me watching this video.

202
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:22,408
Speaker 1: I'm not using my computer.

203
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,020
Speaker 0: There's an economy if you talk about the environmental cost of that.

204
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:46,404
Speaker 0: There is an economy of scale in Real supercomputers that if you're distributing that load to a wide array of much shittier machines that are maintained to dubious degrees May end up drawing more energy out of the system than the centralized ones would thus having an indirect and negative Environmental impact.

205
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,810
Speaker 0: Yeah kind of like how

206
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,975
Speaker 1: but you know, but while

207
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:49,858
Speaker 0: there are efficiency

208
00:15:49,899 --> 00:16:01,068
Speaker 1: losses It's tough to measure the environmental impact because it's like, you know People always talk about like all the environmental impact of driving a shitty car, but it's like versus the cost of Manufacturing an electric car.

209
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you're better off using the used car that spewing out, you know gas.

210
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,819
Speaker 0: Well, that's the whole conversation of electric cars.

211
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,502
Speaker 0: They have more.

212
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:14,686
Speaker 1: so it's like alright is running this CPU for and making some heat right and using some Electricity that the CPU already exists.

213
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:19,240
Speaker 1: How does that compare to making a new CPU at the fab, right?

214
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:25,012
Speaker 1: I don't know the numbers on this But I'm just saying there's a potential there at least to investigate maybe as good maybe as bad.

215
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just.

216
00:16:26,557 --> 00:16:30,109
Speaker 0: I am so Highly dubious of all of that.

217
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,614
Speaker 0: I'm also increasingly dubious of the.

218
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,690
Speaker 1: I mean, yes right now I'm just talking about potential features right now.

219
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,156
Speaker 1: Fuck anyone who does this.

220
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:46,291
Speaker 1: block them all And also fuck your coins, yeah There's a reason I don't have any fucking coins and hands off my CPU.

221
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,475
Speaker 1: That's the story today.

222
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,020
Speaker 1: That is the story today.

223
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:50,058
Speaker 1: No buts about it.

224
00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:04,760
Speaker 0: So in a much shorter news because I don't want to get too much into the specifics of Portugal But it appears that at least one Portuguese ISP is Doing the exact thing that all the nerds were warning would happen if net neutrality is not protected by governments.

225
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:10,136
Speaker 0: They're literally selling packages of oh, you want to watch YouTube videos.

226
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:16,527
Speaker 0: That's another five currency units a month, ah, you want to watch YouTube videos and Netflix videos.

227
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:24,140
Speaker 1: Well, you got to get the premium package So you got to pay your ISP and then you got to pay Netflix our YouTube or whoever also because they're not giving out.

228
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't want to get into the details.

229
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:32,940
Speaker 1: this article The actually the thing that we were worried they would do is try to charge Netflix, but they're not doing that.

230
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:40,725
Speaker 1: They're just charging the customer saying oh you pay for us as ISP You're paying your ISP bill then you pay Netflix themselves But then you got to pay us.

231
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,480
Speaker 1: if you want to add Netflix to your is piece you getting doubled booked.

232
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:55,077
Speaker 0: Yep, now the real problem with this is that shift is moving from fighting against an entity that has resources to fight back on an Equal level because Netflix can say go fuck yourself.

233
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:59,460
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Some random dude in Portugal does not have the power.

234
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,940
Speaker 1: I don't know if Portugal has the local monopolies on the internet a service provider.

235
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,466
Speaker 0: That's why I don't want to get into the details.

236
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:10,213
Speaker 0: not because I have some higher motive because I don't fucking know anything about Portuguese ISPs.

237
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:18,357
Speaker 1: no But like in the United States at least if someone were to do this like say I have Time Warner I don't really have much of a choice of anyone to switch to right.

238
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,139
Speaker 1: It's like that's the only one that's connected to my building.

239
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,557
Speaker 1: So I can get I guess shitty DSL from Verizon over the phone line.

240
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:26,260
Speaker 1: fuck that noise.

241
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,218
Speaker 0: But the higher-level problem and this is why net neutrality is so important.

242
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:29,560
Speaker 0: and why?

243
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:36,872
Speaker 0: You as a nerd who's listening to the Monday episode of geek nights Which I assume is the least popular episode of geek nights.

244
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,293
Speaker 1: I don't know.

245
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:38,578
Speaker 1: It's the hardest episode to do.

246
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:55,979
Speaker 0: Yep But when we care the least about the reason normal people need to care about net neutrality Is that the only reason the cool shit that happens on the internet is happening is because the pipes are neutral So anyone can try to sell a cool service or thing.

247
00:18:56,403 --> 00:19:05,458
Speaker 0: Netflix could not have begun Without net neutrality because Netflix needed to assume the pipes are there and get to everyone to then try to offer a service on top of those pipes.

248
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,993
Speaker 0: It's a series of tubes and we need to protect that.

249
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 0: everyone has access to those tubes.

250
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,188
Speaker 1: This is a common business model.

251
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:20,120
Speaker 1: actually even forgetting the internet just in Technology and other businesses also in general is you make something new and you got to compete.

252
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,319
Speaker 1: You gotta they got to compete with something that's entrenched or you're new to market and you're brand new.

253
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:33,334
Speaker 1: But what you do is you make your product open and relatively free for everyone and it gains Popularity and then once you're big enough you lock that shit down and everyone's locked in.

254
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,380
Speaker 0: but locking down the internet locks down.

255
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:43,652
Speaker 1: We had this open internet and all these companies were able to use it to get real big Amazon Google Facebook Twitter everyone and now Netflix.

256
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:51,610
Speaker 1: it's like oh well now we're big, you know Let's lock it down and now we'll stay the Kings forever because you know We already got on top of the hill and it's very telling.

257
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,344
Speaker 1: let anyone new in the same gate that we use to get up To the top.

258
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,080
Speaker 0: there is an opposite direction.

259
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:12,180
Speaker 0: This could go in that the big companies that have already succeeded in the previously neutral environment if they were evil They would actually be against net neutrality Because a loss of net neutrality locks new competition out of ever competing with them at least in internet businesses.

260
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:26,908
Speaker 0: yeah, so the fact that even the big a like a Moral giant internet companies are also against very very against it because the ISPs will have power over them because of the monopolies ISPs have.

261
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:38,799
Speaker 1: if ISPs didn't have a monopoly the Google's of the world would love to get rid of net neutrality And I think ISPs should be basically destroyed and regulated like power companies are.

262
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,573
Speaker 0: yes They should be utilities providing a service.

263
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,934
Speaker 0: That is a Ostensible right to all citizens and at a reasonable and highly regulated price.

264
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:47,837
Speaker 0: and SLA.

265
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:48,238
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

266
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:49,700
Speaker 0: But yeah.

267
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:58,400
Speaker 0: So the this is one more example you can use to terrify your muggle friends about why they should at least Occasionally call their senator and say the words net neutrality.

268
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,652
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

269
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,540
Speaker 0: Scott's got a Monday relevant thing of the day.

270
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaker 0: So I will go first with my much less inspiring not Monday related thing of the day at all.

271
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,420
Speaker 1: So obviously I got to start by saying that I admit I do not have a lot of knowledge on this topic.

272
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,234
Speaker 1: I only know what you learn about DNA in like high school.

273
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:24,699
Speaker 1: I Only remember most of it and not all of it.

274
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:25,844
Speaker 0: I took more.

275
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:34,400
Speaker 1: something about the helix splits apart and then the RNA comes along and copies and makes the other half and they got Two DNAs right something like that and this ACGT and they match up.

276
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's some like polymerase enzyme and some other one.

277
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,717
Speaker 0: I'm just saying proper nouns and linking them to those are definitely the right proper nouns.

278
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,380
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

279
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,159
Speaker 0: Do you remember what the nucleotides are?

280
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, ACG and teeth.

281
00:21:48,689 --> 00:21:55,650
Speaker 0: so ending guanine cytosine Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, which one is not in RNA?

282
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:58,628
Speaker 0: No, it's replaced by uracil.

283
00:21:58,648 --> 00:21:59,793
Speaker 0: I I've heard it.

284
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:05,756
Speaker 0: so whatever the point is I just said bounced off of the near bottom of what I remember about biology rice.

285
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:25,058
Speaker 1: Anyway, here is video of video right video of real-time DNA replication like you see these like lines going across its DNA growing in real time Like you're watching this shit happen Like photons are bouncing off the DNA and hitting this microscope camera.

286
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:27,426
Speaker 1: I presume Right and you're watching it go.

287
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:28,270
Speaker 1: It's like holy shit.

288
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,909
Speaker 1: And what they learned from this video is that Shit is not like they thought it was.

289
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,280
Speaker 1: it has something to do with like how the strands coordinate.

290
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 1: I don't completely understand it But basically a lot of stuff that they thought and taught you in high school or college or ever is not a hundred percent, right?

291
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,567
Speaker 0: So I took AP bio in 1998 and also it just I mean fuck.

292
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:54,140
Speaker 1: whatever the information is that I understand and probably won't matter to me anytime soon.

293
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,249
Speaker 1: But holy shit, it's a video of DNA replicating.

294
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,017
Speaker 1: They predicted something they couldn't see and then they saw it.

295
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 1: That's so science.

296
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:06,824
Speaker 0: I still have my AP bio textbook from 1998 and It's half wrong now.

297
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:09,414
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz I watch SciShow so I get a lot of like.

298
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,920
Speaker 0: here's a current thing about science.

299
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:19,640
Speaker 0: Holy shit, have we discovered a lot about cellular biology since 1998?

300
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,220
Speaker 0: Holy shit has a lot changed To the point that I Highly dubious that I know anything about how cells work anymore.

301
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,980
Speaker 1: No, but if you want to see DNA with your eyeballs check out my thing a day.

302
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:30,422
Speaker 1: That's pretty.

303
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,410
Speaker 1: you know about biology and DNA.

304
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:32,972
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

305
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,317
Speaker 1: I don't know as much as you do.

306
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:39,160
Speaker 1: Don't hate me I'm admitting that I don't know and I'm wrong and you'll still love this fucking video.

307
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:48,575
Speaker 0: So if you are much lower brow and that and that thing of the day terrifies you I just got some YouTube live streamer guy but the lowest brow.

308
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:53,032
Speaker 0: so I Stumbled upon this channel in this video just kind of randomly.

309
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:57,284
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and it was legit Really funny.

310
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:01,120
Speaker 0: and it wasn't just me because I played it again for Emily and it was legit funny.

311
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,960
Speaker 0: And then I played it for a bunch of other people and it's legit funny.

312
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:12,413
Speaker 0: And then I figured some stuff out about this, dude This dude has been this kind of crap since the early Newgrounds days.

313
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,720
Speaker 0: Okay, so he's like he's in our clade.

314
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,508
Speaker 0: He's more old-school like he was making.

315
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,803
Speaker 0: you know, those like fuck his head like those nonsense videos We used to watch.

316
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:20,043
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

317
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,171
Speaker 0: This dude was doing that stuff back then.

318
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,776
Speaker 1: and is who is the dude?

319
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:24,298
Speaker 1: What's his name?

320
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,266
Speaker 0: Uh, Video game donkey.

321
00:24:26,286 --> 00:24:27,211
Speaker 1: Okay.

322
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,100
Speaker 1: Is he like a gamer gate or a bad person?

323
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,335
Speaker 0: No, he seems like a perfectly fine person with a vaguely Brooklyn accent.

324
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,962
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my kind You're.

325
00:24:33,983 --> 00:24:34,626
Speaker 0: you'll hear some.

326
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,414
Speaker 0: some hints of.

327
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:40,920
Speaker 1: you can't hold 10 Pokemon But those are Jersey kids if I'm not mistaken.

328
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, but see I can't tell those accents apart.

329
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:44,640
Speaker 0: a group in the Midwest.

330
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:53,602
Speaker 0: But this video is just a collection of stuff things that happened in Breath of the Wild and One.

331
00:24:53,623 --> 00:25:00,999
Speaker 0: if you haven't really explored the crazy nonsense You can pull off in Breath of the Wild like making airships or bringing chickens with you.

332
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:14,099
Speaker 0: It gives you a lot of ideas of crazy crap you can do in this game because the game lets you do a lot of crazy crap like What if you knock the weapon out of a bokoblin's hands and give him a Korok leaf and he tries to kill you with it?

333
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:17,854
Speaker 0: Is it even possible for him to hurt you with that Korok leaf?

334
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:19,280
Speaker 0: And the answer is pretty funny.

335
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,505
Speaker 0: So this video is pretty good and I guarantee you will laugh at least once during it and it's only like six minutes long And then at a moment.

336
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,936
Speaker 0: the book club book was the fifth season by N.K.

337
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:31,278
Speaker 0: Jemisin.

338
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:31,660
Speaker 0: We did it.

339
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,164
Speaker 0: We done it.

340
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:33,092
Speaker 0: We did a show on it.

341
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:33,999
Speaker 0: You can listen to it.

342
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,332
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't choose a new book club book during that episode.

343
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,240
Speaker 0: I did not and I will choose it very soon.

344
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,664
Speaker 1: It's not the Count of Monte Cristo.

345
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:47,239
Speaker 0: Now, the Count of Monte Cristo is held out solely as a punishment if I ever get displeased by your book club choice.

346
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:50,540
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, you seem to like my book club choices better than yours.

347
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,128
Speaker 0: I think my book club choice has been pretty good, too.

348
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:53,550
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

349
00:25:54,112 --> 00:25:55,959
Speaker 1: Let's have a poll whose book club choices are better.

350
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,047
Speaker 0: We finally got the archive with book club books.

351
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,620
Speaker 1: Also, I'm pretty sure the last book club book you chose was a stolen choice from me.

352
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:02,804
Speaker 0: Let's see.

353
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:03,469
Speaker 0: Let's see.

354
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:04,395
Speaker 0: We did the Prince of Nothing.

355
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:08,775
Speaker 0: That was both of us Uh Snow Crash Earthsea.

356
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,666
Speaker 0: Then I picked a Fair World Arms.

357
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:11,890
Speaker 0: You did Cavalier and Clay.

358
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,893
Speaker 0: I did Steppenwolf.

359
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:16,541
Speaker 0: You did Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mm-hmm.

360
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:20,131
Speaker 0: I did Locke Lamora, and I think I skipped one.

361
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:20,733
Speaker 0: I can't tell.

362
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,622
Speaker 0: I don't remember who picked what in these old episodes Uh-huh.

363
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:25,792
Speaker 0: I picked the Ear of the Eye and the Arm.

364
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:26,375
Speaker 1: Okay.

365
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:27,218
Speaker 0: That was really good.

366
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:31,759
Speaker 0: That's okay Yeah, but anyway, I will pick it soon, but I'm already mostly done with the second book.

367
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:34,550
Speaker 1: I gotta get started on that.

368
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:39,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know a lot about the moon now and I'm very pleased with some things that I learned.

369
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,834
Speaker 1: and The only thing that surprised all those people who smacked down the second book are wrong.

370
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:56,640
Speaker 0: Uh, I can see why they would say the things they said about the second book so far because some Fundamental truths were revealed very directly and I can see why some people would be disappointed by that.

371
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,936
Speaker 1: But no, I like that as long as there's another terrible secret of space.

372
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:13,975
Speaker 0: at the same time I was not disappointed by that at all because I Learned to think about the moon and I was a hundred percent right about almost everything I thought about it, but then I learned about the other moon.

373
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:15,160
Speaker 0: That's a very different moon.

374
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,306
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I got this Technology control room and it's good shit.

375
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:27,752
Speaker 1: this Saturday October 4th and also 5th is Gamer X East, G-A-Y-M-E-R-X East.

376
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:34,800
Speaker 1: obviously, even though this is a convention That is mostly for L-G-B-Q-T all the letters.

377
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:41,079
Speaker 0: I'll be honest I say all the people just because I don't want to get into the argument of how many more letters all the letters.

378
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,023
Speaker 0: I include Everyone.

379
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,416
Speaker 0: L-G-B-T dot star everybody, right?

380
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,503
Speaker 1: It's meh, but you can come even if you're like us just a cishet boring white dude who sucks Still go.

381
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:57,420
Speaker 1: I guess if you're a homophobe you might not want to go but I mean you're still probably welcome there.

382
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:01,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if you're in New York City and you like games is a good place to go.

383
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:05,334
Speaker 1: This weekend Saturday and Sunday is gonna be awesome time.

384
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:06,620

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
Speaker 0: Yep, we will be there Saturday most of the day just hanging out playing games.

386
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:15,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you want to play a board game with us, we're just gonna be hanging around this.

387
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:18,243
Speaker 1: Friday and Saturday is Blizzcon.

388
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,216

391
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,270
Speaker 1: So, you know, you can watch around.

392
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:46,540
Speaker 1: you can watch if you're not a gamer X. You can switch between the first rounds of the Swiss rounds of Hearthstone and the final rounds of heart Net runs start of netrunner and the end of hearthstone and then on Sunday watch the end of netrunner anyway.

393
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,053
Speaker 1: Also on Sunday is the end of daylight savings time in the stupid place.

394
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:54,200
Speaker 0: We live daylight saving time.

395
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:58,987
Speaker 0: There's no s on the end of whatever TP I know about daylight saving time.

396
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:00,632
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's fast fucking bullshit.

397
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:03,380
Speaker 1: It's gonna be dark at like 5. fuck that nonsense.

398
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:10,340
Speaker 1: Also, that is gonna be the New York City marathon, which we don't give a shit about because you shouldn't run marathons.

399
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:11,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, I run marathons.

400
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:16,791
Speaker 1: I ran one Saturday before the marathon starts There's an opportunity if you have a bicycle to bike.

401
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,096
Speaker 1: Oh bicycle Michael.

402
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:22,614
Speaker 1: I'll bike Michael Yeah on the marathon route before people start running and doing stuff.

403
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:25,129
Speaker 1: if you want to do that ending on the weather I may do that.

404
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:25,938
Speaker 1: I did it last year.

405
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:29,820
Speaker 0: Yep I did it last year except I bailed at the Queensborough because I didn't want to be trapped in Manhattan.

406
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,914
Speaker 1: I use the Roosevelt Island sky car to get back.

407
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:35,650
Speaker 1: I could also use a subway to get back Yeah, like an F train or something.

408
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,849
Speaker 0: So I'll see but a Google, you'll find it's pretty easy to do.

409
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,220
Speaker 0: like you might wonder like oh, well, where do I meet?

410
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:47,520
Speaker 0: Just like look on reddit and head vaguely where the start is and you'll see a bunch of other bikers.

411
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:52,840
Speaker 1: But it's not or it's way down south in Brooklyn close to the Verrazano.

412
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:59,291
Speaker 0: The only thing I'll warn you about because it wasn't we were I wasn't clear on this last year There will still be cars on the route just way less.

413
00:29:59,331 --> 00:29:59,452
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,074
Speaker 1: No, it's good.

415
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,480
Speaker 1: The roads aren't closed yet.

416
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,531
Speaker 1: That's why you can do this.

417
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,440
Speaker 1: They're partially closed.

418
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:08,720
Speaker 1: They'll be barricades up in some places But now the roads are technically still open because the marathon hasn't started yet.

419
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,112
Speaker 1: But they're all setting marathon shit up and there's not a lot of cars out at y'all.

420
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:17,799
Speaker 1: crackety crack crack as a dawn on Sunday, especially not when there's a marathon going on.

421
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

422
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:24,221
Speaker 1: So there's very few cars and you can just bike along the route and so you get to the part that's actually closed near the Finish line.

423
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:24,543
Speaker 1: anyway.

424
00:30:25,084 --> 00:30:38,240
Speaker 1: other things the week before Thanksgiving we're talking about November 16 salt 17 18 19 is packs unplugged in Pennsylvania which sucks but it's packed some plug which is great.

425
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,044
Speaker 0: We will be there.

426
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,190
Speaker 0: we will be enforcing.

427
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,600
Speaker 0: we will be doing a two-hour event Where we're gonna teach a bunch of people how to play carcass own.

428
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:56,993
Speaker 0: we're gonna teach them how to be ruthless monsters at carcass own and then we're gonna put them all in a Basically pub G equivalent carcass own tournament last man standing in a single elimination To see what happens when you make monsters and make them fight each other.

429
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:58,600
Speaker 1: tomorrow is Halloween.

430
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:11,501
Speaker 1: Good, you're probably listening to this on Halloween the 12th anniversary of geek nights and in the beginning of January It's gonna be magfest on the 4th 5th 6th and 7th and then pack south on the 12 13 14.

431
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,329
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's gonna go boom packs.

432
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,702
Speaker 1: It's gonna go magfest packs out 1 2 1 2.

433
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:21,715
Speaker 0: Also, if you've been wondering why a lot of our side content hasn't been bustling so much.

434
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:25,210
Speaker 0: It's because of all these conventions I've had to organize and deal with our panels.

435
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:26,558
Speaker 1: for all this shit's going down.

436
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:32,115
Speaker 0: meeting into January stuff will really calm down and all our side projects will probably pick up.

437
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:33,859
Speaker 1: you can't do any of these events.

438
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,306
Speaker 1: you Should still follow us everywhere on the internet.

439
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:37,650
Speaker 1: We got two youtubes.

440
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,613
Speaker 1: We got twitches.

441
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,097
Speaker 1: We got twitters.

442
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:40,980
Speaker 1: We got Facebook's.

443
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,803
Speaker 1: We got instagrams.

444
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:45,295
Speaker 1: We got everything that people have on the internet all those evil places.

445
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,560
Speaker 0: We even got a g-plus.

446
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:51,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, go to all those places and follow us and you can follow along with all this shit.

447
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Speaker 1: That's going down and I'm like streaming Mario Odyssey.

448
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:59,539
Speaker 1: Okay, all kinds of contents that you can see there because you're not gonna see any content anywhere else.

449
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,681
Speaker 0: So yeah Batteries.

450
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:05,213
Speaker 1: so how many times have you tried to do a battery show?

451
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:06,499
Speaker 0: so only one.

452
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,858
Speaker 0: well So I don't think we've ever done it before.

453
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:10,704
Speaker 0: I Looked I couldn't find it.

454
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:21,520
Speaker 1: I feel like we tried to do a battery show way back in 2000 beacon days and It might have either been lost or was part of another show and probably called the battery show.

455
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,520
Speaker 0: There are some early old episodes of geek nights where we literally like blew a load and reviewed like five great board games in one show.

456
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,000
Speaker 0: So we're gonna probably redo a lot of those in the future.

457
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:39,659
Speaker 0: But when it comes to this stuff there are Two episodes of geek nights ever that were lost to time because I don't remember what they were about.

458
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,082
Speaker 0: neither Do I. so there are two shows that we've recorded and then either my computer crashed or I fucked Anytime.

459
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:49,920
Speaker 1: rim has a show idea that I felt like we did already, but I can't find in the archive.

460
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:53,080
Speaker 1: I either believe he deleted it or is one of those shows they got lost.

461
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,723
Speaker 0: You know that's like.

462
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:57,060
Speaker 0: that's like how I'm still spending that money from when we won in Atlantic City, right?

463
00:32:57,283 --> 00:33:06,960
Speaker 1: Batteries are one of those shows And we tried to do a battery show when recently and we failed for some reason we came up with a better idea at the last Second, okay, but the stream still said batteries.

464
00:33:07,081 --> 00:33:11,403
Speaker 0: So all of you were coming into the stream being like I thought this is batteries WTF All right.

465
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:14,800
Speaker 1: So the other thing is that I actually don't know that much about batteries.

466
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:17,213
Speaker 1: I don't know how good a show I can do on them.

467
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,260
Speaker 0: I Think we can talk one, but there's such an important.

468
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,079
Speaker 1: There's such an important thing for all technologies that it's they're kind of worth doing a show on

469
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:27,763
Speaker 0: Your camera,

470
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:28,325
Speaker 1: okay,

471
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:41,938
Speaker 0: so but also we can talk at a high level in the sense that it's very easy, especially for some of you who are younger to Underestimate how ridiculously important modern batteries have been to almost everything you do.

472
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:49,740
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm because when we were growing up The batteries that you are used to today that you just plug into a USB and they just kind of work did not exist.

473
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,497
Speaker 1: right when I was a kid and it wasn't because I only had kids toys to put batteries in it's cuz.

474
00:33:54,537 --> 00:34:00,980
Speaker 1: no literally those are Batteries you could get even like adults of boomboxes had a bunch of fucking D and C batteries to my keyboard.

475
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:02,943
Speaker 0: I had a keyboard like that I would play on.

476
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:07,480
Speaker 0: it took eight D batteries and those bet that lasted like a day.

477
00:34:07,688 --> 00:34:11,580
Speaker 1: Yeah Rechargeable batteries were didn't show up till later in my life.

478
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,179
Speaker 1: Childhood like middle and high school in high school is when he had Rayovac renewal batteries and they were garbage.

479
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:20,760
Speaker 0: They were garbage power a game gear for like 10 minutes.

480
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:31,277
Speaker 1: I used them in our TI 80 calculators, right and I would keep we constantly be recharging them Like every teacher had multiple Rayovac rechargers and was constantly charging all the bad.

481
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:35,161
Speaker 0: high school They were like if you use rechargeable batteries, you're on your fucking own I know right.

482
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:42,056
Speaker 1: it was like they gave everyone real bad little batteries and then he could buy Double-a batteries in class.

483
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:44,126
Speaker 0: Oh, wow We're like a dollar each ever.

484
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:47,940
Speaker 1: they gave everyone one full set when they bought their calculator if you bought it from the school.

485
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:52,777
Speaker 0: But I bought my calculator at the store the store as did I because the store was like $40 cheaper.

486
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,353
Speaker 1: And I got it and I got an 86 instead of 83 like everyone else.

487
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone got an 83 but because I came in from another school district I went online.

488
00:35:00,781 --> 00:35:01,800
Speaker 0: I was yet alive.

489
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:10,226
Speaker 0: I got the 85 because it was superior in literally every six is even more superior in so in many aspects anyway But its memory was actually slower.

490
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,011
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was we had more of it.

491
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:13,636
Speaker 0: It did have a lot more of it.

492
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:23,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, so The point is I got the rate the same rechargeable batteries that everyone else had because that was convenient and then I bought even more Of them and during high school.

493
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:28,078
Speaker 1: I used those exclusively until I got to RIT and I didn't use the calculator anymore really.

494
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:38,898
Speaker 0: but Batteries like buying batteries putting them in devices and replacing them was a huge part Like of the like daily use of basic technology.

495
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:45,260
Speaker 1: Yeah They did not have devices that you plugged in and charged themselves with their built-in rechargeable batteries.

496
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,429
Speaker 1: That was very rare.

497
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,558
Speaker 1: Very very rare.

498
00:35:49,140 --> 00:36:07,035
Speaker 1: Rechargeable batteries period were rare and it was only you know Later on like when laptops were actually some of the first things that like had their own cells Attached to them that you could like swap out and such yep, and that was like the first thing that was using like lithium-ion batteries as laptops.

499
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:14,077
Speaker 1: and then you started seeing like iPods were actually one of the earliest things that charged themselves up right and that was you know, early 2000s.

500
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:15,069
Speaker 0: Yep.

501
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:18,271
Speaker 0: So all those batteries that are not rechargeable.

502
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:19,074
Speaker 1: people were actually like.

503
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:23,653
Speaker 1: I remember in the earliest days of iPods People were like why the fuck does this iPod not?

504
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,100
Speaker 1: let me like swap out the battery.

505
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:26,865
Speaker 1: Yeah Bones were also.

506
00:36:26,926 --> 00:36:34,130
Speaker 1: the earliest flip phones were some of the things that had their own batteries And you could swap those out on the earliest phones now.

507
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:41,480
Speaker 0: part of that was the expectation that up until that point The idea of an embedded battery was not a thing to most people.

508
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,271
Speaker 1: So you assume people would be upset by it.

509
00:36:44,312 --> 00:36:49,191
Speaker 1: people want to be able to swap out the batteries All right, because any other battery technology was so shitty.

510
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,380
Speaker 1: it would die and take a long time to recharge.

511
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,114
Speaker 0: Yep, and also batteries especially back then.

512
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,760
Speaker 1: and if the battery died You didn't want to have your whole expensive electronic device be dead.

513
00:36:58,121 --> 00:36:59,947
Speaker 1: You wanted to just swap out the battery and be good to go.

514
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,817
Speaker 0: and the kinds of rechargeable batteries back then.

515
00:37:02,837 --> 00:37:08,371
Speaker 0: and we're not gonna get into the difference between like Nycad batteries which were in early because we don't know.

516
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,583
Speaker 0: I know a little but it's not relevant Mm-hmm.

517
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:17,160
Speaker 0: I part of the reason I do a little was that I was really into like tape mixing and mixtapes and nonsense.

518
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,733
Speaker 0: So I had a lot of portable cassette audio devices.

519
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:22,876
Speaker 1: all mine took double-a's.

520
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,119
Speaker 1: even my dis man had double-a's.

521
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:24,556
Speaker 0: Yep.

522
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:32,273
Speaker 0: So I actually started getting different kinds of rechargeables for those because they had a physical motor that had to turn Actually needed a lot of power.

523
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the other things.

524
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,500
Speaker 1: I was using my ray of X and was that dis man?

525
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:50,551
Speaker 0: Yep But I think one thing well that I remember this very specific moment in my life because as a kid got a game gear And I didn't know a lot about batteries obviously But the game gear took six double-a's and that would last like three or four hours.

526
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:56,107
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah Gameboy GBA Gameboy color They all took double-a's.

527
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:59,298
Speaker 1: the DS was the one that you would first one that had its own battery.

528
00:37:59,358 --> 00:37:59,920
Speaker 1: That was different.

529
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,906
Speaker 1: You could swap it though.

530
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:01,388
Speaker 1: I did.

531
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:08,320
Speaker 1: I did swap the battery in my original DS But I think you can even swap the DS light battery and maybe even the 3ds better.

532
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:11,231
Speaker 1: I don't know about that But those are the ones where you started to charge itself.

533
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:14,204
Speaker 1: GBA took two double-a's and as a kid I don't know the SP.

534
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,210
Speaker 1: I think you charge the yeah.

535
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't have two double-a's.

536
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:19,180
Speaker 1: the GBA you did.

537
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,223
Speaker 0: I never had an SP's.

538
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:20,926
Speaker 0: I don't really remember.

539
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:21,648
Speaker 1: I have one now.

540
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:32,415
Speaker 0: Yeah in the in the drawer somewhere, but so My parents being a kid who didn't have any money They took issue with the fact that I ran these batteries out.

541
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,840
Speaker 0: every time we drove anywhere I basically went through six double-a batteries.

542
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:43,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they want they searched and they found you could buy this like I think it was official this rechargeable battery kit.

543
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,397
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, a lot of people had that what it was even bigger.

544
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:49,700
Speaker 0: it looked I was about to say it looks like a phone receiver like a phone.

545
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,494
Speaker 1: It was like two big wings coming off the side of the game.

546
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:54,359
Speaker 0: No, no the side one That's not what I had.

547
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,620
Speaker 0: I had this one that looked like the receiver on a telephone which is also as I went across the middle.

548
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, it hung from the bottom of the game gear.

549
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,200
Speaker 0: it weighed as much as the game gear by itself.

550
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:10,660
Speaker 0: It took like eight hours to charge it if I plugged it in and it powered the game gear for like three hours.

551
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,800
Speaker 1: Couldn't you just plug into the lighter on the in the car to keep your game gear going the whole time?

552
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,279
Speaker 1: I know lots of my friends did with it.

553
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,236
Speaker 0: Yeah So here is the problem the the actual device to plug that to plug into the game gear.

554
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:26,020
Speaker 0: cuz remember devices back then Didn't have a standard power input.

555
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,960
Speaker 1: No It had a interface that basically Mimicked the shape of all the six double-a batteries and went right in there and pretended to be bad.

556
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:34,505
Speaker 0: There was an AC adapter.

557
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,071
Speaker 0: Okay for the game gear.

558
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,235
Speaker 0: I think the Gameboy had one too.

559
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:38,198
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there was.

560
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:41,600
Speaker 0: yeah When I was playing at home, I just plugged in with the AC adapter.

561
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:54,767
Speaker 0: But the thing that cut the AC adapter plugs into the wall and or into the car Cigarette lighter which is extra funny because that interface stuck around even though that is not used as a cigarette lighter By anyone.

562
00:39:54,787 --> 00:40:00,700
Speaker 0: it hasn't been for a long time Yeah, but and it was just a convenient source of powers like a hack back in the day.

563
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,669
Speaker 1: These cars these days have USB in them a lot Yeah But they usually still have the old cigarette lighter port.

564
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:10,314
Speaker 0: because I'm gonna say some of them do but some because there's so many devices That use that socket.

565
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:10,557
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

566
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:31,620
Speaker 0: But the plug that you plugged into your device because your device took AC or took DC usually The only devices that are AC were like even older devices that were just motors basically Would have a proprietary connector That would not plug in anything else and took a particular voltage and had particular parameters.

567
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:42,478
Speaker 0: So as a result, you usually had to buy either a first-party car adapter That was often not cheap or you had to buy a bootleg one which before Amazon kind of hard to do.

568
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:50,840
Speaker 1: actually Yeah, imagine with no internet, you know e-commerce trying to buy like a Gameboy car adapter thing.

569
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,624
Speaker 1: It's like you.

570
00:40:51,644 --> 00:40:54,900
Speaker 1: better hope the one toy store has them somehow in stock.

571
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you're getting a first party order from a Nintendo catalog and hope you actually get it.

572
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:00,724
Speaker 1: Who knows what.

573
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,029
Speaker 0: and thus the problem.

574
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,435
Speaker 0: I had the game gear.

575
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:04,520
Speaker 0: my brother had the game boy.

576
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,227
Speaker 0: Which one of us gets to plug into the car?

577
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,220
Speaker 1: right anyway, so more battery stuff, right?

578
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,899
Speaker 1: So that eventually right phones iPods laptops.

579
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:15,400
Speaker 1: That's when the rechargeable battery started to really be in everything.

580
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:24,650
Speaker 1: Lithium-ion battery was invented and you finally had enough power density a good recharge time That obviously improved over time and also a battery life cycle.

581
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:33,580
Speaker 0: previous rechargeable batteries the more you cycled them And there's details as to what kind of cycling damaged them the most they wear out they get less and less.

582
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:42,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, those rail vac ones I was using the TI calculator you recharge and recharge and recharge and recharge them and then eventually they'd last like 10 minutes and Throw them out even though they're rechargeables.

583
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,596
Speaker 1: you can recharge them forever.

584
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:44,540
Speaker 1: a lithium-ion.

585
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,220
Speaker 1: You can recharge a ton of time and thus this is why ever but a ton of time.

586
00:41:49,280 --> 00:42:01,654
Speaker 0: This is why modern devices have an embedded usually not replaceable battery Mm-hmm because that way they get whatever that whatever the battery is You shouldn't care if it's lithium-ion or some other kind.

587
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:03,779
Speaker 0: you shouldn't care What?

588
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:10,924
Speaker 0: Particular method of cycling it or how much ambient power to leave in it if it's not used for a long amount of time and Shoot you deep cycle.

589
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:15,000
Speaker 0: that is wizard nonsense that no one should need to deal with in the modern era.

590
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:22,920
Speaker 0: So there is a circuit where the device knows how to manage its own battery to maximize its usability and longevity.

591
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:24,540
Speaker 1: You would hope you would hope so, right?

592
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:25,441
Speaker 1: It's like, you know I plug.

593
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:33,552
Speaker 1: I pretty much believe things plugged in even if they're 100% like a whole all the time and I trust that those devices Are smart enough to manage their own batteries intelligently.

594
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:34,696
Speaker 0: and kids in the old days.

595
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,128
Speaker 0: That was not true No, and the only rechargeable devices that game gear thing.

596
00:42:38,248 --> 00:42:42,120
Speaker 0: It said when the light turns green fucking unplug it or it might catch fire.

597
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:58,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like they're all sorts of like, okay, if you want the laptop even like think pads They'd be like, all right You know the all the always you would have spread rumors around like if you want your ThinkPad battery last the longest you got To let it drain down to 30% then charge it back up to 100 and then let go down to 30.

598
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:06,360
Speaker 1: Don't leave it plugged in when it's 100 and then once every few months Let it go down to zero and then all the way down to zero like a hundred percent dead and charge it up again.

599
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,585
Speaker 1: It's like what the hell.

600
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:08,127
Speaker 1: why do I got?

601
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:12,826
Speaker 1: shouldn't I just want to plug it in all the time whenever I can and only Unplug it when I have to?

602
00:43:12,846 --> 00:43:17,728
Speaker 1: so I use you know minimal battery power Yeah, and I want everything to be good now.

603
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:21,501
Speaker 0: So in my current laptop now, it's just Windows 10 Like.

604
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:25,277
Speaker 0: I wiped all the stuff but when I first got it, it had some like IBM stuff on it.

605
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:39,535
Speaker 0: The battery management software that came with it actually exposed all those details and you basically would choose Whether you wanted the battery to last longer in any given use like how long will the laptop run?

606
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:41,200
Speaker 0: and you could make it?

607
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,236
Speaker 0: Run a lot longer, but then the battery itself would have a shorter lifetime before it just stopped working.

608
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:53,740
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Most devices favor the battery lasting as long as the device is expected to last.

609
00:43:54,585 --> 00:44:10,080
Speaker 1: So during college for a short period of time I had a job working somewhere and one of the things that they made one of the things that they made there Was military like military batteries like batteries that military people actually use like they had a big charger on the back of their Humvee or whatever.

610
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,393
Speaker 1: And if these enormous friggin batteries used to power who knows what?

611
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:16,500
Speaker 1: or I guess I don't know power suits or whatever.

612
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,740
Speaker 1: And you know, they made like the recharging software and some of the hardware for these batteries.

613
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:23,931
Speaker 1: So they had them around.

614
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,520
Speaker 1: I wasn't working on them But my friend James did and I think he still works on batteries.

615
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:28,264
Speaker 1: I guess he.

616
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:31,320
Speaker 1: well you can't be on the show to tell us all his battery knowledge.

617
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,096
Speaker 1: He's probably so mad if he listens to this at our lack of battery knowledge.

618
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:38,530
Speaker 0: I remember You and him from our IT.

619
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,740
Speaker 1: those batteries were big Heavy and they lasted a long time and gave a lot of power.

620
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,586
Speaker 0: So everything we just talked about.

621
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:51,299
Speaker 0: there's a fundamental thing that you really need to know and this is why this is kind of an interesting topic.

622
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:57,160
Speaker 0: The better a battery is The more energy it holds per unit mass.

623
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:03,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, the more energy it holds for unit mass the more closely it resembles a hand grenade, right?

624
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,736
Speaker 0: I mean because there's more energy in a smaller space right thing about.

625
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:15,137
Speaker 1: it's like, okay No matter what battery technology it is chemicals or solid-state or who know whatever it is Whatever mechanism you have for holding energy, right?

626
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,216
Speaker 1: Electrons don't weigh nothing.

627
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,204
Speaker 1: We don't weigh nothing.

628
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:24,860
Speaker 1: well and if protons weigh even more right and so this you gotta have the protons any electrons in there.

629
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:32,135
Speaker 1: Uh, and if you want a battery lasts a long time Right, you got to have you know, a lot more energy in there.

630
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:33,720
Speaker 1: energy is mass.

631
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,459
Speaker 0: I'm shit.

632
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:53,699
Speaker 0: I make no statement as to everything you just said and I'm going to simplify that to simply say that the more energy density something has the more catastrophic a Rapid uncontrolled release of that energy would be case in point You take that old shitty battery pack for my game gear and shove out an iron spike through it.

633
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:55,339
Speaker 0: It'll probably go play.

634
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:03,262
Speaker 0: Well, look at how many people shove an iron spike through like just a raw modern lithium-ion cell full energy and it'll kill you All right.

635
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,520
Speaker 1: Look how many people I got my got my cell phone exploded.

636
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:11,245
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, cuz you have a battery and there were the insane amount of energy in it And they actually can.

637
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:23,344
Speaker 1: there is technology out there to make some kinds of batteries that are better in terms of you know Energy than the ones we have but you're not allowed to use them or they won't like people won't mail them and stuff because it's like Well, they're super dangerous.

638
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:26,573
Speaker 1: There's a lot of energy in a space or they have other trade-offs.

639
00:46:26,593 --> 00:46:32,540
Speaker 0: They're very expensive manufacture very heavy They take a long time to recharge or a lot of them act more like primary cell.

640
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:42,000
Speaker 0: Like if you have a battery that is not intended to be rechargeable There are ways to make very long-lasting batteries, but then they run out Yeah, and then you gotta get another one and give you an extreme.

641
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,611
Speaker 1: Oh, they don't go nicely into.

642
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:47,497
Speaker 0: inside of an iPhone case There is actually the concept of a nuclear battery.

643
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:56,760
Speaker 0: now These are not commonly used except in space and like old Soviet era like remote unmanned lighthouses.

644
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:07,000
Speaker 1: But a nuclear battery is a battery that weighs more than you can imagine, but it's relatively small Because it's got you know radioactive elements which tend to have really high numbers and are thus heavy.

645
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,632
Speaker 0: But it also needs shielding because it's radioactive.

646
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:12,558
Speaker 1: Yes is led in the radioactivity is.

647
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:18,440
Speaker 0: Well, basically, usually they're actually just generating ambient heat which is then some sort of Peltier device.

648
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:24,735
Speaker 0: there's a lot of ways to get a nuclear battery, but They these are a battery that if you had one it'll output.

649
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:31,987
Speaker 0: however many volts it outputs You know how much energy it you it provides for like 20 years Depends on the half-life, but yeah fucking long-ass time.

650
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:43,559
Speaker 0: You have a battery that will last consistently 20 years of constant use Mm-hmm, but if you break that battery open It'll kill you and a lot of other people nearby.

651
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,556
Speaker 0: They'll get the cancer and it'll also way too much to put in.

652
00:47:46,596 --> 00:47:56,295
Speaker 1: say a car Yeah You're not putting even like even it was like a flake imagine like a cornflake worth of radioactive material Right and then putting a whole battery around that and somehow getting that in your phone.

653
00:47:56,315 --> 00:47:59,629
Speaker 0: It's like no Regulators might have a big issue with.

654
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,759
Speaker 1: but even half a cornflake is too much.

655
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,923
Speaker 0: So think of these.

656
00:48:03,003 --> 00:48:08,660
Speaker 0: this is the the boundaries of the idea of a battery and a portable energy or semi portable energy repository.

657
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:13,376
Speaker 0: You can go from a nuclear battery that lasts forever to a tiny flake that will kill anyone.

658
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:27,890
Speaker 0: It looks at it crosswise Mm-hmm, and it's just a matter of use cases material science Chemical science and it's a field that needs to evolve further to do the kinds of things We want to do with technology that we can't do today.

659
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:29,820
Speaker 0: the Tesla like those electric cars.

660
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:34,020
Speaker 0: It is amazing that there are batteries that can hold that much power.

661
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:35,024
Speaker 1: Well, there's a also.

662
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:39,080
Speaker 1: you just use a lot of batteries and it somehow manages to not be too heavy.

663
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,340
Speaker 0: So the motor can actually push the car, but there is a huge number of batteries in there.

664
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,959
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's like a whole tray of them, right?

665
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:52,751
Speaker 0: But when you we already you're already breaking down the I how many cells comprise a battery Doesn't really matter to a modern person.

666
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,500
Speaker 0: No, I'm working in the technology.

667
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:57,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't realize it but like okay you open up your iPhone is it?

668
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:58,840
Speaker 1: there's like a rectangle battery in there.

669
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:01,050
Speaker 1: The battery is not a rectangle shape.

670
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,376
Speaker 1: batteries are cylinder shaped.

671
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:04,620
Speaker 1: if you open that up There's a ton of little cylinders in there.

672
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,119
Speaker 1: You don't care how many or whether they're in series or rows or anything, but that's that's how it is.

673
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:10,448
Speaker 0: So not all of them are.

674
00:49:10,468 --> 00:49:11,900
Speaker 0: there are other shapes of batteries.

675
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:23,150
Speaker 0: But the point is unless you work on the internals of batteries specifically the beauty of the modern world is that there is circuitry and electronics Intelligence between you and all that bullshit.

676
00:49:23,532 --> 00:49:29,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you don't need to know what's actually going on But yeah, most batteries are actually a whole bunch of smaller batteries combined.

677
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:31,509
Speaker 1: Yep, right because it's like it's cheaper.

678
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:42,170
Speaker 1: right you can instead of making some custom battery You can just buy these stock cells and just arrange them to get the voltage you need and the life you need Right and then encase them in something and put a connector on the end.

679
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,960
Speaker 0: So in terms of practical example, it's kind of interesting.

680
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,487
Speaker 0: Remember I bought that weird phone.

681
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:49,480
Speaker 0: like everyone else has a normal Android phone or an iPhone.

682
00:49:49,562 --> 00:49:50,340
Speaker 1: Are you the Sony thing?

683
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,540
Speaker 0: I have the weird Sony thing and the real deal with the Sony thing is the battery lasts twice as long as any other phone.

684
00:49:54,641 --> 00:50:01,678
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it's not as powerful as the other phones Like the Samsung galaxies are like ridiculous CPU ridiculous screen ridiculous GPU.

685
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:05,146
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh Yours is much more reasonable like iPhone 5c.

686
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:09,820
Speaker 0: the batteries we put in phones all pretty much have the same energy density.

687
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:18,178
Speaker 0: So the only factors in terms of how long your cell phone's battery last can last How big it is how heavy it is and how much your phone uses.

688
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:30,474
Speaker 0: Yep And thus there's an interesting situation where a larger phone will have a much larger screen that has to be lit very brightly But can also have a much larger battery in it.

689
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:30,856
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:31,900
Speaker 1: Well, you need it to accommodate.

691
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:39,962
Speaker 0: My tiny phone actually does not have a lot of room for battery But at the same time it also has a much smaller screen with many fewer pixels and a slower processor Right.

692
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:46,300
Speaker 1: So the other thing is that when you if you're thinking about saving battery life on your phone Keep the screen off the screen uses the most energy.

693
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:55,460
Speaker 0: That is why we talk so much about how smartwatches are so great because if you have a smartwatch You're not gonna turn your phone screen on as much you'll be shocked at how much longer your phone's batteries last.

694
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the Bluetooth uses a Bluetooth is very low energy depending there.

695
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:01,058
Speaker 0: They well, it should be.

696
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:04,246
Speaker 1: there's also Specifically NFC and Bluetooth.

697
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:11,734
Speaker 1: low energy is actually a protocol that exists is different from Bluetooth and if you use Bluetooth low energy It's way less energy than turning on your screen.

698
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:15,490
Speaker 0: Yep, way less So in terms of practical battery stuff.

699
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:19,666
Speaker 0: modern laptops, you don't need to worry anymore Like I think Lenovo.

700
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:24,020
Speaker 0: you can still buy like you pick which got the batteries just like they do.

701
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:26,528
Speaker 1: They do sell as far as I know.

702
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:31,706
Speaker 1: like you can buy a bigger battery pack because I bought what they're like six cell And nine cell ones you can.

703
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:34,494
Speaker 1: you can buy a battery that was bigger heavier and lasted longer.

704
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:38,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, my x230 I bought the Six cell one.

705
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,500
Speaker 0: there was a four cell I think and I forget you bought the new one.

706
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't buy the biggest one because it was really big.

707
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:47,420
Speaker 1: Oh, I had a normal one and I had one that was big and stuck out the back a little bit.

708
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:55,451
Speaker 0: Yep So the one I bought sticks down a little bit and the bigger one Sticks down more and also sticks back and weighs so much.

709
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:56,374
Speaker 0: like I went lifted one.

710
00:51:56,394 --> 00:51:57,698
Speaker 0: I didn't get that one.

711
00:51:57,718 --> 00:51:58,260
Speaker 0: It was too much.

712
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:02,135
Speaker 0: but Where was I going with that?

713
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:08,120
Speaker 0: Alright modern laptops unless it's one of those weird laptops like it like it just has a battery.

714
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:09,998
Speaker 0: Just use your laptop and don't think about it.

715
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,421
Speaker 1: now.

716
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:20,560
Speaker 1: the one last thing you I think about here is for a lot of things and this is I've encountered this a lot with cameras is People companies want to sell you their specific battery, right?

717
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,705
Speaker 1: So you look at my camera.

718
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:24,600
Speaker 1: is Panasonic Panasonic sells a battery for it.

719
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,896
Speaker 1: That battery costs a lot of money like 70 bucks or like a tiny like 40 to 60 bucks.

720
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:36,480
Speaker 1: Alright now they're nice in that they've what they've done, you know Some of the companies do nice things and not nice things, right?

721
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,293
Speaker 1: One of the nice things they did is the gh3 the gh4 and the gh5.

722
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:44,409
Speaker 1: if you keep using their camera system They all use the exact same battery.

723
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,860
Speaker 1: They haven't changed the battery at all, right?

724
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,580
Speaker 1: So you can you know, they've had the same battery.

725
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,760
Speaker 1: They've been made and it's good for them too because they just keep manufacturing the same battery.

726
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,520
Speaker 1: You don't have to redesign it or anything, right and it's got enough power.

727
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,100
Speaker 1: It lasts a hell of a long time longer than a lot of batteries and other cameras.

728
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:05,380
Speaker 1: But anyway, the thing is that battery is expensive like 40 to 60 bucks depending on where you get it if you get an official one.

729
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,870
Speaker 1: So maybe you want to get a cheaper one.

730
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,320
Speaker 1: plenty of other people make the same exact battery.

731
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,448
Speaker 1: It's just not the official battery.

732
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:14,175
Speaker 1: It's made by like wasabi Co.

733
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:21,060
Speaker 1: which is somewhat legit Yeah, but it's not obviously not official or even shady your bootleg one that says pass anonic on it.

734
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:29,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought a variety of non first-party batteries over the years with a wide array of effects.

735
00:53:29,322 --> 00:53:32,160
Speaker 1: Sometimes you buy a third-party battery, right?

736
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:40,180
Speaker 1: And that third-party battery lasts five seconds or explodes or sets on fire or is useless or who knows what or?

737
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,920
Speaker 1: Some some devices these days even have like DRM and are like, ah, I see that that is not an official battery.

738
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,956
Speaker 1: I refuse to turn on even though I would otherwise be able to work because I want.

739
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:53,752
Speaker 1: I want you to buy the $50 battery, but it's interesting.

740
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,820
Speaker 0: my old Panasonic camcorder.

741
00:53:55,001 --> 00:53:58,942
Speaker 0: I have two official batteries and I have like six bootleg batteries I got from.

742
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:01,951
Speaker 0: I get them from anyway somewhere.

743
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:12,020
Speaker 0: the bootleg batteries all worked at first just fine But then over time one by one they stopped working and the camcorder would be like this is not an official battery.

744
00:54:12,494 --> 00:54:16,833
Speaker 0: Yeah I've had but I didn't have any firmware update and I figured out what actually was happening.

745
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:21,709
Speaker 0: is those batteries the bootleg ones were just pieces Of shit and their voltage was fluctuating too much.

746
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:22,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

747
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:31,091
Speaker 1: Now the wasabi batteries I have are actually, you know they're so cheap compared to the the official ones and Occasionally very occasionally you'll get a message.

748
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:35,139
Speaker 1: That's like I see that battery is not legit But then you just restart the camera and it works.

749
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,920
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's like it's like that small hassle is worth it, right?

750
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Speaker 1: You're only gonna pay if you are so important Whatever you're shooting with your whatever your door your whatever device you're using camera or otherwise.

751
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:50,260
Speaker 1: If it's so important that it works perfectly then pay for the official battery.

752
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:59,938
Speaker 1: If you absolutely cannot deal with an exploding battery and you're so nervous by the make sure you're getting the official one and not a bootleg that looks like the official one or really on Amazon.

753
00:55:00,238 --> 00:55:06,200
Speaker 0: if you Cannot afford to have something go tragically wrong with an expensive piece of electronics that you saved up for.

754
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,838
Speaker 0: Don't if you bought a thousand dollar camera, don't try to save 40 bucks on a battery, right?

755
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:16,557
Speaker 1: It's like, okay I understand that you don't have a lot of money and you saved a long time for this thousand dollar camera.

756
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:23,400
Speaker 1: because you don't have a lot of money Save even more money for the good battery because if the thousand dollar camera goes down you're going down.

757
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:24,668
Speaker 0: I'm like this LED panel.

758
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,318
Speaker 0: I got here that I paid like 20 bucks for.

759
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:36,469
Speaker 0: I Bought a bunch of cheapo bootleg batteries for those things because if these LED pay if every LED panel I own broke today because the batteries exploded.

760
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:40,040
Speaker 0: I'm not out that much money because I don't buy good light panels.

761
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:48,852
Speaker 1: So the new camera I got came with a legit battery and what actually I've been doing is I've been treating it like That battery is actually an internal non-removable battery.

762
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:59,440
Speaker 1: I just plugged the camera into micro USB at night Right, but I did buy two wasabi batteries for it, which were ridiculously cheap and they work just fine perfectly.

763
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:07,800
Speaker 1: So that if I'm ever in a situation where I'm out so long that the battery dies I can swap those bad boys in right because and they just they totally were great.

764
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,206
Speaker 1: It was like wasabi.

765
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:09,910
Speaker 1: is this brand?

766
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,412
Speaker 1: and I'm not.

767
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:10,693
Speaker 1: I'm not.

768
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:13,078
Speaker 1: I guess I am shilling for them But they didn't pay me for this.

769
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:18,295
Speaker 1: I've honestly just like a happy customer of a bootleg battery that you can buy.

770
00:56:18,315 --> 00:56:23,194
Speaker 1: an Amazon that I've had good Experiences with doesn't works almost all the time.

771
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:24,600
Speaker 1: I've had a lot of recharges.

772
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,113
Speaker 0: I've had good and bad with wasabi, but I've never had exploded bad.

773
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,120
Speaker 0: I've only had it just doesn't work anymore.

774
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,586
Speaker 1: But I've never had doesn't work anymore.

775
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:32,750
Speaker 0: Like oh my god works.

776
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,220
Speaker 0: They're sitting right there cuz I just haven't dealt with them yet.

777
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:39,515
Speaker 1: All right, but they always give you a charger and they're so cheap Like you don't even feel bad if they don't work.

778
00:56:39,555 --> 00:56:44,945
Speaker 0: as well as the yeah Charges I've had a couple of their chargers that make Terrifying noises sometimes.

779
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:48,797
Speaker 0: I haven't had that either but then again some of my light panels make terrifying noises.

780
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:53,840
Speaker 1: cuz they're yes Yes, I've had those yeah Anyway, but yeah, it's a little shaky.

781
00:56:54,001 --> 00:57:02,840
Speaker 1: Like you hear stories about battery setting on fire and stuff and those are real stories, you know Cuz there's so much energy in the little battery and if it's not well made its bootleg, you know.

782
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,825
Speaker 1: Then they could happen.

783
00:57:03,845 --> 00:57:06,278
Speaker 1: and official batteries, you know that you get from the.

784
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:11,840
Speaker 1: you know Full price for they're gonna be more expensive But they're gonna be work and they're gonna have a much better chance of being safe.

785
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:14,451
Speaker 1: Not a guarantee of being safe, but pretty rare.

786
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:20,880
Speaker 1: It's gonna be unsafe, but Even if you have money, it's just not worth it to buy the official batteries.

787
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:26,600
Speaker 1: You can get pretty good third-party ones that are good enough now regardless of whether or not as a first party.

788
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:40,180
Speaker 0: You should definitely treat your batteries with respect In the sense that old kinds of batteries even rechargeable ones They really wouldn't do anything too bad if you disrespected them or were careless with them.

789
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:47,214
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but like if I drop a lithium-ion cell like a big one not the tiny ones But like the ones that are on the back of my camera.

790
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:53,452
Speaker 0: if I drop one one I don't Immediately retrieve it just to make sure it didn't have a problem.

791
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:58,680
Speaker 0: Like I give it a few seconds like okay It didn't explode and then just inspect your batteries.

792
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,087
Speaker 0: Like if you if something happens to one of your battery if it's inflating a little bit if it inflates even a little bit Like take it outside.

793
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,040
Speaker 1: I have some GoPro batteries didn't play a little bit.

794
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:12,980
Speaker 0: Yeah If that happens just get them out of your house as soon as possible and put them somewhere Where if they start a fire, it won't burn anything.

795
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:20,040
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, cuz that is sign number one that a modern rechargeable battery might be about to catch fire and hurt you very badly.

796
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:28,100
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if your phone starts to expand a little bit That means the foil that the cells are in is expanding and you are fucked.

797
00:58:29,004 --> 00:58:30,791
Speaker 0: Take the phone out of your pocket and put it outside.

798
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:39,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, um if you get them wet Especially dropping them though because dropping them especially a big battery can very often cause a problem More.

799
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:46,369
Speaker 1: this is why the GoPro batteries had the problem because you know GoPro the action camera It's getting jostled quite a bit.

800
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:47,473
Speaker 1: Yep.

801
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:48,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, have a careful.

802
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:52,830
Speaker 1: There's one more thing I want to say.

803
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,239
Speaker 0: do you remember what it was?

804
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,231
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so a lot of people out there like in my work.

805
00:58:57,272 --> 00:59:02,590
Speaker 1: I have this problem a lot of People not recharging the batteries properly, right?

806
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:07,968
Speaker 1: So when you get a battery as rechargeable, you know It's designed to go with a particular charger.

807
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:11,140
Speaker 1: the people who made the charger designed it with a particular battery in mind.

808
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:14,491
Speaker 1: You can't just go putting like eneloop's in the energizer charger.

809
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:16,658
Speaker 1: No, also people at my work.

810
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:17,260
Speaker 1: They so dumb.

811
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:22,569
Speaker 1: They're taking batteries that aren't even rechargeable and just like shoving them in a charger It's like what the hell are you doing?

812
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,339
Speaker 1: That's battery's not even rechargeable.

813
00:59:24,781 --> 00:59:26,448
Speaker 0: So the worst part is there are.

814
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,718
Speaker 0: I remember when I was a kid there were cut.

815
00:59:28,738 --> 00:59:34,932
Speaker 0: you could buy Things that ostensibly would recharge a non rechargeable battery.

816
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:38,100
Speaker 0: knew those things were bad fucking news.

817
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:40,966
Speaker 0: So what I did?

818
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:43,355
Speaker 1: luckily the eneloop charger is smart enough to like.

819
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:47,160
Speaker 1: not mess around but yeah Recharge batteries in the charger that came with it.

820
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,364
Speaker 1: I'll even have like.

821
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:53,080
Speaker 1: I have wasabi batteries and official batteries and then I have a wasabi charger and an official charge.

822
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:53,911
Speaker 0: I don't mix the two.

823
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:54,560
Speaker 1: I don't mix them.

824
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:05,420
Speaker 1: I use the wasabi charger and the wasabi batteries and the regular batteries and the regular charger and I don't cross them because you know The charger was designed to recharge that battery and you don't want to confuse it.

825
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:10,680
Speaker 0: I have occasionally put the bootleg battery in the real charger because the chargers what has the logic?

826
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:14,580
Speaker 1: I would I usually I might do that, but I will go the other way.

827
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:18,176
Speaker 0: I will never put a legit battery in this like cheap plastic wasabi.

828
01:00:18,196 --> 01:00:20,826
Speaker 1: That's even scarier Yeah, but I don't.

829
01:00:20,886 --> 01:00:21,851
Speaker 1: I try not to do either.

830
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,519
Speaker 1: but yes one is better than the other.

831
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:28,217
Speaker 0: Yeah If you have to so for my own personal batteries because remember we could.

832
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:28,780
Speaker 0: there's sort of two.

833
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:31,708
Speaker 0: There's three types of batteries kind of the thing we can end on.

834
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:35,499
Speaker 0: there's portable power bank that has USB holes in it.

835
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:40,060
Speaker 0: Mmm, I think everyone should own at least one small one because you can recharge your cell phone.

836
01:00:40,342 --> 01:00:42,232
Speaker 1: I have I have one that's like the energy.

837
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:43,540
Speaker 0: It's nothing so ancient.

838
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:47,615
Speaker 1: It's so ancient, but it has plenty of energy can recharge my phone several times.

839
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:48,860
Speaker 1: It can recharge lots of stuff.

840
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,266
Speaker 1: It has enough cables.

841
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:54,820
Speaker 1: It can recharge almost any device ever has plugs for everything.

842
01:00:55,661 --> 01:00:56,444
Speaker 1: It's not USB.

843
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:57,690
Speaker 0: my little anchors cuz one.

844
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:00,080
Speaker 0: my anchor just has a couple of USB holes in it.

845
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,365
Speaker 1: Yes I have a tiny anchor.

846
01:01:01,405 --> 01:01:02,389
Speaker 1: There's like a little cylinder.

847
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:03,554
Speaker 1: That's one USB.

848
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:04,940
Speaker 1: It'll try my phone up once.

849
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:06,970
Speaker 1: It'll charge my phone up like two or three times.

850
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:07,954
Speaker 0: Oh, you got the bigger one.

851
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:09,120
Speaker 1: No, I got a free one.

852
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,120
Speaker 1: They sent me for being a good customer.

853
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:13,399
Speaker 1: I just keep it in my bag at all times.

854
01:01:13,721 --> 01:01:17,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if my phone I can always bring it out if I ever need a phone charge and it's rare.

855
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:18,903
Speaker 1: But it I have it.

856
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:19,666
Speaker 0: so I have that too.

857
01:01:19,766 --> 01:01:23,900
Speaker 0: I also have a big one that will recharge an iPhone like four times.

858
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:39,093
Speaker 0: but I only use that for like plugging devices into or Powering my phone if I'm doing GPS tracking over like a really long hike in the wilderness Or like I brought that on the Holland Valley Railroad as my power in the tent.

859
01:01:39,635 --> 01:01:39,795
Speaker 1: Mmm.

860
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,520
Speaker 0: So that's a use case.

861
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,753
Speaker 0: So just you should own one of those if you don't know which one to get.

862
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:47,629
Speaker 0: just buy like whatever the cheapest anchor branded One is they're fine.

863
01:01:47,649 --> 01:02:05,779
Speaker 0: Uh There's the specialized batteries Which is what we've been mostly talking about just now like the ones you use on an expensive camera or an LED panel And we've talked of that enough for Batteries that are the shape of a double or triple-a battery to use with any old device Which I feel like is increasingly an obsolete use case.

864
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:10,396
Speaker 0: I mean the only devices I have that use those today are 9 volt batteries.

865
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,085
Speaker 0: go to my smoke detectors Mm-hmm.

866
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:13,679
Speaker 0: Fuck that that is such a pain in the ass.

867
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:15,508
Speaker 1: I have a whole bunch of 9 volt.

868
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:19,241
Speaker 0: The only other thing 9 volt batteries seem to be used for is Microphones.

869
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:30,800
Speaker 0: more wireless microphone devices also non wireless but true pretty much any microphone that needs a battery seems to use 9 But increasingly people seem to be moving toward double-a in there because 9 volt is just an annoying form factor.

870
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:35,859
Speaker 1: I got a 9 volt in the microphone that goes on top of my camera and I bought a whole pack of them from Amazon basics

871
01:02:36,104 --> 01:02:36,613
Speaker 0: yep, and

872
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,542
Speaker 1: Back

873
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:37,943
Speaker 0: of them - I

874
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:43,764
Speaker 1: accidentally left the microphone on overnight and I've used it a whole bunch and I used it like all day At the fucking review.

875
01:02:43,784 --> 01:02:45,673
Speaker 1: con like, you know, it's like and you know what?

876
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,240
Speaker 1: It's still on the first 9 volt.

877
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:57,569
Speaker 0: Yep I bought a pack of those same 9 volt batteries because all the smoke detectors in our apartment when the 9 volt bed They're powered by real power They have wires But they also have a 9 volt battery.

878
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,899
Speaker 0: as the backups of the powers out the smoke detector still works.

879
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:11,900
Speaker 0: if a smoke detectors battery fails, it'll make it a really high-pitched annoying chirp at Really short intervals forever and there's no way to stop that short of replacing that 9 volt battery.

880
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:23,639
Speaker 0: Let me tell you when that starts happening at 3 in the morning and you do not have another 9 volt battery Welcome to hell Especially when the rabbits hear it and they you cannot explain to them.

881
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:33,973
Speaker 0: So I basically use antelopes now and the inter only Sanyo Panasonic antelope is the best.

882
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:37,349
Speaker 1: double a triple a CD rechargeable battery.

883
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:39,440
Speaker 0: if you need C's or D's the fuck is wrong with you.

884
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:43,640
Speaker 1: What they do if you need C or D is actually these plastic cylinders.

885
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:49,540
Speaker 1: And you put your double-a antelopes into the plastic cylinder and now your double-a fits into the C or D hole.

886
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:52,849
Speaker 1: They don't actually make C and D batteries.

887
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,716
Speaker 0: I kept the D hole like the shapes.

888
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:57,160
Speaker 1: I kept them but I've never used them.

889
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,180
Speaker 0: I got rid of the C's cuz I don't own anything that could take a C bad.

890
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,667
Speaker 1: You never know when you'll find something.

891
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:03,290
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

892
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,878
Speaker 0: what about a single a or a B?

893
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:13,923
Speaker 1: Actually the stylus that comes with the Microsoft Surface Pro that I have at work what has a Quadruple?

894
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:14,625
Speaker 1: a bad.

895
01:04:14,786 --> 01:04:16,171
Speaker 0: I've seen those around.

896
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,476
Speaker 1: I've never seen one before in my life.

897
01:04:17,516 --> 01:04:18,620
Speaker 1: I was like, what the fuck is this?

898
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,758
Speaker 1: Where the hell do I get another one when this dies?

899
01:04:22,061 --> 01:04:24,930
Speaker 1: You don't recharge it like you do with the Apple magic pencil.

900
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:27,277
Speaker 1: You had to buy a new battery for it Wow.

901
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:38,420
Speaker 0: Yeah But With antelope, there's the normal ones, but they actually have two Weird use cases and three different antelopes, but and there's different generations of antelope.

902
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:44,320
Speaker 1: But it's hard to tell the difference between the generations and as far as the users concerned the difference in the generations doesn't really matter.

903
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,734
Speaker 0: But there's normal ones and normally we'll use those.

904
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:47,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to point out noise.

905
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:48,342
Speaker 1: You're curious.

906
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:54,080
Speaker 1: if you don't if you don't know better just take the normal white and loops if you somehow really know what you're doing.

907
01:04:54,401 --> 01:05:01,580
Speaker 1: They have the el cheapo antelopes, which are light don't last as long but are way cheaper and they're way lighter.

908
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,205
Speaker 0: Yes, they weigh a lot less.

909
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:11,696
Speaker 0: So this is where you like you're putting a camera on a drone and like every ounce counts Yeah, or you know that the device you're putting the batteries.

910
01:05:11,736 --> 01:05:12,800
Speaker 1: It doesn't need a lot of energy.

911
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,964
Speaker 1: It's a really low drain device like a portable radio or something and you want it to be lighter and you know Save some money or whatever.

912
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:23,060
Speaker 1: You can get the cheapo antelopes that are light and I guess more efficient and whatever.

913
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,155
Speaker 0: There's also an aloo pros and I have eight a double-a and aloo Pro cells.

914
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,000
Speaker 0: They cost way more than a regular one.

915
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're way heavier.

916
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:31,808
Speaker 1: Yeah,

917
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:45,760
Speaker 0: like if you hold a regular one and one of these like it is Interesting how much heavier the the pro one is and also I didn't measure this to be sure They're a little bit bigger like they're skirting the line of actually being a double-a

918
01:05:46,202 --> 01:05:50,544
Speaker 1: Big as a double-a as you can fit into a thing if it's one of those Battery holder mine

919
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:54,620
Speaker 0: are scraped to fucking hell because they barely fit in the Marantz.

920
01:05:55,423 --> 01:05:57,431
Speaker 0: Like I have to shove them into the Marantz.

921
01:05:57,592 --> 01:06:04,120
Speaker 1: I mean while the regular and loop slides in just fine I use the eneloop pros mostly for not for gaming controllers for those uses regular and loop.

922
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,320
Speaker 0: Yep, I love those for a camera flashes.

923
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,420
Speaker 0: I use the pros for camera flash and I use the pros for the Marantz audio recorders.

924
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,633
Speaker 0: We have hmm, which I have three of them.

925
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:14,740
Speaker 0: I found another cheap one.

926
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,198
Speaker 1: I use them for things that Can only be double-a.

927
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:20,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, I absolutely need them to.

928
01:06:20,766 --> 01:06:25,700
Speaker 1: I need to like be guaranteed that they're not gonna like turn off right like a recording device.

929
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,233
Speaker 0: But even then these are not like pay for these expensive batteries and your thing lasts twice as long.

930
01:06:30,273 --> 01:06:33,466
Speaker 0: it lasts like 10 to 20% Longer, yeah, it's not.

931
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:35,840
Speaker 1: they're not that much better than the regular ones.

932
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:41,380
Speaker 1: But you only get them if you really have a situation where you must have the more power.

933
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:42,543
Speaker 1: It's a high-powered.

934
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,228
Speaker 1: but what I would recommend now?

935
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:47,196
Speaker 0: this might have changed and so you can double-check.

936
01:06:47,256 --> 01:07:00,669
Speaker 0: but I bought several of the eneloop pro Charger because the old regular eneloop charger had a thing where you had to put two batteries in at a time Minimum and it would charge them in groups of two.

937
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:01,110
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

938
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:03,740
Speaker 0: The pro one charges every cell individually.

939
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:08,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, as far as I can tell all it was just an upgrade of the charger model.

940
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:15,011
Speaker 1: Yep, so like even if you go today to buy white eneloop and it comes with the white charger It's the same actual model as the charger.

941
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,979
Speaker 1: The clearly charge your pro battery - I don't know They're all it's the exact same model number.

942
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,740
Speaker 1: It's just if you buy the white one of the black one that the plastic is white or black.

943
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:25,129
Speaker 1: But it's actually the same exact charger.

944
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,660
Speaker 1: There's a okay old one is actually a different model.

945
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,606
Speaker 1: It's way back.

946
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:30,377
Speaker 1: It's like there's something something 17 or who knows?

947
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:36,940
Speaker 0: I bought the pros actually a long time ago and it's kind of amazing that these cells still work great so many years later.

948
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:40,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have not had a single eneloop battery ever.

949
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:43,020
Speaker 1: like not be able to recharge and keep working.

950
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:43,928
Speaker 1: That's how good they are.

951
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,331
Speaker 1: Of course.

952
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,179
Speaker 1: I do have a ton of them.

953
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:48,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I I don't need to buy any more ever because I have so many.

954
01:07:48,713 --> 01:07:49,476
Speaker 0: I have 24 double A's.

955
01:07:50,641 --> 01:07:52,207
Speaker 0: I have eight pro double A's.

956
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:53,814
Speaker 0: I have four triple A's.

957
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,040
Speaker 0: cuz I really don't need those anymore.

958
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:58,475
Speaker 1: I use them pretty much in game controllers and camera flashes.

959
01:07:58,515 --> 01:07:58,756
Speaker 0: Yep.

960
01:07:58,877 --> 01:07:59,580
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

961
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:04,369
Speaker 0: I use them for a little while because my bike has lights on it But now I just use primary cells in my bike lights.

962
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:06,520
Speaker 1: all my bike lights now are USB charged.

963
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,151
Speaker 1: No, I still have one bike light that takes double a.

964
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:21,169
Speaker 0: still my take double or triple a. yeah And primary cells are just better for that kind of purpose because there's a lot of primary cells are pretty rugged compared to Rechargeable cells and they will survive things better.

965
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,651
Speaker 0: Hmm.

966
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:22,273
Speaker 1: Whatever.

967
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:22,755
Speaker 1: All right.

968
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:23,417
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

969
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:23,858
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

970
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:24,340
Speaker 1: batteries.

971
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:32,859
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
