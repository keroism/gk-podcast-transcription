1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,926

Speaker 0: Let's do this Now.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:33,290
Speaker 0: I should note we're gonna try to avoid talking about any of the non tech aspects of because they're obvious.

9
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:34,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're obvious.

10
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:37,989
Speaker 1: the way you shouldn't work zillion hours a week.

11
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:45,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the only exception would be if work is also life, but That's a sad person.

12
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:46,234
Speaker 0: Well.

13
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:46,716
Speaker 0: Well.

14
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:46,996
Speaker 0: What if?

15
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:47,237
Speaker 0: what?

16
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:55,602
Speaker 0: if my job Scott mm-hmm is to hang out on the beach and relax I'm putting in extra hours for that job.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,950
Speaker 1: I'm gonna murder you and take your job.

18
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:02,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but in that case or you're gonna put in a good word for me And I'll get hired and you'll get as high signing bonus.

19
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:11,770
Speaker 0: I mean I spent a lot of late nights working on geek nights when I could have been asleep Back in the day when it would take us a couple hours to actually put a show together after we recorded it.

20
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,222
Speaker 0: But I digress that's in the second part of the show, but yeah, I was in Istanbul all last week Ironically in Turkey over Thanksgiving, so I did not have any turkey.

21
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,506
Speaker 1: is that really ironic?

22
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:24,634
Speaker 0: uh no It's ironic.

23
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:42,550
Speaker 0: That's why I said ironic with an ironic lilt perhaps but Nobody who everyone I talked to who knew that I was gonna be in Turkey over Thanksgiving Had to basically make some Observation along those lines of ah you're gonna be what?

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,286
Speaker 1: Instead of having been the turkey what three times now?

25
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:47,653
Speaker 1: more than that I mean the turkey.

26
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,910
Speaker 1: the Turkish people know that the name of their country in English is the name of a bird.

27
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,164
Speaker 0: I so so right let us know that they do.

28
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:56,590
Speaker 1: and what do they think about that?

29
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,434
Speaker 0: They don't think about it.

30
00:01:58,735 --> 00:01:58,996
Speaker 1: Okay.

31
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:03,790
Speaker 0: They do eat turkeys on Christmas, which they celebrate even though they call it turkey.

32
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:07,041
Speaker 0: I don't know because everyone I do business where.

33
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,366
Speaker 1: what is the Arabic word for Turkey?

34
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,630
Speaker 0: so they don't speak Arabic.

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,693
Speaker 1: I thought they speak it up.

36
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,261
Speaker 0: They speak Turkish.

37
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:12,682
Speaker 1: I didn't know.

38
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:13,787
Speaker 1: Turkish is a different language.

39
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:15,411
Speaker 1: Wow What's that?

40
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,032
Speaker 1: was it different?

41
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:18,095
Speaker 0: It's completely different.

42
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:22,614
Speaker 0: It's more based on Greek than it is based on Anything else.

43
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,537
Speaker 1: did not know this?

44
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,284
Speaker 0: Wow really okay?

45
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:26,950
Speaker 0: You listen to 12 Byzantine rulers.

46
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't know.

47
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:30,242
Speaker 1: how much do you think I remember?

48
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,025
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

49
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,190
Speaker 1: I can't remember anything all right.

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,220
Speaker 0: So so a few highlights.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:45,981
Speaker 0: then I saw the chain As in that chain from that podcast the one that hung across the Bosphorus that kept the Ottomans at bay Until they eventually took the tower and took it down.

52
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:51,226
Speaker 0: the chain is just there in the museum Mm-hmm, and I think the funniest thing was.

53
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:55,294
Speaker 0: I saw all these Egyptian Artifacts and for a second.

54
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:55,956
Speaker 0: I'm like what?

55
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,460
Speaker 0: why is there so much Egypt?

56
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:02,569
Speaker 0: Oh right Romans conquered Egypt Greeks conquered Egypt, this is all

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,634
Speaker 1: Cleopatra

58
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:20,038
Speaker 0: yeah, and I think older stuff yeah lot a lot of the artifacts that Rome and Parts of Rome have laying around like in their museums today are things that the Romans themselves looted from places They conquered more than a thousand years ago.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:36,624
Speaker 0: These are things that were conquered taken looted and put in museums Before so-called Jesus wasn't born mm-hmm I just find that awesome and interesting, but now that my trouble with Turkey is that I Would like to learn Turkish because I go there enough and the business is big, but

60
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,828
Speaker 1: they mostly speak English.

61
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,041
Speaker 0: well Let's be everyone in the industry.

62
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:44,886
Speaker 0: I engage with speaks English Pretty well too very well too better than a lot of Americans.

63
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:45,589
Speaker 1: hello my friend.

64
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,470
Speaker 0: I want a lot of people in the street at least in the urban centers also speak English.

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,096
Speaker 0: So as a result I don't have any chance to really use.

66
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,863
Speaker 1: do they speak English even to each other?

67
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:57,499
Speaker 1: or only they are able to speak English But don't speak it as their primary language.

68
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,730
Speaker 0: They will never speak English to each other, okay?

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,349
Speaker 0: But they speak it very well when they're speaking with me or when I'm in the room.

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,686
Speaker 0: but All the books I can find to teach myself Turkish are ancient and teach like Turkish from the 1920s like no one.

71
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,601
Speaker 1: Why don't you get ripoff Rosetta Stone?

72
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm probably going to pirate Rosetta Stone.

73
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:24,030
Speaker 1: Why don't you do the thing that Emily does with the Skype and with the Turkish person because that service did not have Turkish?

74
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:31,892
Speaker 0: Really there are not a lot of English to Turkish language resources because there's not a lot of interest in the English-speaking world and learning Turkish.

75
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:34,869
Speaker 1: sadly why don't you find the person who is like?

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,408
Speaker 1: Translating Turkish books or something and ask them if there's something you can do?

77
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,690
Speaker 0: yeah I'll just pay them to come over and teach me Turkish.

78
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:52,308
Speaker 1: I mean like go to the Turkish bookstore right and find like the most popular fucking book right and it's probably gonna be have an English translation look up in the credits who did the translation and then find the person on the internet and call them.

79
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,210
Speaker 0: well I think I'm gonna probably start by pirating Rosetta Stone, and I'm still doing some research.

80
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:58,420
Speaker 0: I found a couple of books.

81
00:04:58,582 --> 00:04:59,510
Speaker 0: the problem is the books.

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,064
Speaker 1: Why don't you look at the person in the credits of the Turkish Rosetta Stone who made it?

83
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:04,429
Speaker 0: Oh?

84
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,189
Speaker 1: maybe Those people may probably just tell you to use Turkish Rosetta Stone, but still.

85
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:19,352
Speaker 0: But I I only learn words related to food and coffee because they have coffee and tea and stuff like that Constantly.

86
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,235
Speaker 0: it's awesome.

87
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,063
Speaker 1: usually the first thing people learn is when they're learning a new language.

88
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,090
Speaker 1: late in life is swear words.

89
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you probably haven't learned any.

90
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,543
Speaker 0: nope I haven't learned any.

91
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,145
Speaker 0: I've overheard.

92
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,575
Speaker 0: I think what you say We're lucky in Turkey.

93
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,721
Speaker 0: nope I can.

94
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:37,784
Speaker 0: I can order a Black Turkish coffee by getting saute coffee.

95
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,270
Speaker 0: okay as opposed to art.

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,810
Speaker 0: Oh coffee, which is Turkish coffee with a little bit of sugar in it and the word for tea is chai.

97
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:45,623
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a hard word.

98
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:46,510
Speaker 0: It's spelled differently.

99
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,299
Speaker 0: It's spelled C a y but I can read Turkish.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:57,256
Speaker 0: I can read Turkish words and know how to pronounce them Which actually took me a little while to figure out I could do that with Hebrew and I was like in kindergarten.

101
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:04,012
Speaker 0: they use a lot of Diocratics like way more than I'm used to and they have a much bigger impact on the words Like.

102
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:09,350
Speaker 0: also the most vexing thing is that there's I with a dot and without a dot and they're different.

103
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,909
Speaker 0: So they're gonna be an uppercase I with a dot and uppercase I without a dot.

104
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:18,570
Speaker 0: All right, yeah that also causes problems in Java and other languages if you don't handle it properly.

105
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:19,413
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:28,149
Speaker 0: because there's a lowercase I with the dot so it gets uppercase to do an uppercase Dotted I. that doesn't display in most Western character sets.

107
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:29,758
Speaker 0: Thus problems.

108
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:33,475
Speaker 0: text editor you TFA yeah But even then which character?

109
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:33,857
Speaker 0: if you have?

110
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:39,608
Speaker 0: if you type an I that's a lowercase I in English It'll have the dot by default mm-hmm.

111
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:56,870
Speaker 0: So if you if you take that in Turkish and then uppercase it it'll still have the dot Mm-hmm, but you don't want the dotted uppercase I. in that case most likely You want the non dotted uppercase I especially if it's English just being typed in Turkish.

112
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,009
Speaker 0: There's also issues.

113
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,615
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

114
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:07,746
Speaker 1: is someone on a Turkish keyboard put in their Turkish lowercase I when they meant to put in an English lowercase I yep, or the other way around.

115
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:14,930
Speaker 0: you put in English lowercase I. that gets uppercase to a uppercase I with a dot which doesn't exist in English.

116
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:16,196
Speaker 1: It's a different letter right.

117
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:21,818
Speaker 1: you just pretend it like that lowercase Turkish I ah but this is the problem in English.

118
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:22,379
Speaker 0: we have.

119
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,009
Speaker 0: we have lowercase I with a dot and uppercase I without a dot.

120
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:27,255
Speaker 0: So we have.

121
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:30,270
Speaker 0: we have like half and a half is our problem anyway.

122
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:32,723
Speaker 0: but yeah, that that's how I was in Turkey.

123
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:39,295
Speaker 0: it was awesome and Lions won the Thanksgiving Day game The first time.

124
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:42,244
Speaker 0: it doesn't my life that I can remember that I cared.

125
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:45,174
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter matters a lot Matters a lot.

126
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:49,589
Speaker 0: if I if you're you know if you've ever lived in Detroit it matters a lot doesn't matter.

127
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,844
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we got some news got a news got news.

128
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:54,326
Speaker 0: We're back.

129
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,209
Speaker 0: It's geek nights news.

130
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,199
Speaker 1: I think I closed my tab with my news.

131
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:05,029
Speaker 1: Let me remember was all right, so RMS as In Richard Stallman why are we talking about him?

132
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,975
Speaker 0: So I decided that he's the opposite of relevant has proven that Bitcoin has made it and you know how we know.

133
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:18,810
Speaker 0: Bitcoin has made it because Richard Stallman is calling for an anonymous alternative to Bitcoin.

134
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:24,382
Speaker 0: Okay He doesn't tell anyone how or doesn't know how?

135
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:42,089
Speaker 0: of course not but basically Bitcoin has become useful enough to where he is calling for an alternative to it Because of its flaw the flaw being that it's not actually anonymous Which is funny because most people who talk about Bitcoin seem to laud how anonymous it is not knowing that it's actually the opposite of that.

136
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:45,470
Speaker 0: And the point of it is not that it's anonymous, but that it's intrinsic.

137
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:54,511
Speaker 0: This article just if you want to see what slash shot looked like in 1994 this article from today is basically slashed out in 1994.

138
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:59,294
Speaker 0: It's got all the keywords RMS alternative to whatever hot technology They take.

139
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,009
Speaker 1: your Bill Gates face with the Borg on it.

140
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:07,735
Speaker 0: It's actually got a picture of a Bitcoin because they have a Bitcoin category because there's so many articles about Now.

141
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:31,538
Speaker 0: Maybe we do need an anonymous equivalent of Bitcoin because cash is increasingly difficult to use by tech nerdy people and And Intrinsic currencies are useful for the segment of the population that can't use credit cards aka Teenagers who are increasingly spending a lot of money online and have no good way to do that.

142
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:39,280
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Anonymous ones would be good for the black market the internet underground buying drugs.

143
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:49,999
Speaker 0: Bitcoin is kind of good for that too, but you have to be technologically savvy Mm-hmm, but now my real news is that Amazon announced the kind of thing that's usually a Don't know April Fool's joke.

144
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,975
Speaker 1: I thought it was an April Fool's joke at first or a parody and I had heard.

145
00:09:54,015 --> 00:10:21,479
Speaker 0: I mean there have been rumors about this For a long time and I assume this is the kind of thing that you'd see on One of those TV shows back when they were like what's new in tech with Soledad O'Brien on TV back in the day like square Whatever TV, but I forget what all those channels were called but Amazon actually announced that they're gonna have little drones that will deliver packages and They actually have come a long way and they've got working prototypes like this is not as far away as people think it is.

146
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,168
Speaker 1: I just see like two things.

147
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,955
Speaker 1: I'm seeing really often lately, right?

148
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:35,100
Speaker 1: The one thing is Where people like they misunderstand where technology currently is in both directions, right?

149
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:44,126
Speaker 1: It's like they'll underestimate what they're capable of doing right now realistically and they'll also overestimate in different areas Point Google Glass.

150
00:10:44,468 --> 00:11:01,640
Speaker 0: people think it's like this real-world overlay Device that shows you this heads-up display that fully fills your vision like yeah people do have no under no realistic Understanding of what it actually does right, but then they don't realize that robot cars already work like they already work.

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, they exist.

152
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:16,793
Speaker 1: they work for real in real cities but and and the thing is in either direction right the over or underestimating people have a completely unrealistic Expectation about timeframes as well, right?

153
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:21,691
Speaker 1: It's like when they underestimate They think you know, the thing is actually way old.

154
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,520
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, I've been doing that for like a hundred years.

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,664
Speaker 1: Where have you been right?

156
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:28,720
Speaker 0: Well, like when Facebook come up, you're like, wow, this is the first thing like that ever.

157
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,747
Speaker 0: It's like yeah Never mind ICQ and orca.

158
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 1: and then when they overestimate it's like, you know, they think it's gonna be right around the corner.

159
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,912
Speaker 1: It's like no, that's you're not, you know, we've been talking cars, right?

160
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,836
Speaker 1: It's like we've been talking about.

161
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:41,940
Speaker 1: it's like Google Glass, right?

162
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's here, right?

163
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,444
Speaker 1: You're overestimating what it's capable of But you think it's.

164
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,954
Speaker 1: you know, even if you get that right you think it's good.

165
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,540
Speaker 1: You're gonna be capable of it like really soon.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,442
Speaker 0: It's like no not anytime soon, but at the same time they really underestimate that what glass is Right.

167
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,326
Speaker 0: He much already exists.

168
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,230
Speaker 0: They say be out soon.

169
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:09,693
Speaker 1: the whole world just has this, you know Anyone who's not in technology has a completely Wrong understanding of where we are at and what things can do and including right.

170
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:17,815
Speaker 1: this news story is the perfect example because even 60 minutes a very reputable news program right is acting all like this.

171
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,379
Speaker 1: shits like around the corner.

172
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,360
Speaker 0: no nerds We're talking about this back when Amazon started sure.

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,667
Speaker 1: But the other thing is like when is this actually?

174
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:29,720
Speaker 1: realistically when I'm what day am I going to receive a package by Amazon?

175
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,613
Speaker 1: by air like this.

176
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,973
Speaker 1: Five years minimum more like ten.

177
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:40,189
Speaker 0: I think this brings up the Fundamental underlying point.

178
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:50,780
Speaker 0: I'm glad that you went in this direction The biggest problem in technology, but they have a news story like if we're gonna have this today just because we can theoretically Yeah, well, I mean that's the people are acting like this is some crazy thing.

179
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,249
Speaker 0: No, this is this.

180
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,020
Speaker 0: technology has existed for a while.

181
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:58,016
Speaker 0: It's not new Amazon saying they're going to do and then they go.

182
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,443
Speaker 1: Oh my god U.m.

183
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:00,207
Speaker 1: Play gods.

184
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,896
Speaker 1: a package is gonna fall on someone and kill him.

185
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,051
Speaker 0: Yeah But the it's the same thing is with robot cars.

186
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,116
Speaker 0: that technology exists today.

187
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:14,892
Speaker 0: It is not Technologically infeasible to roll it out assuming no concerns.

188
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:15,333
Speaker 1: It might.

189
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:19,624
Speaker 1: I can be economically infeasible In mass.

190
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:22,817
Speaker 1: in mass you can definitely deliver one package for sure.

191
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:30,291
Speaker 0: No problem It would depend on where this would be the most feasible in a place like New York City Sure, where it could just deliver.

192
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:37,936
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to go very far But there's a lot of people that can deliver to Exactly and you could get to the places that are difficult to get delivery trucks to.

193
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 1: but how is it gonna?

194
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,399
Speaker 1: How are you gonna for anyone from robbing it?

195
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:47,227
Speaker 1: I'm not worried about that because those are the kinds of things I would just stand look around for them Shoot them down and take whatever they got.

196
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:58,320
Speaker 1: especially I would use my binoculars a scope and if it's a new egg, boom If it's right if it can that hard drive will make the it'll survive the descent fireman person catching that.

197
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,718
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that that is.

198
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,611
Speaker 0: you know This is something you're doing the thing that people on slashdot did.

199
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:07,759
Speaker 0: they do all the time whenever there's an article about hey We're gonna make a subway that goes in space.

200
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:15,060
Speaker 0: The first comments are armchair engineers saying yeah, but because of the whatever radiation it couldn't actually work.

201
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,159
Speaker 0: It's like dumb shits if the engineers are working on it.

202
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,076
Speaker 0: They probably thought of the most low hanging fruit dangers that you think of my gogo 13 attack.

203
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,327
Speaker 0: You know what if gogo 13 attacks that it's fucked.

204
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:33,260
Speaker 0: that's what I'm saying, that's fine if gogo 13 attacks a tank tanks fucked.

205
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:34,219
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

206
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:47,786
Speaker 0: but in terms of this the biggest problem with technology today in terms of rolling it out is the gap between government regulation and technological availability and Fear of people.

207
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:52,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the fear of people kind of ties in that Technology exists today to do this.

208
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,956
Speaker 0: Amazon could start doing this on a small scale today.

209
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:59,986
Speaker 0: There is literally no Technological limitation preventing them from doing so.

210
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:03,255
Speaker 0: just like we could have robot cars give you windy driving.

211
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,940
Speaker 0: Well, then it doesn't go until the next day.

212
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,839
Speaker 0: So yes today or tomorrow, you're never getting deliveries.

213
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:17,569
Speaker 0: Well, then they do some sort of blimp thing instead where a blimp goes up rides the wind and then lands and then someone just Goes around later and picks up all the blimps like once a month.

214
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:23,751
Speaker 1: I Military's been doing that for like as long as we've had planes.

215
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:24,274
Speaker 0: Yep.

216
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,620
Speaker 0: You think the military doesn't.

217
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,802
Speaker 1: They can deliver stuff wouldn't create with a parachute old Invention.

218
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:38,749
Speaker 0: if the military can deliver a Hellfire missile into someone's living room whenever they want via a drone They can deliver a package with some hard drives and a USB cable.

219
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,419
Speaker 0: Yep, if they did it via missile, that'd be pretty cool, dude.

220
00:15:44,381 --> 00:16:02,740
Speaker 0: But seriously the only reason we don't have limited trials of Commercially available robot cars or things like this is simply that our government is and on any level on the local level the national level The federal level state level town level old people 100% incapable of even discussing these issues.

221
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:10,280
Speaker 0: Do you know how will New York City as a specific example even get to the point where anyone involved in our government?

222
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:17,300
Speaker 0: Even begins to understand how to go about regulating private drones using New York City's airspace?

223
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,980
Speaker 1: They're still discussing whether to put like a traffic slowing curb in my neighborhood.

224
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:31,838
Speaker 0: They're already fighting whether they're already realizing that because of state laws They can't reduce the speed limit to 20 miles an hour because there's state laws that prevent it.

225
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:39,504
Speaker 0: So we have a problem where increasingly and I think this is going to happen more and more within the next 10 years We're gonna hit a crisis point with this.

226
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:44,740
Speaker 0: technology is advancing so fast that we will have things that are so just start.

227
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:59,849
Speaker 1: I think that right and this is why what you see in Silicon Valley so much is These companies sort of jerkily right in most cases just start deploying their technology in direct Scoffing and violation of any laws and regulations.

228
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,756
Speaker 0: a crunchy roll did that back in the day, right?

229
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,000
Speaker 1: Exactly like uber.

230
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:04,440
Speaker 1: They're just like fuck your taxi laws.

231
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,711
Speaker 1: We're doing it and they just do it and it's like what do you do?

232
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,146
Speaker 1: stop us and they do try to stop them By forcing the battle.

233
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:15,300
Speaker 1: that's the only way to actually make anything happen is by just starting to do it.

234
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,146
Speaker 1: So if I was Amazon They have plenty of fucking money.

235
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:25,000
Speaker 1: if you got this shit to the point where it worked and you were ready to make it happen Just start doing it, right?

236
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,620
Speaker 1: Just do it and make the guard and force the government to discuss it and do something about it.

237
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,703
Speaker 1: Force them to shoot down your little drones or do whatever because this is the only way you're actually gonna be able to get it Set up.

238
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:38,946
Speaker 0: I do a little more subtle and a little more 80s movie villain.

239
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:44,134
Speaker 0: I would find a small town that Really needed it that really needed me.

240
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,360
Speaker 1: the post office never goes there.

241
00:17:45,551 --> 00:18:00,225
Speaker 0: Yeah like one of those small towns and I would work with them and get them to pass all the local laws that would make it Work and tell them don't worry about federal and state bullshit because we got your back and then just deploy in that town and then as soon as there's trouble and the government gets involved.

242
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:09,813
Speaker 0: suddenly you've got a government fighting with you not just individual people and Neighboring towns, there'll be people who want these things and you could.

243
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,840
Speaker 0: you could just dump lobbying money into.

244
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:13,128
Speaker 1: You think people would.

245
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,000
Speaker 1: actually the problem is in the small town.

246
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,703
Speaker 1: No one will want them.

247
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:17,230
Speaker 1: you have to do in the city where people.

248
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,860
Speaker 0: you gotta find the small city like this like the Silicon Valley like mini like these little cities that have a bunch of tech workers.

249
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,940
Speaker 0: Anyway, like Raleigh would be possibly a good place for something like that.

250
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,017
Speaker 0: A lot of tech workers despite being a relatively small city on the grand scheme of things.

251
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,622
Speaker 1: All right News.

252
00:18:33,803 --> 00:18:35,532
Speaker 1: so this isn't really news, right?

253
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,100
Speaker 1: It's just something I always had troubles with.

254
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,234
Speaker 1: Alright, you know, I'm pretty good at setting up computers and whatnot.

255
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:51,472
Speaker 0: Yep, but mail servers Nope, you know, nope, you know the last time I set up a mail server Well one Scott and I try to get squirrel mail working at our IT.

256
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:52,175
Speaker 1: I did.

257
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,400
Speaker 1: Yeah some point it did.

258
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:54,606
Speaker 0: It technically works.

259
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,198
Speaker 1: Who knows if I was spamming or whatever, but yeah.

260
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:05,400
Speaker 1: So anyway There's a website here at flirty calm and it's how do you set up a mail server on a new slash Linux system?

261
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,850
Speaker 1: Step by step guide you install post fix.

262
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,740
Speaker 1: it would do plus post fix plus courier.

263
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,752
Speaker 1: I'm at plus my SQL plus mf as the new plus spam assassin.

264
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:21,505
Speaker 1: plus clamor plus sazzle plus telus plus around cube plus post gray, it tells you how to set up every Single piece.

265
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:27,525
Speaker 1: I wish they would just give you a fucking CD where it was set up already and when the CD turns on You type in your domain.

266
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:31,299
Speaker 1: it gives you the MX records you paste them and you push go and it's set up.

267
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,540
Speaker 1: That's what they should make and maybe I can make that from these instructions.

268
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:37,516
Speaker 0: Maybe and then make it a virtual image.

269
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:37,980
Speaker 1: just make it.

270
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:45,412
Speaker 0: Make it an AMI so you can just boom your email on Amazon with a little back door to where years from now You can use it to take over all these networks.

271
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, great Take over your emails.

272
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,270
Speaker 0: No, seriously.

273
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,100
Speaker 0: I mean your job at least is programming.

274
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,335
Speaker 0: So it's understandable that you would not have deep expertise on email server administration.

275
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:57,920
Speaker 1: I can administer any other kind of sir.

276
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, my job was IT.

277
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,716
Speaker 0: My career was IT.

278
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:02,660
Speaker 0: My degree is in IT.

279
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,236
Speaker 0: I am no more capable of getting email servers working than Scott is.

280
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:06,980
Speaker 1: I'm very capable.

281
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:08,080
Speaker 1: I read these instructions.

282
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:22,819
Speaker 0: Yeah but the last time I set up email to work was like one of my capstone projects at our IT in system administration - Hmm I had to set up an email server a Wins server which already is starting to date me.

283
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,019
Speaker 0: So anyway things of the day Little video game thing of the day here.

284
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,990
Speaker 0: Uh, Scott was not aware of these differences.

285
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,238
Speaker 1: I was not aware at all.

286
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:36,520
Speaker 0: Now.

287
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,010
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do with my life.

288
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,521
Speaker 0: I was aware of some of the everything I knew is wrong.

289
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,710
Speaker 0: My worldview is shattered, but not all of them.

290
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:56,365
Speaker 0: So there's a history of Japanese Nintendo games being way harder than the American equivalents because Japan has a Final Fantasy 4 1 Mega Man 2 having the easy mode which doesn't exist.

291
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,390
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 6 Yeah.

292
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:00,155
Speaker 1: So every game.

293
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:05,289
Speaker 0: pretty much Japan had a very low opinion of the intelligence of the average American gamer.

294
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,792
Speaker 0: not Unfounded.

295
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,503
Speaker 0: they also had a very low opinion.

296
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,230
Speaker 1: or was it a self-fulfilling prophecy?

297
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:15,370
Speaker 1: Maybe if they had given us the real Mario 3 and such then we would be better at games.

298
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:16,272
Speaker 0: Maybe.

299
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:23,007
Speaker 0: but at the same time maybe they rightfully assumed that Americans would give up in frustration rather than rising to the challenge.

300
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,567
Speaker 0: I Don't know because I played Final Fantasy 4j and I came as fucking hard.

301
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:40,174
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so this is a complete enumeration to the best of my knowledge of all the differences between the United States release and the Japanese release of Super Mario Brothers 3.

302
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,370
Speaker 1: Some I thought they were identical.

303
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of the differences are subtle.

304
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,322
Speaker 0: like there's some graphical changes.

305
00:21:45,342 --> 00:21:48,010
Speaker 0: like the throne rooms are just different for no reason.

306
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:49,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably for memory reasons.

307
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:50,350
Speaker 1: It's an NES.

308
00:21:50,691 --> 00:22:05,516
Speaker 0: Uh, there's a door that's in a different place because it's harder if the doors in that's play in that place in Japanese only slightly and I wouldn't die there in American Mario 3. if you have say the fire flower and you get hit you turn into big Mario You get hit again.

309
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:07,005
Speaker 0: turn into small Mario get hit again.

310
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:11,880
Speaker 0: you die in Japanese Mario 3 just like every other Mario.

311
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,270
Speaker 0: if you're fire flower and you get hit small Mario hit again dead.

312
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,364
Speaker 1: It's Super Mario world different between Japan and us.

313
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,894
Speaker 0: I'm Not sure.

314
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:22,442
Speaker 0: I don't know.

315
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:28,250
Speaker 0: actually I Only knew about Mario 3 because of Nintendo power features and a lot of research as a kid.

316
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,841
Speaker 0: Okay, but there were some things like this crazy glitch.

317
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,870
Speaker 0: I did not know about with a fourth warp whistle.

318
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:35,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is.

319
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:39,109
Speaker 0: Yeah It's weird that they changed like that end to like.

320
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,324
Speaker 0: Maybe they just realized at the end of this cuz level 5 was kind of glitchy.

321
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:47,762
Speaker 0: in general you get the impression that it was The rushed one and they cut a lot out at the last minute.

322
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:51,353
Speaker 0: and I feel like oh, yeah I don't know.

323
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:55,289
Speaker 0: sky world had the most weird glitches that currybows shoe just kind of hanging out.

324
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:58,406
Speaker 1: That's not doesn't sound like something that you just sort of you know.

325
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,035
Speaker 1: Spit out quickly, right?

326
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,290
Speaker 1: They put a lot of work in a curry bow shoe and also that tower where you go up and down.

327
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,995
Speaker 0: They did but I feel like because that's our sky world always felt kind of different from all the other parts of Mario 3.

328
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,486
Speaker 0: Anyway, we can talk about that on a Tuesday.

329
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,537
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, so another thing of the day.

330
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,082
Speaker 1: This is just a YouTube channel.

331
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:19,505
Speaker 1: Not a specific YouTube video.

332
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,210
Speaker 1: I found out about this.

333
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:33,949
Speaker 1: There's a YouTube channel KBS world TV and KBS is just a Korean TV stations one of the biggest ones and They just put a whole bunch of shit on YouTube with subtitles legit totally legit full HD.

334
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,527
Speaker 1: Whatever who like constantly like all like you just watch their dramas.

335
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:39,410
Speaker 1: You can watch your whatever.

336
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,050
Speaker 1: It's just all on there and it's like whoa, how come like other TV channels don't do this.

337
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,514
Speaker 1: How come I?

338
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:52,830
Speaker 1: you know, it's like yeah, obviously You know the Koreans pretty good at spreading their culture on the Internet's better than the other countries.

339
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,842
Speaker 1: But you know, how come there isn't like.

340
00:23:54,903 --> 00:24:01,030
Speaker 1: I don't know the French Broadcast network putting their shows up on it, you know, the BBC does it with their stupid?

341
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,190
Speaker 1: I player you can only watch if you have a VPN or live there or what, right?

342
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,181
Speaker 1: It's like everyone is getting this wrong here.

343
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,549
Speaker 1: is there is a real TV station getting it, right?

344
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:19,082
Speaker 1: I hope other people follow suit because if you look even the unpopular videos They post are getting like hundreds of thousands of views.

345
00:24:19,102 --> 00:24:32,583
Speaker 1: It is not unpopular All right, so I want to see a day We're pretty much just every TV station just puts all their shows on YouTube with subtitles to spread them around the world Perhaps with a pre-funding model.

346
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:33,910
Speaker 0: Yeah being puppy care.

347
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you don't need some shady fucking fansubbers posting it on weird websites and whatnot.

348
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:39,950
Speaker 1: They just post legit.

349
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:47,089
Speaker 0: So yeah in the meta moment the book club book is I do by William Gibson.

350
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,207
Speaker 0: now I started reading it again because I had a lot a bunch of long flights.

351
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:50,569
Speaker 0: I didn't.

352
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:55,390
Speaker 0: Haha, well, I finish it again and then start reading further.

Speaker 1: I have a week a week vacation between Christmas and New Year's.

354
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:00,767
Speaker 1: That's my time.

355
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:03,859
Speaker 0: So I started reading it.

356
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:14,990
Speaker 0: I read just like the first chapter and with all the cyberpunk jargon and awesome just Stereotypical cliched cyberpunk crap that happens in the beginning.

357
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:19,448
Speaker 0: It's easy to forget that it wasn't cliche when this book was written.

358
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:23,320
Speaker 0: guys This book was written in 1996.

359
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,770
Speaker 1: yep 1996.

360
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:31,939
Speaker 0: I in Upgraded to a thirty three six KBP PS modem.

361
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,604
Speaker 1: I was a freshman in high school.

00:25:33,685 --> 00:25:34,708
Speaker 1: I was maybe like 14 years old.

363
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:38,237
Speaker 0: There's cyber the.

364
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:41,250
Speaker 0: the ideas and books like this were not common.

365
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:47,390
Speaker 0: It's the one of those situations where something seems cliche and you forget that it came about before that thing was cliche.

366
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,258
Speaker 0: This book is kind kind of awesome.

367
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,547
Speaker 0: So I actually I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of it again.

368

426
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:40,796

427
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:43,265
Speaker 1: The only thing I really want to watch badly.

428
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,570
Speaker 1: It's Kill La Kill.

00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, did you watch the newest episode?

Speaker 0: Oh But I am caught up on adventure time, okay I saw James.

00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:56,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like this.

433
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,350
Speaker 1: This is a good guy.

434
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:03,470
Speaker 0: I like how both ponies and and adventure time have had the direct continuity episodes.

435
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,340
Speaker 1: You notice James had the brack voice actor.

436
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:12,060
Speaker 0: notice how James had a red shirt on those proving that peeps Planned him to be what he was from the beginning.

437
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:17,890
Speaker 0: She brought him to be used for that purpose if things went wrong.

438
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:24,169
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah sure I would do radio for you but Scott doesn't wanna you can do your own radio for you.

439
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I will do with Judy sue actually.

440
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:29,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I should.

441
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,702
Speaker 0: Judith I know you listen to geek nights.

442
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:32,869
Speaker 1: What why?

443
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,341
Speaker 0: Let's let's do it let's do it radio for you.

444
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:43,750
Speaker 0: Okay anyway So there is a little bit of a brouhaha on the internet.

445
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:49,169
Speaker 0: This is all you a little bit hubbub about a job posting from one penny arcade incorporated.

446
00:30:49,189 --> 00:31:00,470
Speaker 0: I Don't want to talk about the social side of this because it's obvious I don't want to talk about the the all the issues except the actual job posting because a lot of the complaints.

447
00:31:00,696 --> 00:31:01,148
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

448
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:08,393
Speaker 0: They posted a pretty accurate job posting for the kind of tech guy they wanted because the tech guy they have is leaving to do something else.

449
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:19,279
Speaker 0: so the internet went crazy about it and About a third of the people maybe half the people who are complaining about this We're complaining about the wrong thing.

450
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:22,710
Speaker 0: and the people who are complaining in the manner that we're about to talk about.

451
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:26,989
Speaker 0: There's a reason those people do not have high paying jobs.

452
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:29,742
Speaker 0: So a complaint.

453
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:29,964
Speaker 0: well here.

454
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:30,570
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read the job.

455
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:34,830
Speaker 1: Well, I mean a lot of people are complaining simply because they're penny arcade haters.

456
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,657
Speaker 1: They'll hate on anything penny arcade does ever.

457
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:45,153
Speaker 1: they'll find a reason to make it like a huge, you know Catastrophe where it's like this 10,000 job postings just like this every day about companies You don't care about.

458
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,459
Speaker 1: so you're not making a hullabaloo.

459
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,283
Speaker 0: now there have been.

460
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:47,926
Speaker 0: don't get us wrong.

461
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,892
Speaker 0: there are penny arcade Catastrophes.

462
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,665
Speaker 1: my crew lick like this one also.

463
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:53,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is it.

464
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,805
Speaker 1: This is yeah the I mean asking someone to work a zillion hours is awful.

465
00:31:57,926 --> 00:31:58,327
Speaker 1: the end.

466
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,080
Speaker 0: well I'm not sure how many hours they actually work.

467
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:06,315
Speaker 1: the guy said he there was a posting by the guy who had That post up.

468
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:06,877
Speaker 0: I read that.

469
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,650
Speaker 1: he said yeah, basically you can't go anywhere because you're on a call.

470
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,800
Speaker 1: You're the only guy.

471
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,623
Speaker 0: there's two separate things There's the on-call thing and then there's the actual working hours thing.

472
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:27,024
Speaker 0: because not to disparage him But based on reading that and seeing just kind of how this all evolved I don't think other than the on-call aspect the amount of work.

473
00:32:27,044 --> 00:32:27,747
Speaker 0: It would take to do.

474
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:32,556
Speaker 0: what they need is Maybe Maybe 20 hours of work a week.

475
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:39,629
Speaker 1: right but if you work at penny arcade who's gonna make you stay there for a zillion hours A week, and it'll look down on you if you leave at 5 every day?

476
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:40,915
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe not.

477
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:41,839
Speaker 0: maybe what have you got everything?

478
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:46,565
Speaker 0: what if you came to the office just fucking hung out and play games cuz there Was no work to do cuz you did it all who would fire you?

479
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:47,189
Speaker 0: maybe I?

480
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,671
Speaker 0: Don't know.

481
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:51,003
Speaker 0: if he's smart you definitely give you a talking to?

482
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:51,545
Speaker 1: I don't know.

483
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:52,490
Speaker 0: not because there's there.

484
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,320
Speaker 0: It's that that's one of the biggest problems with tech.

485
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,661
Speaker 0: is the?

486
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:56,424
Speaker 0: you know what?

487
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:59,882
Speaker 0: it's the same thing that managers of Terrible fast-food jobs will say.

488
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:00,969
Speaker 0: you'll hear this phrase a lot.

489
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:15,029
Speaker 0: They'll say if you got time to lean you got time to clean Meaning they're paying you for your time, so if you if you finish all the work It's your responsibility to find more work to do and to work more because otherwise why are they paying you?

490
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,493
Speaker 1: Why are you?

491
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:19,930
Speaker 1: maybe you should have hired paid hired me for half the time that you hired before?

492
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:27,890
Speaker 0: My fault that you mis-hired me, but the problem is they'll hire you for half the time But then pay you half as much, and then you don't have enough money to live.

493
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:33,590
Speaker 0: We kind of have this messed up to pay me twice pay me more per hour And then we have this messed up situation in America.

494
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:38,270
Speaker 0: This is why you're expected to have a full-time job of 40.

495
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,423
Speaker 1: Technology which is why we're not talking about this part.

496
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:41,650
Speaker 1: We're talking about the technology part.

497
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:43,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel you itching to talk about it.

498
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,454
Speaker 1: No, that was all I just said.

499
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:45,276
Speaker 1: the end now.

500
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,708
Speaker 0: so here are the requirements of the job.

501
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:56,555
Speaker 0: mm-hmm You need to have an attention level of attention to detail that everyone writes that in every job description ever it means nothing I know except it.

502
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:56,736
Speaker 0: Well.

503
00:33:56,756 --> 00:34:00,030
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean it means nothing except that anyone who doesn't I would not hire.

504
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:05,389
Speaker 0: Sure, I mean if I get an email from someone that has a how do you measure someone's attention to detail?

505
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:13,190
Speaker 0: Simple if they follow the instructions that I put on the job posting and there are no misspellings in their resume or the email they Sent me

506
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,512
Speaker 1: done

507
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:18,893
Speaker 0: if they don't meet that record that they basically if they don't have that then There's

508
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,362
Speaker 1: no reason to write that on the res on the job posting.

509
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,250
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe I don't know.

510
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,681

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,862
Speaker 0: Strong project management skills okay, which is something most people who say they have do not have.

514
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:35,389
Speaker 1: it's such a subjective not you know?

515
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:47,187
Speaker 0: Measurable yeah, so whatever motivated self-starter who can overcome and work around issues independently Yeah, okay flexibility to travel 30% of the time Not uncommon in tech.

516
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,237
Speaker 0: I Travel almost that person.

517
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:52,489
Speaker 1: I mean you got to be going to PAX is you're gonna be good right?

518
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,739

519
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,828
Speaker 0: I go to Turkey I go I travel overseas.

520
00:34:56,868 --> 00:35:03,490
Speaker 0: so much for Work that I had two sets of extra pages added to my passport, and I will still probably fill it before it expires.

521
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:08,643
Speaker 0: You have no problems working in a creative and potentially offensive environment.

522
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:10,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely not a problem.

523
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's penny arcade.

524
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:14,642
Speaker 0: Flexibility adapting to deadlines changing schedules priorities.

525
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:19,919
Speaker 0: You know the same old work well under pressure Ability to communicate and work in a team environment.

526
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,003
Speaker 0: Yeah again.

527
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,629
Speaker 1: I can't work with people you can't work.

528
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:27,830
Speaker 1: Go work on go be an author right woods have no problem appearing on camera.

529
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:31,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, what's for a lot of people?

530
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:34,229
Speaker 0: tech people even complain about that one they?

531
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,244
Speaker 0: People we know okay said things like they would have.

532
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,470
Speaker 0: someone would have to pay me extra.

533
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:45,422
Speaker 0: I feel like that's a huge negative of being on camera Which I guess is just the different kinds of jobs don't go out in public ever.

534
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:49,368
Speaker 0: like I never leave I have tech job clothes on your blinds.

535
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,847
Speaker 0: I worked for one financial company where I was basically the guy in the back room making everything work.

536
00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:00,917
Speaker 0: now I work for a tech company where I do private lectures that are videoed for Gigantic audiences on a regular basis.

537
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:05,855
Speaker 0: like that shit comes with the territory I consider being on camera a perk Not a negative.

538
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:18,683
Speaker 0: you could pay me less if I get to be on camera and get some personal Legend of Krauser not just the back end credited Legend of Krauser, yeah Okay, the messed up one because this is kind of relevant to the tech world.

539
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:23,612
Speaker 0: if anything breaks in the middle of the night You were expected to be on call 24/7.

540
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:29,647
Speaker 1: No, you're supposed to have multiple people in on call shifts so that people can have lives or not?

541
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:33,335
Speaker 0: everything is production critical 24/7.

542
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:36,144
Speaker 1: obviously I mean Seriously know what you can't.

543
00:36:36,284 --> 00:36:39,053
Speaker 1: I mean you know it is penny arcade is?

544
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:39,314
Speaker 1: you know?

545
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:46,560
Speaker 1: this website and all these people are living off Of it, so if it goes down you're losing money, and that feeds the people who work there, right?

546
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,652
Speaker 1: But if people can't read a webcomic until I get in in the morning And then at nine o'clock in the morning they can read the webcomic again.

547
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,520
Speaker 1: That's not a big fucking deal.

548
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:57,428
Speaker 1: That is a very very small deal.

549
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:58,413
Speaker 1: It's not a bank.

550
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,040
Speaker 1: It's not a hospital.

551
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:03,610
Speaker 1: It's not you know fucking military systems.

552
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:05,596
Speaker 1: It's not the stock market.

553
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:06,358
Speaker 1: It's not something.

554
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:07,160
Speaker 1: That's so disastrous.

555
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:07,441
Speaker 1: It's.

556
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,632
Speaker 1: you can't read a webcomic for six hours.

557
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,260
Speaker 1: I can fix that in the morning.

558
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:15,294
Speaker 1: You don't have to wake me up for that right just because you care about it that much.

559
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:17,588
Speaker 1: the rest of the world doesn't care About it that much.

Speaker 0: I'm sorry But a lot of people know how to code or they know how to set up a server.

577
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:05,260
Speaker 1: But the diff I know people who do have that and don't know how to cook.

578
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:14,676
Speaker 0: Yeah the people who have the degrees at least from a reasonably good school tend to have all of the skills they can set up a server and write code.

579
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:15,462
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

580
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,232
Speaker 0: a minimum of three years in development and project management.

581
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:19,954
Speaker 1: That's not much.

582
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:22,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, preferably in a professional.

583
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,920
Speaker 1: Basically, they don't want someone fresh out of college.

584
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,620
Speaker 1: They want someone who has been able to do this before because you are going to be responsible for their livelihoods effectively.

585
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,618
Speaker 1: So they want you to at least know what you're doing.

586
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,660
Speaker 0: some Yeah, but also not just someone who can write code but also someone who can manage the code itself.

587
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,367
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and those are two different jobs.

588
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:42,399
Speaker 0: That's why RIT had computer science and software engineering.

589
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,705
Speaker 0: Strong experience in PHP MySQL JavaScript CSS Apache jQuery Ajax, duh modern technologies Relatively speaking.

590
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:56,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a web person of any kind those things should all be on your resume already.

591
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:02,437
Speaker 0: Strong experience in one of Java Python Ruby or any other object-oriented language.

592
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:03,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't really matter.

593
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,679
Speaker 1: You just gotta be able to write code.

594
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,910
Speaker 0: Yeah If you if you know Python and you do web development and you have to do something that's Java instead You can just do it.

595
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,391
Speaker 0: if you're a good programmer, of course Maybe you'll have to look up a few keywords and things along the way.

596
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,900
Speaker 0: change an IDE setup, but it's not hard.

597
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:26,380
Speaker 0: a history of running running and configuring multiple server environments including load balancers web accelerators caching systems databases.

598
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:27,324
Speaker 1: Not hard.

599
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,339
Speaker 0: a history of running multiple server environments load balancers varnish.

600
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:33,286
Speaker 0: So I do that.

601
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:42,960
Speaker 0: the complaint I saw from a lot of people on the internet Was that that set of requirements does not describe one person it describes a number of people.

602
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:58,500
Speaker 0: That no, well the hours of all those skills the hours describes a number of people but these skills describe If you ignore the 24/7 support thing Well for a shop like penny arcade the number of hours of someone competent.

603
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:01,048
Speaker 0: Well, yeah a 40-hour can we work?

604
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,252
Speaker 0: week would cover all of that?

605
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:03,054
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

606
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:04,760
Speaker 1: I mean that's I do all that.

607
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:20,196
Speaker 0: So most of the night working less than 20 hours 40 hours a week who are complaining that Nobody has all those skills Including also being I have all those skills Basic IT in the office like configure the office firewall cuz something changed.

608
00:40:20,456 --> 00:40:21,540
Speaker 1: all those skills and more.

609
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:27,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone with competence in tech could do all those things and and could learn the few things.

610
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,020
Speaker 0: They don't know, right?

611
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:39,492
Speaker 1: There's a lot there's a lot of people out there I noticed because I hire people and I interview people and they have Instead of being generally knowledgeable with computers They know one thing like.

612
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:49,486
Speaker 1: they did Ruby on Rails Tutorials and they made web apps with Ruby on Rails and all they did was write Ruby on Rails code and they learned Ruby on Rails But they didn't learn anything else.

613
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,149
Speaker 1: so they can't.

614
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,951
Speaker 1: if you ask them to do something the same exact thing and something else they can't Do it because they didn't learn HTTP or how the web works.

615
00:40:57,152 --> 00:41:02,653
Speaker 0: they just learned Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails and they don't know how to type app get install Ruby.

616
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:09,100
Speaker 1: They hosted it on Heroku right which did all the hosting work for them, so they never learned how to set up a Linux server.

617
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,560
Speaker 1: They did everything on their Mac right following a tutorial to set it up once right the development environment.

618
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,880
Speaker 1: They don't know how to set up the server environment at all because Heroku did it for them.

619
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:24,006
Speaker 1: They paid a bunch of money extra to Heroku for the more expensive hosting And that's pretty much it right.

620
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:27,820
Speaker 1: It's like they know exactly one thing and they don't know any other things.

621
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 1: They don't understand how computers work or anything about that and they probably don't have the BS in computer science.

622
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:37,980
Speaker 1: So they're not good for having any sort of real job.

623
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,516
Speaker 1: I would never hire you for anything unless I really just needed like an army of Ruby on Rails.

624
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:54,300
Speaker 0: guys who only know one Thing and now yeah, so guys aside from the 24/7 work-life balance thing for support Yeah, the the technical requirements of this job are very minimal actually.

625
00:41:54,801 --> 00:42:04,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that's a baby like really really low-hanging fruit like anyone fresh out of college Would probably should be able to do these things.

626
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they want.

627
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:08,775
Speaker 1: they just want someone who's they're sure can do those things and isn't?

628
00:42:08,855 --> 00:42:10,824
Speaker 1: probably I could have done that job Out of college.

629
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:11,792
Speaker 0: Oh easily easily.

630
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:21,775
Speaker 0: I Could not have just I'm not really a developer like it would have If I did it, it would have taken me 80 hour weeks just to learn They should have posted a job when I was coming out of college.

631
00:42:21,815 --> 00:42:22,459
Speaker 1: They would have gotten me.

632
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:31,193
Speaker 0: I've been too naive and dumb and take like like when I saw that other posting they had before for packs event manager And I read it and it literally was this is a list of everything.

633
00:42:31,234 --> 00:42:32,258
Speaker 0: rims good at mm-hmm.

634
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,647
Speaker 0: Just write down the list.

635
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:38,230
Speaker 0: rim rim rim rim rim Sure, of course then I would have.

636
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,658
Speaker 0: I would have I don't know.

637
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,007
Speaker 0: Imagine a weird alternate reality.

638
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,011
Speaker 0: We're fresh out of college.

639
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,999
Speaker 0: Those two jobs got posted and we applied for them.

640
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:48,600
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure this happens in lots of other fields too, right?

641
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,586
Speaker 1: It's like you never passed by a car dealer and it's like they specialize in one kind of car and it's like dude You know how cars work.

642
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,720
Speaker 1: shouldn't you be able to repair any car, right?

643
00:42:57,203 --> 00:42:59,660
Speaker 1: But no, it's like it's not just the ones that are on the dealership, right?

644
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,060
Speaker 1: It'll be like it's like some, you know independent mechanic, but it's like the whole parking lot is all Benz's.

645
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,964
Speaker 1: It's like we fix Benz's.

646
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:06,668
Speaker 1: that's it.

647
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,919
Speaker 1: And it's like if you brought him a Ford, I'd bet they'd fuck it up.

648
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:09,964
Speaker 1: It's like.

649
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,400
Speaker 1: shouldn't you understand cars fundamentally on some fundamental level mechanics?

650
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,340
Speaker 0: Well, it might be the expertise of you know, they're good at working with these cars don't want to work on cars.

651
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,020
Speaker 1: They're not good at working with I'm sure but it's like I feel like if I knew mechanics and I was a mechanic I would be able to fix any car.

652
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,065
Speaker 0: Oh Scott, I'll put it this way.

653
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:32,798
Speaker 0: If you brought me an HP UX server and something wasn't working I could probably fix it.

654
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,684
Speaker 1: I could definitely fix it.

655
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:37,402
Speaker 0: But it would take me twice as long and I'd be pissed off the whole time because it's HP UX.

656
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:41,080
Speaker 1: It takes me just as long to Google HP UX as it takes me to Google.

657
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,853
Speaker 1: It actually takes me slightly longer to Google HP UX than it takes me to Google BSD because it's one more character to type.

658
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:48,661
Speaker 0: Ah, here's the trouble HP UX.

659
00:43:48,701 --> 00:43:53,395
Speaker 0: you won't find as much up-to-date modern useful information because it's not commonly used.

660
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:53,977
Speaker 0: It's old.

661
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:54,820
Speaker 1: I could still do it.

662
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could but it'd take you longer than someone whose thing was HP UX.

663
00:43:57,873 --> 00:43:58,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see you would?

664
00:43:59,219 --> 00:43:59,480
Speaker 0: we got it?

665
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,103
Speaker 0: Whatever race.

666
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:03,800
Speaker 0: Well, I'll set up an HP UX server and then I'll break something on it.

667
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,191
Speaker 0: I'll find some old surprises.

668
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:07,055
Speaker 1: break NTP.

669
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:08,040
Speaker 1: That's what you do.

670
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:11,739
Speaker 1: You'd be like out the clocks off by like a millisecond.

671
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:14,288
Speaker 1: So I'm like, yeah, it's working.

672
00:44:14,328 --> 00:44:15,475
Speaker 1: who gives a shit about a millisecond.

673
00:44:15,496 --> 00:44:16,119
Speaker 1: It's a webcomic.

674
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:17,752
Speaker 0: So funny story.

675
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:35,757
Speaker 0: back at RIT one of my capstone classes was this sort of like holistic class of all the aspects of IT and system administration together into one and One of the final labs was we had a team and me and Katsu were on this team with some people and we had this complex environment with some servers some clients a wireless access point that they connected through and a router.

676
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:40,655
Speaker 0: and we had this whole lab Set up and we got it all working and we had to make it secure and all that BS.

677
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:46,374
Speaker 0: and then for one of Our lab practicals we had to leave the room and the professor's broke six things.

678
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:51,260
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and we had to Bring them back up as quickly as possible and document what we did.

679
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:52,658
Speaker 1: reimage done.

680
00:44:53,621 --> 00:45:00,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we came back in and we look at oh sure enough, you know our clients can't connect to the servers and one of the server demons had crashed.

681
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:04,944
Speaker 0: here we did we rebooted everything and Then it still didn't work.

682
00:45:05,004 --> 00:45:08,900
Speaker 0: and then we looked and the firewall like the config file was corrupt because of our log message.

683
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,067
Speaker 0: So we fixed that and then it was fine.

684
00:45:10,631 --> 00:45:13,040
Speaker 0: then we came back and we were like, yeah We fixed it all immediately.

685
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:21,160
Speaker 0: There was only one problem and they got really mad at us and it turned out that all the changes they had made Like they did all this really complex crap.

686
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:29,170
Speaker 0: One of the things they did is they put dummy records in the ARP table of the router So that traffic would only flow one way from certain hosts.

687
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:31,015
Speaker 0: Okay, the ARP tables wiped out.

688
00:45:31,036 --> 00:45:34,987
Speaker 0: if you just recycle the device There was no point in troubleshooting it.

689
00:45:35,328 --> 00:45:35,549
Speaker 0: Right?

690
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:36,633
Speaker 0: We saw it wasn't working.

691
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,138
Speaker 0: We just recycled it and it was fixed.

692
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,136
Speaker 0: Sure They ended up having to give us an A but they were not happy.

693
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,399
Speaker 1: No I would be a lot smarter than that.

694
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,043
Speaker 1: Let's see.

695
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:49,139
Speaker 1: What would I do to a computer to make that would break it?

696
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,260
Speaker 1: But you would have a hard time finding that anything was broken.

697
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,010
Speaker 1: Well, I still there has to be a bug report or it's unfair.

698
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, there has to be a description of a behavior That's incorrect.

699
00:45:58,446 --> 00:45:58,667
Speaker 1: Right?

700
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,700
Speaker 1: Yep, like can't log in.

701
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,260
Speaker 0: It says password incorrect or I run the application in the web browser and it works except it doesn't display any of the images.

702
00:46:06,623 --> 00:46:09,343
Speaker 1: Yeah, like what I could do is I could be like, okay No one can log in.

703
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:14,200
Speaker 1: and then I would like the Etsy password file and the shadow file would still be correct.

704
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:25,660
Speaker 1: But actually I would find I would reconfigure it to actually be using some shadow file that's hidden somewhere So that you wouldn't even you have to find the config file that points to which shadow file is being used.

705
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:33,120
Speaker 0: I just said yeah I'd set the total number of file handles that you can have open to something really small so stuff would break or I would be.

706
00:46:33,722 --> 00:46:41,677
Speaker 1: The sound isn't only working in some apps and I like what I did to you is I like swapped out your kernel modules To change the sound driver or something.

707
00:46:43,062 --> 00:46:45,319
Speaker 1: It'd be like, yeah, you'll never see that in a million years.

708
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:51,380
Speaker 0: But yeah again not talking about the 24/7 support stuff the work-life balance all those things.

709
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,804
Speaker 0: There's a discussion to be had there.

710
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:53,627
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong.

711
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:57,800
Speaker 0: I think the 24/7 support requirement is ridiculous bullshit.

712
00:46:58,468 --> 00:47:01,086
Speaker 0: I Refused to be on call.

713
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:04,702
Speaker 0: the part of the reason I have the care I have is that I was done with being on call Ever.

714
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:14,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing with this right is like not only are these people sort of ridiculous saying Oh one person can't have all these skills It's bad if you don't have all of them, right?

715
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,120
Speaker 1: Like what is someone I know in people who are like system administration skills and development skills?

716
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:29,540
Speaker 1: They set up a web server and it would be the most insecure Wrongly network configured thing in the universe and then the thing would just get taken down as soon as anyone tried to attack it ever.

717
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:32,612
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's like why did I just get taken down?

718
00:47:32,633 --> 00:47:34,199
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't do any IP tables at all.

719
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:36,648
Speaker 1: You did SSH with passwords.

720
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,459
Speaker 0: Oh most people in the world turn off IP tables the first thing they do.

721
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:40,804
Speaker 1: Why does it should?

722
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:42,431
Speaker 1: it's turned off usually by default.

723
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:45,467
Speaker 1: You have to set it up to actually add things to it Oh, and then they'll turn off.

724
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:49,875
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what I would do if I was gonna fuck up your server I would just turn on se Linux and not tell you.

725
00:47:50,157 --> 00:47:55,449
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, it's like, you know, it's like.

726
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,318
Speaker 1: there's things that you have to do, you know.

727
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,840
Speaker 1: They didn't turn on automatic security updates and then they didn't constantly maintain the server every single day with the new security update.

728
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,727
Speaker 1: So this no, this is zero day.

729
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:07,313
Speaker 1: wouldn't you just put out a patch?

730
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,919
Speaker 1: I read the patch, you know.

731
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:11,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you haven't installed that patch yet.

732
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:17,183
Speaker 1: I nail you with it Whatever it is, right because you haven't done it yet because you didn't set up auto update to install as soon as it would do Pushed it out.

733
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:17,525
Speaker 0: Yep.

734
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:20,060
Speaker 1: Good job because that's not something that's on by default.

735
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:27,680
Speaker 0: Now the other hilarious thing was the speculation about salaries because they make this point in the thing about salaries negotiable quotes.

736
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:28,989
Speaker 0: But you should know up front.

737
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,620
Speaker 0: We're not terribly money motivated group.

738
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,710
Speaker 0: We're more likely to spend less money on salary.

739
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,522
Speaker 0: invest that in making your day-to-day work life better Sure.

740
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:40,599
Speaker 0: Now that could reek of startup culture of hey you work somewhere cool, but we don't pay you.

741
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:42,046
Speaker 0: We don't know.

742
00:48:42,427 --> 00:48:44,900
Speaker 1: but I'm not motivated by money either.

743
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:45,904
Speaker 1: But there's still had.

744
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:49,980
Speaker 1: I am motivated almost entirely by money, but you still have to pay me a lot of money.

745
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:52,200
Speaker 1: You can't not pay me a lot of money.

746
00:48:52,342 --> 00:48:57,340
Speaker 1: So I saw someone Someone who actually someone who's competent and has all those skills.

747
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,631
Speaker 1: They obviously didn't put any numbers so we can't judge.

748
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:03,193
Speaker 1: they might you know, because they're so rich They might be like, yeah, not a lot of money 300k, right?

749
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever I was going to apply for this job.

750
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,920
Speaker 1: I Would ask oh if they first of all they had absolutely they must get rid of the on-call, right?

751
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:21,500
Speaker 1: So if they agree to get rid of the on-call nonsense Then you'd probably had to pay me like 150 to 200,000.

752
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:29,891
Speaker 1: I was gonna say I would ask for 150 because I think the fringe benefit someone with those Someone with those skills is rare and that's the market value.

753
00:49:29,972 --> 00:49:32,119
Speaker 0: I would argue that someone of those skills is not that rare.

754
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:34,569
Speaker 1: It's more rare than you think.

755
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:34,911
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:49:35,092 --> 00:49:42,314
Speaker 0: Well, I guess go try to hire someone Those tech skills and the social skills required for a job like this.

757
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,360
Speaker 1: Yeah find someone who has all that whole package.

758
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of rare and especially they're geographically limiting me.

759
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,999
Speaker 0: I was gonna say I would only ask for 150k because the fringe benefits of a job like this actually would be pretty sweet.

760
00:49:54,179 --> 00:50:06,833
Speaker 0: Yeah But if that was at borrowing Oh I saw a post on Twitter a tweet that said something to the effect of Wow Anyone who applies to this should better at least ask for 50k.

761
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,760
Speaker 0: Jesus like what?

762
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,140
Speaker 0: I got paid that at my internship.

763
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:16,719
Speaker 0: Like do you people have no conception of what the tech world is like?

764
00:50:19,704 --> 00:50:20,896
Speaker 0: 50k is what teachers make.

765
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:24,125
Speaker 1: It's not enough money.

766
00:50:24,145 --> 00:50:26,315
Speaker 0: that's close to the poverty line in New York City.

767
00:50:26,335 --> 00:50:29,534
Speaker 1: that is not yeah And Seattle's not much better right now.

768
00:50:29,554 --> 00:50:30,319
Speaker 1: Where are you gonna live?

769
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,744
Speaker 1: And the hostel the other?

770
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:35,654
Speaker 0: a lot of people because there's the no salary number is listed here.

771
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:36,717
Speaker 0: that that is tip.

772
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:41,380
Speaker 0: people seem to Just really think that this job means that they don't pay anything.

773
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,090
Speaker 0: I get the impression they're gonna pay a reasonable amount of money.

774
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,640
Speaker 0: They're just not gonna pay some ridiculous amount of money.

775
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:47,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, I might be wrong.

776
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:50,900
Speaker 1: I don't know but probably gonna play slightly less than the market rate.

777
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:51,984
Speaker 1: I mean no one.

778
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,412
Speaker 0: they'll probably shoot for like 80 or 90.

779
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:57,904
Speaker 1: anyone who has these social and technical skills to be Considered for the job.

780
00:50:57,984 --> 00:50:58,928
Speaker 1: right you're in Seattle.

781
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:00,694
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna be like an ex Amazon employee.

782
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:06,320
Speaker 1: They said don't relocate you Yeah to Seattle, but it's like it's someone who's willing to live in Seattle.

783
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:10,020
Speaker 0: So it's well, they're obviously going after the single nerd demographic.

784
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:19,152
Speaker 1: It's an intelligent city person is gonna know what their own market value is exactly and is only gonna mark my noble Smartly negotiate it down a little bit.

785
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:23,231
Speaker 1: if you're not smart enough to do that You're probably not smart enough to be considered for the job in the first place.

786
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,540
Speaker 0: now the well Yeah, I don't want to get into the 24-7 any of the social stuff.

787
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,654
Speaker 0: But if you out there some tech nerd and you're gonna try to apply for this job.

788
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:37,496
Speaker 0: Here's my advice to you one Don't list me as a reference unless you've talked to me at least once before now.

789
00:51:37,777 --> 00:51:41,420
Speaker 0: Okay kids I Yes, people have done that.

790
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:52,152
Speaker 0: I've written a lot of college recommendation letters and reference letters in the last couple of years and I Only actually write them for people who I can actually vouch for.

791
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:56,769
Speaker 0: so those of you who got letters from me It's because I actually have some respect for you.

792
00:51:58,002 --> 00:52:00,719
Speaker 0: Those of you who I didn't write them for it's because I had no idea who you were.

793
00:52:01,781 --> 00:52:09,604
Speaker 0: So if you think that you can list people like us because we lecture at penny arcade, you know at the packs penny arcade expo Unless we know who you are.

794
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:10,347
Speaker 0: That's not gonna help.

795
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:11,571
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't.

796
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:12,575
Speaker 1: I'm gonna recommend you.

797
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:13,278
Speaker 1: I don't know who you are.

798
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:18,760
Speaker 0: do Ask for the salary you think you need notice how they didn't say what a salary is.

799
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,384
Speaker 0: That's common in tech jobs.

800
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:21,708
Speaker 1: ask for more.

801
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:29,813
Speaker 0: ask for what you think you need plus plus 10 or 15 K. I mean I made a big mistake when I applied to my first job in the.

802
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:34,019
Speaker 1: I could have made a lot more money if I Would have asked for more monies in the olden days.

803
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:42,138
Speaker 0: I asked when I when I got that first job for that broker dealer I asked for 60 K. I was like, yeah, I need at least 60 K and they were like sure done.

804
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:44,549
Speaker 0: You're hired Yeah, I was like, oh shit.

805
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:46,417
Speaker 0: I fucked up fucked up fucked up.

806
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, then a month later.

807
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,733
Speaker 0: They're like, okay.

808
00:52:49,753 --> 00:52:50,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're good.

809
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:51,381
Speaker 0: And then they raised it to 90.

810
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,519
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, you really asked for the wrong amount of money kid.

811
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:56,651
Speaker 0: So even I. so don't make the mistake I made.

812
00:52:57,133 --> 00:53:04,219
Speaker 0: if you ask for the amount of money That's reasonable and you are skilled and you don't get the job then you didn't want the job.

813
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:07,759
Speaker 0: You don't want a job that will pay you less than you actually need.
