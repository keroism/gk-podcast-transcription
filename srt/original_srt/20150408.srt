1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,504
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 8th 2015.

2
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:12,987

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:26,374
Speaker 0: It's been a while since we've talked about anime con so anime Boston 2015 and Zenkai con The letter which is technically not an anime con if you listen to the people who want to say that to you.

5
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:28,079
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:35,900
Speaker 0: One of the weirdest things that I've ever done in my life is be in an airport, but not be flying anywhere.

7
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:37,796
Speaker 1: Why would you go to an airport?

8
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:37,938
Speaker 0: well?

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,410
Speaker 0: I had to go so I basically signed up for that like global entry thing cuz I fly around the world a lot like my Work was like yeah, it's free.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,954
Speaker 0: We'll pay for it.

11
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:44,539
Speaker 0: Just go get it.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,807
Speaker 0: Mostly, I'm doing it to get the TSA.

13
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,920
Speaker 1: I didn't think that I thought you could get checked at not an airport.

14
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:51,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can.

15
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,657
Speaker 0: so I signed up, and I filled out all this forms and everything and then they were like all.

16
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:59,200
Speaker 0: right now You need an appointment in the next 30 days for us to like meet you in person and like check on your shit.

17
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,412
Speaker 0: Yep, and I go.

18
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:07,539
Speaker 0: no There's one at Bowling Green like right next to my office, and I click find next available appointment slot and June 28th.

19
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:14,820
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, so then I was like yeah, can I get an earlier one somewhere else and if you go to JFK?

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,113
Speaker 0: There's an office there now, and I was able to get an appointment.

21
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,866
Speaker 0: like a few days There's no one wants to go there.

22
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:23,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you took the air train all the way there and back.

23
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:25,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically I took a half-day off work.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,400
Speaker 0: I took the air train from work to there and went from there train from work subway to the air train from work.

25
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, well yeah a train to the air train.

26
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:37,793
Speaker 1: Or you went to the South air train, so you know what's funny.

27
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,240
Speaker 0: from City Hall.

28
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:48,316
Speaker 0: It takes the same amount of time to take the e train to JFK Via air train as it does to take the a train.

29
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:50,665
Speaker 1: yep There are people who don't know.

30
00:01:50,865 --> 00:02:01,526
Speaker 1: for people who don't know the e train goes way north and then goes south to the e train goes Furthest Queens through Manhattan Like forest Rockaway a true.

31
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,788
Speaker 0: No it ends the time actually.

32
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:10,098
Speaker 0: no it ends at World Trade Center, but the same tracks with the a train go all the way.

33
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,460
Speaker 1: A train is all the way to the bottom part.

34
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,913
Speaker 1: So it's like go.

35
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:19,740
Speaker 1: it's basically Imagine a circle and it's just as fast to go to the top half as the bottom half of the circle.

36
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,392
Speaker 1: So one thing I'd ever to fly as the crow flies.

37
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:32,596
Speaker 1: It should be way As the person as the rim drives Michigan right as though Scott bikes it would be so fast.

38
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:33,660
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan.

39
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,248
Speaker 0: So I think about distance.

40
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:43,720
Speaker 0: still like it's hard for me to not think That it takes about 80 percent of the number of miles a place is away in minutes to get there.

41
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:49,199
Speaker 0: So if a place is 10 miles away I assume it's gonna take me like eight to nine minutes to get there.

42
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:56,332
Speaker 0: But in New York City you know cuz it's Michigan you drive like 60 to 80 miles an hour Everywhere there's really no traffic, and there's a grid.

43
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:58,742
Speaker 0: so if there's traffic you just go somewhere else on the grid It's a grid here.

44
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:11,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a grid here, but now I've been in situations where I am Close enough to home that I can see Like the up the tower next to our apartment building.

45
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,300
Speaker 1: we took that Amtrak home from Boston.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,760
Speaker 0: We just looked out the window.

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:24,497
Speaker 1: I saw my apartment And it went past my apartment And then it went around in a circle and then it went in a tunnel and it took me To a place that is 30 minutes away from my apartment.

48
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:24,960
Speaker 1: by train.

49
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:32,120
Speaker 0: I once sat and I could see the city building in Queens for a full hour stuck in traffic Just trying to get to that building.

50
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,453
Speaker 1: So yeah, New York, but the building the tallest of the buildings also has that effect.

51
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:42,854
Speaker 1: city buildings not that tall no But I mean it's way taller than buildings in the rest of the world.

52
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:43,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

53
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:49,834
Speaker 1: That would be the tallest building in town in most town.

54
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,320
Speaker 0: well like how we navigate in Boston.

55
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:51,823
Speaker 0: All we do.

56
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,553
Speaker 0: we got into the station we never been to before.

57
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:54,217
Speaker 0: we just looked around.

58
00:03:54,238 --> 00:03:56,326
Speaker 0: we're like well There's the only tall building in Boston.

59
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:56,848
Speaker 0: go that way.

60
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, the conventions at the tall building.

61
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll go to it.

62
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,000
Speaker 0: But yeah, the coolest thing was I will move on because I travel a lot for conventions.

63
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:07,699
Speaker 0: So I guess it's almost relevant to what we're talking about today.

64
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:13,120
Speaker 0: But the people that interviewed me and like did my background check were actual u.s.

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,497
Speaker 0: Customs and immigration people not like TSA people of course.

66
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,394
Speaker 0: good God does that just remind you of how?

67
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:32,826
Speaker 0: Professional chill and just generally cool people who work for the real parts of the government are Compared to the people who work with the TS the harder the job is to get the more awesome You have to be to get it.

68
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,077
Speaker 0: this guy sits me down, and he's like all right.

69
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:35,720
Speaker 0: I'm your passport.

70
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:36,508
Speaker 1: Are you a druggie?

71
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,013
Speaker 0: no?

72
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:37,780
Speaker 0: He just doesn't say anything.

73
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,675
Speaker 0: He's like hand me a passport, and then he's like he says nothing.

74
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,408
Speaker 0: he starts typing shit And then he's just looking.

75
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,060
Speaker 0: he's like looking through your background.

76
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:53,466
Speaker 0: I'm like okay, and he's like you ever done it like you ever done anything like really super bad, and I was like Like what constitutes bad?

77
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:53,908
Speaker 0: He's like.

78
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:54,209
Speaker 0: I don't know.

79
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,152
Speaker 0: I'm just making small chalk.

80
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:59,180
Speaker 0: the the thing already said you're fine So yeah, and then we started chatting.

81
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,074
Speaker 0: He's like so why signing up for this?

82
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:01,880
Speaker 0: your work paying for it?

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,170
Speaker 0: I'm like yep, and he's like yeah pretty much everyone who has this is either rich or their work pays for it and It was just a really much money could it be?

84
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:11,800
Speaker 0: it's a hundred bucks for five years.

85
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:12,764
Speaker 1: That's not that.

86
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:14,370
Speaker 0: it's actually not that expensive.

87
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,900
Speaker 1: I mean, but the thing is to make it worth it, right?

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,997
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a hassle to get it.

89
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a hassle.

90
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:24,340
Speaker 0: you fly in and out of a real Airport Internationally at least a few times a year.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,318
Speaker 1: It's not right the hassle of checking your passport at the airport takes a few minutes.

92
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:29,884
Speaker 0: this time It depends what.

93
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:34,840
Speaker 0: I've landed at JFK where the line for a citizen to get in was an hour, okay?

94
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,118
Speaker 1: So it takes an hour.

95
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:37,807
Speaker 1: So this had a long.

96
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,299
Speaker 1: did it take to go to JFK do this and then come?

97
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,914
Speaker 0: well I was doing it on work hours.

98
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,600
Speaker 0: So that was In fact, I just played a lot of nursery my hex sure, but I'm gonna say it takes for half your workday four hours.

99
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,580
Speaker 1: You have to fly four times to save time more.

100
00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:03,698
Speaker 0: I'm thinking of this way paying a hundred bucks to save at least 40 minutes on the average return from overseas For five years and I fly overseas like 12 to 20 times a year.

101
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,180
Speaker 1: That's true.

102
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,188
Speaker 1: You have five years to do all the traveling.

103
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I quit my job tomorrow, I've still got it for five years It's true.

104
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:14,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, so of course it's worth it and I didn't waste any of my personal time.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,400
Speaker 0: I got home earlier than I normally do sure so it was awesome.

106
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:27,700
Speaker 0: But yeah, the actual like interview took three minutes plus they took my fingerprints and then even the guy was like Oh, do you like rock climb or boulder or something?

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,386
Speaker 0: I was like you can tell that from my fingerprints.

108
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:33,994
Speaker 0: and he was like we can pick out you guys and we can pick out people who work in hospitals.

109
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:39,214
Speaker 0: and I was like I used to work in hospitals and yeah Actually didn't have fingerprints for that whole time.

110
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:43,220
Speaker 0: and he was like, yeah That's actually a problem because people who work in hospitals don't have fingerprints usually.

111
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,260
Speaker 0: Yep, but the guy was just like super professional and chill it It's.

112
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:55,213
Speaker 0: it's so weird to interact with the government official who is so chill Because you very rarely interact with the professional government because you're working a hospital.

113
00:06:55,233 --> 00:07:02,419
Speaker 1: you wash your hands like 10,000 times a day Yeah, but just like them like I cannot express to you how super chill this guy was.

114
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:03,583
Speaker 1: Wouldn't he be chill?

115
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:12,706
Speaker 0: because you kind of lose sight of that when you interact with like cops or the TSA people who are paid less More yeah, pretty much.

116
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:28,959
Speaker 0: or people who have jobs that actually matter like checking the actual passports is a real job Sure, but looking through my bags to see if I have more mousse than I'm supposed to have And making sure I took my shoes off So yeah, that's my story.

117
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:36,238
Speaker 1: Okay, so this weekend while we were anime Boston something happened something did happen something that we completely forgot about.

118
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,180
Speaker 1: it came by surprise.

119
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, the pones have returned.

120
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,240
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

121
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:47,940
Speaker 0: So it's funny because one there's been a lot of quality animation both anime and just animation for the last year.

122
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:54,598
Speaker 0: So when ponies ended season four we didn't really miss it while it was gone because I had so much else to watch like.

123
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:56,671
Speaker 0: I mean Just counting animation.

124
00:07:56,691 --> 00:08:04,770
Speaker 0: I've been watching Steven Universe Adventure Time Archer, uh Gumball and a bunch of anime.

125
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 0: like Yurikuma came and went in that span.

126
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,689
Speaker 1: Your panel came and went in that span.

127
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

128
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,943
Speaker 0: so I come home and from anime boss I'm like, what should I do?

129
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:16,332
Speaker 0: and then I go on Twitter and I sell these pones.

130
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,340
Speaker 0: I'm like is pone back?

131
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:23,179
Speaker 0: Oh shit, and then I go and of course there's an hour special and you know what?

132
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,509
Speaker 0: Still shows pretty good still.

133
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,586
Speaker 1: It's not bad It was ponies in vergeron.

134
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:29,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

135
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:30,654
Speaker 0: We're watching the episode.

136
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,260
Speaker 0: We're like, so are these cult ponies?

137
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,945
Speaker 0: They might be communist ponies.

138
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:36,794
Speaker 1: as soon as I saw the equals cutie marks.

139
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,000
Speaker 1: I'm like pony vergeron.

140
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there were noted.

141
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,308
Speaker 1: Did you see Harrison pony thon?

142
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,938
Speaker 0: You saw see the very clear like the wall reference.

143
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:44,839
Speaker 1: When was that?

144
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,767
Speaker 0: There's that where the when the ponies are marching the way they're set up and the cadence in the animation for a minute zooms in On their legs like the hammers.

145
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:52,610
Speaker 1: Okay.

146
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,292
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

147
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,597
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they were like.

148
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,319
Speaker 0: I will put this in here.

149
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:59,454
Speaker 0: The show, you know season two is the best that show ever had to offer.

150
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,240
Speaker 0: season one's rather the second best.

151
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:06,737
Speaker 0: I think the show was on this slow upward trends from season three onward.

152
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:07,720
Speaker 0: I think three was the bottom.

153
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,213
Speaker 1: I'm still a season one fan the most right?

154
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:13,186
Speaker 0: I think one is like 1% less good than two.

155
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:17,320
Speaker 1: I mean Sonic Rainboom is the best episode and so was the one with the dragon.

156
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:19,580
Speaker 0: I don't know if I know his best episodes.

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,451
Speaker 0: I actually a lot of the rarity episode isn't my favorite.

158
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:24,860
Speaker 1: all the all every not to say that the other ones are bad.

159
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:29,817
Speaker 0: but season one had all the things I like about season five so far.

160
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,447
Speaker 1: the Overall, it's season four now right?

161
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:34,310
Speaker 1: five five.

162
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,453
Speaker 0: Whoa Scott.

163
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,556
Speaker 0: You lost track of pones.

164
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,038
Speaker 1: Well,

165
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:48,927
Speaker 0: so one thing I liked is that the plot of this season seems to be the magic mystery map is going to send them on a whole bunch of episodic adventures Confronting direct conflicts

166
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:54,188
Speaker 1: and you know, they don't have a stupid thing at the end of every episode They have to write in a journal or

167
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:54,931
Speaker 0: right now.

168
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,538
Speaker 0: They are the Knights of the Round Table.

169
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:57,040
Speaker 0: like that's it.

170
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,351
Speaker 0: They are the authority.

171
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,640
Speaker 0: like when they went to this place Twilight could have just nuked it or whatever.

172
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:04,175
Speaker 0: They didn't need to like go back to Celeste you and get help.

173
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:08,518
Speaker 0: Twilight is Basically, like I don't know a level 15 mage.

174
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:09,844
Speaker 0: at this point I guess right.

175
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:15,990
Speaker 1: the one problem though is it seemed like because Twilight is so powerful They didn't they good thing.

176
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:18,540
Speaker 1: They didn't cover up the fact that she was so powerful.

177
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,854
Speaker 1: She tried many times to just magic the problem away directly with magic powers.

178
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:28,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean she could have nuked all right, but They kept having basically until the end.

179
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:36,679
Speaker 1: They kept having things prevent her from succeeding edges magicking the problem away And then at the end they did let her magic the problem away.

180
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,727
Speaker 1: He's the most satisfying but what?

181
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:39,590
Speaker 1: how are they gonna keep?

182
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,540
Speaker 1: are they gonna keep making excuses in every episode or are they gonna keep?

183
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,870
Speaker 1: Having scenarios that magic can't solve?

184
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,016
Speaker 1: because I can't imagine many.

185
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:54,930
Speaker 0: the problem The only problems with this episode was that they should have resorted to violence way earlier Yeah, and they fell for like baby's first trap.

186
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,094
Speaker 1: Well, they're not gonna.

187
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,900
Speaker 1: they're gonna learn and not fall for them again.

188
00:10:58,522 --> 00:10:59,485
Speaker 1: Second place they got to go.

189
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:03,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also like how the villain was basically just like a minor wizard.

190
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:05,269
Speaker 1: The villain was bad.

191
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,635
Speaker 0: It's like a minor wizard just started.

192
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,612
Speaker 0: a cult is basically Scientology Bergeron off in like the boonies.

193
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:12,700
Speaker 1: It's a Trixie kind of situation, right?

194
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,238
Speaker 0: Yeah Trixie would not be able to pull that off though.

195
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,349
Speaker 1: No, but I mean that that is a problem.

196
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,443
Speaker 1: right is that there are people who you know There are pones out there.

197
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,892
Speaker 1: all these people got magic this wizards fucking everywhere.

198
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,422
Speaker 1: one-third of the population as far as we know is Wizards.

199
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:27,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, so someone's got to keep that shit under control.

200
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,360
Speaker 0: Doesn't hurt to have another even you know, I wonder what the distribution actually is of pegasi unicorn earth.

201
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:35,927
Speaker 0: I think 33 we.

202
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,580
Speaker 0: you could figure that out by standing like background ponies.

203
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,320
Speaker 1: I mean it's tough, you know, if you go to clouds Dale's like a hundred percent Pegasus, right?

204
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's only one day.

205
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:45,951
Speaker 0: look at how many shit bird in Ponyville is.

206
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:48,759
Speaker 1: clearly there's Pegasus's but there's not.

207
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:50,387
Speaker 1: It's not as not thirty.

208
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:51,151
Speaker 1: It's less than thirty.

209
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,880
Speaker 1: three percent pegasi or a minority.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,178
Speaker 0: Oh evil, wasn't it notable that that's one of the few places where they intermingle.

211
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,250
Speaker 1: It's true the capital is mostly unicorns.

212
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, and everywhere else is mostly earth pones.

213
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ponyville seemed to have you know, not thirty three percent.

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,660
Speaker 1: it had you know more regular pones, but this yeah, there's still plenty of unicorns and You know enough pegasi in Ponyville.

215
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:21,820
Speaker 0: But I'm enjoying the fact that it's the Knights of the Round Table going on constant adventures Probably spikes pretty much not gonna be around for a while.

216
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,732
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure that'll tell them to go to.

217
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:28,279
Speaker 1: you know In like the later episodes it's gonna tell them to go to Ponyville like whoa.

218
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:36,020
Speaker 0: I was gonna tell them to go to Crystal Kingdom or tell them to go Keep taking them far enough away to where they cannot easily go back home.

219
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,380
Speaker 0: So they're kind of like the Horatio situation.

220
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:49,220
Speaker 0: The reason the Horatio hornblower stories work is because a ship captain in the British Empire Was basically the god of his ship and him and his officer just had to deal with whatever the fuck happened out there.

221
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,692
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you want to go back to Britain and get help or cannonballs.

222
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:57,318
Speaker 0: That's like a month or more journey Like you can't just leave.

223
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,320
Speaker 0: So that could force, you know, they have to deal with things with and if you try to just leave.

224
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:09,440
Speaker 0: There's Marines on the boat also Yeah, well also like no I'm saying like the ship tries to just leave to like go and get reinforcements or supplies.

225
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,708
Speaker 0: It'll be a few months before you get back.

226
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:12,571
Speaker 0: and what if they?

227
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:19,040
Speaker 0: I imagine actually if they'd left this town With violence in mind Jonestown would have happened before they got back.

228
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's already a rebellion happening right?

229
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,200
Speaker 0: Well, the rebellion was pretty much quashed.

230
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,949
Speaker 0: I mean they knew already that they're like they were set up.

231
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,454
Speaker 0: there were informants everywhere.

232
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,927
Speaker 1: I wonder if the evil pony What was her name?

233
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,056
Speaker 0: She's coming back.

234
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:38,040
Speaker 1: obviously I wonder if she offed any other pones who were betraying her the while before her.

235
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:40,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll bet her and Trixie team up at some point.

236
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,218
Speaker 1: It's the same voice actor.

237
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:43,900
Speaker 1: It's pretty similar.

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope they both.

239
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,519
Speaker 0: they team up at some point whatever or she goes off in mines Tyrak again or whatever.

240
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,904
Speaker 1: Who knows the other thing?

241
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:53,315
Speaker 0: I liked the Fluttershy was totally with this cult like from the beginning.

242
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:54,680
Speaker 0: Fluttershy's like, ooh, this is nice.

243
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,034
Speaker 1: She just doesn't like confrontation.

244
00:13:56,135 --> 00:14:00,205
Speaker 0: No So, yeah, I'm The best.

245
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:07,372
Speaker 0: actually, you know what the best pony is going on right now is still the comics but Maybe I could read those if you would find the ones that I have here.

246
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:07,714
Speaker 1: Yeah.

247
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:08,115
Speaker 0: Yeah.

248
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta deal with that.

249
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:14,900
Speaker 0: So in other news one of our panels anime Boston was our annual judge anime by its cover.

250
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:23,700
Speaker 0: And I want to highlight there were a few shows in this thing that at least on a surface view Actually looked like they were worth checking out.

251
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,449
Speaker 1: These are summer anime chart shows that we saw that we thought hey We're gonna probably watch at least the first episode maybe more.

252
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:38,236
Speaker 0: and we learned some things because at anime Boston Multiple people came up to and said yeah, we saw your thing last year in the year before.

253
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,561
Speaker 0: you guys are pretty much always Right.

254
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,889
Speaker 0: So we're pretty much batting at that.

255
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,340
Speaker 0: Well, we're betting 990 because we fucked up on Sailor Moon crystal.

256
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:50,839
Speaker 1: Please tell us we're serious if we fucked up anything else, but we're only just a highlight.

257
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,988
Speaker 0: Akagami no Shiro Yuki.

258
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,947
Speaker 0: He may looks okay, maybe Alright looks like a fantasy story.

259
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:00,400
Speaker 0: It has some really good allegorical style and art up here and it's bones.

260
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,153
Speaker 0: Okay, uh, I gotta skip down because I remember the order we did.

261
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:08,686
Speaker 0: these in some of these shows look pretty pedo Durato, but there's already.

262
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:09,791
Speaker 1: there are two that I haven't watched.

263
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's even more.

264
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 0: watched a couple episodes.

265
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:12,446
Speaker 0: You know what it is.

266
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:13,999
Speaker 0: It's just more Durato.

267
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:24,658
Speaker 0: Right gakko gurashi Might look stupid, but it's basically like a zombie survival show and it's got a little bit of potential.

268
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:28,466
Speaker 1: I think Mm-hmm It's not a show that looks good.

269
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:39,180
Speaker 1: It's a show that could be good in sort of a. I Don't know like it's cool like a Monica kind of way where it's like the schoolgirls, but it's not about that.

270
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it could or it could be like a Nichijou type.

271
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:47,700
Speaker 0: You know those kinds of characters in a zombie survival world, which I could dig that.

272
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:51,219
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the girl with the shovel already is gonna give you some comedy no matter what.

273
00:15:51,681 --> 00:16:06,513
Speaker 0: Gangsta just looks maybe good because it looks serious and not like other shows like If it's Amazing Mangalobes doing this that gachiman crowds inside.

274
00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,480
Speaker 1: Well, I don't I have to see gachiman crowds first.

275
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:14,046
Speaker 0: No, the only reason I bring it up is we got to see what the fuck the deal is with this because I'm getting a Project blue cheeky you vibe from it.

276
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:15,290
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

277
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,254
Speaker 0: I'm getting that vibe.

278
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,879
Speaker 0: I'll stand by that vibe.

279
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,588
Speaker 0: Bad Joe bad Joe bad Joe Bad show bad show.

280
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,339
Speaker 0: we were not positive about a lot of shows.

281
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,686
Speaker 0: Bad show bad show.

282
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,996
Speaker 0: actually that show no bad show.

283
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:32,000
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

284
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,840
Speaker 0: I think I mentioned all the shows that worth watching that our movie is gonna be good movies.

285
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:37,939
Speaker 0: Ushio and Tara is getting a remake.

286
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:39,435
Speaker 0: Mappa's doing it.

287
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 0: No one in the audience knew what Ushio and Tara was.

288
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:48,738
Speaker 0: It was a pretty good manga and an okay anime adaptation from the 90s.

289
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,709
Speaker 0: I think this looks pretty good.

290
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:54,159
Speaker 0: cuz Ushio and Tara was the story of a kid.

291
00:16:54,623 --> 00:17:05,987
Speaker 0: Okay, it's kind of like the Tenchi plot of a kid Finds this demon that was like sealed by his grandfather or whatever with this magic spear and the demons like if you free me I'm gonna fucking eat you and he's like.

292
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:07,592
Speaker 1: then why would you say that demon?

293
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,238
Speaker 1: You're basically asking not to be freed.

294
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:11,512
Speaker 0: rawr I'm a D. I'm a tiger demon rawr.

295
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,279
Speaker 0: They fucking eat you.

296
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,182
Speaker 0: He's just mad.

297
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:20,611
Speaker 0: and then this other demon comes and attacks the shrine and the demons like look if you free me Fight off that other monster.

298
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,867
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna promise I won't eat you and the kids like.

299
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,031
Speaker 0: what the fucking choice do I have?

300
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,902
Speaker 0: so he frees him, but he keeps the spear Mm-hmm.

301
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:33,620
Speaker 0: So now him and the demon are kind of enemies, but he's got the spear and the demons a powerful demon.

302
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:38,920
Speaker 0: So they're against each other and they're both against the other demons and that's kind of what it's like.

303
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,379
Speaker 0: And I think this could be pretty good.

304
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,452
Speaker 1: But can't the demon just take the spear cuz demon stairs?

305
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,320
Speaker 0: the spear is actually really powerful.

306
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:48,019
Speaker 1: So it's like you can't even go near him when he's got the spear.

307
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:50,191
Speaker 1: Uh, doesn't he have to sleep at some point?

308
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:54,188
Speaker 0: watch your show share Considerings being remade and no one's seen it.

309
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:57,120
Speaker 0: Uh, I feel like we just everyone should watch it.

310
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,400
Speaker 0: I think knowing nothing about the original other than what I said, there's a lot of awesome movies coming in the summer.

311
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:03,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, particularly Ghost in the Shell.

312
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,378
Speaker 0: that sin bad actually looks like it might be pretty good.

313
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,163
Speaker 1: Yeah Give me a Horace Prince of Sun vibe Seriously though.

314
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:10,805
Speaker 0: Ghost in the Shell.

315
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,088
Speaker 0: Ghost in the Shell.

316
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,517
Speaker 0: when I saw that coca-cola kid a tie cuz Scott just wrote it out in English.

317
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 0: That is that's one of the few complicated kanji words that I've ever recognized in my life.

318
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,306
Speaker 0: Ghost in the Shell.

319
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,220
Speaker 0: you guys don't understand how much I like Ghost in the Shell.

320
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,720
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

321
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:47,547
Speaker 0: so in Germany during the Wehrmacht You know the Third Reich World War two the Wehrmacht had a tank that was in many ways Technologically superior to pretty much any other tank in the world at that point.

322
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:48,530
Speaker 1: What was so great about it?

323
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,975
Speaker 0: The Tiger tank was just better.

324
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,521
Speaker 0: It was it was fast.

325
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:52,665
Speaker 0: It was super heavy.

326
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:55,562
Speaker 0: It was like a heavy tank Super crazy armored.

327
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:58,941
Speaker 0: It was basically Invulnerable to many lesser tanks.

328
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,382
Speaker 0: in a one-on-one kind of like confrontation You just roll onto the battlefield.

329
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:05,377
Speaker 1: if you're sitting inside of it You're perfectly safe and you can blow everyone else up now.

330
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,650
Speaker 0: There were many problems like yeah, the tiger tanks were amazing.

331
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:21,490
Speaker 0: Germany couldn't build that many of them let alone train enough crews for them and Because they were so technologically advanced they required a lot of complicated maintenance that became increasingly difficult as the war went on.

332
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,041
Speaker 0: So yeah, they had a few thousand like uber tanks.

333
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:24,985
Speaker 1: I was honored.

334
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:33,436
Speaker 0: America had Millions of shitty shirt will not millions but so many sherms like yeah, we lost ten in that battle But you lost your one Tiger tank.

335
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,298
Speaker 0: we came out ahead.

336
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:45,750
Speaker 1: I always wonder right what if Hitler was still Hitler but Minus the genocide part like he was just okay with all the people who lived in Germany and still tried to take over Europe.

337
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:46,292
Speaker 1: What about?

338
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:57,270
Speaker 0: basically one of the main reasons he reduced unemployment was by kicking all the Jews out of all their jobs and giving those Non-jews right, but he would just you know, employ the Jews give them jobs making tiger tanks just everyone in Germany.

339
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,334
Speaker 1: I don't care who you are.

340
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:02,147
Speaker 1: So you really gonna work together and be fascist, you know take over Europe.

341
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:02,990
Speaker 0: how many?

342
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:11,410
Speaker 0: Assassination attempts there were on Hitler by people who were like we want to be fascist Nazis But we need to cut down on the genocide and not invade Russia.

343
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:15,441
Speaker 0: There were so many attempts on his life.

344
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:20,139
Speaker 0: In fact, there was one dude who was like fuck it I'll suicide bombing because this shit's gotta end.

345
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:28,530
Speaker 0: So he put a chemical fuse for ten minutes In a bomb that he had on him met with Hitler.

346
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:35,970
Speaker 0: Hitler like called the meeting short and left early and he had to run to a bathroom and defuse the thing.

347
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,170
Speaker 0: The same bomb was then used to try to kill Hitler again.

348
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:44,750
Speaker 0: It was put on a plane with him, I guess and it just fucking didn't go off.

349
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:53,658
Speaker 1: All the alternate history like, you know, what's that guy who always writes the the Turtle dove right that guy?

350
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:57,876
Speaker 1: and also things like command and conquer red alert and you know These sorts of things are always like.

351
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,361
Speaker 1: what if Hitler got killed?

352
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,445
Speaker 1: What if this happened?

353
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:01,248
Speaker 1: What if that happened?

354
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:01,670
Speaker 1: the good news?

355
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,310
Speaker 1: I've never seen what would happen if Hitler was less evil because I guess no one wants to portray Hitler is less evil.

356
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,330
Speaker 1: But maybe you could just do the story as Hitler got killed.

357
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:14,253
Speaker 0: Hermann Gurne because right I've been reading a lot about world We're not.

358
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:18,790
Speaker 1: and Jew liking fascists ran Germany instead and they took over Europe.

359
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:34,548
Speaker 0: What's interesting though is so there's this two-sided view of the German military during the wehrmacht because on one hand They were like the troops that were like the stormtroopers were so technologically and tactically and just materially advanced compared to the armors they were fighting

360
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:35,030
Speaker 1: but

361
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:42,538
Speaker 0: The rest of the army was actually still like horse-drawn non mechanized Shittier than much of the rest of the world.

362
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,043
Speaker 0: So there's.

363
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:44,766
Speaker 0: it's a complication.

364
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:45,910
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's not.

365
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,440
Speaker 1: Anime otaku is usually military otaku.

366
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,302
Speaker 0: So that is true.

367
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:50,924
Speaker 1: There you go.

368
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,950
Speaker 0: What was that one show for summer?

369
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,039
Speaker 0: That's basically a member of the school.

370
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:07,827
Speaker 0: through and find it who is also an otaku Gets transported to a fantasy world got it Military guy right in the middle of the picture and he uses his fantasy and otaku and military knowledge combined to save the day.

371
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:10,595
Speaker 0: I Already give up on it.

372
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:10,997
Speaker 0: That's it.

373
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,443
Speaker 0: There it is gate.

374
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:18,441
Speaker 0: Jita J Tanochi nita kaku tata kek tata Kyra.

375
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:20,207
Speaker 0: some crazy Japanese fuck this show.

376
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:21,932
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah So it's basic.

377
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:28,150
Speaker 0: if the tiger tank was notable for another reason the tiger done with military fanboy parts.

378
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,856
Speaker 0: This is my my thing of the day.

379
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:42,008
Speaker 0: Oh, my thing of the day is this thing the tiger tank had possibly the best User manual ever written for anything into that point in the world.

380
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:52,319
Speaker 0: Yes It's in German the tiger feeble the tiger feeble or or tiger primer the tiger feeble Has cartoons in it.

381
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:53,930
Speaker 0: It has racy humor.

382
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:54,772
Speaker 0: It has.

383
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,942
Speaker 0: there's these characters and comics and poems.

384
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:00,830
Speaker 1: are they trying to copy Will Eisner's like service manuals?

385
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:11,266
Speaker 0: So basically the idea was that this thing had to act like they expected everyone who ran a tiger tank to actually fucking read This thing and know how to run the tiger tank.

386
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:15,543
Speaker 0: really well The tiger feeble is an amazing work to behold.

387
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:30,140
Speaker 0: watch check this shit out And if you're ever after write technical documentation kind of like how you know Network like the corporate or like sponsored type media like the Twitter accounts that succeed are the ones that are kind of real.

388
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,276
Speaker 0: and Like Sarah like funny and snarky and just.

389
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,620
Speaker 0: you know tell you like it is.

390
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:54,019
Speaker 0: The tiger feeble was that this shit is amazing and it was so successful That then later they made the Panther feeble for the Panther tanks and I'll like Many people who write about it make a point of saying this was actually written for Approved by the Wehrmacht.

391
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,164
Speaker 0: like this is official.

392
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:56,450
Speaker 0: It's amazing.

393
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:03,550
Speaker 1: If you like that sort of thing, you should check out preventative maintenance monthly, which is when Will Eisner was in the military.

394
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,810
Speaker 0: Oh, I think we made that a thing of the day at one point.

395
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,931
Speaker 0: I

396
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:26,580
Speaker 1: mean this, you know, Will Eisner basically made this monthly Effectively comic book magazine that told you how to prevent it, you know all about preventative maintenance of US military equipment during the war and It's prides, you know, that's not bad, but it's it's not as doesn't have a good name as the tiger feeble

397
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:28,747
Speaker 0: Tiger feeble, but it's

398
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,351
Speaker 1: but it's.

399
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:35,920
Speaker 1: you know, the tiger feeble is no Will Eisner There's a lot of naked ladies in it, too, which is you don't think Will Eisner ever drew a naked lady?

400
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,793
Speaker 0: No, I'm just saying the tiger feeble is pretty has a better name.

401
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,749
Speaker 1: Let's check the tiger feeble out So you got a thing of the day.

402
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,380
Speaker 1: I do so, you know.

403
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:52,460
Speaker 1: We usually you know, we're not like big fans of like the violent real-world sports here, you know It's not like we're following the MMA's of the boxing or anything like that.

404
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,125
Speaker 0: But I guess I love out you.

405
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:58,398
Speaker 0: the unstated assumption is that hockey and spin football are not violent.

406
00:24:58,718 --> 00:24:59,220
Speaker 1: not not.

407
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,146
Speaker 1: They're not just about violence, right?

408
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,109
Speaker 1: They just have violence.

409
00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:02,992
Speaker 0: That's modern.

410
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:05,039
Speaker 0: Hockey is not about violence.

411
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,323
Speaker 1: That's correct It's true.

412
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:10,220
Speaker 1: an Olympic hockey is the best hockey which is very devoid of violence.

413
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:12,992
Speaker 0: But there was an era of hockey where violence anyway.

414
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:13,735
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:14,780
Speaker 1: Thanks, Philadelphia.

416
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:15,016
Speaker 1: Yeah.

417
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:29,931
Speaker 1: But sometimes there is a notable Occurrence in the violent sports, you know, especially the MMA's and when there is it spreads around the internet To the eyeballs of people who can appreciate it, which is almost everybody.

418
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:32,540
Speaker 1: So this can be appreciated by everyone.

419
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:38,340
Speaker 1: Some 62 year old dude is in this MMA fight against a much younger individual.

420
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,940
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like it's some sort of major big-time fight, but it's not small time.

421
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,304
Speaker 1: That's like a real-deal ring.

422
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,631
Speaker 1: Not some backyard junk place.

423
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:48,296
Speaker 1: There's real people watching.

424
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:49,259
Speaker 1: You know, this is like.

425
00:25:50,223 --> 00:25:50,624
Speaker 1: You know, it's.

426
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:54,858
Speaker 1: it's almost like us at a convention panel compared to famous person at San Diego Comic Con.

427
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:55,420
Speaker 1: of that, you know.

428
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:03,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, so 62 year old dude fights much younger dude in MMA and I'm guessing you know What the result is.

429
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,360
Speaker 1: Otherwise, this wouldn't be a thing of the day.

430
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:13,300
Speaker 1: If the 62 year old dude just got the shit kicked out of him We wouldn't be discussing it because it would just be horrible.

431
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:21,093
Speaker 0: In the moment the booklet book is still watershed down It is a story about rabbits.

432
00:26:21,477 --> 00:26:21,679
Speaker 0: also.

Speaker 0: Yes, the one we did at midnight 30 had.

441
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:46,603

442
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:50,989

444
00:26:55,252 --> 00:27:08,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, I need to go to bed but all we did in this panel at the end was watch three and a half minutes of footage from utenna and Pause it periodically and point that only after every single line of dialogue.

445
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:13,484
Speaker 0: Yes, because the show is that thick We this show is.

446
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:18,158
Speaker 0: I was doing that for every single fucking episode of utenna and I the shows we're doing.

447
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,663

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,800
Speaker 1: Oh, ah At least for us there's plenty of conventions to go.

480
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,980
Speaker 0: Never thought I'd get to a point in a life where I said I want to go to conventions.

481
00:28:59,121 --> 00:28:59,985
Speaker 1: There's plenty to go to.

482
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:00,788
Speaker 1: we just won't be there.

483
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we went to Zenkaikan and anime Boston.

484
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,920
Speaker 0: Well Scott had to skip Zenkaikan for sad reasons, but I went and Scott went to the previous Zenkaikan.

485
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:11,628
Speaker 0: So he's been there.

486
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:12,620
Speaker 0: He knows the drill, right?

487
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,922
Speaker 1: So I actually didn't want to go to the Zenkaikan because I really needed the weekend and it's like yeah No offense to Zenkaikan It's not.

488
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:23,859
Speaker 0: I mean we just don't bail on things that we've committed to.

489
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:27,540
Speaker 0: But I really wanted to be home that weekend for personal reasons.

490
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:31,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just didn't want to go to Zenkaikan, but you did end up going.

491
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:35,867
Speaker 1: Should did I if I could have gone?

492
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,991
Speaker 1: would I have wanted to go?

493
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:37,995
Speaker 0: you would had a good time.

494
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:46,170
Speaker 0: it was interesting because You know, we go to a lot of cons and there's kind of this, you know This is sort of a episode more for people who've listened to geek nights.

495
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:50,971
Speaker 0: a lot because we used to go to a lot of Anime cons very few gaming cons.

496
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:52,800
Speaker 1: There weren't that many gaming cons.

497
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:55,460
Speaker 1: The only gaming con that can't that we started going to his packs.

498
00:29:55,581 --> 00:30:03,573
Speaker 0: it just happens to be that there's like four of them and we fucking loved anime cons and we went to a Lot of anime con most of them and the product.

499
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,460
Speaker 0: what happened was we went to one packs.

500
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:10,494
Speaker 0: We came home and we were like, wow, and I saw magfest almost all shit.

501
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:15,829
Speaker 0: and we went to magfest for like wow Yeah, anime cons and most gaming cons are shit.

502
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:33,618
Speaker 1: The big problem that anime cons have in general is not that they're bad It's that as so if you are not a person who can find something to enjoy and do During that whole weekend that you're there you spend a lot of time doing nothing Whereas at a gaming con you can always bail to tabletop.

503
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:37,654
Speaker 0: Yep So this is something that that have or other gaming areas PC.

504
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:52,349
Speaker 0: There's another factor Any con is fun if enough of your friends go and They're actually your super close friends that you would like hang around like late at night in your own hotel rooms with Mm-hmm, like your like friends.

505
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,920
Speaker 1: You don't even need the convention for that.

506
00:30:55,221 --> 00:31:04,209
Speaker 0: So yeah, but it gives you context because the thing is here at a con means you all hang out and make messes But you're not in anyone's house for those messes.

507
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,080
Speaker 1: So consider, you know an artist's alley, right?

508
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,770
Speaker 1: Okay, so I go to a con by myself.

509
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,715
Speaker 1: I go the artist's alley.

510
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:10,480
Speaker 1: What can I do there?

511
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,106
Speaker 1: I can buy stuff and look at arts.

512
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:14,937
Speaker 1: if I have a person with me now, I can increase that.

513
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:15,700
Speaker 0: enjoy Scott.

514
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:17,677
Speaker 0: Oh my god, look at that art right there.

515
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:18,000
Speaker 0: like that.

516
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,594
Speaker 1: It's like a third person who saw the artist's alley without us.

517
00:31:20,634 --> 00:31:21,700
Speaker 1: They all gonna come up to me later.

518
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,727
Speaker 1: Like did you see that thing?

519
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,480
Speaker 1: It's like no I missed that shit.

520
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:27,334
Speaker 1: I guess you better go back and look at it cuz he totally missed it.

521
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:31,029
Speaker 1: All right This thing I bought you this, you know.

522
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:38,680
Speaker 1: suddenly stuff sir more people you bring with you Multiplies the amount of enjoyment you can extract from a specific thing at a convention.

523
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:39,510
Speaker 0: So here's our side.

524
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:40,219
Speaker 1: as a limit to it.

525
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,426
Speaker 0: Obviously we went to a ton of anime cons.

526
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:45,976
Speaker 0: lot of our close friends went to anime cons.

527
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:47,340
Speaker 0: anime cons were a thing for us.

528
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,947
Speaker 0: We went to a Pax.

529
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,803
Speaker 0: we said holy fuck the next year we got a like.

530
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:59,295
Speaker 0: we got a bunch of our friends to go to a Pax and Then all our friends said wow fuck anime cons.

531
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:06,720
Speaker 0: and overnight Almost everyone we used to go to anime cons with started going to only Pax's and mag fests.

532
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:10,205
Speaker 0: They literally dropped Every anime convention that.

533
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:17,990
Speaker 0: these are people who'd gone to Otacon ten years in a row who suddenly just dropped it overnight Because they'd been to a Pax and a mag fest.

534
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:21,062
Speaker 0: Yep, and these people are super anime fans, too Like don't?

535
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:22,728
Speaker 1: they're watching anime all the time.

536
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:24,395
Speaker 1: Yeah every season watching anime.

537
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,640
Speaker 0: They just don't go to anime cons.

538
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:31,528
Speaker 0: So now if I go to an anime con like we have friends there like an anime Boston we had like a bunch of like friends

539
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:36,200
Speaker 1: a lot of people there that we knew who they were and they knew us and we Ate together and hung out and spent time together.

540
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:43,239
Speaker 0: But our crew like the crew of people what with I've gone to cons for ten years with was not there.

541
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:57,804
Speaker 0: so All the time between hanging out with those friends like con friends and running our panels There's maybe two and a half hours of content total that are worthwhile to us Other than Mike Tool's stuff.

542
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:59,329
Speaker 1: Yeah walk around the dealers room once.

543
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:01,356
Speaker 1: Mike Tool had two panels.

544
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,138
Speaker 1: He went to one of them.

545
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:10,285
Speaker 1: Yep Walk around the artists alley once walk around the convention once and Do our panels.

546
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,940
Speaker 0: but meanwhile Zenkai con the core crew went.

547
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:17,816
Speaker 1: Our core crew was there because some of them are running it.

548
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:26,764
Speaker 0: Yes So as a result, I spent most the con hanging around in bars and restaurants outside of the con with really close friends Just drinking and playing.

549
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,933
Speaker 1: There's nothing about Zenkai con itself.

550
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:32,280
Speaker 1: if we're talking to these people listening to the show They need to know about the convention.

551
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the convention go to it if it's closed.

552
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:37,364
Speaker 0: if I if I could drive to it an hour I just go to it no matter what.

553
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:38,710
Speaker 1: that's true for almost any convention.

554
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:45,327
Speaker 0: Yes, and I'll probably go next year Cuz I actually really good time Partly because I gotta say about Zenkai con.

555
00:33:45,347 --> 00:33:46,793
Speaker 1: Well anything notable happened there.

556
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:48,640
Speaker 1: Were there any notable panels events?

557
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,809
Speaker 0: I did not go to any event that I did not run.

558
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,760
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any notable like rooms?

559
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,943
Speaker 1: Like was the artist alley?

560
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:59,416
Speaker 0: good dealers room good like the artist alley was the same as last year.

561
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:00,320
Speaker 1: nice and tiny.

562
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, like good, but good quality.

563
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:03,717
Speaker 1: increase the size of it.

564
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:05,124
Speaker 1: since last year Even though the convention grew.

565
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:08,900
Speaker 0: now cuz the space is pretty much the space they fill this convention center.

566
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:14,360
Speaker 0: Okay, but I mean the con was the same as what you experienced in every way you can think of.

567
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:20,860
Speaker 0: The only thing that was different at all is they had a room dedicated to Artemis which was just kind of cool.

568
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:26,780
Speaker 0: All right, a lot of conventions doing that days and there's fucking nowhere to eat food in Lancaster.

569
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:28,369
Speaker 1: True the same as last time.

570
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,179
Speaker 0: the worst thing is it was restaurant week there.

571
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:44,179
Speaker 0: So the few restaurants they had were full of townies townies And so we went off to this townie restaurant that was kept pretty far away from the con cuz we all heard Alright, if we go to a place is way far away from the con town only locals would eat there.

572
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,728
Speaker 0: How could it be full?

573
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:46,754
Speaker 0: we went there full?

574
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:47,659
Speaker 0: It wasn't that full.

575
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,125
Speaker 0: Oh disgusting.

576
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:56,327
Speaker 0: the owner Really didn't seem to want to let us into his restaurant Like he was really grumpy and surly.

577
00:34:56,368 --> 00:35:00,440
Speaker 0: it was like kind of trying to passive-aggressively make us go away.

578
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,640
Speaker 1: Okay, and then as we want more money.

579
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,356
Speaker 0: So then as we walked out I saw a big sign and the sign said no cell phones.

580
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:10,600
Speaker 0: No cussing.

581
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:16,178
Speaker 1: So Yeah, I had a lot of cell phones and cussing.

582
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:19,300
Speaker 0: We were basically all standing there looking at our cell phones and cussing.

583
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:26,293
Speaker 0: Well, one of us is trying to negotiate like no we can split up into different tables, it's fine, dude Just like we'll just take those tables there.

584
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,617
Speaker 0: It's fine, dude it will sit down.

585
00:35:28,698 --> 00:35:28,779
Speaker 0: or.

586
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:36,260
Speaker 0: And also I looked up at his beer menu and it pretty much consisted of like four bottle beers and like butt on tap.

587
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:47,095
Speaker 0: Okay, so, uh, yeah But here's the notable thing about zinc icon because this is all The things that are notable about zinc icon this year are the same things that were notable about anime Boston.

588
00:35:47,756 --> 00:35:54,499
Speaker 0: the academic and For-real panels are having a huge uptick in terms of people going to see them.

589
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,086
Speaker 1: Okay, that's nice.

590
00:35:56,126 --> 00:36:13,297
Speaker 0: You saw that anime Boston like Mike tool was like my 10 a.m Friday panel was full and we were like, yeah our like Mid-eleven at night panel on Friday is full like people are being turned away Like the panels that were actually good with good to good content full.

591
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:18,269
Speaker 0: Yep, and That has not been the case Previously at anime cons.

592
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,400
Speaker 0: for us like this is a trend now, right?

593
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,437
Speaker 1: So let's have anime Boston which I did go to.

594
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,382
Speaker 1: yeah It's an anime.

595
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:29,559
Speaker 1: Boston had problems talking about just the convention not our personal deal of going there without people.

596
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,190
Speaker 1: Yeah The convention itself the way I see it.

597
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:36,160
Speaker 1: It did an amazing job within horrible conditions.

598
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,808
Speaker 0: Yes, like Boston basically fucks anime Boston.

599
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,460
Speaker 1: like Boston is doing everything it can to hurt anime Boston.

600
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:55,174
Speaker 0: It's like the security thing is just as awful as it was before Alright, and it's very telling how much worse it is for AB than it is for packs because packs has the cloud to force Boston to back off a little bit.

601
00:36:55,194 --> 00:36:58,960
Speaker 1: anime boss Oh can't force him to back off enough, but they back off more sure.

602
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:07,646
Speaker 1: But it's basically like not just the security but like just the conditions under which anime Boston is existing Right are just not good.

603
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:10,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Boston prevents them from doing their dance.

604
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:13,199
Speaker 0: There was cops fucking Everywhere.

605
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:16,167
Speaker 1: Security checks at the door.

606
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:17,714
Speaker 0: the convention center staff this year.

607
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:25,760
Speaker 0: We're surly as fuck Mm-hmm, like like notably surly and let me tell you we have a high tolerance for surly convention center staff.

608
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,532
Speaker 1: Yep, the Sheraton hotel that is attached to anime boss.

609
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:30,736
Speaker 0: Fuck never stay there.

610
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:32,000
Speaker 1: They had a big problem.

611
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:33,800
Speaker 1: This is the elevators are a big problem.

612
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,691
Speaker 1: They couldn't even check people in as fast as they could.

613
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:39,344
Speaker 0: our and 45 minute way to check into your hotel Right now.

614
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:41,040
Speaker 1: that wasn't anime Boston's fun.

615
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,686
Speaker 0: None of these things are anime Boston's.

616
00:37:42,706 --> 00:37:50,660
Speaker 1: basically within this framework of bad things happening around it Anime Boston itself is doing a great job of being anime Boston.

617
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,123
Speaker 1: They mostly anime content almost all anime content, even though there's some non right Every.

618
00:37:57,163 --> 00:37:58,951
Speaker 1: there's just Pete tons and tons of people.

619
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:03,148
Speaker 1: It was probably the most crowded highest Attendance anime boss they've ever seen.

620
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:06,260
Speaker 0: the crowds were like really well-behaved like no weird shit was going on.

621
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,560
Speaker 0: Marco Polo was existent, but there's this great moment where I think was on Friday night.

622
00:38:11,781 --> 00:38:16,702
Speaker 0: We heard somebody yell Marco and somebody else that shut the fuck up and then it was quiet Mm-hmm.

623
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:23,043
Speaker 1: And yeah, like the Marco Polo is not really that tolerated anymore and there's still a few punk kids, you know But not too many.

624
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:24,749
Speaker 1: the artists alley very high.

625
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:27,940
Speaker 1: I guess the art show is down, but that's your choice Boston's fault.

626
00:38:28,101 --> 00:38:29,345
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be really really real.

627
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,980
Speaker 0: there was almost nothing notable in the art show, but it's not anime Boston's.

628
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,855
Speaker 0: It's like saying oh you didn't have any good panels like at a con.

629
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 0: it's like well what was submitted?

630
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,747
Speaker 1: Let's put some stuff in that art show next year.

631
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,232
Speaker 0: You're out of light.

632
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:41,995
Speaker 1: I'll just draw.

633
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:43,300
Speaker 0: you remember the rod of light?

634
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,771
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm just gonna draw like a spirit to me or something.

635
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:51,400
Speaker 0: I'm gonna draw a Baron, okay But yeah.

636
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:58,600
Speaker 1: So the one especially notable thing about anime Boston was it in the Sheraton Hotel on the fifth floor?

637
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:02,511
Speaker 1: Where the swimming pool is and the gym and other weird stuff.

638
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:05,500
Speaker 1: there were some rooms and they got these rooms.

639
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,700
Speaker 1: They basically got every room they possibly could in the area.

640
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:15,360
Speaker 0: Yeah This is like there are people's like regular hotel rooms and then there's these like low ceiling conference room, right?

641
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,048
Speaker 1: So they got these more rooms just to get more rooms and in those rooms they put Foundations of anime.

642
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,760
Speaker 1: is the foundations of anime area.

643
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:28,540
Speaker 1: This is in a hotel attached to the convention center on a weird fifth floor.

644
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,139
Speaker 1: That's hard to get to it hard to even know it exists.

645
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,135
Speaker 1: Yet we went up there to see what the deal was.

646
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:38,860
Speaker 1: because we had so much time We want to see every part of the convention place was rocking.

647
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:40,020
Speaker 1: It was full.

648
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:43,012
Speaker 1: There was a mythology and anime panel that was starting as we were leaving.

649
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,920
Speaker 1: that had any full line going all the way out And down the stairs and was a big problem.

650
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:49,237
Speaker 0: There was a guy who did a panel on like Gundam shorts.

651
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:49,700
Speaker 1: through the guys.

652
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,667
Speaker 1: There was a the panel on Gundam shorts.

653
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,220
Speaker 1: I get I've go to peek in and it looks like he's a that guy.

654
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:55,846
Speaker 1: But he's not.

655
00:39:55,927 --> 00:40:02,579
Speaker 1: he's just the guy who's way into Gundam But it's totally normal and chill and he's showing these Gundam shorts that are all amazing many of which I hadn't seen.

656
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:02,980
Speaker 1: only one.

657
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,446
Speaker 0: What was he doing?

658
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:07,540
Speaker 0: He was he was explaining what their deal wasn't giving context.

659
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew what he was talking.

660
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:18,039
Speaker 1: There are some Gundam fanboys in the crowd but most were not super fanboys and the room was mostly full in his weird area and It was pretty terrific.

661
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:20,679
Speaker 1: Yeah The other panel next door looked great too.

662
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:26,370
Speaker 0: Three years ago if you had told me this was going to exist in anime Boston I would have said that's a bad idea.

663
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,363
Speaker 0: one person will find this place This you like.

664
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:37,892
Speaker 0: I am so happy that people were up there and the people who were there It's kind of like it packs go over to the panel rooms.

665
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:45,393
Speaker 0: We're like game design stuff is going on Very different crowd from the kinds of people are in the expo hall and anime Boston.

666
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:51,380
Speaker 0: the kinds of people who are in this area Were our kinds of people you know me chill conversations.

667
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:55,840
Speaker 0: We have the strangers the likes of which I cannot have with strangers and other parts of anime cons.

668
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:59,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, the hotels like little office He area was also there.

669
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,017
Speaker 1: so I was sitting in one of the office He chairs next to the rented computer that I wasn't using.

670
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:08,080
Speaker 1: yup And it's like this people hanging out there like eating lunch, and they had seen our panel and they were totally chill.

671
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:10,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, like oh hey you guys did that panel on that.

672
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:11,620
Speaker 0: that was super awesome.

673
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,485
Speaker 0: I just wanted to say I don't want to intrude, but you did a really good job, and they walked away, and I was like That's what happens at Pax's.

674
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:19,712
Speaker 0: that's happening at an anime con now.

675
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:27,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like anime Boston is like Totally rockin just within these bad conditions of stupid hotel and stupid Boston.

676
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,923
Speaker 0: yup And like seriously Go back.

677
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:40,928
Speaker 0: yeah our panels like filled standing room only people being turned away people Exceeding the fire code like going nuts.

678
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,760
Speaker 1: I think I want to go back and just do way more panels.

679
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:48,138
Speaker 0: I'll submit as many panels as you know because we have to do at least four because of the like.

680
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:51,142
Speaker 1: the panelists I'd submit like six or eight or something I would.

681
00:41:51,283 --> 00:42:01,638
Speaker 1: I will do as long as long as a bunch of them are easy to do and they don't get scheduled for 1232 - I was fine with that because a lot of people is not fine with that because I didn't go to sleep.

682
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:05,512
Speaker 0: yeah Well, we didn't have any panels on Sunday if we get a 1230.

683
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:10,940
Speaker 1: if they'd given us the schedule earlier I could have gotten a later trip home and slept in and then wouldn't fine.

684
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:16,540
Speaker 0: We could have gotten a later trip home and slept in if we weren't just paranoid and gotten up way too fucking early on Sunday.

685
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:18,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean if we do eight panels.

686
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,837
Speaker 1: Maybe there's someone will be on Sunday, so we have to you know.

687
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:32,400
Speaker 0: So I've realized now I will continue to go to cons like Zank icon because my My core core friends will get drunk with me and hang out any convention no matter how shitty if you got friends there.

688
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:43,815
Speaker 0: Yes, okay, and I will continue to go to anime cons as because the the only problem is other than like Mike tools stuff And that floor five we didn't go to any panel content except the things.

689
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,140
Speaker 1: usually we go to the concert.

690
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,622
Speaker 1: But the concerts this year were Lisa who I don't know if she's good or not But she basically does anime theme songs, and they're not animes I know.

691
00:42:51,663 --> 00:42:55,340
Speaker 1: so I didn't care and front a lot who I've seen six or seven time.

692
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,825
Speaker 0: I know I've seen front a lot so many times I think I made at this point.

693
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:01,999
Speaker 1: I may have seen MC front a lot more than any other musical act on earth.

694
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:04,265
Speaker 1: He just goes to all the same.

695
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:07,457
Speaker 0: I may have seen Paul and storm more times.

696
00:43:07,658 --> 00:43:08,100
Speaker 0: technically.

697
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,956
Speaker 1: Maybe you did see them a time when front a lot was not there.

698
00:43:11,977 --> 00:43:19,759
Speaker 0: yes And I have skipped front a lot in the past just because his concert was on the day I didn't want to go to a concert at a PAX.

699
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:21,853
Speaker 1: It would be tough to count.

700
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:23,297
Speaker 0: yeah Oh my god.

701
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,860
Speaker 1: Well can you add in the times that I saw front a lot like he is having a concert and I was there.

702
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,936
Speaker 1: But I didn't actually like stand at the concert like those CES right.

703
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:34,859
Speaker 1: No it wasn't CES.

704
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:38,814
Speaker 1: It was like it was like fake CES in the Javits.

705
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:40,380
Speaker 0: Oh, what was that called?

706
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,764
Speaker 0: I know what you're talking about that.

707
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:50,173
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's like I was just walking around looking at the booths and then leaving and I front a lot was just like they're doing his thing.

708
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:55,419
Speaker 1: This is before I ever went to PAX and Like six people were watching him.

709
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:56,143
Speaker 1: But he was.

710
00:43:56,424 --> 00:43:58,934
Speaker 1: he was acting like it was a full crowd like he should like.

711
00:43:58,974 --> 00:44:03,372
Speaker 1: yeah like you do cuz he's pro And I just saw him from afar, and I'm like is that front a lot.

712
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:05,080
Speaker 1: I guess it is wow that's sad.

713
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:06,860
Speaker 1: He's he's rapping to nobody.

714
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:08,345
Speaker 1: That's all right.

715
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,100
Speaker 1: I listened to him for like a minute and then kept walking.

716
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:13,534
Speaker 0: But yeah, the the only reason that we want to talk about these cons.

717
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:21,888
Speaker 0: Oh, here's the other weird thing We noticed and Scott you'll bag me up on this and I will say this is a hundred percent true for Zenkai Con 2 Fursuits like full-on.

718
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:29,090
Speaker 0: I am a furry with a capital S fursuit Way up like there is a trend.

719
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,535
Speaker 1: I mean I don't want you to.

720
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:37,852
Speaker 1: I don't want you to be imagining that It's like 25% fursuits right no But it is like usually when you go 120% increase in fursuits.

721
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:38,072
Speaker 1: right.

722
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:43,698
Speaker 1: usually when you go to a con like this like you go To magfest they'll be like two fursuits, and you see the same two going around.

723
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:45,024
Speaker 1: yeah You go to kinetic on.

724
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:49,060
Speaker 1: it's like five fursuits, and you see them because they stand out so much.

725
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,744
Speaker 1: There's a big.

726
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,399
Speaker 1: you see them, and then you can recognize them when you see them again.

727
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:56,393
Speaker 1: So it's very easy for anyone who goes to a convention for all the full weekend.

728
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,701
Speaker 1: if you move around and don't stay in one Spot.

729
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:01,491
Speaker 1: you have a pretty accurate count of unique fursuits.

730
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,000
Speaker 0: I think there were more than 40 at this anime, Boston.

731
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,923
Speaker 0: I know it was.

732
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:14,340
Speaker 1: it was a number that was quite significant to where I did not see like the same one twice very often And I was rarely in a place where I saw zero at a time.

733
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:18,959
Speaker 1: There was usually one like in every place.

734
00:45:19,604 --> 00:45:20,189
Speaker 1: So I were.

735
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:20,472
Speaker 0: so what?

736
00:45:20,492 --> 00:45:23,366
Speaker 0: this is what we wonder Why and we're not like.

737
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:24,069
Speaker 0: we're not saying like.

738
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:28,308
Speaker 0: I don't care like it's cool because the thing is the really high quality To the what I mean.

739
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,220
Speaker 1: a full body fursuit is rarely low quality.

740
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:33,730
Speaker 0: They were easy to make what they used to be rare to see.

741
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,513
Speaker 0: so I'm wondering.

742
00:45:34,613 --> 00:45:35,637
Speaker 0: I have a few theories either.

743
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:42,499
Speaker 0: one furry cons are going the way of Sci-fi cons meeting the way of guy trying to blow up the con.

744
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:48,020
Speaker 0: yes Astronomicons meaning everyone there is 48 years or older obese and a pedophile.

745
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,285
Speaker 0: Maybe that is.

746
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:57,320
Speaker 0: so maybe young cool art kids are like they go to one Like people go to one sci-fi con and they go oh shit, and then they never go back.

747
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,666
Speaker 0: But they've got this fursuit.

748
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:02,865
Speaker 0: so they go to the anime con like maybe they're just going to anime cons now Maybe.

749
00:46:02,946 --> 00:46:06,745
Speaker 0: so maybe those cons are just all exploding Disappearing collapsing.

750
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:07,146
Speaker 0: who knows?

751
00:46:07,427 --> 00:46:11,660
Speaker 0: maybe young nerd kids just don't care about their nerder being out there anymore.

752
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:19,970
Speaker 1: I'm sure the listener is intelligent enough to speculate on the all possible reasons for an increase in freedom And we don't need to just tell them the speculations.

753
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:20,974
Speaker 1: They could make on their own.

754
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:21,636
Speaker 0: I don't know.

755
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:24,106
Speaker 0: I'm curious though I want you guys to tell us speculation.

756
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:25,070
Speaker 1: right I do.

757
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:28,965
Speaker 1: I want to hear speculations that I haven't thought of But also I want to hear some.

758
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:30,911
Speaker 1: you know anyone with knowledge of?

759
00:46:31,152 --> 00:46:36,912
Speaker 1: I know there are people who listen to have furry knowledge is Furry-up, I need to know the furry weather report.

760
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:43,320
Speaker 0: yes because it's a red There's there's the tide is rising in the harbor right now on nerdery in Jen.

761
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,303
Speaker 1: I can see it's like.

762
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:48,898
Speaker 1: I can see that it's raining more now, but that doesn't tell me about tomorrow's weather.

763
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,139
Speaker 0: Yeah Right so look at it.

764
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,774
Speaker 0: So here's that there's the con weather report anime con weather report.

765
00:46:55,336 --> 00:47:05,132
Speaker 0: anime Boston in content in particular, I can't say this about other anime cons has Consistently been getting better and better and better over everything.

766
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:08,726
Speaker 0: it has control over the anime Boston staff Every year.

767
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,180
Speaker 0: make things better and the con is on this upper trajectory.

768
00:47:11,882 --> 00:47:22,520
Speaker 0: anime con attendees across the board are in an upper trajectory of being more interested in the Academic good content less interested in the bullshit even if they're not overall more interested.

769
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:29,094
Speaker 1: There are more people who are interested such that those Panels and things fill up or a very crowded and well attended because it's

770
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:33,032
Speaker 0: not just that everything was filling because we can't Peek in our heads in on all the other

771
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:38,880
Speaker 1: like there's a panel before us Which is a very nice well-done generic cosplay like how to be a cosplay business

772
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:40,466
Speaker 0: Pro yeah,

773
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:42,293
Speaker 1: but very poor attendance like

774
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,558
Speaker 0: 12 people are in the audience.

775
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:53,091
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Basically universally most of the panels we looked in that weren't like Mike tool mostly empty Mm-hmm, but see.

776
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:54,980
Speaker 0: but yeah all the academic stuff super full.

777
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,077
Speaker 0: So rising tide there and furry is also a rising tide of the anime kind.

778
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:10,078
Speaker 1: and one more thing I want to say about anime Boston which differentiates it from other anime cons And they've always done this but they're doing it even more is every year They have a theme and they go all-in on that theme.

779
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:13,453
Speaker 0: and this Was so good the way they did the theme this year.

780
00:48:13,534 --> 00:48:14,980
Speaker 1: the theme was such an excellent theme.

781
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,046
Speaker 1: It was mecha's verse kaiju.

782
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:18,672
Speaker 1: so they could integrate both at once.

783
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:21,280
Speaker 1: right it would have been easy to just be like mecha.

784
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,553
Speaker 0: But oh yeah, and their guests they had two of the Godzilla people right.

785
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:41,492
Speaker 1: so if you watch the original Gojira the very very first one from the olden days the guy who was in the Godzilla suit and also in the suit for like most of the movies that happened after that he was there and So was the main actor human guy right?

786
00:48:41,712 --> 00:48:42,956
Speaker 1: You know he was also there.

787
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,100
Speaker 1: How am I supposed to remember these?

788
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:44,960
Speaker 0: I don't remember his name either.

789
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:52,560
Speaker 1: He if I when I'm his main human character from the original gods at Godzilla who was also in some other Godzilla movies.

790
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:54,129
Speaker 1: He was also there.

791
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:56,119
Speaker 0: He was wearing this amazing suit.

792
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,167
Speaker 1: He was like Japanese mr.. Hollywood.

793
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:02,616
Speaker 0: yes, and the first question his answer was basically all.

794
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:06,510
Speaker 0: it was all about Japan being nuked And the dangers that like the whole nuclear horror.

795
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,077
Speaker 0: It was just a great answer.

796
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:12,451
Speaker 0: also I think he's sexually attracted to Mothra like so am I.

797
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:14,396
Speaker 1: so we have something in kinda like.

798
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:24,196
Speaker 0: he was joking obviously But it was funny to see how he joked about Mothra and the audience laugh, and then he just kept Escalating the joke and he can't.

799
00:49:24,216 --> 00:49:24,700
Speaker 0: he got to the point.

800
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,469
Speaker 0: We started doing it in English just to get.

801
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,700
Speaker 1: even a lot of people had their cameras out for this panel.

802
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,006
Speaker 1: I'm sure you could find video of it.

803
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:31,393
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

804
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:38,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah Autograph signing Distantly also does a good job of getting a good mix of guests.

805
00:49:38,962 --> 00:49:48,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean who would even think to get those people, but as soon as I realized that they were there I'm going to fucking see fucking went and stood in line Seeing that again.

806
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:50,800
Speaker 1: Uh so yeah.

807
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:56,502
Speaker 1: But you know they always decorate the hallways with the theme and they do all sorts of stuff with the theme and all of it Was really good.

808
00:49:56,522 --> 00:50:02,180
Speaker 0: Yeah as usual, so hopefully we'll see you guys to anime Boston 2016 mm-hmm, and I'm hungry.
