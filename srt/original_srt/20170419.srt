1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,764
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, April 19th, 2017.

2
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:10,085
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:14,360
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,729
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,220
Speaker 0: Tonight, your name.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,540
Speaker 0: Pretty much the biggest anime movie ever.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,040
Speaker 1: What's the Japanese title?

8
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:24,200
Speaker 0: Kimi no Noah.

9
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:24,978
Speaker 1: Okay.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,898
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,230
Speaker 0: So a notable feature of my life in this apartment building.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,172
Speaker 0: We've lived here since like 2009.

13
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:36,189
Speaker 0: And the building has a bike room.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,390
Speaker 0: And a couple years ago I think we got a better bike room.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,910
Speaker 1: We've talked about this bike room in the past years.

16
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:44,990
Speaker 0: When we moved in, the building was all like less than a year old.

17
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,289
Speaker 0: It was a brand new building.

18
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:52,449
Speaker 0: And there was a bike that I noticed in the bike room because it was like in the way of a good spot.

19
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,140
Speaker 0: And both tires were flat.

20
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:56,890
Speaker 0: Like completely flat.

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,328
Speaker 0: Like hanging off the rims.

22
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:07,549
Speaker 0: And after like a year of that bike never moving and always being there, one day I moved it and I put my bike in the much better place.

23
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,389
Speaker 0: Literally the next time I went to use my bike, that bike was back in that spot.

24
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:15,750
Speaker 0: But let's fast forward to today.

25
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:23,885
Speaker 0: So the number of years between 2009 and 2017 and whoever owns that bike moved it on the first day.

26
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:26,329
Speaker 0: the new bike room was open into the new bike room.

27
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:27,910
Speaker 0: Because you had to move your bike yourself.

28
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:29,870
Speaker 1: And the tires have never been not flat.

29
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:37,250
Speaker 0: The tires are not only completely flat but now the cabling for the brakes is like loose.

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,190
Speaker 0: And it looks like everything, like stuff is rotted and just broken.

31
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,649
Speaker 0: The bike is literally unusable.

32
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:53,090
Speaker 0: And a couple days ago I moved it off of the peg because it happens to be hung on the peg next to our bikes.

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,030
Speaker 0: And it's always in the way because since the tires are flat it like leans in over our bikes.

34
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:00,310
Speaker 0: So I just took it off because it's not locked up or anything.

35
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,209
Speaker 0: And I put it on the floor.

36
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:06,730
Speaker 0: And I have not yet checked today to see if the person has moved it back.

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,949
Speaker 1: If you haven't checked, then why are you telling the story now?

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,650
Speaker 1: You gotta tell the story after the final checking.

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,920
Speaker 0: No, because I'm never gonna reveal what the answer is.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,268
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good too.

41
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:18,650
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna leave it open forever.

42
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,449
Speaker 1: That's also fine.

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,830
Speaker 0: The moral is, why does this person own a bike?

44
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,628
Speaker 1: It's not really a moral.

45
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,690
Speaker 1: No, the real question here is not like, I can understand.

46
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,590
Speaker 1: Okay, the person has a really shitty bike.

47
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,443
Speaker 1: They're planning to fix it someday.

48
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,189
Speaker 1: They just haven't.

49
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, like if you live in the suburbs, you got busted shit in your garage that you don't throw away.

50
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,470
Speaker 1: Exactly, but that part makes perfect sense.

51
00:02:38,752 --> 00:02:40,070
Speaker 1: It's not crazy.

52
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,750
Speaker 1: But they're moving it so reliably.

53
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,990
Speaker 1: The crazy part is that the person is going in to check on it so frequently.

54
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,518
Speaker 1: They're not using it.

55
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,270
Speaker 1: What the fuck are they doing with it?

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,689
Speaker 1: Why are they going to look at it?

57
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:54,750
Speaker 1: If you have a busted bike in your garage, you're gonna fix one day.

58
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,589
Speaker 1: You basically never, ever, ever look at it.

59
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:59,030
Speaker 0: Or if you see it, you feel ashamed.

60
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,608
Speaker 0: You either hide it or you fix it.

61
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,609
Speaker 0: If it's like right out in the center, someone might be like...

62
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,649
Speaker 1: Maybe they're doing some sort of time lapse thing, where every day they take a photo of it getting more busted.

63
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:16,169
Speaker 0: Or maybe there's an alternate podcast out there where this dude is like, "So I got this shitty bike and I'm just fucking with these people who seem to take a weird interest in

64
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,269
Speaker 0: it.".

65
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,170
Speaker 1: I'm using it to hold a spot in the bike room for when I get a good bike.

66
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,229
Speaker 1: And I check every day to make sure.

67
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,210
Speaker 0: But I haven't gotten that new bike yet because I'm saving up my pennies.

68
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,049
Speaker 0: Bike's on layaway.

69
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:27,750
Speaker 0: That's my story.

70
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,650
Speaker 0: Because I promised I wouldn't tell any fixie stories.

71
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,768
Speaker 0: This bike is not a fixie.

72
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,550
Speaker 0: It's just a heavy-ass steel tube... I don't know, bike?

73
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,337
Speaker 1: Piece of rust?

74
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,330
Speaker 1: Does it even count as a bike?

75
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,735
Speaker 0: There's only rust.

76
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,750
Speaker 0: The only rust on it is on the brake cables.

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,415
Speaker 0: Alright.

78
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:42,110
Speaker 1: Not bad.

79
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,470
Speaker 1: Not the worst I've seen.

80
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:45,590
Speaker 1: Far from the worst I've seen.

81
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,136
Speaker 0: It's been a couple days.

82
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,190
Speaker 0: I really want to see if they have put it back on its pay.

83
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,050
Speaker 1: Why didn't you see on your way into the building?

84
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:52,321
Speaker 0: I gotta go down there.

85
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,150
Speaker 0: I just didn't bother.

86
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,549
Speaker 1: You were just down there on your way up.

87
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,660
Speaker 0: No, it's one floor down.

88
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:56,590
Speaker 0: It's in the basement.

89
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,630
Speaker 0: There's a giant-ass room down there.

90
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,989
Speaker 0: In fact, the room's so big, I'm doing bike maintenance down there now.

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,090
Speaker 0: It's basically like my personal workshop.

92
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,150
Speaker 0: I even hid tools because there's a bunch of tool chests of contractors and things.

93
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,608
Speaker 0: I just got some tools down there.

94
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,312
Speaker 1: Whatever.

95
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:17,390
Speaker 1: So, I don't have any real news action going on, but I want to talk about this anime called Kimono Friends.

96
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,869
Speaker 1: Not Kimono that you wear.

97
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:20,269
Speaker 0: Well, that would be Kimono.

98
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:20,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

99
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:21,801
Speaker 1: This is Kimono.

100
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,010
Speaker 1: K-E-M-O-N-O.

101
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,650
Speaker 1: And this is a show that I heard lots of buzz about on the interwebs.

102
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:30,950
Speaker 1: And I saw a lot of tweets, you know, with pictures from the show.

103
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,559
Speaker 1: And so, I was thinking, "Huh.

104
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,108
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about

105
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:34,329
Speaker 1: this.".

106
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:38,010
Speaker 1: But the internet is giving me that sort of Madoka feel.

107
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,090
Speaker 1: Everyone's talking about a thing that I ignored.

108
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,609
Speaker 1: There must be something up with it.

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,908
Speaker 0: And I remember very clearly because Dragon Maid kind of had like this initial, like everyone's talking about it.

110
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:51,229
Speaker 0: And then everybody shut up about that show.

111
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,910
Speaker 0: And it was nothing but Kimono Friends on Twitter.

112
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,649
Speaker 0: Like, within the span of a couple weeks.

113
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,534
Speaker 1: So, there was a time where I was sitting down with a Crunchyroll, and I'm like, "Huh.

114
00:04:58,897 --> 00:04:59,845
Speaker 1: Let's watch something.

115
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:00,470
Speaker 1: Oh, I know.

116
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,490
Speaker 1: I'll watch that thing that everyone talked about.

117
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,026
Speaker 1: Let's pull up episode

118
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:04,228
Speaker 1: one.".

119
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:07,190
Speaker 1: And I've watched only episode one.

120
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:15,488
Speaker 0: I watched a couple of random, not whole episode, basically I went to later episodes and kind of did the skim through and see if anything's going on.

121
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:19,630
Speaker 1: So, what I had to say about this show is it is not good.

122
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,870
Speaker 1: Why are all you people-- I can sort of see why people are obsessed with it, right?

123
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,129
Speaker 0: Dude, it's got better ratings than like half the anime on Animator's Network.

124
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,410
Speaker 1: I can see in the plot, there's definitely some sort of mystery.

125
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,792
Speaker 1: Like,

126
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:32,077
Speaker 1: "Ooh."

127
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,510
Speaker 1: I'm going to spoil the whole first episode.

128
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,929
Speaker 1: You know, deal with it, right?

129
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,109
Speaker 0: Humans are the unknown animal, the end.

130
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:38,591
Speaker 0: Right.

131
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,770
Speaker 1: There's clearly this Safari Zone, right?

132
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,210
Speaker 1: But the Safari Zone is dilapidated.

133
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:50,350
Speaker 1: It's clearly some sort of post-apocalyptic world where all the animals have become furry animals, right?

134
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,536
Speaker 0: People animals, but-- They're not really furries.

135
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:53,890
Speaker 0: They're more like Nekomimi types.

136
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:01,010
Speaker 1: Whatever, but this actual person, or at least as far as we can tell, actual person, they could have animal parts that are covered up by their clothes.

137
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:08,470
Speaker 0: I feel like if they explore, there already is a show that explores if there's animal parts covered up by their clothes, and that's that Monster Musume show.

138
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:18,130
Speaker 1: But anyway, this actual person who's not an animal person appears in this place with no memories and befriends some animal person.

139
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,249
Speaker 0: The serval girl, I guess.

140
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,945
Speaker 0: And they're all like, "What the fuck are

141
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:21,107
Speaker 0: you?".

142
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:33,430
Speaker 1: And they start exploring and meeting animal friends and learning about the world, and there's also these weird jelly monsters that are something mystical or some connection, obviously, with the post-apocalypse stuff, and there's a mystery there.

143
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,869
Speaker 1: So people are into it because they want to know what the mystery is.

144
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,029
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

145
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,370
Speaker 1: I've seen enough post-apocalyptic shows with terrible secrets of space.

146
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,069
Speaker 0: The thing is, if you want a weird show that has some of those vibes, I can name a lot of better shows.

147
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,829
Speaker 1: Every good anime ever.

148
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,770
Speaker 0: And if you want cute, funny animals, guys, Damaka Dobutsu exists.

149
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,729
Speaker 0: Just watch that over and over again.

150
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,230
Speaker 1: So this show, the animation is not the worst, but it's awful.

151
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,764
Speaker 0: Well, it's not low budget.

152
00:06:58,764 --> 00:07:00,811
Speaker 1: 2 out of 10.

153
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,309
Speaker 0: It is low budget.

154
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,470
Speaker 1: Lowest budget, crap CG, garbajo.

155
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,549
Speaker 0: You might think it looks good in stills.

156
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,169
Speaker 1: The character designs aren't bad, right?

157
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,669
Speaker 1: It's just the animation, the movement and the quality is not good.

158
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,163
Speaker 1: The acting is just...

159
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,610
Speaker 0: The show is slow and repetitive.

160
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,570
Speaker 0: You know what it reminds me of?

161
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:22,730
Speaker 0: Binchotan.

162
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is just some... Remember that?

163
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is just some garbajo anime.

164
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,309
Speaker 1: I don't know why it became a big deal.

165
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,351
Speaker 1: It's not... Like, Monika is like 9 point, almost 10 out of 10.

166
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:39,929
Speaker 1: And this is like 2 or 3 out of 10 at best as a whole show.

167
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,108
Speaker 0: So by following Anna Twitter and kind of really paying attention...

168
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,649
Speaker 1: Is it just an ironic meme?

169
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,368
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

170
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,610
Speaker 0: So, it's interesting because I found this article while I was looking up some info on it.

171
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,690
Speaker 0: Because one, Kimono Friends, the story of how and why it got made is actually kind of weird and interesting.

172
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:08,050
Speaker 0: But the gist of it is, it was like a crass marketing ploy where this really dumb, simple, low budget show was basically a giant ad for this bigger property with a phone game, like a video game.

173
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,030
Speaker 1: Like a hack sign thing?

174
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:09,486
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:16,043
Speaker 0: Quote, "But it wasn't until the series began airing that the project really caught fire.

176
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,788
Speaker 0: The smartphone game was released in March of 2015 and ended its service shortly before the anime series began

177
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:26,230
Speaker 0: airing.".

178
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,130
Speaker 1: So they made an anime to promote a phone game.

179
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,590
Speaker 0: The phone game came and went.

180
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,710
Speaker 1: The phone game came and went, but they kept making the anime anyway.

181
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,230
Speaker 1: The anime was just an ad for the phone game.

182
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,210
Speaker 1: And now the anime is doing well on its own?

183
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:39,812
Speaker 0: Yup.

184
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:40,823
Speaker 0: And this article...

185
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,254
Speaker 1: I did read something.

186
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,208
Speaker 1: This isn't just an American fan thing.

187
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:45,730
Speaker 1: For some reason...

188
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:47,050
Speaker 0: No, this show is going crazy.

189
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,410
Speaker 1: I read something that said there was a pop-up store, a temporary shop, that's selling Kimono Friends merch.

190
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,410
Speaker 1: And everything in the store, except for audio CDs, sold out.

191
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, in two days.

192
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,190
Speaker 1: Because who buys audio CDs, even if they're your favorite thing ever?

193
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,890
Speaker 0: And the merch looks like typical AnimeCon stuff, except it's all Kimono Friends.

194
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:05,490
Speaker 1: Sure.

195
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,458
Speaker 0: And you know, the character designs are cute.

196
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,450
Speaker 0: I can see why people would be into that aspect of it.

197
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:12,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, the show isn't... I didn't give it a zero, right?

198
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,879
Speaker 1: It's not the worst ever, but it's bad.

199
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,010
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna put any more watching time in my life into this.

200
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,782
Speaker 0: I've enjoyed watching other people talk about it.

201
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,530
Speaker 0: I've enjoyed animated gifs from it.

202
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:24,910
Speaker 1: I mean, I enjoy animated gifs from pretty much anything.

203
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:26,034
Speaker 0: Yeah.

204
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:32,870
Speaker 0: So this article on Anime Now, which is where I got that quote from, it goes a little more into the story of how it came to be and what's going on here.

205
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:44,170
Speaker 0: But this article tries to explain why it's so popular in Japan and also among... I don't want to say normal anime fans, because normal American anime fans have no idea what the hell this is.

206
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,330
Speaker 0: This is like, if you go to AnimeCons and you're in anime culture, those are the kinds of people talking about this show.

207
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,790
Speaker 1: If you're an anime person, this show's the biggest deal.

208
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,110
Speaker 1: If you're not an anime person, you're just a person who might watch anime.

209
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,004
Speaker 0: If you're just watching Boruto.

210
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,428
Speaker 1: You don't know what this is.

211
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,561
Speaker 0: You know about Boruto, right?

212
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,349
Speaker 0: Naruto's son?

213
00:09:59,700 --> 00:09:59,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,228
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,626
Speaker 0: I could just put "bort license

216
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:02,948
Speaker 0: plates."

217
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,321
Speaker 0: Bort.

218
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:20,950
Speaker 0: But this article basically, and this is not the only article that has expressed basically the same sentiment, says that the reason it's popular is because it's earnest and simple and it lets you forget about the bad world around you.

219
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:29,370
Speaker 0: It basically gives the case that perverts give for why they watch moe shows, where they want to make it very clear that they are not watching it for perverted reasons.

220
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:37,330
Speaker 0: So, they're saying that because it's just fluff and there's basically nothing going on, that is why it's so popular.

221
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:44,310
Speaker 0: I feel like the only reason it's popular among the Anna Twitter types is because Cat girls?

222
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,530
Speaker 0: All the background clues are that humans are gone, post-apocalyptic.

223
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,710
Speaker 0: You see bombs, Adventure Time type stuff in the background all over the place.

224
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:54,908
Speaker 1: So it has fanboy appeal?

225
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:55,281
Speaker 1: Yeah.

226
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,629
Speaker 1: Bombs, cat girls, cute things.

227
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,389
Speaker 1: Everything fanboys like.

228
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:14,290
Speaker 0: I think the best thing that came out of this show, other than me being able to talk about Dama Kidobatsu again and remind people to watch that, is that someone did a whole bunch of really good illustrations of mashing this up with Galaxy Express 3 9.

229
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,419
Speaker 0: Really?

230
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:14,939
Speaker 1: Yeah.

231
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:15,530
Speaker 1: Okay.

232
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,870
Speaker 0: They're real good because that's Mettalu and that's the kid and it's really good.

233
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,430
Speaker 1: Tetsuro?

234
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:20,828
Speaker 0: Yeah.

235
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:21,910
Speaker 0: That's it.

236
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,169
Speaker 0: That's the best I've gotten out of this.

237
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:31,790
Speaker 0: Maybe you guys could convince me that I gotta go back and watch more of it, but I'm not convinced and I've read every spoiler and I have dug through later episodes.

238
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,850
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm watching your petal, which is not good.

239
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,630
Speaker 1: It's just a thing I'm into, but it's bad.

240
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,470
Speaker 1: It's barely better than Initial D. And I'm not gonna watch Kimono Friends.

241
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,730
Speaker 1: That's how bad Kimono Friends is.

242
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,690
Speaker 0: I would probably finish Dragon Maid before I would watch more Kimono Friends, to be perfectly honest.

243
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,622
Speaker 1: If I had to watch...

244
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:54,727
Speaker 0: But the same people who were really talking up Dragon Maid were the ones who jumped off that ship to this one.

245
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,370
Speaker 1: That's actually a tough call for me, right?

246
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:03,470
Speaker 1: Because on the one hand, I think they're pretty much even in my desire to watch more of them, which is not at all.

247
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,730
Speaker 0: Dragon Maid's funnier and better animated.

248
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:15,230
Speaker 1: That's true, but I do care about the... I mean, as much as I said, there's a stupid mystery, that's what everyone cares about, and I don't care.

249
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,109
Speaker 1: I've seen enough of those.

250
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,530
Speaker 1: It's still a thing, right?

251
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,610
Speaker 1: And that's about equal.

252
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:27,430
Speaker 1: That level is about equal to the level of what's that mystery going on in Dragon Maid with the sword.

253
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:29,490
Speaker 1: It's like they're about equal mysteries.

254
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,328
Speaker 1: I don't care about either one, but if I gotta pick one, it's like, "Oh, they're so

255
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:34,670
Speaker 1: even.".

256
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,010
Speaker 0: Well, think back to Attack on Titan, and even to an extent, the original Fullmetal Alchemist.

257
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,709
Speaker 0: Both those shows, I was really into, and then when they were done, or there wasn't more to watch...

258
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:44,390
Speaker 1: Stop caring.

259
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just didn't care at all.

260
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:50,930
Speaker 0: And Attack on Titan, unlike Fullmetal Alchemist, pretty sure that show ain't going anywhere.

261
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,630
Speaker 1: I went with the manga even further.

262
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:58,829
Speaker 0: I read every spoiler from the manga up until the new anime came out.

263
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:06,110
Speaker 0: Every one of the answers that you get in the show after the anime ends, the first season, not worth it, not good.

264
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,906
Speaker 1: If anyone wants a big stack of Attack on Titan manga, I got it.

265
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:10,549
Speaker 1: You can have it.

266
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:19,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it came back, and I realized that everyone who's talking about it really seems to only care about finding out what the deal is with the crap.

267
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,150
Speaker 1: Just read the spoilers and save time in your life to do something more productive.

268
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:32,690
Speaker 0: I think you're better off not reading the spoilers, because every answer to every question you come up with is way less satisfying than whatever you were going to make up on your own.

269
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,870
Speaker 1: Oh, so just make something up on your own and be productive, and then pretend that that's the real deal.

270
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:40,169
Speaker 0: Pretend the show's just about the potato girl, and that's it.

271
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:49,930
Speaker 0: In other news, we're going to talk about Your Name, which is a fantastic movie, but it's not just us saying it's a fantastic movie.

272
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,048
Speaker 0: If you were not aware, Your Name is...

273
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,170
Speaker 1: Shouldn't we talk about this in the main bit?

274
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,147
Speaker 0: No, so Your Name did crazy, crazy.

275
00:13:59,208 --> 00:13:59,690
Speaker 0: well.

276
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,101
Speaker 1: I was going to talk about that during the main bit.

277
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,450
Speaker 1: You're taking time away from the main bit.

278
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,056
Speaker 0: Alright, then I'll be very short on this.

279
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:08,530
Speaker 0: It's the fourth highest grossing film of all time in Japan.

280
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:10,507
Speaker 0: It's a big deal.

281
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:17,488
Speaker 0: That includes foreign films that screen in Japan, and it is the second highest grossing Japanese film ever.

282
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,630
Speaker 1: As in a film that was made by a Japanese movie studio.

283
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:30,030
Speaker 0: And it is still in theaters, but the news is that it's not just Your Name, so Toho also made Shin Godzilla.

284
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:35,250
Speaker 1: Anytime you see a movie, and at the beginning of the movie, there's that circle.

285
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,638
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that kanji.

286
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:37,790
Speaker 0: It's one big kanji.

287
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,923
Speaker 1: That kanji that says "guaranteed good

288
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,245
Speaker 1: movie."

289
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:45,390
Speaker 1: And apparently "guaranteed good movie" in Japanese is Toho.

290
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,469
Speaker 1: That's how you say that.

291
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,599
Speaker 0: Toho is making crazy money.

292
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:56,070
Speaker 0: They have set record profits due primarily to Your Name and Shin Godzilla.

293
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:59,990
Speaker 0: And they have made record profits every year for I think three years in a row.

294
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,130
Speaker 0: So we talk about all these different things that have saved anime over and over again.

295
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,630
Speaker 0: I feel like Toho/Your Name is what has actually saved anime.

296
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:15,650
Speaker 0: Your Name has transcended the traditional boundaries that anime tends to run up against on the global stage.

297
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,870
Speaker 0: And this movie is getting legit wide traction.

298
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,396
Speaker 1: There's another symbol you may have seen.

299
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:23,390
Speaker 1: It's when there's water splashing on some rocks with this triangle.

300
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:25,458
Speaker 1: That says "almost guaranteed good

301
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:25,780
Speaker 1: movie."

302
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,650
Speaker 1: Not quite as good as the circle.

303
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,957
Speaker 0: Oh, I had a thing of the day.

304
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 0: I keep forgetting to use.

305
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:30,730
Speaker 0: I gotta go find it again.

306
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,010
Speaker 1: Someone went to the rocks?

307
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:32,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, they found the spot.

308
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:33,648
Speaker 1: That's old.

309
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the rocks are mostly the same.

310
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,010
Speaker 0: They're a little worn down, but they found the exact spot.

311
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,110
Speaker 0: And then they confirmed with the studio that that was the spot.

312
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,157
Speaker 1: Yes, we know the spot.

313
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:42,640
Speaker 1: I've seen that.

314
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:43,810
Speaker 1: It's years and years old.

315
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:45,689
Speaker 0: I've never used this as my thing of the day.

316
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,070
Speaker 1: I think we may have actually.

317
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:47,828
Speaker 1: I don't think we did.

318
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,183
Speaker 1: I think we did like 2,000 long times.

319
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,490
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

320
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,670
Speaker 0: So I was thinking about anime cons and anime music videos recently.

321
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:08,669
Speaker 0: And I've noticed that anime, anime music videos, not nearly as popular as they used to be.

322
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,362
Speaker 0: Not the biggest part of the conventions that they used to be.

323
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,930
Speaker 0: And there's a whole thing we could do about that.

324
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:13,667
Speaker 1: You found a good one?

325
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,890
Speaker 0: No, but independently, I've just noticed that there have been a lot of things.

326
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,861
Speaker 0: And there's a lot more of them now than there used to be.

327
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,830
Speaker 0: that are basically AMVs.

328
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:25,195
Speaker 0: But they're not anime.

329
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,090
Speaker 0: It's like that culture has expanded to everything but anime.

330
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,290
Speaker 0: But what I noticed looking through AMVs and then these newer things on YouTube.

331
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:38,683
Speaker 0: Is that AMVs get very few views.

332
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:40,990
Speaker 0: Even very expectedly popular ones.

333
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,510
Speaker 0: But the exact same thing done with like Western cartoons or just movies lately.

334
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:48,850
Speaker 0: Is getting tons and tons and tons and tons of views.

335
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,310
Speaker 0: And I realize I've just been watching a lot of these things without even really thinking about it.

336
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:58,890
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is just this really good AMV swimming pools drank Rick and Morty.

337
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:00,794
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

338
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:05,290
Speaker 0: All the things you used to watch AMVs for apply to this stuff.

339
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,790
Speaker 0: And AMVs are... I think they're going to disappear from the con scene.

340
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,829
Speaker 0: Or at least they're going to become niche and they will be to anime cons.

341
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,182
Speaker 1: They've already become niche.

342
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,010
Speaker 1: That's already happened.

343
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,210
Speaker 0: No, within the anime con scene, because they still put them in the big rooms.

344
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:28,490
Speaker 0: I feel like it won't be too long before they fill the spot that those 12 guys playing Warhammer fill at a mid-sized gaming convention.

345
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,190
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there's this thing I never heard of before until just by luck I came across this.

346
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,077
Speaker 1: So British Pathe.

347
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:40,690
Speaker 1: Or it's spelled P-A-T-H and then the E has one of those accents on it.

348
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:42,145
Speaker 0: What direction is the accent going?

349
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:42,470
Speaker 0: Up or down?

350
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,930
Speaker 1: To the right.

351
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:44,748
Speaker 0: To the right up?

352
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:45,689
Speaker 1: Up to the right.

353
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,579
Speaker 0: Accent to you.

354
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:47,269
Speaker 0: So A.

355
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's weird because that's a French thing, but the first word is the word British.

356
00:17:52,750 --> 00:18:07,193
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's considered to be the finest newsreel archive in the world as a treasure trove of 85,000 films, unrivaled in their historical and cultural significance, spanning from 1896 to 1976.

357
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:09,990
Speaker 1: It's a big treasure trove of newsreels, right?

358
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:19,950
Speaker 1: These people, British Pathe or whatever, they keep this because people who want to use these films pay them for rights.

359
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:21,660
Speaker 1: It's all rights reserved.

360
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,170
Speaker 1: It's not some public thing.

361
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,990
Speaker 1: It's just like they have this huge library of newsreels and if you want to use one, you give them money.

362
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:35,610
Speaker 1: And if you're a teacher or broadcaster or any reason you would need one of those, you give them money and you use it.

363
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,524
Speaker 1: So that's great.

364
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:39,127
Speaker 1: What does that matter?

365
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,890
Speaker 1: Well, I came across by, I don't even know how, their YouTube channel.

366
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,332
Speaker 1: Ooh.

367
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:51,990
Speaker 1: Their YouTube channel is basically a gold mine, a very large gold mine.

368
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,049
Speaker 1: Perhaps it's even a platinum mine, you could say.

369
00:18:54,711 --> 00:19:01,790
Speaker 1: So here is one thing from this platinum mine, one nugget of ore to give you a taste.

370
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,509
Speaker 0: Give me my nugget.

371
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:12,770
Speaker 1: This is video from 1966 at Charlie Chaplin's 77th birthday where they made a cake that looks like him.

372
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:20,204
Speaker 1: And there's mad famous people there, mad famous people, some of which are still children at the party.

373
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:32,150
Speaker 1: And they have, I don't think all their films are on YouTube, but the other stuff they have on YouTube is of this quality.

374
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,029
Speaker 0: That is real high quality right there.

375
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,850
Speaker 0: That's not just chocolate, that's white chocolate.

376
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,710
Speaker 1: You could just stop watching all anime, all whatever it is that you're doing and spend the rest of your time and guess until you run out of their YouTube material.

377
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,790
Speaker 1: A lot of that's going to be better than whatever else is out there.

378
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,590
Speaker 0: I got to turn those into AMVs.

379
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,867
Speaker 1: Go for it.

380
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:55,549
Speaker 1: It's only four minutes long.

381
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:03,410
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is Frank Erbert's Dune and we're going to do it way later because we're still playing Zelda and I'm not going to even start reading that book.

382
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,028
Speaker 1: I haven't even played Zelda in like a week because it's too busy.

383
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,309
Speaker 0: Shit is lit.

384
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,870
Speaker 0: I had the Master Sword for a long time.

385
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:12,470
Speaker 0: Now I'm doing the bird people, the great beast right now.

386
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,289
Speaker 1: I already took care of that.

387
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:22,730
Speaker 0: I went over to do the desert one and then multiple people have warned me that if I go mess with the Yiga Clan, the ninja problem gets way worse.

388
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:23,670
Speaker 1: It's true.

389
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,970
Speaker 1: Once I defeated the Yiga Clan, everywhere else in the world, ninjas just keep appearing randomly all the time.

390
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,790
Speaker 0: So I'm letting them be for now and I'm going to go.

391
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,850
Speaker 0: I got plenty of mighty thistles and I'm going to take care of the other two guardians first.

392
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,549
Speaker 1: I'm sorry because I'm pretty good at killing them now.

393
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,084
Speaker 0: Yeah.

394
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,509
Speaker 0: Well, if you got a long stick, it's real easy to kill those guys.

395
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,379
Speaker 1: It depends.

396
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:45,630
Speaker 1: The arrow ones I can kill with arrows and the fighting ones, you know.

397
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,090
Speaker 0: The fighting ones I just end up poking with a spear and they're gone.

398
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:48,864
Speaker 0: There's nothing they can do.

399
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,209
Speaker 1: You haven't fought the big ones.

400
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,350
Speaker 0: No, I have not fought the big ones.

401
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,515
Speaker 0: But I beat a bunch of big guardians.

402
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:57,650
Speaker 0: so I got all these like gigantic guardian plus plus swords.

403
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, guardian plus plus swords are trash and are really only good against guardians.

404
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,630
Speaker 1: They're not really good against anything else.

405
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,929
Speaker 1: They also break really quickly.

406
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:08,890
Speaker 0: Yep, so two of them have that durable bonus on them.

407
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:09,789
Speaker 1: That barely helps.

408
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,070
Speaker 0: I've been using one for a while.

409
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,870
Speaker 0: It's still going.

410
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,203
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,070
Speaker 1: I'm collecting guardian bits.

412
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,110
Speaker 1: I just need some gears and a pile of money and I'm going to get the ancient armor.

413
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,622
Speaker 0: I have more than 50 gears.

414
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,050
Speaker 1: Which basically makes me invincible.

415
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,590
Speaker 1: But then I think I need like a pile of diamonds to upgrade it to the max level.

416
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,469
Speaker 0: Ugh, diamonds.

417
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,530
Speaker 0: I need way more diamonds.

418
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:37,550
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we are going to be at, well, I'm going to be at because Scott is skipping it, Zenkai Con.

419
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:41,650
Speaker 0: At the end of the month, Saturday, I'll be doing grinding mechanics and game design.

420
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,869
Speaker 0: It's the one you've seen before.

421
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:46,590
Speaker 0: And I'm also doing foreign anime openers.

422
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,630
Speaker 0: The condensed mega version of only the best of.

423
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,570
Speaker 0: And on Sunday, I'm doing flip the table, rage quitting in games, and then I'm coming home.

424
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:05,530
Speaker 0: Otherwise, Kineticon, if you haven't submitted your panels and you want to perform a panel at Kineticon, submit it basically like right now because I'm literally filling in the schedule.

425
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:08,610
Speaker 0: Like, every night I'm putting panels in their spots.

426
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,669
Speaker 0: The longer you wait, the shittier your spot's going to be.

427
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,570
Speaker 0: I pretty much schedule everything myself and I'm just scheduling.

428
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,418
Speaker 0: I'm not waiting for it.

429
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,389
Speaker 0: I wait for no man.

430
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,948
Speaker 1: He waits for women though.

431
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:21,542
Speaker 0: I wait for.

432
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:22,089
Speaker 0: no they.

433
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,057
Speaker 1: No they?

434
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:24,330
Speaker 1: No human?

435
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:25,410
Speaker 0: No human.

436
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,299
Speaker 1: He's waiting for alien.

437
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:33,470
Speaker 0: If a xenomorph submits a panel, they're going in the small room because they have to keep that contained.

438
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,450
Speaker 1: He's waiting for a tiger.

439
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,368
Speaker 0: I give him a panel.

440
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,310
Speaker 1: Waiting for a tiger.

441
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,219
Speaker 1: Rawr.

442
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,550
Speaker 0: Did you see someone, because everyone's freaking out about how hot Sidon is in Zelda, the shark guy.

443
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,629
Speaker 1: They're still freaking out about him?

444
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,449
Speaker 0: So someone drew, I just saw this.

445
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:52,430
Speaker 0: It was the similar art of the cat guy equivalent of that like tiger guy.

446
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:54,749
Speaker 0: It's just a full tiger for a head.

447
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:55,770
Speaker 0: Okay.

448
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,310
Speaker 0: So I saw your name, actually a long time ago, because I just was on a flight.

449
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,330
Speaker 1: It wasn't a long time ago.

450
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,147
Speaker 0: It was months ago.

451
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,610
Speaker 1: It's not a long time.

452
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:04,708
Speaker 0: That's a long time ago.

453
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,188
Speaker 1: And I actually- In the dark ages.

454
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:18,210
Speaker 0: It was good enough to where, when it came to the US in theaters, and Scott and Emily of course wanted to go see it, I was 100% ready to just see it again and to see it in the theater in glorious high res.

455
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:24,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, so Makoto Shinkai, we've talked about him before, but I guess in case someone's new, we'll talk about him again, right?

456
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,109
Speaker 1: He's a guy who I think with his wife made an anime in their basement on their own.

457
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:36,809
Speaker 1: And it was good enough that he got to make more animes, and eventually he made, I guess the breakout anime was Hoshino Koe.

458
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,330
Speaker 0: Voices of a Distant Star.

459
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,769
Speaker 1: Which I think we've done an episode on.

460
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,110
Speaker 0: So let's see, Voices of a Distant Star is about lovers separated by space and time.

461
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:49,029
Speaker 0: Then there's The Place Promised in Early Days, which is about lovers separated by space, time, and possibly dimensions.

462
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,289
Speaker 0: Five Centuries for a Second, which is a short show of three episodes, which is lovers separated- I think it's also a manga.

463
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,989
Speaker 0: Lovers separated by space and time.

464
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:01,310
Speaker 0: Children of Chase lost Miyazaki movies, which is just a knockoff Miyazaki movie.

465
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:01,809
Speaker 1: We couldn't tell.

466
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:02,768
Speaker 1: We saw that.

467
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:04,709
Speaker 1: When we saw that, he was there.

468
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,550
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's Geek Nights episodes about all these things.

469
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:07,805
Speaker 0: Yep.

470
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,810
Speaker 0: We reviewed all these.

471
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,364
Speaker 0: He was there.

472
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,848
Speaker 1: We went to see him.

473
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:18,289
Speaker 1: He talked at a panel, and also after showing us that movie, I really barely remember that movie.

474
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,110
Speaker 1: It was like, "Go to a fantasy world.

475
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:20,970
Speaker 1: Weird shit happens.

476
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,175
Speaker 1: The

477
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:21,508
Speaker 1: end.".

478
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:25,510
Speaker 1: I had no idea what the hell it was, and I don't have no desire to see it again.

479
00:24:25,773 --> 00:24:27,009
Speaker 1: I can't imagine that it's good.

480
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,710
Speaker 1: I'm really curious to see what I said about it at the time.

481
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,436
Speaker 0: It was long.

482
00:24:34,094 --> 00:24:36,990
Speaker 1: I don't know how long it was, but thinking about it, it feels long.

483
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:37,869
Speaker 0: You know what it was?

484
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,830
Speaker 0: It was like a post-apocalyptic Miyazaki movie.

485
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,427
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was, but yeah.

486
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,089
Speaker 1: This is not someone who's only hit home runs, is what I'm trying to say, right?

487
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,169
Speaker 0: But he's pretty much always hit at least an RBI.

488
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,510
Speaker 1: His trademarks are beautiful clouds.

489
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,510
Speaker 1: Even in TV commercials he makes, the same beautiful clouds.

490
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:56,910
Speaker 1: Even in the things he made in his basement, beautiful clouds.

491
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,150
Speaker 0: Beautiful clouds in front of a sky that has a lot of purple and stars.

492
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,190
Speaker 1: Stories about lovers who are separated by space and time, right?

493
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:04,419
Speaker 1: Yep.

494
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:14,390
Speaker 1: Your name comes, and for once, this is someone who had been oddly successful considering he started in his basement, but your name comes, and I'm reading about it.

495
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,430
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Oh, new movie from the guy I know.

496
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:17,110
Speaker 1: That's all right.

497
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:18,346
Speaker 1: I definitely want to see it at some

498
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:18,589
Speaker 1: point.".

499
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,930
Speaker 1: Then you start reading the stories like we talked about before.

500
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,769
Speaker 1: Most grossing movie.

501
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,449
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

502
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:24,830
Speaker 1: It's popular like crazy.

503
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,388
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

504
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,269
Speaker 1: It's the biggest deal.

505
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:26,908
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Really?

506
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:28,610
Speaker 1: Nothing else he made is a big deal.

507
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,346
Speaker 1: Why is this a big

508
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:29,490
Speaker 1: deal?".

509
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,219
Speaker 1: Right?

510
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,070
Speaker 1: How is this different from anything else he made?

511
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,450
Speaker 0: The short answer is we'll talk in depth about it.

512
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:34,949
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

513
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,530
Speaker 0: No spoilers.

514
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,089
Speaker 0: At least not until the end of this, but it's his best work.

515
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:41,109
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

516
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:50,950
Speaker 1: What happened is this guy who has been an expert at clouds and lovers separated by space and time just kept doing what he was doing.

517
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,930
Speaker 1: He made something.

518
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:59,870
Speaker 1: I had beautiful clouds and lovers separated space and time, but he made the best possible version of that better than all the previous possible versions of that.

519
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:09,330
Speaker 0: If you had a checklist of things that will make an anime movie popular, it just checks pretty much everything outside of the robots fighting world.

520
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:16,550
Speaker 1: Regardless of the content of the movie itself, seeing it made me really think about it because I'm always trying to do new stuff.

521
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,842
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Oh, let's do something

522
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:18,206
Speaker 1: different.".

523
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:24,374
Speaker 1: I'm tired of doing the same stuff over and over, but it's like maybe in life, a good way to just live.

524
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:31,870
Speaker 1: a good philosophy on life is to find the thing you're good at and just polish the fuck out of it and do it over and over and over and over again.

525
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:32,380
Speaker 1: I'm like,

526
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,788
Speaker 1: "Huh."

527
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:35,710
Speaker 1: When I think about doing that, it's like that feels bad.

528
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:36,449
Speaker 1: I shouldn't do that.

529
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,250
Speaker 1: I'll keep wanting novelty and variety, but Makoto Shinkai doesn't want novelty and variety.

530
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,604
Speaker 1: He wants to make the best lovers separated by space and time.

531
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,168
Speaker 1: cloud movie there ever was and he made it there.

532
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:48,570
Speaker 1: Good job on you.

533
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,650
Speaker 1: Maybe he'll do even better.

534
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:51,070
Speaker 0: I guess it's always possible.

535
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,862
Speaker 0: My only worry, because this one hits real emotionally hard.

536
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,649
Speaker 0: It's a good movie.

537
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:58,557
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's not material.

538
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:20,290
Speaker 0: So there's a moment, a real emotional low point, shall we say, near the end of the movie, and just when it's about to go a little too far down, because some of his earlier works- Yep, take you a little deeper than probably is necessary for this kind of story.

539
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:21,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hoshino Koe ends sad.

540
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,204
Speaker 1: It's just like, "Sad, the

541
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:23,488
Speaker 1: end."

542
00:27:23,652 --> 00:27:23,886
Speaker 1: Yep.

543
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,327
Speaker 1: Right?

544
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,189
Speaker 0: Oh, and Place Prom is in early days.

545
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,630
Speaker 1: This one has a slightly different curve.

546
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,349
Speaker 0: It's either the happiest sad ending or the saddest happy ending I've ever seen in my life.

547
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,690
Speaker 1: Right, but this one goes down and at the very end, it goes up a little bit.

548
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:51,970
Speaker 0: But just technically, from a storytelling standpoint, from the use of side characters characters and backgrounds and not having extraneous elements, it's a technical, I don't want to say masterpiece, but it is technically perfectly done.

549
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:58,210
Speaker 1: It's not so much, it's not selling crazy tickets at the box office for no reason.

550
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:00,230
Speaker 1: It's not unwarranted, right?

551
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,149
Speaker 1: It's hella good.

552
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:05,004
Speaker 1: Usually when there's an anime movie and we review it, we're like, "This is good.

553
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:18,729
Speaker 1: It's an anime movie though, so you should go see it even if it's not the greatest thing ever because anime movies that aren't just Pokemon, the 20th movie, are rare and worth your 90 minutes pretty much no matter what.

554
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:19,804
Speaker 1: So go see them

555
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:20,129
Speaker 1: all.".

556
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:29,509
Speaker 1: But no, even if you're a person who doesn't give a shit about any animes, you've never seen any animes, this is a movie worth seeing in your life, period.

557
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:31,250
Speaker 1: It is on the higher level.

558
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,610
Speaker 0: It's a movie that you can just get someone who's never heard of anime to watch.

559
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,207
Speaker 0: Get your mom down and be like, "Hey, let's watch this

560
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,429
Speaker 0: movie.".

561
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:43,330
Speaker 1: It is not a masterpiece, all-time, Citizen Kane level movie, right?

562
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,450
Speaker 1: It's not that high, but it's in damn good movie territory.

563
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,850
Speaker 1: Is that every- Matrix level.

564
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,249
Speaker 0: Everything it tries to do is executed basically perfectly- It had a lot of practice.

565
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,909
Speaker 0: In terms of like, all these little things happen, like there's side characters and all these, like the plot is actually pretty expensive.

566
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was much, see, I didn't realize it was going to be so long.

567
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,870
Speaker 1: So during the movie, there was a time where it felt like the movie was going to end just then and I'm like, "No, it's too soon.

568
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,318
Speaker 1: This is way

569
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:12,706
Speaker 1: short.".

570
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,870
Speaker 1: And then, of course, it didn't end even though it sort of like, the way it was shot, there was a fade out or something.

571
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:18,648
Speaker 1: It felt like an end.

572
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:19,750
Speaker 0: It could end it there.

573
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,627
Speaker 0: That would have been a downer.

574
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was like a fade out and a plot point.

575
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,089
Speaker 1: It felt like it could have been an end even though it was way too soon.

576
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:29,236
Speaker 1: But then later on, it happened, it was a similar kind of thing where I'm like, "Oh, is that the

577
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,466
Speaker 1: end?".

578
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,343
Speaker 1: And it wasn't.

579
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:30,958
Speaker 1: Yup.

580
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,690
Speaker 1: And then it happened, I think, one or two more times vaguely, I've only saw it once in the theater.

581
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,310
Speaker 1: That was it, right?

582
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:42,697
Speaker 1: So I vaguely remember it multiple times where that could have been the end and it wasn't until eventually there was an end.

583
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:45,630
Speaker 1: and I'm like, "Oh, that's, yeah, definitely the end.

584
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,418
Speaker 1: That one for

585
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:46,722
Speaker 1: sure.".

586
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:55,070
Speaker 0: But there's little, so all those little side bits, there's a thing that happens, especially in a lot of anime movies, there's movies in general that aren't that good.

587
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,930
Speaker 1: But the point is, it's like two and a half hours long.

588
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:57,788
Speaker 0: It's a lot.

589
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:59,030
Speaker 0: It's 107 minutes actually.

590
00:29:59,071 --> 00:29:59,569
Speaker 0: It's long.

591
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,208
Speaker 0: Full of runtime.

592
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:06,730
Speaker 0: But there's expected scenes that'll be drawn out or you don't care and you see them coming.

593
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:12,710
Speaker 0: And this movie very definitely avoids every one of those scenes where you'd go, "Well, this is the part that I expect.

594
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,423
Speaker 0: I'll just wait for, you know, to get to the good stuff

595
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:14,685
Speaker 0: again.".

596
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:21,310
Speaker 1: But yeah, we went to see Enchin and the Magic Tablet and that had a lot of that action going on, but this did not happen.

597
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:32,509
Speaker 0: Well, like a point where this one could have had that is when the people have to convince other people to do something that might be crazy, a normal movie would like draw that part out.

598
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,330
Speaker 0: This movie skips that and goes right to the bombing.

599
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:37,309
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

600
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,409
Speaker 1: Bombing indeed.

601
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,190
Speaker 0: Though in retrospect, the fact that that kid is like, "Fuck yeah," that easily.

602
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,068
Speaker 1: He just wants to bomb.

603
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,890
Speaker 0: Like I wonder what his life would have been like had the bombing not taken place.

604
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,889
Speaker 0: I feel like something was going to get bombed.

605
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:57,670
Speaker 1: You know, he also wants to sort of get revenge on his dad making him work there and stuff.

606
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,210
Speaker 0: But it does a good job of all, like every character.

607
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:03,390
Speaker 1: So he has a motivation even if the whole thing's a sham.

608
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,947
Speaker 0: But that's it.

609
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:16,569
Speaker 0: Every single character who says words pretty much and has a name has a moderately complex set of motivations and their story is told purely through background and environmental stuff.

610
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:24,670
Speaker 1: There's some side characters like this sort of secondary couple at the school and it's like, normally in another movie, they would be just sort of like decorations basically.

611
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,150
Speaker 1: But no, every character has a meaning and comes in and does something or they're not even a character.

612
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,990
Speaker 0: But those meanings are not just explained like you see often.

613
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,909
Speaker 0: It's not like there's a scene at the end where you'll do this because you're in the broadcast club and they blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

614
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:53,630
Speaker 0: You know she's in the broadcast club because they just show a different character sitting in the broadcast club's room and then later you see that he has a crush on her and you can basically piece together and foreshadow literally every beat of this movie.

615
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,729
Speaker 0: It's so consistent.

616
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,407
Speaker 1: So the story of your name.

617
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:13,710
Speaker 1: So before I saw it, all I thought what it was about was based on the trailers and stuff is there is this high school guy and girl in Japan and when they go to sleep, they dream that the other person and they try to find each other.

618
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,169
Speaker 1: That's not a hundred percent accurate.

619
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:30,930
Speaker 1: What it is about is that these high school guy and girl in Japan go to sleep and they meet in the dream world vaguely, but basically when they wake up, sometimes they switched bodies.

620
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:32,830
Speaker 1: Oh shit, it's a trope.

621
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:39,787
Speaker 0: But the way they show the opposite of what a movie that is about that kind of thing would normally show.

622
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,495
Speaker 0: So they don't like the first.

623
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:48,270
Speaker 0: when this is happening, you basically see the guy like meeting his friends and friends are all like, what the fuck was up with you yesterday?

624
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:55,909
Speaker 0: And the girl meets all her friends and they're like, yeah, that was quite a scene you caused yesterday and you get the story like sort of second hand.

625
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:56,530
Speaker 1: Yup.

626
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,589
Speaker 1: Like they thought they were dreaming and they, but yeah, they do try to find each other.

627
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,850
Speaker 1: like when they're awake, uh, somehow they're communicating with each other.

628
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,150
Speaker 0: Like they try as best they can cause it's like dreams.

629
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,082
Speaker 0: They don't have full memories of what they were up to, but they're like texting each other.

630
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:13,690
Speaker 0: Yup.

631
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:21,650
Speaker 0: Well, they start leaving messages for each other to try to like, like they're basically, they're trying to not mess up each other's lives because they start messing up each other.

632
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,669
Speaker 1: Like if one person messes up the other person's life on, you know, one day, then the other person is just going to get revenge.

633
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:27,070
Speaker 1: Right.

634
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,850
Speaker 1: So they come to some sort of truce or whatever.

635
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:32,289
Speaker 0: And you might think at many points, well, why don't they just do X?

636
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,629
Speaker 0: Why don't they just, they pretty much try to do all the things you think of.

637
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,510
Speaker 1: There's nothing ridiculous where you're like, Oh, do this.

638
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,323
Speaker 1: It's like, no, it's, it's, you know, it makes sense.

639
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,649
Speaker 1: at one point, I mean, except for switching bodies, it makes sense.

640
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,229
Speaker 0: At one point, the guy's like, I should actually just try to call her.

641
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,429
Speaker 0: And at one point the girl's like, I should go meet him.

642
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,790
Speaker 1: And it's when they try, it says number disconnected or whatever.

643
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,046
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:58,709
Speaker 0: But the, everything that you think, why don't they do X is explained sufficiently as to why that didn't work.

645
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,268
Speaker 1: You're not going to be sitting in the theater going, why don't they just do this like my mom does.

646
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,029
Speaker 0: And I really, really recommend that you just go see this movie no matter what.

647
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,550
Speaker 0: it's the best anime movie I have seen in a long time.

648
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,110
Speaker 1: It's very unlikely that there will be a better anime movie soon.

649
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,670
Speaker 1: And it's been a long time since there's been an anime movie is good.

650
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:29,069
Speaker 1: You've got to dig into Satoshi, Khan and Jiv, you're someone who listens to, if you're someone who listens to geek nights, how can you at anime day, how could you not see this and do yourself a favor?

651
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:42,349
Speaker 0: If you don't know anything more about the movie, uh, don't go read about like what it's really about because of course a movie like this, it's going to swerve and it does obviously not, it's, it swerves in ways that could not be foreseen.

652
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:42,594
Speaker 1: Yeah.

653
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:50,409
Speaker 0: Kinda like, uh, so, uh, what was the, uh, there's a couple other movies we've seen that do this, but where you think the movie is going to be like, start to finish.

654
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,210
Speaker 0: This is what I expect.

655
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,310
Speaker 1: It doesn't just take and zag.

656
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,368
Speaker 1: It zogs and zugs.

657
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:00,869
Speaker 0: It's just like, whoa, the point where you think the movie would wrap itself up is probably like it gets past that in the first quarter, first, fifth.

658
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:13,550
Speaker 0: And it even does a thing where just when you get into the rhythm of, okay, they're swapping bodies, it passes a lot of time and cuts to a montage, just like a brave story did.

659
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:17,890
Speaker 0: And I feel like both movies did that to very good effects.

660
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:33,530
Speaker 1: Well, also, uh, what's it called the, uh, the one where the guys getting trained by the Wolf and the, uh, what was that movie called a boy and the beast, which is also a movie that had a big ass montage where of training of getting strong, right?

661
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:33,722
Speaker 1: Yep.

662
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:37,230
Speaker 0: Well, that movie also spanned a lot more years than I expected.

663
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,910
Speaker 1: But that point is it had a big ass montage in it.

664
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,350
Speaker 1: That's what I thought of it, but this is way better than that.

665
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:42,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

666
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,250
Speaker 0: This one's more like the brave story one where a typical movie might show better than brace.

667
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:46,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

668
00:35:47,253 --> 00:35:49,070
Speaker 0: But brave story is still, I think, a really good movie.

669
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,950
Speaker 0: I think it's criminally underrated.

670
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,329
Speaker 1: All I remember is the circus part.

671
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,450
Speaker 0: That circus part is the best animated circus scene I've ever seen.

672
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,824
Speaker 0: Okay.

673
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:59,170
Speaker 0: Name a better animated circus scene.

674
00:35:59,270 --> 00:35:59,929
Speaker 1: Atari circus.

675
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:01,070
Speaker 0: Okay.

676
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:08,590
Speaker 0: I mean, sailor moon super S has a bunch of circus stuff, but it's not super well animated.

677
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:18,349
Speaker 0: You don't say, you don't say, but, uh, the montage is one of those moments where the movie basically skips all the crap.

678
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:29,589
Speaker 0: Dumbo has a better anime than a movie would normally deal with in this context to give you all that passage of time and equilibrium and everything to then get to what the movie is actually about.

679
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,690
Speaker 0: And it goes so far beyond the, they just swap bodies and I cannot recommend this movie enough.

680
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,469
Speaker 0: This movie is great.

681
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:37,668
Speaker 1: It's way good.

682
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,123
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:42,025
Speaker 0: So I want to, I want to talk about some of the spoilers and the actual stuff that happened in the movie.

684
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,793
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I don't, we can just tell you what the plot is, is like, okay, so first it was crazy.

685
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:51,910
Speaker 0: when spoilers spoil, we're going to, if you haven't seen the movie, just don't.

686
00:36:51,950 --> 00:37:01,165
Speaker 0: it's crazy when every character died and then came back to life two times and then it turns out that they actually, the world gets destroyed and then animal people called friends take over.

687
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:01,870
Speaker 1: Anyway.

688
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,223
Speaker 1: No.

689
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,670
Speaker 1: So, uh, first off, where they suddenly stopped switching bodies.

690
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

691
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,429
Speaker 0: That, that hit real hard.

692
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,410
Speaker 1: It's just like, wait, what?

693
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:16,749
Speaker 1: And then it's just like, we're just going to continue now living our own lives with no more body switching and let's see what happens to them.

694
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:17,889
Speaker 1: And years pass by.

695
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,590
Speaker 1: It's like, whoa, what?

696
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:19,954
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,710
Speaker 1: And you think like you would just skip that over or like, but it's like, wait, why?

698
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:25,510
Speaker 1: What happened?

699
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,160
Speaker 0: You feel like the movie is going a certain way.

700
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,928
Speaker 0: And then the three big moments, I think the emotional hits that really got me other than the end.

701
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,789
Speaker 0: Cause the end is the Makoto.

702
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,309
Speaker 1: And it's like there, it doesn't even seem to be a reason for it.

703
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:43,669
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, things are sort of moving along and coming to a thing and then it's just like, Oh, we didn't switch again after that.

704
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:50,368
Speaker 0: But just the, those, that scene of like suddenly it's over and you see the comment, you don't really understand what happened.

705
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:57,127
Speaker 0: Was very well designed to manipulate the emotions of the audience, which then there's a long build.

706
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,010
Speaker 0: It turns into almost a mystery story where the guy's like, so what happened?

707
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,989
Speaker 0: Like doing research.

708
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:14,387
Speaker 1: Because it's, you have basically these two people see, they switch the camera between the two people, however they want, you know, and then like at certain points it's like, it's all on the girl all the time and you don't know what the hell's going on with the guy at all.

709
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:19,170
Speaker 1: And sometimes on the guy, you know, and after, you know, they, they stopped switching.

710
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:25,650
Speaker 0: It's like, it's all on the guy a hundred percent, but that moment when he's in the diner and the guy's like, Oh, that's a really good picture of blah.

711
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:30,550
Speaker 0: And then like everyone knows except him, what happened.

712
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:45,188
Speaker 0: And one of my favorite moments is when he wakes up in her body and like, there's still time, like there's still time and he's just crying and holding his breasts and the sister comes in and she's like, Nope, nothing to do with this.

713
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,027
Speaker 0: Fuck this.

714
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:47,509
Speaker 0: It does.

715
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,086
Speaker 1: Yeah.

716
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:55,189
Speaker 1: It's not a comedy, but it does do a good job of not pulling it back for something so serious and so heavy with the material.

717
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:56,028
Speaker 1: Right.

718
00:38:56,832 --> 00:39:05,370
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, and it, you know, even though it's got the supernatural and the spiritual action going on, it does a pretty good job of leaving in, you know, just enough humor.

719
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,810
Speaker 1: This is still a cartoon or anime or whatever.

720
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:08,070
Speaker 1: Right.

721
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:13,646
Speaker 1: You get the humor with the, in, in the, in the restaurant, you know, you get the humor and the school.

722
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,050
Speaker 0: It's a complex movie.

723
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,029
Speaker 0: It's super serious.

724
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,910
Speaker 1: I'm in a girl's body.

725
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,868
Speaker 1: I'm going to touch my boobs.

726
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,550
Speaker 0: It's also super funny.

727
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,269
Speaker 0: Like it's legit funny.

728
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,109
Speaker 1: I learned the funny parts and you reach a point where there's no more funny parts.

729
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:34,009
Speaker 0: But at the, at the lowest point, you get a very tactical, funny part to sort of keep you from just crying out loud in the theater.

730
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:36,670
Speaker 0: I don't know what else we can say.

731
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,650
Speaker 0: I mean, just go see this movie.

732
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,830
Speaker 0: It is really good.

733
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,389
Speaker 0: There's a reason why it's not, it's still in theaters.

734
00:39:42,595 --> 00:39:43,748
Speaker 1: Uh, have we talked enough about it?

735
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:45,467
Speaker 0: Uh, I think so.

736
00:39:46,352 --> 00:39:49,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, it brings it like it's, you know, it gets really crazy.

737
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:56,610
Speaker 1: Like the whole thing with the fucking, you know, that's the first thing you see in this movie is like the, you know, the space, like it was a meteor, asteroid, whatever it is.

738
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,430
Speaker 0: The first thing, literally everything.

739
00:39:58,552 --> 00:39:59,510
Speaker 0: So there's all these.

740
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:06,110
Speaker 1: And as soon as I saw that at the beginning of the movie, as that was the opening scene, I was like, oh, that's just not, that's just not just decoration like this.

741
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,909
Speaker 1: That's something in this movie is about that.

742
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:12,937
Speaker 1: But I remembered it, but I couldn't, I had no fucking clue until eventually they tell you.

743
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,848
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh shit.

744
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:22,288
Speaker 0: So I, because I've seen it twice, so I, so I saw it again, knowing like the full deal so I could watch for stuff.

745
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:33,150
Speaker 0: It is freakishly consistent in details to where you could have figured it out if you were paying attention, little details, like what kinds of cell phones people have.

746
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:33,367
Speaker 1: Right.

747
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:38,669
Speaker 1: Well, when the guy is like, oh, you know, we can go see the meteor shower tonight and everyone's like, what the hell are you talking about?

748
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:38,976
Speaker 1: Yeah.

749
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:44,810
Speaker 1: And it's on the, it's on the girls knew the girls watching the news and in the news is all about this meteor shower or whatever.

750
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,289
Speaker 1: And no one in the dude doesn't in the Tokyo seems to know anything about that.

751
00:40:50,040 --> 00:41:06,369
Speaker 0: And there's, and it's also very much predicated on the idea that the whole movie, the primary mystery of the movie is basically because there is one short scene that actually happens way early in the movie, but you don't actually see it as an audience until near the end.

752
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:12,290
Speaker 0: And it literally like literally, literally ties a bow around the entire plot.

753
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:12,721
Speaker 1: Yep.

754
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:18,909
Speaker 0: I like that trope when movies do it well, where there's like the missing scene and you're seeing all the events around it.

755
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,915
Speaker 0: And then that's how to,

756
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:34,647
Speaker 1: like, she, like, she, like the very beginning of the movie, she wakes up from this dream and you see like a few seconds of what she was dreaming and then late, late, late in the movie that you finally see the whole scene and it's like, oh, that's what that was.

757
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:35,201
Speaker 1: Yep.

758
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,330
Speaker 1: Dun dun dun.

759
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,489
Speaker 0: Why didn't she ask?

760
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,248
Speaker 0: Why didn't he ask?

761
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:40,869
Speaker 1: Oh, everything makes sense now.

762
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:44,789
Speaker 0: But there are zero wasted scenes.

763
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:45,790
Speaker 1: Yeah.

764
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,529
Speaker 1: For something so long, you think there would be like a bunch of bullshit, you know, time killing stuff.

765
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:49,930
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:53,390
Speaker 1: And they're almost like, they get close to it, right?

767
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:59,928
Speaker 1: There's some scenes where like, you know, they're doing, they're like, uh, you know, doing the thing with the weaving or whatever.

768
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,466
Speaker 0: Yeah.

769
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,290
Speaker 0: But then that ends up being a very important part of the later plot.

770
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:24,229
Speaker 1: Obviously, but it's like those scenes are like, they take just as many seconds as they can for those scenes and if they took like one, even one second longer on any of those would have been sort of like, eh, and one second shorter would have been, I guess not the end of the world, but it's like, you know, they, they make it just enough to where it's not a problem.

771
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:38,148
Speaker 1: Unlike, you know, the other, I'm only thinking about, cause I saw it recently, the option and the magic tablet where the guy runs up extra flights of stairs and it just like you could have run up like four less flights, dude, it's like you could have just, you know, zip past that.

772
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,909
Speaker 0: But a lot of like a lot of those scenes, like I keep bringing it back to it, but it's like a perfect example of it.

773
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:50,490
Speaker 0: When the bomb dude, there's that one scene in the beginning where just randomly you see him sitting in a room filled with radio equipment and then it cuts away.

774
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:52,070
Speaker 0: Like he's sitting there for a while and then it cuts away.

775
00:42:52,391 --> 00:43:05,150
Speaker 0: And then later when you realize that he's not in that club, the girls in the club and you figure out this whole side story of who likes who based on literally one scene with no dialogue that lasts maybe six seconds.

776
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:20,310
Speaker 0: And then at the end, of course they're married, so I mean, yeah, but that's actually important at the end because all, a lot of Makoto Shinkai's earlier stuff either left the like lovers separated by space time unresolved or tragically resolved.

777
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:23,410
Speaker 1: This one, he made it less tragic.

778
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:32,169
Speaker 0: He made it very clear that the events of this movie literally happened and if they meet again, they could figure shit out.

779
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:35,850
Speaker 0: Like there is, there is a trail of evidence of stuff.

780
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:48,609
Speaker 0: They made it very real and set that up at the end, which I do appreciate because the place promise in our early days, that end is a little bit brutal to watch despite it being happy.

781
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:48,907
Speaker 0: Sad.

782
00:43:49,517 --> 00:43:50,168
Speaker 1: Only a little bit.

783
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:50,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

784
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,930
Speaker 0: It's happy, sad, sad, happy.

785
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:57,610
Speaker 0: This one's just intense and emotional, but also wraps a bow around everything.

786
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:58,567
Speaker 0: There's no loose ends.
