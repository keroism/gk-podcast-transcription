1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,793
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday October 2nd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:14,980
Speaker 1: We talk about very simply the news.

3
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:17,637
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:23,900
Speaker 1: This past weekend Scott and I had a weekend of the likes that we have not seen in about a year.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,692
Speaker 1: We had a non podcast weekend the kinds of weekends We had every weekend before we started doing geek nights yet.

6
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,077
Speaker 0: There was no podcasting.

7
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,384
Speaker 0: there was no Convention going.

8
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:38,313
Speaker 0: there was no people coming over to our house.

9
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,500
Speaker 0: There was no us going anyone else's house.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,388
Speaker 0: It was just doing our business.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,155
Speaker 1: Yep on Saturday.

12
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:51,119
Speaker 1: We went up the road We played board games all day, and then we consumerized for the rest of the day.

13
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:56,140
Speaker 1: Yep We went to a mall we bought things with credit cards and cash.

14
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:03,000
Speaker 1: We went to a Best Buy and fussed with their sensors making them think that more customers came in than actually did.

15
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:07,833
Speaker 0: I Attempted to buy pants only to find that they are too expensive.

16
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:08,616
Speaker 1: I attempt.

17
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:13,720
Speaker 1: for my frugal nature I attempted and succeeded in buying bionic commando for the GBA.

18
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:18,414
Speaker 0: It came with Strider and Oh, whatever mighty fighter by a mighty final fight.

19
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,260
Speaker 1: It was bionic commando anything else.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,747
Speaker 1: I would have paid the 20 bucks just for that.

21
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:22,209
Speaker 0: Yeah.

22
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be reviewing that shortly Mm-hmm, and then Sunday we went apple picking.

23
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,119
Speaker 0: we got them apples there from the trees.

24
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:35,973
Speaker 1: Yeah apples and cider, you know donuts cider donuts.

25
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:37,637
Speaker 1: Yes pumpkins.

26
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:38,660
Speaker 1: We got some pumpkins.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,680
Speaker 1: I think that my pumpkin because it's so understated as far superior to Scott's bullshit pumpkin.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,944
Speaker 0: Why my pumpkin?

29
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:45,767
Speaker 0: puns your pumpkin.

30
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:48,015
Speaker 0: it's bigger by almost first off.

31
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:58,237
Speaker 1: when we're walking in to get pumpkin Scott's trying to talk tell me that you don't buy the biggest pumpkin you can reasonably fit into your car But in fact that you should get some kind of smaller pumpkin.

32
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:58,860
Speaker 0: That's right.

33
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,470
Speaker 0: Well, what do you need this big giant pumpkin for?

34
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,574
Speaker 0: it's just a waste of space.

35
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:05,886
Speaker 1: now when it comes to pumpkins bigger Clearly is superior.

36
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:06,568
Speaker 0: No, no.

37
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:09,759
Speaker 0: No, I think you're trying to compensate for something with your giant pumpkin.

38
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:12,580
Speaker 0: I'm happy with a moderately sized pumpkin.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,410
Speaker 0: I care more about the symmetry of the pumpkin.

40
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,360
Speaker 0: see but the thing is the niceness of the surface of the pump.

41
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,833
Speaker 1: The pumpkin you got is so pumpkiny.

42
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:22,220
Speaker 1: It's kind of like Cyclops.

43
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 1: Everybody hates Cyclops because he's just too perfect and your pumpkin has that little handle coming off the top.

44
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:31,135
Speaker 1: My pumpkin the way it's situated is much more understated.

45
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:32,260
Speaker 1: It's a sleeper pumpkin.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,086
Speaker 0: yeah, because There's nothing exciting about it.

47
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:37,171
Speaker 0: Just puts everyone to sleep.

48
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,260
Speaker 0: My pumpkins exciting and awesome and cool.

49
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:42,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what happens when the pumpkins actually have some sort of.

50
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,099
Speaker 1: I don't know how I could go with that.

51
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:50,040
Speaker 1: When we carve them and see who carves it better neither one of us has any sort of skill at that whatsoever.

52
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,671
Speaker 0: That's why I'm going to get the internet to help me in this.

53
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:59,999
Speaker 0: what you get a piece of paper and you shine a light Or you just get like a stencil and you trace onto the pumpkin and then you cut out along the lines.

54
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:00,320
Speaker 1: somehow.

55
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:04,220
Speaker 1: I think your original plan of hiring you go to make you a pumpkin was far better.

56
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's also a good plan, but we'll see what happens.

57
00:03:07,941 --> 00:03:10,432
Speaker 0: Either way, I'm a pumpkin will put in you my pumpkin.

58
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:12,060
Speaker 1: I think is going to be a traditional pumpkin.

59
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,877
Speaker 1: It's going to have two triangle eyes and a mouth with some pumpkin seed teeth in it.

60
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:16,640
Speaker 0: It's so lame.

61
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,089
Speaker 0: Oh and Mike my pumpkins totally gonna get a better candle.

62
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:22,120
Speaker 1: what my pumpkin is going to be a bomb.

63
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:29,899
Speaker 1: But Goblin my pumpkin is going to be full of gasoline and star phone.

64
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:30,883
Speaker 0: Okay.

65
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:33,793
Speaker 0: Well, you can have that pumpkin far away from the house.

66
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,532
Speaker 1: I Was trying to think how many more pumpkin jokes I can make.

67
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:38,358
Speaker 1: there really aren't so many?

68
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,383
Speaker 0: no Not really.

69
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:41,969
Speaker 1: I mean we're gonna make some pumpkins.

70
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:42,471
Speaker 1: What do you want?

71
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,197
Speaker 0: Everyone's got to get some pumpkin?

72
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,067
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean, I don't think pendulettes gonna be doing.

73
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:56,860
Speaker 0: they celebrate Halloween and other countries the way do in the US because we have listeners in other countries and They might not, you know be into the whole pumpkin Halloween thing.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,940
Speaker 1: Well, I have a funny short anecdote before we get into the news about just that kind of question.

75
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:10,808
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, you see when we were in high school now I'm not gonna mention any names, but there was a girl in my 10th grade social studies class Oh god, who was also in my 11th grade.

76
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:11,932
Speaker 0: I've heard this story.

77
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,000
Speaker 1: Well, no, you haven't heard this specific one.

78
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,233
Speaker 0: I don't think I've heard stories about this girl.

79
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:16,898
Speaker 1: Yeah this girl.

80
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:30,586
Speaker 1: Well once we're talking about Vietnam and the Vietnam War and we're talking and talking and talking about it, you know US involvement troops there how he had troops there for a while and Then he'd stops talking.

81
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:36,299
Speaker 1: the teacher, you know says blah blah blah troops there and he stops and there's silence You know and he's about to ask a question at the class.

82
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,580
Speaker 1: She raises her head and he's trying to ignore her.

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,180
Speaker 1: He's doing his best to ignore her because she has asked some dingers before.

84
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:51,120
Speaker 1: So she says her name and she looks at him and very earnestly asks, so are those troops still there?

85
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:56,651
Speaker 1: And he said yes her name they are.

86
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,920
Speaker 1: she goes really and he goes no they're not.

87
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:06,040
Speaker 1: So there are all sorts of stories, I mean that is probably the least funny of the stories about this woman.

88
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, not even a woman.

89
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:08,728
Speaker 1: She was a 10th grader along with me.

90
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:15,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, but one day we're talking about the 4th of July Independence Day u.s.

91
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,135
Speaker 1: Breaking off from Britain the first time.

92

Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and She.

93
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:23,192
Speaker 1: she said we start talking about this and she asks very seriously.

94
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:25,880
Speaker 1: How do other countries celebrate their 4th of July?

95
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,898
Speaker 1: And the teacher without a beat say me I forget what he said, but he made some crack about Britain celebrates it.

96
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:38,652
Speaker 1: All right But yeah Yeah.

00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:52,909

Speaker 0: It's going to be wicked awesome because we are going to make it wicked awesome regardless of what goes down.

106
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:19,900
Speaker 1: in fact I think in the future we're gonna do an episode on that about what to do when life gives you shit.

107
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, aka make shit exactly.

108
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:25,480
Speaker 0: but no come to CityCon and Utica, New York.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,665
Speaker 0: If you are within throwing distance this weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday CityCon calm si Ta con.

110
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,554
Speaker 1: we're gonna be plugging it all week.

111
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:35,237
Speaker 1: Try the veal.

112
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:46,679
Speaker 0: Yep Okay news that all right now.

113
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,280
Speaker 1: this is news.

114
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:54,720
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk about it mostly because I Became aware of it through my dealings with this company and it's not widely reported at all.

115
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,480
Speaker 1: In fact, I've seen no mention of this anywhere other than the forums of Libsyn.

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:08,388
Speaker 1: but Libsyn the company we use we contract them to do all of our media file storage for geek nights and Aside from a somewhat rocky start.

117
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,175
Speaker 1: They are an incredibly good company.

118
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're pretty good.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:26,800
Speaker 0: I mean without companies providing this exact service podcasting would largely be the domain of incredibly rich people and It would be much fewer many fewer podcasts with many more ads granted geek nights would probably be going just the same.

120
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:30,907
Speaker 0: yes, it would just cost us more and Have an ad maybe.

121
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,280
Speaker 1: but a lot of podcasts are on Libsyn.

122
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,529
Speaker 1: They're very good service and for the most part.

123
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,380
Speaker 1: I don't have to deal with them at all because there are never problems anymore.

124
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:42,940
Speaker 0: Used to be problems early in the back in the day it kind of sucked but now they're all good.

125
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:44,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they've got great stats.

126
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:45,474
Speaker 1: Everything's great.

127
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:45,756
Speaker 1: Nothing.

128
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:46,440
Speaker 1: No problems at all.

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,163
Speaker 1: We love Libsyn.

130
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:51,880
Speaker 1: Mmm, and we're not plugging them for any reason because we actually pay them for the service.

131
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,294
Speaker 1: It's not like we're getting anything from them that they're not being compensated duly for.

132
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:55,575
Speaker 0: Yes.

133
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:58,366
Speaker 0: This isn't an advertisement This is an honest whatever.

134
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:02,200
Speaker 1: Well, I was on their forums because I was trolling about something.

135
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,546
Speaker 1: I forget exactly why I was there.

136
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,800
Speaker 1: It's not like I go there for support and I got to say Libsyn gets a lot of shit from their customers.

137
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,125
Speaker 0: That's entirely unwarranted Because the customers don't know shit.

138
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:20,453
Speaker 1: most of the customers are problems with Libsyn or people who hate Libsyn are people who just don't know Anything about podcasting at all.

139
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:21,879
Speaker 1: You should see some of this.

140
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:28,695
Speaker 1: But apparently there's a problem where recently this group calling itself perverted justice.

141
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:43,179
Speaker 1: Uh-oh was going around sending emails Angry emails to any Podcaster they could find who they knew was on Libsyn because they didn't feel that Libsyn was addressing their concerns.

142
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:44,291
Speaker 0: Alright.

143
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,140
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna sum up.

144
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,043
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read.

145
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:46,745
Speaker 0: so they were trying.

146
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:54,830
Speaker 0: so Libsyn did something bad to perverted justice and perverted justice tried to get Libsyn Customers to fight Libsyn and join their alliance.

147
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,260
Speaker 1: They're basically trying to bully Libsyn into doing something.

148
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:58,882
Speaker 0: Alright.

149
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:05,640
Speaker 1: now the crux of the matter and I'll state right now that we do not support what is going on here.

150
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,456
Speaker 1: This is very much a I don't agree with you, but I defend to the death.

151
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:10,399
Speaker 1: You're right to say it.

152
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:14,230
Speaker 1: It has to do with child pornography.

153
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:14,974
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

154
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:15,817
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

155
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:19,239
Speaker 1: All right Now apparently I got a funny story.

156
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:21,309
Speaker 0: Is that just remind you something?

157
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:21,872
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

158
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:26,680
Speaker 1: when I say the word child pornography The last thing I want to hear is you say I got a funny start.

159
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,308
Speaker 0: I know cuz this the way you said.

160
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:30,379
Speaker 0: that reminded me of 10th grade.

161
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:41,114
Speaker 0: You ready for this?

162
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,932
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't think I don't know if we're gonna break the law here.

163
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:46,397
Speaker 0: No, no in 10th grade.

164
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,240
Speaker 0: I had this class.

165
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,098
Speaker 0: It was a for, you know for my social studies, whatever requirement.

166
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,191
Speaker 0: Yeah It was like like current events.

167
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,200
Speaker 0: history of you know recent history.

168
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:59,190
Speaker 0: Okay, and the teacher was mad cool.

169
00:09:59,571 --> 00:09:59,852
Speaker 0: Mr.

170
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,434
Speaker 0: D. Felice.

171
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,100
Speaker 0: He was the first libertarian I ever knew.

172
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,094
Speaker 1: Did you and this mad cool teacher have some sort of illicit?

173
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:06,179
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

174
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:23,032
Speaker 0: So on every Friday instead of actually teaching the class We had a current events game where what you had to do is write down Questions at five questions with answers about current events and then you'd make teams and you know He would bring the questions out and you try to answer him and whatever.

175
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:23,293
Speaker 0: Yeah.

176
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever team one got bonus points.

177
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,682
Speaker 0: You know what?

178
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:29,520
Speaker 1: It's funny because I think every 10th grade social studies class had the same thing going.

179
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's one kid and one one week.

180
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,440
Speaker 0: He was just getting all the answers wrong.

181
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,942
Speaker 0: He was just.

182
00:10:36,163 --> 00:10:38,735
Speaker 0: his name was Mark and he was just like, oh you got it wrong.

183
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:39,760
Speaker 0: Oh, I got it wrong.

184
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:40,911
Speaker 0: I got it wrong, right.

185
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:50,000
Speaker 0: and There was a news story that week about a teacher at another at another school in the state of Connecticut Who got fired for having child porn.

186
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,359
Speaker 0: I think it was like a college professor had child porn on the computer and he got fired.

187
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,810
Speaker 0: So they questioned it.

188
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:58,727
Speaker 0: finally markets, you know They come back to him and they're like.

189
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:01,600
Speaker 0: they got this question like, you know, so-and-so was fired.

190
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:05,700
Speaker 0: Why did he get fired and he goes child?

191
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:13,859
Speaker 0: And the way you said child porn like, you know pulling it out of the hat was just like that, all right.

192
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 1: So aside from the child porn story that Scott just told us yeah, there's this podcast called.

193
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,640
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say the name of the podcast cuz I don't want you to actually go check it out.

194
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:33,169
Speaker 0: I don't want to promote them in any way, you know, even though I do have like I don't want to listen to it But I want to know what they say.

195
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,614
Speaker 0: Well, what is there to say?

196
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:38,132
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of people Assess the situation here.

197
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:48,220
Speaker 1: Basically this podcast talks about Changing laws to make sex with younger children legal and changing the age of consent and all this stuff.

198
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:49,685
Speaker 0: So they're not so.

199
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:57,314
Speaker 0: they're not giving you instructions on how to trick kids to get into your van And they're not telling you the URLs of websites of child porn.

200
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:08,940
Speaker 1: Well from what I can gather I mean I have not listened to it either but from what everything I've read and other people who have done research It seems that the podcast talks about some sick things and the podcast is creepy and scary

201
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:09,983
Speaker 0: I imagine it is

202
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:17,179
Speaker 1: but it does not advocate any illegal acts and technically nothing It does is illegal in any way shape or form.

203
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:30,540
Speaker 1: Alright now Libsyn's policy which I did not know regarding the content of podcast is very simply if you're paying them money Unless the podcast you were putting up is actually in violation of United States law.

204
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:36,077
Speaker 1: They will not in any way prevent you from doing business with them and that is as it should be.

205
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:39,829
Speaker 0: being liberated Syndication I mean Libsyn.

206
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:48,197
Speaker 1: they even had a statement to the effect of we don't like this But we're not going to get rid of one of our customers just because you disagree with them.

207
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,989
Speaker 0: Yep I think that's the way it has to be.

208
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,633
Speaker 0: if you're gonna call yourself liberated syndication You can't really have a different policy.

209
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,600
Speaker 0: Can you know?

210
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,426
Speaker 1: Even better the way Libsyn is handling.

211
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:03,298
Speaker 1: This is that they did investigate the podcast to make sure they weren't doing anything illegal.

212
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:09,842
Speaker 0: Wow Wonder how they must have given the guy who had to listen to that podcaster raise Beyond that.

213
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:16,520
Speaker 1: actually apparently what they did is they made the guy who does the podcast transcribe all of his episodes.

214
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,286
Speaker 1: That's so they could read them.

215
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:19,029
Speaker 0: That's fine.

216
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:19,831
Speaker 0: Furthermore.

217
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:29,582
Speaker 1: They told this perverted justice group of Interesting folk that if they have concerns as to the legality of a podcast they should contact the FBI immediately who will work directly with Them.

218
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds good to me.

219
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:45,600
Speaker 1: So I guess I would like to say that this news here which I bring up mostly because I really Have a lot of respect now for Libsyn because they stood up for something that is horrible and despicable But yet it is the people person's right to talk about it.

220
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:54,335
Speaker 0: Yeah That's the only things that really need standing up for are horrible and stupid things because no one needs to stand up for something That's not horrible because no one's gonna try to bring it down.

221
00:13:54,576 --> 00:14:03,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the arguments I would make is that what if there were a podcast about overthrowing the government of the United States or about communism libertarianism or something?

222
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:10,064
Speaker 1: those things are just as anathema to some people as this and This isn't illegal.

223
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:18,560
Speaker 1: And if we want to have a First Amendment, you know the right to speak freely Then we have to accept all of the consequences of having that including speech.

224
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,146
Speaker 1: We don't want to hear speech.

225
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,572
Speaker 1: we find offensive speech.

226
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,757
Speaker 1: We might think is dangerous.

227
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,070
Speaker 0: Yeah And if you don't like it, no one's making you listen to it.

228
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can talk all you want.

229
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,065
Speaker 0: We don't have to listen to you either.

230
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:36,020
Speaker 1: I mean there there are reasonable limitations to speech But the key words are reasonable.

231
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:51,713
Speaker 0: If someone made a podcast where they gave specific instructions on how to make a nuclear weapon and then an or Biological weapon and they told you go make one now and then go set it off here at this time That's not okay.

232
00:14:52,016 --> 00:15:07,540
Speaker 0: Yes But if you're just gonna say please please please please let our horrible perversions Be legal instead of putting us in jail where we should be you can say that all you want But we're still gonna come and put you in jail where you should be.

233
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:11,717
Speaker 1: so I guess I mean Libsyn gets a lot of crap for a lot of things.

234
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:19,989
Speaker 1: but Stand up for Libsyn on this one because I think that they're doing probably the most Ideological thing they can do.

235
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,777
Speaker 1: they're standing up for what they've said.

236
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,002
Speaker 1: they'll do Mm-hmm.

237
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:32,902
Speaker 0: All right, so Jan Lech Johansson Aka DVD Jan DVD on a or DVD John to all of you Barbarians.

238
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,654
Speaker 0: Yes DVD Jan is a famous dude.

239
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:40,839
Speaker 0: when he was 15 years old He cracked CSS which allowed everyone to copy DVDs.

240
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:49,960
Speaker 0: DVD Jan is the basically the reason that you can play DVDs and Linux Basically, yes, the reason that you can rip DVDs to your hard drive is DVD Jan.

241
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,236
Speaker 0: anyway He at one point, you know broke Apple's DRM on.

242
00:15:57,376 --> 00:16:03,579
Speaker 0: you know the iTunes stuff But then they you know, they fought back and Apple was got ahead and now other people are doing that.

243
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:27,776
Speaker 0: However, DVD on stopped being a punk kid and now he's got a company and what he's done is he has reverse engineered The Apple DRM, but he's not putting out a tool like, you know fair use for WM or you know QT fair use that allows you to you know, turn your you know iTunes store purchases into mp3s.

244
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:28,259
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

245
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:38,291
Speaker 0: He is making it so that other companies can distribute Music and songs that are protected with Apple's DRM.

246
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:44,327
Speaker 0: because right now if you want to make a song That has Apple's DRM protection on it.

247
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,940
Speaker 0: The only way you can do it is letting Apple do it for you in the iTunes store.

248
00:16:49,841 --> 00:17:05,915
Speaker 0: Now if he succeeds in doing this without getting sued He will be able to open up or any of his customers will be able to open up a music store on the internet That will put out music that is DRM and will work on iPods.

249
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:15,220
Speaker 0: That is sort of huge Because a lot of the problem is people who want to make a music store need to use some sort of DRM if they want.

250
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,240
Speaker 0: You know licensed music from companies.

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,359
Speaker 0: But the only DRMs they can use are either make your own DRM and then what player is that gonna work on?

252
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,820
Speaker 0: Well, you need a player So you can use Windows DRM which works on all those, you know, whatever players the what are they called?

253
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,544
Speaker 0: Plays for sure players.

254
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much anything.

255
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,260
Speaker 0: that's not an iPod that you can buy in the store is plays for sure.

256
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:41,965
Speaker 0: And then there's the.

257
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:46,240
Speaker 0: the Zune is gonna have a different DRM on it the Zune DRM.

258
00:17:47,221 --> 00:18:01,900
Speaker 0: So, you know if most players out there are iPods which makes it really hard to be a music store That sells DRM stuff because no one has a player for your DRM files.

259
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:06,333
Speaker 0: So this one that you know people can already compete with the iPod.

260
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:14,036
Speaker 0: There's no problem there, but we DVD on succeeds in doing this people be able to compete with the iTunes music store.

261
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:18,231
Speaker 1: now a lot of people might say Oh, but won't it still be illegal to use this stuff?

262
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:20,460
Speaker 1: And the answer is complicated.

263
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:31,460
Speaker 1: But in most countries there there are a lot of laws that there's basically a loophole where if you reverse engineer something It is perfectly legal to recreate the functionality that you figured out on your own.

264
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:40,832
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a really a tough call on the legality of this because real tried to do this before Back in the day and Apple made them stop, you know, basically they said okay.

265
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:41,635
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll stop.

266
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:55,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, but by the same token DVD yawns not in this country right now and If anything a lot of companies especially Chinese companies Well might just start making stuff that supports this and fuck all what Apple cares about.

267
00:18:56,117 --> 00:18:56,920
Speaker 1: Apple can't sue them.

268
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:04,540
Speaker 0: Yeah So be on the lookout for online music stores where you can legally buy music with DRM on it.

269
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,440
Speaker 0: So I wouldn't buy it but that is playable on an iPod.

270
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,146
Speaker 0: That's gonna be in the.

271
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,419
Speaker 0: you know, wonder why it doesn't exist now.

272
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:17,207
Speaker 0: Well DVD on is gonna make it happen and possibly stick it to Apple.

273
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:26,320
Speaker 1: some things of the day.

274
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,693
Speaker 0: Oh, I got a mighty good thing of the day right here.

275
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:29,739
Speaker 0: Oh, do you now?

276
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, well what this is?

277
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,650
Speaker 0: it's a typical bathroom rules joke.

278
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,736
Speaker 0: I mean, this is an old joke.

279
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:41,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a flash Executable going around when I was in high school that did.

280
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,700
Speaker 1: this made the same basic joke.

281
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:47,074
Speaker 0: I had a friend in high school who wrote up a large document.

282
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,980
Speaker 0: That was basically this joke.

283
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:58,816
Speaker 0: but Essentially the joke is it's not it's sort of a truth and a joke and that this is how things go in a men's bathroom For the most part.

284
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:05,620
Speaker 0: yet The biggest the most part of the joke that always seems to stay true is the stall selection or the urinal selection.

285
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:09,540
Speaker 0: You always want to have at least a one urinal buffer between you and other guy.

286
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:12,719
Speaker 0: Go to the ends first and then the middle and you know all that.

287
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, except I pretty much completely ignore that and I just pee somewhere.

288
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:20,224
Speaker 1: Yeah often often between two people see Three categories.

289
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:28,909
Speaker 0: There's you know, there's a minority of guys but still a large number but a minority who Have a problem going to the bathroom.

290
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,120
Speaker 0: Like if they're next to someone they can't go they have a problem.

291
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:33,806
Speaker 0: I'm not one of those people.

292
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,477
Speaker 1: I had that happen once but that was cuz I held it for too long.

293
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:39,045
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah long car ride.

294
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:46,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then there's the kind of guys who you know, they go wherever they don't care they'll stand right next to you and look at your wiener and pee.

295
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,329
Speaker 0: they're scary.

296
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:51,311
Speaker 0: and Then there's the people who are kind of normal, you know They don't.

297
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:56,250
Speaker 0: they won't stand next to someone if they don't have to but they don't really care if they have to you know.

298
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,563
Speaker 0: And if every urinal is filled except for one and they got a pee they pee.

299
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:01,465
Speaker 0: What do they care?

300
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:02,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, that's me.

301
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:13,370
Speaker 1: There was a time our marching band in high school was on the way back from a big competition or something And we all really had to pee like ten school buses full of kids.

302
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:18,090
Speaker 1: So we pull up on this rest stop we all get off and we all run into the bathrooms.

303
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,765
Speaker 1: There were two urinals and one stall for the guys.

304
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:22,930
Speaker 0: Oh, I heard the story.

305
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like a hundred guys, so, you know the lines going.

306
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:32,963
Speaker 1: and finally this kid, I'm not no names here But one of my favorite kids in high school says fuck this.

307
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:34,609
Speaker 1: and he runs in and pees in the sink.

308
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:36,612
Speaker 0: He's the winner.

309
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:42,910
Speaker 1: and then everyone peed in the sink and the guys were done almost 45 minutes before the girls.

310
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,333
Speaker 1: That's all I gotta say.

311
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this video it.

312
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,987
Speaker 0: they made it using the Sims and SimCity.

313
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,679
Speaker 0: It's a little machinima it's pretty good.

314
00:21:52,548 --> 00:22:07,070
Speaker 0: and They made the same joke about you know it's using urinals and how to operate in the bathroom and then they took it a step further and then a step further and It gets pretty funny because you don't expect where it's going even if you've heard the joke before.

315
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:10,329
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of little subtle jokes in it.

316
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:24,444
Speaker 1: Throughout like it talked the narrators like blah blah blah blah Awkward situations in the restroom blah and if you notice the guy sitting in one of the stalls is naked Yeah, and the other guy kind of just notices that.

317
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:36,889
Speaker 0: yep Or the one where it says if you go into a urinal If you go into a stall and you find that the previous guy didn't flush walk out and go to another one gasp thrice.

318
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, there's a VG cats the.

319
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,065
Speaker 1: I'll make that a thing of the day someday.

320
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:46,516
Speaker 0: Well Yeah, all right.

321
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:49,630
Speaker 1: So real quick not much I can say about this other than that.

322
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,170
Speaker 1: I'm disappointed in the propaganda at the top of this page.

323
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:07,146
Speaker 1: I'm linking to my thing of the day because while the works that are presented are wonderful things They are trying to somehow use this as propaganda for Aposto-farianism when we all know that the ramanites hold the true noodly appendage.

324
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,072
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't know.

325
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:17,641
Speaker 1: So these are a bunch of flying spaghetti monster carved Halloween pumpkins Oh my god of varying quality.

326
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,770
Speaker 1: I'll admit most of them are pretty piss poor.

327
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:23,426
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard to carve out a noodly appendage in a pumpkin.

328
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,057
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, the thing is I was kind of hoping to see.

329
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:32,763
Speaker 1: you know people who are really good how they'll scrape out the pumpkin But leave the skin there so they have shading on their things.

330
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:32,843
Speaker 0: Yep.

331
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:33,486
Speaker 0: Yep.

332
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,650
Speaker 0: I know exactly what you're talking about.

333
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,743
Speaker 1: No one made that kind of flying spaghetti monster.

334
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,967
Speaker 0: Ah Maybe someone will.

335
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:53,262
Speaker 0: Because the way that works is you know You take the skin off the pumpkin and then you shave Deeper in parts that you want to have a brighter color and you shave less deep or you want the darker color And the candle shines easily through.

336
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:55,169
Speaker 0: the parts that are shaved a little bit.

337
00:23:55,591 --> 00:24:01,544
Speaker 0: I mean that are shaved a lot and the parts that are only shaved a little bit It's you know, the candle goes through less.

338
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:02,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, one guy kind of did it.

339
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:07,860
Speaker 1: The problem is that it's really it's hard to do that And if you screw up you're done until next.

340
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,516
Speaker 0: pretty much need to make like, you know Sort of like this topographical map.

341
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:22,410
Speaker 0: or like you draw lines and then you know say this one is X deep and this one is X deep times to you know, yeah The problem is in addition to that you also need the manual dexterity the physical skill and the artistic eye.

342
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, we lack all four.

343
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,182
Speaker 0: done done done done done.

344
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:29,736
Speaker 1: Our pumpkins are gonna be so lame Mine's gonna be okay.

345
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:30,641
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

346
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:31,243
Speaker 1: I'll bet money.

347
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:32,208
Speaker 1: Your pumpkin will be lame.

348
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:32,590
Speaker 0: We'll see.

349
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,404
Speaker 0: I'll go gonna go buy some extra tools.

350
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:35,190
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

351
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,067
Speaker 0: You know what?

352
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,896
Speaker 0: Even if a man doesn't know what to do It doesn't have any talent or anything.

353
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,443
Speaker 0: if he has the tools he can do something.

354
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:44,868
Speaker 1: Yeah more damage.

355
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,806
Speaker 0: That's right It's all about tools.

356
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:55,930
Speaker 1: So we were trying to come up with what to talk about today Because Mondays are real easy except when we don't feel like doing any research which is all the time.

357
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:59,010
Speaker 1: No every now and then we've been all set to do a Monday.

358
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,509
Speaker 1: Sometimes yeah, and if we do a tech news roundup just bam bam bam.

359
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem with tech news roundup is that everyone likes them.

360
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:14,710
Speaker 0: people love that as like the best Monday we ever do Yeah, but like every other podcast just does that as their podcast.

361
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:15,774
Speaker 0: So what do we want to?

362
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:28,700
Speaker 1: you know, well not to not to sound full of you know egotistical leanings, but More than one of our listeners which actually means two of our listeners have said Independently of one another that we do twit better than twit.

363
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,064
Speaker 0: You know what this week twit didn't do to it really I didn't notice.

364
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:34,482
Speaker 0: well They kind of did they the they.

365
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:40,087
Speaker 0: they were at the podcast Media Expo and they just kind of talked to a bunch of podcasters stuff.

366
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:41,795
Speaker 0: Uh-huh They didn't they didn't.

367
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,049
Speaker 0: I mean they went over some tech news, but not a whole bunch.

368
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,477
Speaker 0: Not like they usually do.

369
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:52,870
Speaker 1: so we're going over ideas and you know We have about 20 Mondays in the queue, but each one of them requires some sort of build a computer.

370
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:54,365
Speaker 0: I had a computer works.

371
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,813
Speaker 0: part 3.

372
00:25:56,813 --> 00:26:04,190
Speaker 1: We have a lot of shows we've got planned that just require a little bit of research and planning because they're the kind of shows Where we'll actually be more informative than we normally would.

373
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,002
Speaker 0: Yes, send us more Monday show ideas and not the same ones over and over again.

374

Speaker 1: Yeah, we know IT security.

376
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,210
Speaker 1: We're still trying to work out what to cover to make that interesting to those of you who aren't techie.

377
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:18,340
Speaker 1: Well, not being completely useless to people who are techie.

378
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:18,982
Speaker 0: Also.

379
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,330
Speaker 0: There's an existing podcast called security.

380
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,641
Speaker 0: Now you can listen to that and it's a whole podcast.

381
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,370
Speaker 0: all of basically that would you know be the same thing?

382
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,546
Speaker 1: We would do only yeah, if anything we tend to provide overview and humor.

383
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:35,478
Speaker 0: Yes, if anything That's what you hope you provide.

384
00:26:35,538 --> 00:26:39,595
Speaker 0: and rust hurricanes rust hurricanes Taking the wrong podcast.

385
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,343
Speaker 1: You can't hold ten rust hurricane.

386
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:43,050
Speaker 0: You can't hold ten rust hurricanes strong.

387
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,915
Speaker 1: But we were.

388
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:51,615
Speaker 1: I'm sitting in work not doing anything because there was no work for me to do today and I asked I was Like can I do some work?

389
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:52,358
Speaker 1: and there wasn't any.

390
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,670
Speaker 0: I was oh, yeah, I was home all day.

391
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:55,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

392
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:56,658
Speaker 1: My office was empty.

393
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,290
Speaker 1: All the Gentiles were at work and everyone else was at home.

394
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:05,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, in case anyone doesn't know today was a Jew holiday non-sequitur Not really kind of.

395
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:06,899
Speaker 1: it wasn't a non-sequitur at all.

396
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,744
Speaker 1: I just said it was a Jewish holiday.

397
00:27:08,864 --> 00:27:16,850
Speaker 0: And yeah, anyway, I was born Jewish But that was a sequitur Scott, I guess I guess but the problem is just what we started talking about.

398
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,542
Speaker 0: You know tech Monday and now we're talking about Jew day.

399
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:20,848
Speaker 1: I was getting to that.

400
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,133
Speaker 1: All right I was getting to that.

401
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:29,748
Speaker 1: cuz you see I'm sitting at work and I'm messaging Scott ideas for the Monday show and They were all ideas that we didn't feel like doing today.

402
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:39,945
Speaker 1: well tonight and then I thought I'm looking through the news because I also needed a news in the thing of the day and I realized Well, actually I realized it when I saw an old piece of news on dig.

403
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:41,030
Speaker 1: This is what started it all.

404
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:48,186
Speaker 1: I saw this piece of news from like eight years ago and it was on dig like it was brand new and it had a bunch of digs.

405
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,096
Speaker 1: so I'm like what the hell.

406
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,704
Speaker 1: so I comment this is horse shit and old.

407
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:59,410
Speaker 1: and then I buried it and Then I realized that there seems to be this cycle lately of like news will exist.

408
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:20,451
Speaker 1: You know something happens like Scott stabs a guy or or some terrorists attack someone and then there's this flow of how the news gets Disseminated and it seems that it's very different nowadays from the way it was even a few years ago Mmm, so we kind of just want to talk about how we get the news how you probably should get the news and just stuff about The news.

409
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:21,796
Speaker 1: we didn't really plan this out at all.

410
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:26,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is this is totally cuff off of off my cuff.

411
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,414
Speaker 1: I'm not wearing any cuffs.

412
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,145
Speaker 1: Oh, like I'm wearing a tattered button-up shirt.

413
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:31,249
Speaker 0: That's how off it is.

414
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:32,577
Speaker 0: That's how off it is.

415
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,850
Speaker 1: Well, my shorts are tattered - I didn't even realize that.

416
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:40,158
Speaker 0: So when it comes to reading news, I'm gonna try to keep this Technology internet kind of that.

417
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:41,343
Speaker 1: All right.

419
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:46,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about newspapers We're going to talk briefly about radio.

420
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:51,563
Speaker 0: Yeah There are generally different kinds of sources that you get news from.

421
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:53,250
Speaker 0: there's the direct source.

422
00:28:53,792 --> 00:29:00,473
Speaker 0: Some guy comes over to your house and he says I saw this thing going on down the street or you see something happening with Your own eyeballs.

423
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:01,696
Speaker 1: now see that's eyewitness.

424
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:02,739
Speaker 1: and then primary.

425
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:13,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, the two best sources you can get that's pretty much, you know Guaranteed to be true unless the guy who says the primary source is insane Or neti in some way.

426
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:18,590
Speaker 1: then there are secondary sources like CNN, you know, we heard that a guy saw.

427
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:32,347
Speaker 0: Or you know the AP news wire Yeah, which just gives its news directly to CNN who copies that news and perhaps rewrites it Without changing the information course, then they're the tertiary sources aka the people blogging or making shit up.

428
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:34,670
Speaker 1: Yeah Which surprisingly?

429
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:50,909
Speaker 0: I guess not surprisingly is becoming more and more common and people seem to believe that more than CNN's and things for some reason I guess because you know the way it's written and presented feels more honest and genuine than the assumedly conspiratorial news networks.

430
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:57,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, the conspiratorial left-leaning yet right-leaning Vast conspiracy.

431
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:05,330
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I love how the people on the far right in this country accused the media of being left-biased and the people on the far left Accused the media being right bias.

432
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,494
Speaker 0: You know what that tells me.

433
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:11,792
Speaker 0: if people on the far right think it's too far left and the people on the far left thing It's too far, right?

434
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,056
Speaker 0: It's probably in the middle.

435
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:13,618
Speaker 1: No.

436
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,126
Speaker 1: No, it's it's very much leaning toward money.

437
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:25,181
Speaker 1: Ah Fox News doesn't care if a conservative or liberal is in power or a Communist or dictator or whatever.

438
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:26,570
Speaker 1: they care about making money.

439
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:27,916
Speaker 1: So they do things.

440
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,570
Speaker 1: they get people to talk about them and watch Fox News.

441
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:35,345
Speaker 1: Money money money money is the sole driving force of conventional media.

442
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:36,889
Speaker 1: Don't think otherwise ever.

443
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:48,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder what makes you know, because we do know it's pretty Objectively true that Fox News is slightly right-leaning, you know, at least I wonder what it is About being slightly right-leaning.

444
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,370
Speaker 0: that means more profits than being slightly left-leaning.

445
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,690
Speaker 1: Well, I've heard some people say that it's because the Republicans have more money.

446
00:30:56,531 --> 00:31:00,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time most of the Republicans watching news are poor hicks in the woods?

447
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:04,675
Speaker 1: not necessarily no no Yeah, granted.

448
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:07,786
Speaker 1: Uh, no not many tech savvy people watch the news anymore.

449
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:08,870
Speaker 0: That's definitely true.

450
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:16,668
Speaker 1: See we could get into this whole thing about Republicans and Democrats Which wouldn't really be entirely accurate because we are neither Republicans nor Democrats and hate both of them.

451
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:26,377
Speaker 0: That's right anyway, so those are the another kind of place you can get your news from is like slash that which is sort of an Editorial news aggregator.

452
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:38,509
Speaker 0: I think that's really what we're gonna talk about is mostly the news aggregators, which are websites and other places that collect news from around wherever and into one place.

453
00:31:38,710 --> 00:32:04,730
Speaker 0: so instead of having to go around the world to every single news site in the universe to get the interesting tidbits because if you Go to any news site like a site that is providing the news semi-directly like CNN there's maybe five good stories and a hundred crap stories and If you had to go through the effort of picking out the five good stories without reading any crap You're gonna be there for a long time, especially if you're doing it to a whole bunch of news sites.

454
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,108
Speaker 0: I mean you could spend your whole day doing that every single day your life and never finish.

455
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,015
Speaker 1: Now what I mean?

456
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,449
Speaker 1: this idea of slash dot dig bark.

457
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,081
Speaker 1: Some people would say bb spot.

458
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,213
Speaker 0: They're not really not really Reddit.

459
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,346
Speaker 0: yeah, there's a lot of them.

460
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:24,938
Speaker 1: drudge Hey drudge, they're all varying levels of really.

461
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:25,882
Speaker 1: it comes down to.

462
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,232
Speaker 1: there are two factors on any sort of news source especially on the internet.

463
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:42,369
Speaker 1: there is speed of delivery how quickly the news gets there and Accuracy, they're usually in an inverse relationship the faster you get it the less accurate It will be and vice versa.

464
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:47,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you go to if some guy puts the news up as soon as it happens He hasn't.

465
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,770
Speaker 0: there hasn't been a lot of time for him.

466
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:55,326
Speaker 0: No one could have possibly fully verified that story in such a short amount of time.

467
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,753
Speaker 0: I mean He could have.

468
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:58,114
Speaker 0: you know.

469
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:11,494
Speaker 0: only it's like if I hear something happen in the in the room next to me and I go and I put a news story about what I heard and then I go look for a second and I see something and I make a Like.

470
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:15,776
Speaker 1: Scott comes into my room and I'm laying on the ground and there's red on the floor And he assumes I'm dead and runs away.

471
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:18,285
Speaker 1: He comes back with the police and I'm just playing with ketchup.

472
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,515
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly Exactly.

473
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:20,917
Speaker 1: Now.

474
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:22,364
Speaker 1: I mean it can go both ways.

475
00:33:22,425 --> 00:33:29,590
Speaker 1: in terms of the quick sources I mean, I remember when drudge reported that a dirty bomb had gone off in like Baltimore.

476
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:46,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and yet I remember when some guy on the realm told me that princess Diana was dead and no one believed me For like four hours And then she was dead and everyone went nuts and my family to this day couldn't figure out how I got that so quick.

477
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:49,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really you know.

478
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:56,430
Speaker 0: What it comes down to is as a person you have to be able to tell when news is likely true and likely false.

479
00:33:56,654 --> 00:34:01,408
Speaker 0: You know if someone Randomly says, you know princess Diana died.

480
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:11,748
Speaker 0: Well It's probably true because unless they were making jokes about Diana or something How would something so random just this this guy just decided to say that

481
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:18,197
Speaker 1: yeah See a lot of people just have a sense for we're kind of gonna go over more if you don't just have a sense of When to be credulous and when not.

482
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:18,962
Speaker 1: here are all the tips.

483
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:29,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Generally one thing you have to consider when someone tells you a piece of news no matter where you get it from is What would they have to gain by tricking me?

484
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:33,042
Speaker 1: Why would this person want to lie to me about this news?

485
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:34,909
Speaker 1: if you can't think of a reason?

486
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:36,724
Speaker 1: They're probably not lying.

487
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:40,143
Speaker 1: However Fark.com has proven the.

488
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:44,378
Speaker 0: the horrible exception to that There was your example just before.

489
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:48,493
Speaker 0: the dirty bomb was also an exception true, but but Fark.com I mean Drog.

490
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:49,618
Speaker 1: it wasn't that he lied.

491
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,567
Speaker 1: It was just that he got the information wrong.

492
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,380
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think he actually does kind of have.

493
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,710
Speaker 0: a reason is that he will take any news He hears that is as sensational as possible and put it up as fast as possible.

494
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:16,930
Speaker 1: But with Fark someone on Fark one day in the middle of this other thread posted that Damon Wayans was dead dead seriously and Ever people started believing it, you know, why would someone lie randomly out of the blue that Damon Wayans was dead?

495
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,538
Speaker 1: Yep, and it turned into this huge thing.

496
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:19,699
Speaker 1: Now.

497
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,184
Speaker 1: It's an old dead cliche.

498
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,610
Speaker 1: It actually hasn't been on Fark in a while.

499
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:26,690
Speaker 1: I urge all of you Farkers who are also geek nighters to bring that back.

500
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,630
Speaker 1: No someone out there tomorrow posted Damon Wayans is dead.

501
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:34,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to see if I have any sort of power like Stephen Colbert does.

502
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,075
Speaker 1: I probably don't know.

503
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:37,480
Speaker 1: maybe Pete will post it.

504
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,869
Speaker 0: I know he farks maybe you'll probably get one or two.

505
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,110
Speaker 1: The thing is I wouldn't be able to tell if that just wasn't someone anyway.

506
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll have to price a in our forums that they did it and then link to it.

507
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:59,244
Speaker 1: but anyway look at the source and the most important thing you can do aside from looking at the source and trying to figure out if they have a reason to lie to you is Very simply to see if anyone else is reporting on the same news.

508
00:35:59,565 --> 00:35:59,805
Speaker 0: Yes.

509
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:04,604
Speaker 0: Remember there was a news story There's about like the dogs that were zombies or whatever.

510
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:06,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Russians had like frozen.

511
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:20,988
Speaker 0: It was I think it was in an Australian newspaper and the article was only on this one site and it didn't link to anywhere and there was a picture of a Living dog and it was just a bunch of words and there was no other site reporting this.

512
00:36:21,008 --> 00:36:21,750
Speaker 0: there was no nothing.

513
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:27,671
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember that one because they used the word boffin and I'd never heard that word before and I actually had to look It up.

514
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:28,012
Speaker 0: Yep.

515
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,577
Speaker 0: That's exactly the one I'm talking about.

516
00:36:29,597 --> 00:36:38,246
Speaker 1: Yeah now that apparently that specific story has made the rounds before Mm-hmm, and there's a couple stories like that like just today on dig.

517
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:44,182
Speaker 1: There was a story about Water that has been microwaved kills plants, but water that was boiled doesn't.

518
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,730
Speaker 1: therefore microwaves do something bad to water.

519
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:53,670
Speaker 1: Why complete horseshit been totally debunked a million times, but there it was on dig with like a thousand digs.

520
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there are fake news stories that go around.

521
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:13,790
Speaker 1: however in all cases unless it's some sort of vast conspiracy by a government which honestly I don't think any government in this world has the Sheer power to silence that many people to have that big of a conspiracy.

522
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:26,310
Speaker 2: The government look the government the US government does do things with news that are not cool like they make those fake news stories and Then all the news stations take them and put them on the news on the TV news as if they were news stories.

523
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:35,403
Speaker 1: Yeah Or we do psyops in other countries and we've admitted to it in the past and so of other countries where it will put fake News out in order to confuse other countries, but they're not.

524
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:37,290
Speaker 2: if that's the best they can do.

525
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:43,090
Speaker 2: They're not doing mass cover-up conspiracies to make you use microwaves and kill and so you'll die.

526
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:49,808
Speaker 1: So if you if one of these stories comes out if you can't find any other sources, it's probably not true.

527
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 1: now The thing you gotta watch out for here is there were like ten sources for that dog article.

528
00:37:55,711 --> 00:38:05,327
Speaker 1: However, they were all just blogs or things that themselves linked to the original or linked to another thing that linked to another thing and they all came back to the original.

529
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:09,127
Speaker 1: there was no Other independent source and there was no journal writing.

530
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:10,734
Speaker 2: Yep You have to.

531
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,210
Speaker 2: if you have a news story you have to count the independent sources.

532
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,755
Speaker 2: Follow all the links.

533
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:19,727
Speaker 2: if it's someone talking about a story that they found in another website.

534
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,610
Speaker 2: That is not a source.

535
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,189
Speaker 2: It has to be a place.

536
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:29,875
Speaker 2: Someone who got the information from this the place the information comes from and is sharing it with you directly That's what counts.

537
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:37,089
Speaker 2: and if there's only one of them or in fact if there's very few of them and they're all saying the same Thing it's probably not true.

538
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:41,350
Speaker 2: It's probably just about one guy made it up and another guy heard it and hearsay.

539
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,489
Speaker 2: If you see the same story in a whole lot of places, that's when you know, it's true.

540
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:53,659
Speaker 1: Also, if you see a sore likely true if you see a source like Reuters or AP wire It's probably at least been fact-checked.

541
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,070
Speaker 2: Yes as opposed to tossed up on the internet without a care.

542
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,230
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people who report on AP wire stories will just make stuff up beyond that or get wrong.

543
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:08,690
Speaker 1: But the actual AP wire or Reuters story is usually mostly factually correct.

544
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:18,075
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of times we'll go to CNN and you'll see a story or I'm tired of saying CNN Fox News Fox News And you see a story and it says via AP wire, right?

545
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:23,257
Speaker 0: That you will usually be a rewriting of Another story.

546
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:25,530
Speaker 2: that was the original AP wire story.

547
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,650
Speaker 2: You see you can subscribe to the news wire, which is it's a lot of money.

548
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:33,250
Speaker 2: You won't do it in your house, but every news station does it in the country.

549
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,923
Speaker 2: You pay money and his wire comes in, you know back.

550
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:46,350
Speaker 2: you see in all these old movies like a ticker tape that's ticking like And it's just this tape that has the news written on it and just kind of slowly types itself out.

551
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,430
Speaker 2: Well nowadays it's computerized and all that and we're not using that old-ass technology, but it's still a wire.

552
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:53,192
Speaker 2: It's not.

553
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:55,861
Speaker 2: actually it's a set of wires tubes.

554
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,928
Speaker 2: wires in tubes do wires.

555
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:04,770
Speaker 2: Yes, and They just get the stream of news stories coming in as they happen as they're reported by the AP.

556
00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:15,828
Speaker 1: one thing a lot of people don't realize anymore is that most of the news you see from the mainstream media is either an AP wire or Reuters story that they rewrote a little bit to make it look like they're also UPI.

557
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,972
Speaker 1: Yeah UPI.

558
00:40:17,896 --> 00:40:31,470
Speaker 1: or it is a story that looks like some locally produced thing But actually was produced by one of a few companies that they then mail out to all the news Agencies and they play them like ads but they make them look like they were actually from that agency.

559
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:37,130
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's say you're watching your local news, you know your your guy down the road reporting.

560
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:37,772
Speaker 2: You know the.

561
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:40,804
Speaker 2: it's only broadcast in your area of your state news.

562
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:42,270
Speaker 1: Yep a cat was found today.

563
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,270
Speaker 1: It was returned to its owner after a horrible ordeal on the street.

564
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,970
Speaker 2: Here's what's happening at the high school down the road, you know.

565
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:53,630
Speaker 2: And then you'll see like the cooking guy and he gives you like a five-minute cooking tip.

566
00:40:53,971 --> 00:41:06,985
Speaker 2: Alright that cooking guy is on the news and like a 200 other news stations around the country He makes that news bit and then all these other You know local news stations buy that bit and put it in their show to fill up time.

567
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,269
Speaker 2: That's where that comes from.

568
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:16,548
Speaker 1: So where do we rim and Scott the almighty gurus of news gathering get our news many many places?

569
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:22,754
Speaker 1: I Personally mostly for geek nights, but also for everything else I read bark slash dot.

570
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:28,046
Speaker 1: I go to dig occasionally if I really need some news and Google news.

571
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:35,416
Speaker 0: I Fart frequent slash dot Google news Slash I said slash that already good game.

572
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:40,390
Speaker 0: I go to dig but I'm really good at figuring out what's good and what's not on dig.

573
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:47,807
Speaker 0: and Then I go to a whole bunch of blogs, but I don't go to like, you know, I'm some guy.

574
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:48,790
Speaker 0: I have a blog.

575
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:57,009
Speaker 0: I go to engadget or Kotaku which are basically just specialized news aggregator blogs.

576
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:57,369
Speaker 0: you know.

577
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:08,390
Speaker 0: they'll go and find all the video game news and They'll take the interesting ones and they'll post links to the real news on IGN or wherever the real video game news comes from.

578
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:08,792
Speaker 0: Cuz I don't.

579
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:12,170
Speaker 0: IGN is not a pleasant website to go to no good God.

580
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,981
Speaker 0: No, yeah, and then they'll post a funny quip.

581
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,370
Speaker 0: So it is entertaining and also informational.

582
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:19,622
Speaker 1: See I read fart for the same reason.

583
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,044
Speaker 1: I remember.

584
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:26,690
Speaker 1: there's the whole balance between Accuracy speed and all that in terms of knowing what's going on right now.

585
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,322
Speaker 1: You know the breaking news like something happened.

586
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:30,989
Speaker 1: OMG as in.

587
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:34,009
Speaker 1: you know If something important is happening right now that you should know about.

588
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:34,812
Speaker 0: The

589
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:53,010
Speaker 1: fastest way to know about that in my opinion other than sites like drudge, which to me are a little too Jumping the gun a little too inaccurate or you know listening to police scanners all day Is simply to read Fark because whenever there's actual news it is on Fark within minutes.

590
00:42:53,472 --> 00:43:01,948
Speaker 1: Yep, partly because there are Farkers everywhere and they'll post I just saw a building blow up long before the news post that a building blew up.

591
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:07,240
Speaker 0: one thing I got to say though about all these blogs I read is that you have to really read them carefully.

592
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:14,610
Speaker 0: For example, there will be a hot there will be a headline that says We price 250 and then there'll be a question mark.

593
00:43:15,412 --> 00:43:18,161
Speaker 0: That means it might be they don't know.

594
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:22,650
Speaker 0: now a lot of people would see that headline and go Oh we prices 250 because they're dumb.

595
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:28,910
Speaker 1: I'll decode this real simply if you ever see a headline that asks a question that news article is probably bullshit.

596
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:29,594
Speaker 0: Well, it's just.

597
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,183
Speaker 0: it's just someone speculating.

598
00:43:31,223 --> 00:43:32,530
Speaker 0: It's not actually information.

599
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,670
Speaker 0: The problem is a lot of people don't read carefully so they get the wrong information.

600
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:46,841
Speaker 1: well, not only that but most articles like that that ask the question like we $250 Sony going out of business Intel buying AMD.

601
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:49,308
Speaker 1: They're not actually reporting on anything.

602
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:50,130
Speaker 1: It's not even a rumor.

603
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:55,266
Speaker 1: They're just gonna have some op-ed speculation bullshit in order to get some ad revenue.

604
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:59,426
Speaker 1: because it's a topic That's hot right then and people are looking for news on it.

605
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:04,009
Speaker 1: Yep Almost always if you see a headline like that on the internet, that's what it's all about.

606
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:08,807
Speaker 0: So don't even bother reading a story that has a headline with a question mark.

607
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,516
Speaker 0: another thing you have to do That's very important.

608
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:24,210
Speaker 0: when you read a news article Look at what site it's on because when you're using something like slashdot or dig you're reading news stories from different websites all over The world, you know, so if they link to a story on CNN, well, that's pretty reliable.

609
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:31,081
Speaker 0: They link to a story on news max news max, you know Go, you know after you see the story.

610
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:37,530
Speaker 0: if the story doesn't seem too plausible Go to the home page of that news site and see what other stories they have.

611
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:45,190
Speaker 0: It is very likely that you know on the internet you will drive at news sites that are horribly horribly slanted.

612
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,358
Speaker 0: I mean Fox News, whatever.

613
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,530
Speaker 0: there are sites that are outright like Nazi news sites.

614
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:59,969
Speaker 0: They exist and they will say, you know, they'll have news like, you know Jews killed a million people today Yep, or like the Republicans eat babies.

615
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:12,870
Speaker 0: So, you know and sometimes those news kites that are just crazy Will have a news story that is a little bit crazy But you know is hits just the right nerve and ends up on dig or something.

616
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:16,814
Speaker 1: One that went around widely a while ago In fact, it went around twice.

617
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:21,630
Speaker 1: was this story that Bush had said to someone that the Constitution was just a goddamn piece of paper?

618
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:32,581
Speaker 1: Yeah now while Some people many people would like to believe that he said that and he may well have said it there was absolutely no Credible source that he actually said that.

619
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:41,490
Speaker 1: and all of that shitstorm Came back to one site that if you read it carefully was just an op-ed and didn't even claim that he said that.

620
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:42,794
Speaker 1: No, it was just blown.

621
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:44,840
Speaker 0: I was a satirical op-ed.

622
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,770
Speaker 0: But the point is yeah, but it was presented in a way.

623
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:49,296
Speaker 0: It was presented in a way.

624
00:45:49,356 --> 00:45:50,299
Speaker 0: That's why it tricked me.

625
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:51,062
Speaker 0: Yeah.

626
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:53,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bring it up because it tricked Scott.

627
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:53,493
Speaker 1: He did.

628
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:54,218
Speaker 1: he comes to me.

629
00:45:54,238 --> 00:45:54,520
Speaker 1: He's like.

630
00:45:54,923 --> 00:45:57,377
Speaker 1: you see what Bush said I'm like because the

631
00:45:57,538 --> 00:46:11,625
Speaker 0: guy he wrote an op-ed and if you look at it carefully you realize it's it's a satire, but he presented it as a news story and Once you click on the site, you could see oh, this is a mad lefty site.

632
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,070
Speaker 0: They were they just make shit up.

633
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we're not.

634
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:19,229
Speaker 1: don't ever think that we would say that the left is okay And it's only the right who does this stuff.

635
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:27,245
Speaker 0: Everyone this if you go to like, you know If there's a news story that says Bush rapes, baby, and it's on buck Bush calm.

636
00:46:27,707 --> 00:46:28,168
Speaker 0: Guess what?

637
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:28,650
Speaker 0: It's fake.

638
00:46:29,993 --> 00:46:31,268
Speaker 0: It's probably not true.

639
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:37,350
Speaker 1: So hopefully the next time you see something reported somewhere you'll at least be able to tell if it's fake or not.

640
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,022
Speaker 1: Luckily, we haven't had I mean a lot of our listeners.

641
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:47,836
Speaker 1: you send us a lot of email Suggesting things the day in news and we read them and usually we you know save away or something We've already seen a little while ago.

642
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:57,580
Speaker 1: Someone suggested a thing of the day that in fact was a thing of the day four months ago, ah but No one has really sent us bullshit news.

643
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,190
Speaker 1: So maybe our listeners are really all awesome.

644
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:01,693
Speaker 0: Maybe they are.

645
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,942
Speaker 0: maybe they are but I have seen bullshit news post in our forum.

646
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:07,710
Speaker 1: true true, but they haven't sent it to us personally?

647
00:47:07,978 --> 00:47:08,691
Speaker 0: No, no They have.

648
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:09,373
Speaker 1: I give them credit.

649
00:47:09,714 --> 00:47:23,294
Speaker 1: plus places like forums are the best place because even if you're lazy if news you think it's shady Look in the comments of a site like Fark or slash dot or maybe dig but dig users tend to not really Research at all.

650
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:24,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, look for me on dig.

651
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, but go to slash dot and if a store is bullshit There'll be a whole bunch of people saying it's bullshit right away.

652
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,396
Speaker 0: That's another useful thing.

653
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,103
Speaker 0: actually is slash dot and dig.

654
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:35,910
Speaker 0: they have these friends features.

655
00:47:36,092 --> 00:47:51,065
Speaker 0: Now there are other uses of the friends features I'm not going to talk about but if you make someone your friend and you read a story you'll usually see their comments away way up top and that's a really easy way to see what people you know and trust say about the story.

656
00:47:51,206 --> 00:48:06,690
Speaker 0: if they posted a comment and They're definitely, you know, if you're friends with someone and you're not stupid and if you're listening to geek nights I'll assume you're not stupid then you can probably trust that their comment is more accurate than you know.

657
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:14,257
Speaker 1: The the comment the some comment of the masses who I mean this assumes you keep the company of smart people Which I can't imagine why you wouldn't.

658
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:22,058
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean don't always trust your friends say Unless you trust that your friends are smart.

659
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,628
Speaker 1: So the moral don't listen to us.

660
00:48:32,912 --> 00:48:35,058
Speaker 1: And that was geek nights with rim and Scott.
