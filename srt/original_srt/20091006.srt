00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:18,660
Speaker 0: tonight late to the party We talked about Castle Crashers on the Xbox.

5
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:38,420
Speaker 1: So rim when we moved into this apartment here this one in Beacon How many keys were given to us upon least signing?

7
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,250
Speaker 0: well two, but there was only one door that had a key, right?

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,310
Speaker 1: So it was two keys But they were exactly the same key right up, and there are two of us And it's a pretty bits of house right as a back door in the front door.

9
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was a weird like back sliding doors.

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,965
Speaker 0: You couldn't really lock it from the out of the lock on.

11
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:55,910
Speaker 1: it didn't really work at all.

12
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:57,119
Speaker 1: He's a wooden stick the lock.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,683
Speaker 0: that's what you do.

14
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,577
Speaker 0: if you have a sliding door And you don't have a stick you're making a mistake.

15
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:05,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, so regardless right we got one key for where we live now effectively To this day.

16
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,470
Speaker 0: It's still weird to me like I I remember as a kid.

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:16,446
Speaker 0: You know our house had like four different like every house All these different like exterior doors and every night There was the ritual of like check all the doors and this house.

18
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,155
Speaker 0: like I come downstairs I look at the one door.

19
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:22,698
Speaker 0: I see it's locked and I just kind of feel like huh Yeah, only one way out.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,202
Speaker 1: Yep.

21
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:28,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, also You know like even people today who have like a front door and a back door just have one key for both.

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,950
Speaker 1: You know they make sure they get the same compatible locks on all the different doors front door back door.

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,079
Speaker 0: You know it's cool in Detroit.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,906
Speaker 0: all the houses outside doors Door and the head door on the garage also door directly into the basement from the outside.

25
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:43,110
Speaker 0: that's old school.

26
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,663
Speaker 1: That's old school anyway, so I'm moving to this apartment.

27
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:50,666
Speaker 1: You know I didn't actually move in yet I'm gonna move in slow and comfortable like not this big rush of course.

28
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:54,824
Speaker 1: I realized It's still a pain in the ass It's it.

29
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:58,564
Speaker 1: I mean I don't have to deal with that day where you carry a shit ton of furniture cuz base.

Speaker 0: you know We have money and an extra month of rent, it's just so such a luxury yeah, but anyway It's still a pain in the ass.

34
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,124
Speaker 1: I guess look at a bunch of shit to do.

35
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:12,466

00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:13,089
Speaker 1: I got the keys.

37
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:15,298
Speaker 1: Guess how it's.

38
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,910
Speaker 1: this is a small apartment, right?

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:28,008
Speaker 1: it's it's bet it's not even the size of just the upstairs of our current place right and It's just one person in one apartment in this in this building.

40
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,039
Speaker 1: Guess how many keys they gave me.

41
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,910
Speaker 0: I'm gonna guess three open exterior door key.

42
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:38,817
Speaker 0: Interior door key mail trash key.

43
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:47,480
Speaker 1: all right, so I got here one two three four six different keys Three of which I have doubles for for a total of nine keys.

44
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,045
Speaker 1: nine keys nine keys.

45
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:50,750
Speaker 0: so boomerangs take those bastards.

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,109
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, there's actually ten ten keys.

47
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:57,543
Speaker 1: So here the first key is a fanatical devotion to the Pope right.

48
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:01,194
Speaker 1: so the first key is just this little metal stick And that's used for.

49
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,865
Speaker 1: you know if you get the bathroom or the bedroom blocks.

50
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,150
Speaker 1: You know the interior doors.

51
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:06,541
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit.

52
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,770
Speaker 1: You locked yourself out of the bedroom.

53
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,059
Speaker 1: Just poke this into the middle.

54
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,530
Speaker 1: you know those locks that just have the time.

55
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:23,626
Speaker 1: Anything will work in that capacity right even like I usually always use a skewer from the kitchen to open those Usually use a tiny screwdriver, that's the first quote key also good for getting CD roms out that are broken.

56
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 1: the next key is The key to get into the trash room.

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:40,470
Speaker 1: you see on each floor of the building There is a trash room Which is basically the cement room that you put your trash in and the guy told me all about what trash to do and apparently He says take all the trash and throw it down the incinerator whatever it is.

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,290
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's actually an incinerator compactor or whatever is at the bottom, but Willie Walker incinerator right?

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:58,443
Speaker 1: Whatever's at the bottom is is something that takes care of the trash, but Recycling just leave it in the room just on the floor in a bag and also if it's like you know raw food Just leave it on the floor in a bag in that room.

60
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:00,010
Speaker 1: Don't send it down the trap.

61
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:03,119
Speaker 1: So the next key is a key to open that trap.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:13,098
Speaker 1: You know the the incinerator shoot compressor thing Compactor thing the thing is he just says he leaves that thing open But I have the key to open it just in case it gets locked.

63
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:32,865
Speaker 1: then I got two identical keys to open my mailbox Two identical keys to open the front door of the building two identical keys to open my apartment one key to open that trash room and then another key that I think is Probably the key to open the back door of the building, but I have to test that out.

64
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,230
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a laundry room key?

65
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:35,796
Speaker 1: I'm not exactly sure.

66
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:39,150
Speaker 1: I don't remember the laundry room being locked, but regardless is one more key.

67
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,976
Speaker 1: It's the mystery key The mystery key.

68
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:48,790
Speaker 1: cuz I got to say when we there's a lot of freaking keys here I need like I gotta just split them up and put them on separate key chains like I thought to put the trash key.

69
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,430
Speaker 1: I'm like good by Oscar the grouch.

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,797
Speaker 1: You know what you could buy that.

71
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:58,684
Speaker 0: I know that those are the trash keys because when I was at IBM We had all these PCs And you know we didn't want the users like open them up and messing with it.

72
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,595
Speaker 1: one of those lockers that you put all the Keys in.

73
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:03,230
Speaker 0: we had a tiny key locker Actually was a gigantic.

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,804
Speaker 1: I think I'm just gonna get a key hanging bit and hang the keys But make sure to put key chains on them so you know which are which.

75
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,715
Speaker 0: but the mystery key That's a lot like you know.

76
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,449
Speaker 1: when I moved into I'll put a question mark keychain on that one.

77
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,009
Speaker 1: You know maybe a Riddler keychain.

78
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:24,362
Speaker 0: We moved from one part of downtown Detroit to another part of downtown Detroit a little less downtown closer to see just put a gun on all your keychain Gun pointed all the doors.

79
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:33,019
Speaker 0: yeah now But in the basement like one the basement had an uneven floor because I think there was a sub basement that was filled in Mm-hmm, but sub sub basement.

80
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,364
Speaker 0: There was no sub sub basement.

81
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:40,581
Speaker 0: Oh my god I wonder if anyone will even realize what we're talking about now anyway.

84
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:45,399
Speaker 0: They open it, and they're like don't watch out.

85
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,890
Speaker 0: That's acid and you know it's like Chekhov's acid.

00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:10,381
Speaker 1: Yeah And if he tries to open it again throw him in the acid and close it.

99
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,732
Speaker 0: never open it again if the bones keep coming Up.

100
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,081
Speaker 0: well you got bigger problems.

101
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,510
Speaker 0: I know right anyway.

102
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:23,196
Speaker 0: So in the basement of that house that had the scary stuff filled in all the heads and crew that I was always Kind of as a kid.

103
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:26,648
Speaker 0: I always basically assumed that bodies were down there, and that's why it was filled in with cement.

104
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:41,136
Speaker 0: duh Yeah, but there was this light switch coming out of the ground like I don't like you know one of those two like pipes and it just came out of the ground in like a totally unrelated part of the basement and There was just this switch on it and the wires went down.

105
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:42,860
Speaker 0: We could never figure out where it went or what it did.

106
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,098
Speaker 1: Why are you speaking about bodies and cement?

107
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,463
Speaker 1: right you know there's that old story.

108
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:50,770
Speaker 1: the Jimmy Hoffa is in the cement of giant stadium.

109
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, the 50-yard line.

110
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,708
Speaker 0: everyone knows that right.

111
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,056
Speaker 1: well Yeah, they're.

112
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,010
Speaker 1: you know next year the new giant stadium is gonna be done.

113
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,974
Speaker 0: They got to move the body.

114
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,942
Speaker 1: obviously they're gonna take the old one apart.

115
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,770
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll find his body.

116
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:09,514
Speaker 0: You know I would not put the odds that low on them finding a body In there.

117
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,343
Speaker 0: however, I would guess that it is a hobo body.

118
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,510
Speaker 1: hobo body hobo Jimmy Hoffa.

119
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:18,476

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,307
Speaker 1: So I don't know what the next one is but I assume it's one of anything to boot to the head.

149
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,717
Speaker 1: all right He tweets where the truck is.

150
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:03,090
Speaker 1: so this dude never has to worry about the location location location problem.

151
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,244
Speaker 1: He just drives to the good location right and you know he's at every day.

152
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:08,649
Speaker 0: the dumpling truck does the same thing.

153
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,790
Speaker 0: they tweet And the only reason I don't follow them is that I'm nowhere near any of the places they go anymore.

154
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is this is a block away from my office.

158
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,478
Speaker 0: It's like down a wall street or something.

00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,730
Speaker 1: also the dude was an awesome, dude.

160
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,241
Speaker 1: I think his wife was in the truck too.

161
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:25,209
Speaker 1: They were totally awesome.

162
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,736
Speaker 1: Basically they have a cool website.

163
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,443
Speaker 1: you get the menu on a PDF.

164
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:37,247
Speaker 1: their sweets were really sweet And you could tell looking at the truck like I'm really close to inspection how well they've thought this out right.

165
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:43,970
Speaker 1: they got lights On the outside of the truck on the side of the the you know the window so that he can open the truck at night.

166
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:46,685
Speaker 1: He took the truck to like Yankee Stadium during a game.

167
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,253
Speaker 1: You know for big It's not stupid.

168
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:51,741
Speaker 1: he's like a really smart much smarter than the ice-cream men.

169
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:56,637
Speaker 1: right he's this on the outside of the truck There's a camera like you could tell.

170
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,042
Speaker 1: it's a security camera looking.

171
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,755
Speaker 1: so if you try to rob the street sweets He'll get you right.

172
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:06,048
Speaker 1: He's got like this whole thing like pimped out to the max, and there's a website.

173
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:09,233
Speaker 1: the website is Street sweets.

174
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:10,558
Speaker 1: and why calm.

175
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,070
Speaker 1: and it was wasn't like the greatest brownie entire universe.

176
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,571
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

177
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:20,990
Speaker 1: I was dying, but it was a damn good chewy brownie much better than any I could make so well worth.

178
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,085
Speaker 1: What did I pay like 250 for this brownie?

179
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:23,749
Speaker 1: That was kind of big?

180
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,740
Speaker 1: That's not bad not bad at all for getting on the street at street sweets and a stamp Working one thing to the way towards another.

181
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,910
Speaker 0: you know that there's no more beard poppa in Midtown.

182
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,950
Speaker 0: I pretty much I'm stuck with like the melon pie.

183
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:44,627
Speaker 1: Yeah So I said I recommend following the street sweets on Twitter if you're in New York and you'll know where the street sweets truck is And if it's near you you can go and get a street sweet.

184
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,013
Speaker 1: that day I'm really.

185
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,124
Speaker 1: there's another truck that sometimes is near my work the Jamaican duchy.

186
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:49,867
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try that.

187
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:52,014
Speaker 1: It's on my list Jamaican duchy.

188
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:57,950
Speaker 0: oh yeah that somehow all I can think of is elephant castle apparently get some jerk chicken from him.

189
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,629
Speaker 0: Oh, man, oh shit the jerk store called.

190
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,608
Speaker 0: So you know Scott and I usually like Scott will ever tell me what he's what his stupid news is gonna be.

191
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:09,230
Speaker 0: that's right.

192
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,182
Speaker 0: But we usually have to at least make sure we're not doing the same news.

193
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:16,410
Speaker 1: otherwise what the fuck happens in the middle of the Show and you realize I don't have a news.

194
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:28,530
Speaker 0: I will just note that it is that you can always tell when we're both on the same page about some news or Something or just a zeitgeist of geek nights when we both end up picking the same news.

195
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,476
Speaker 0: So we got to talk about epic Mickey right.

196
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:41,209
Speaker 1: so the deal here is that you know it basically leaked out because some magazines Got the exclusive wait wait no no no no lee lee Right some magazines we're gonna come out with this.

197
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:45,806
Speaker 1: But then of course the magazines themselves got on the Internet's before they got to print or whatever.

198
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:50,742
Speaker 1: so everyone knows Warren Specter who I guess is a famous video game guy.

199
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:51,285
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

200
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,250
Speaker 1: I don't know what he made.

201
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:54,541
Speaker 1: I just know he's a famous video game guy.

202
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,889
Speaker 1: his name is on the Internet's all the time.

203
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,670
Speaker 1: He is somehow involved in making a game called epic Mickey.

204
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,038
Speaker 1: I don't even it's a Wii game exclusive.

205
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,630
Speaker 1: and what this game is all about is you can tell from the imagery.

206
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,563
Speaker 1: It looks totally awesome because it's like this.

207
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:14,568
Speaker 1: you know it's Mickey Mouse But like a dark evil castle, and it's got all that sort of Kingdom Hearts only even more.

208
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,042
Speaker 1: badass Cuz there's no Square Enix involvement.

209
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,432
Speaker 1: well thing is it's just dark Disney.

210
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,034
Speaker 0: straight up.

211
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:25,453
Speaker 0: this is the kind of picture where even if you know nothing about it you see this picture and you think Badass.

212
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,890
Speaker 0: I mean Mickey Mouse has the badass posture.

213
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,740
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah But you know what it reminds me of a little bit.

214
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,985
Speaker 0: remember that that Mickey game on the NES Which one were you and many versus you.

215
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,929
Speaker 0: we got a fine me.

216
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:40,103
Speaker 0: And then you like in people try to kidnap or got to go through.

217
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,890
Speaker 0: I forget the exactly what the name of the game was.

218
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,307
Speaker 1: There's quite a few of them I don't remember.

219
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:48,326
Speaker 1: There is one that I remember that it was I liked and the other ones in the one word like.

220
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:52,862
Speaker 0: the first level was kind Of a like Icarus a kid Icarus like dungeon style thing.

221
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:54,789
Speaker 0: and then level two was like a side scroller.

222
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,366
Speaker 0: Level three was a dungeon thing.

223
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,239
Speaker 1: again I don't think I remember one.

224
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,788
Speaker 1: level one was kid Icarus.

225
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:03,350
Speaker 1: ish But I was never able to beat level one so that game was hard as balls.

226
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,937
Speaker 0: It was great though you fight beat the pirate.

227
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:08,458
Speaker 0: yeah, Minnie Mouse always get kidnapped by these jerks And you have to save her.

228
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,144
Speaker 1: and yeah, okay.

229
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:09,790
Speaker 1: It's a good game.

230
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,096
Speaker 1: I'll have to go try it out again.

231
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,970
Speaker 0: on the Emily - that's what I feel when I look at this picture.

232
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,887
Speaker 0: Cuz that game was great, and it was kind of dark and scary in parts.

233
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,434
Speaker 1: this game It looks real dark and scary.

234
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:20,661
Speaker 1: the thing about this game is - we exclusive game?

235
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:34,263
Speaker 1: because apparently what the game is about is all These like forgotten disgruntled Disney characters who like got no respect You know and no one even knows about really anymore Who's never wrong but always right who'd never dream of starting a fight.

236
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,348
Speaker 0: you don't remember the Donald Duck song?

237
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,978
Speaker 0: no But they're gonna talk with all the.

238
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,747
Speaker 1: I don't think they're talking about Donald Duck one.

239
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,470
Speaker 1: They're talking about.

240
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:44,674
Speaker 1: They're talking about.

241
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,822
Speaker 1: you know Disney characters that no one even knows.

242
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:57,749
Speaker 1: you know that are from the ancient times That probably in like one or two cartoons if that Are coming back to get revenge on Mickey Mouse for you know being so you know the head of Disney or whatever.

243
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:01,682
Speaker 1: so The way you play this game apparently is Mickey.

244
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,430
Speaker 1: you're Mickey Mouse or you're helping Mickey.

245
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,540
Speaker 1: Mickey Mouse is clearly made of ink and has a paintbrush And you're using the paintbrush that we mote to paint on the screen and do stuff.

246
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,130
Speaker 1: now the thing is my prediction for this game.

247
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,055
Speaker 1: I don't know for sure.

248
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:15,281
Speaker 1: I can't pass judgment.

249
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:17,029
Speaker 0: I can sum it up in one word.

250
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:25,654
Speaker 1: Okay right here scribble knots yeah, that's pretty much what I'm seeing is that it's one of those games Where you know on paper?

251
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,839
Speaker 1: It's probably got all this stuff going on, but in reality.

252
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,310
Speaker 1: It's gonna be Cuz they know that's my prediction.

253
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,150
Speaker 1: Gonna pass the judgment before playing it.

254
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,385
Speaker 0: But that's it's the problem And I've had this my whole life where you see like a picture for a game.

255
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:48,169
Speaker 0: or you have the idea like What if you did mother, but and then you have like the twist that makes it awesome And it used to be that no one ever made the game like that.

256
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:49,615
Speaker 0: So you'd always like how.

257
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,622
Speaker 0: what if they just made tie fighter moves versus?

258
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:55,278
Speaker 0: and if you're about to say they made x-wing versus tie Fighter fuck you that didn't exist.

259
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was I have no son.

260
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:03,287
Speaker 0: But then it's like the industry realized that people want the mashup like them.

261
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:06,235
Speaker 0: the unexpected Usually like take something light.

262
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:11,210
Speaker 1: you can sell a video game based on style alone without any substance whatsoever.

263
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:17,397
Speaker 0: If you made a Hello Kitty like I don't know murder game Like some sort of dark.

264
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,743
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be good.

265
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,050
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way Hello Kitty, right?

266
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,657
Speaker 0: I'll make it I'll make a real good idea.

267
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,405
Speaker 0: It's all Sanrio.

268
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,410
Speaker 0: Hello Kitty styling.

269
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:35,350
Speaker 0: Hello Kitty is a 1920s era private eye going after the serial killer bottom are Shit, and it's all like black and white, but it's still Sanrio like right.

270
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:40,950
Speaker 1: It's like if you got people who are experts in say animation or movies or writing, right?

271
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:50,570
Speaker 1: You can do all those things and put them into a video game and make the video game basically Poop, like just a generic platform or even or a point-and-click adventure or something like that.

272
00:15:51,013 --> 00:16:00,510
Speaker 1: And as long as you have all those other things together Or if you have some like novelty trick like scribble knots does you don't actually need any game substance to get big sales.

273
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:04,370
Speaker 1: You can have absolutely no game substance whatsoever and get big sales.

274
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:05,856
Speaker 1: And that's what's happening.

275
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:13,905
Speaker 1: a lot is this is the lesson that these companies have learned is Don't bother trying to actually make the game like a quality awesome game.

276
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,330
Speaker 1: just have the contest itself.

277
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look Kingdom Hearts.

278
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,302
Speaker 1: I mean in all honesty.

279
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:19,969
Speaker 1: It's just a walk around and hit things.

280
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:20,270
Speaker 1: game.

281
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,879
Speaker 1: You know, there's not too much game going on.

282
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,103
Speaker 1: It's generic action.

283
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,190
Speaker 0: Are I the dope-ass Disney train?

284
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,529
Speaker 1: It's an action RPG.

285
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:32,190
Speaker 1: Not too much novelty not too much, you know innovative gameplay.

286
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,370
Speaker 1: Oh, there's something just a Final Fantasy plus Disney aspects, which you know sell it big time.

287
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,634
Speaker 0: There's something to be said.

288
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:39,738
Speaker 0: you could have done like.

289
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:43,851
Speaker 0: you can make an action RPG game like that because and make it good Or different.

290
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:50,250
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, it's still a good action RPG, but it's not like say Mario 64 a world-changing game.

291
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,320
Speaker 0: But I'm saying you could.

292
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,786
Speaker 0: it's not NS What is otherwise a fairly standard game using you know tried-and-true game mechanics.

293
00:16:57,806 --> 00:17:04,329
Speaker 0: don't do anything innovative or special But use the mechanic of because you're playing the character and because you're immersed in the game.

294
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,790
Speaker 0: The story as a whole is more immersive than a movie and all that.

295
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:12,829
Speaker 0: But even gay games that have the good story and the good styling Still just don't pull that off to the point that it's worth it.

296
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,311
Speaker 0: They were still.

297
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,698
Speaker 0: they would have been better off making a movie.

298
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:15,160
Speaker 1: Yep.

299
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,510
Speaker 0: Kingdom Hearts would have been a better movie than a game.

300
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,823
Speaker 0: I'm straight up and I feel this is the same way.

301
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,030
Speaker 0: Why isn't this a movie?

302
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,613
Speaker 0: Why is this that if what?

303
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:27,290
Speaker 0: if you saw this and it was a movie trailer poster as opposed to a shit?

304
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:28,815
Speaker 1: It Mickey Mouse movie.

305
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,943
Speaker 1: It's been how long holy shit.

306
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:31,445
Speaker 1: I would be.

307
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:32,870
Speaker 1: I would like buy it on DVD.

308
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,524
Speaker 0: Oh my god, but imagine if the movie were this.

309
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,300
Speaker 0: it's the same situation As that that x-men poster.

310
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:41,509
Speaker 0: that was not anything but a poster.

311
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,941
Speaker 1: No, that's some guy may just cuz you wanted to.

312
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:45,830
Speaker 0: yes, that needs to be a movie.

313
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,042
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that needs to be fucking every x-men comic.

314
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:51,250
Speaker 0: Yeah my god, but look no, this is just scribble notch.

315
00:17:51,270 --> 00:18:01,588
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the situation where they come up with a concept that they know will sell and they don't have to back it Up, they just have to back it up enough to where the reviews are not bad right away.

316
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,010
Speaker 0: And that's it.

317
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,673
Speaker 0: They make all their money.

318
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:02,974
Speaker 0: They're done.

319
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:05,064
Speaker 1: It's the same thing with the Sonic Unleashed.

320
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:05,607
Speaker 1: Remember that?

321
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,173
Speaker 0: Oh my god Game.

322
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:14,159
Speaker 1: that was half Sonic the Hedgehog in 3d, but it looks like it's awesome like the old Sonics But the other half of the game is like freakin werewolf.

323
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,765
Speaker 1: Who knows what stretchy werewolf?

324
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:16,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, like why?

325
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,910
Speaker 1: It's like the game looked like it was gonna be the shit but in reality No, everyone says it's poop even though I never played it.

326
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,969
Speaker 1: So I don't like the difference between chocolate and shit chocolate and shit.

327
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:33,790
Speaker 0: So I want to talk a little bit about this article about strain gamers and strangers and testosterone.

328
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:41,730
Speaker 0: But very briefly I would like to point out I had no idea This was even an issue and this is kind of a neat glimpse into the world of hardware hacking.

329
00:18:41,830 --> 00:19:01,130
Speaker 0: But the Game Boy Color boot ROM was a mystery to everyone but Nintendo Until very recently apparently no one actually knew what the firmware was on this chip because the IO Like the the IO pins on the outside were not really interlinked with the control pin.

330
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,405
Speaker 0: So once it booted there was really no way to dump it.

331
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:05,490
Speaker 0: It's not like it's software.

332
00:19:05,631 --> 00:19:12,110
Speaker 0: there was no interface for it and Usually in the past what people would do is they do something called decafing where all right.

333
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,117
Speaker 0: Just crack the chip open and look at what's connect to what.

334
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:21,924
Speaker 0: but that didn't help here apparently and there's this cool story of How after ten years they finally dumped it and ten years good god.

335
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:22,847
Speaker 1: I bought a Game Boy Color.

336
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,190
Speaker 1: the day came out I skipped it.

337
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:33,189
Speaker 0: I remember I had the Game Boy and the Game Gear and the Game Gear with the screen was just so much better That I basically said fuck you to every portable thing that came soon.

338
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:37,705
Speaker 1: I basically I didn't have a Game Boy because everyone else had one and I just played theirs.

339
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:41,250
Speaker 1: and then my brother had a Game Boy Pocket and then I had a job.

340
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,130
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, and I had a job and the Game Boy Color came out.

341
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:51,309
Speaker 0: So I was like yoink and that was that I got at the Pokemon I looked at the Game Boy Color and then I look back at my Game Gear and I was like what the hell.

342
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:55,270
Speaker 0: and It wasn't until the Game Boy Advance when suddenly that was a revolution.

343
00:19:55,656 --> 00:20:01,810
Speaker 1: Is the Game Boy Color Sort of got skipped over because the Game Boy Advance came too soon and that blew everything away.

344
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:05,050
Speaker 0: The Game Boy Advance was just such a transcendent piece of hardware.

345
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:05,469
Speaker 1: No shit.

346
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:10,112
Speaker 1: But the Game Boy Color had a lot of games for it that are sort of like, you know Lost like.

347
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:19,820
Speaker 1: there was Super Mario Brothers Deluxe, which is pretty much the best portable version of Super Mario Brothers one that exists is it straight up?

348
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:23,090
Speaker 0: and it looks like Mario one is not some rescan or anything.

349
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:34,001
Speaker 1: There was a later release of Super Mario Brothers period for the GBA on one of those expensive $20 cartridges But Mario Brothers Deluxe actually had all this extra shit in it.

350
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:36,430
Speaker 1: It even had like the Lost Worlds, you know.

351
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,749
Speaker 1: so it was like totally a sweet deal compared to the you know, straight up re-release of Mario Brothers for the GBA.

352
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:55,833
Speaker 0: so Aside from the coolness of this one of the ramifications one You can now perfectly Recreate the Game Boy logo and then the cling sound that it makes All right, and -

353
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,760
Speaker 1: couldn't we do that before with regular Game Boy boot ROMs as opposed to Game Boy Color boot ROMs?

354
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:11,008
Speaker 0: It wasn't the exact same one apparently, uh-huh But - now emulation will be perfect because there were some color things that apparently Couldn't be done perfectly because we didn't know what was in.

355
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,710
Speaker 1: yet I suggest if you're interested and you know, well what games are for the Game Boy Color?

356
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:20,445
Speaker 1: Go get Zelda Oracle of Agents and Zelda Oracle of Seasons.

357
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,810
Speaker 0: I forget which one I liked.

358
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,802
Speaker 0: I liked one a lot more than the other.

359
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:30,250
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter get both of them And basically it's actually it's two Zelda games or the Zelda games that have probably been least played by human beings.

360
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:39,715
Speaker 1: You can play one then play the other Then you can take like the passwords from one and put them in the other one and vice versa and it's actually like four Zelda games in one.

361
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,050
Speaker 0: But also if you play it on a Game Boy Advance, there's special stuff.

362
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can play it in a Game Boy Advance.

363
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:47,145
Speaker 0: And you can buy the Game Boy Advance ring.

364
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:47,827
Speaker 0: You know what it does?

365
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:48,510
Speaker 0: Nothing!

366
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,895
Speaker 1: Also Wario 2.

367
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,419
Speaker 1: Wario Land 2.

368
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:53,983
Speaker 1: One of the best platform games ever.

369
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:58,237
Speaker 0: Not only that you want to steal from the Forgotten Masters Just steal from Wario 2.

370
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:59,421
Speaker 1: Tell it totally.

371
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,144
Speaker 0: Bad game.

372
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:01,910
Speaker 0: Actually all the Wario games were great.

373
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,385
Speaker 1: Wario 2 though is clearly the best Wario.

374
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,190
Speaker 0: 3 was pretty good though.

375
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,969
Speaker 1: Y'all 3 was just sort of more 2 but a little bit less.

376
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,558
Speaker 1: Wario Land 2 is just above and beyond.

377
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,930
Speaker 1: All I got to say about Wario 2 is defeat the giant spearmen.

378
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:18,426
Speaker 0: But there's this interesting article linked to from Slashdot.

379
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:19,250
Speaker 0: I'd recommend you read it.

380
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,950
Speaker 0: But the title is gamers are more aggressive to strangers and it's from new scientists.

381
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,694
Speaker 0: But they talk about.

382
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:38,250
Speaker 0: if you study gamers and people who play games One you get a testosterone rush if you beat someone But only if you beat someone who is either anonymous to you or if you know who they are.

383
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,557
Speaker 0: They're not in your like in-group uh-huh, and There's a lot of speculation as to why.

384
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:57,209
Speaker 0: and the one obvious speculation is maybe it's like, you know Within a social group you want to kind of have a united front against the outside world and you'll fight Internally for dominance and control and all these things.

385
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:03,317
Speaker 0: But it's very bad if two lions fight and like they kill each other because then you know They're kind of weakened.

386
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,449
Speaker 0: if a bunch of humans all fight internally It's tough for them to fight the external threats or the humans that are more together.

387
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:13,610
Speaker 0: But at the same time if you're fighting an external thread, you want to bite their neck and rip it out.

388
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,710
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that's sort of you know, whenever there's like, you know throughout history, right?

389
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,882
Speaker 1: You try to make war with someone you have to label the other guys as the other.

390
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:26,329
Speaker 1: if you fail to make sure this bad Guys are other then, you know people feel bad killing them.

391
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:27,214
Speaker 1: They don't wanna.

392
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:32,530
Speaker 0: but there's a lot of interesting research not just here But about this sort of related thing.

393
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:43,319
Speaker 0: Like I read an article and we talked about a lot of work actually a couple years ago about how there was a pretty strong link between testosterone levels in the blood and Good performance among stock traders.

394
00:23:43,781 --> 00:24:01,219
Speaker 0: Mmm, and the only Argument like the only link that people could really actually make was that to increase Testosterone tends to cause increased risk-taking behavior and by and large people who have high risk-taking behavior Tend to succeed more often than people who don't.

395
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,070
Speaker 0: however when they fail they fail awesomely.

396
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,330
Speaker 0: Mmm, it's just a really neat article.

397
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:10,430
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about it much more because I have to keep this in mind.

398
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:18,270
Speaker 1: Like if I'm playing a game against a stranger like can say a tournament or something I have to keep in mind to like, you know, like keep them a stranger and be vicious.

399
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,374
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's like.

400
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:23,830
Speaker 1: should I have to evaluate like do I make riskier moves in the games or not?

401
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,009
Speaker 1: You know, I got to make sure I make the right move to win.

402
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:39,710
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna use it more along the lines of when I'm playing against strangers I will expect high risk-taking and I will expect vicious behavior from them and I will play the Conservative play the conservative counter-attack game where you hold back and then you strike.

403
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:43,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking also to when I play against friends.

404
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:58,903
Speaker 0: I have to very pointedly increase the aggression in games Because even you know fighting games like Soul Calibur I don't usually give it my all when we're all playing Soul Calibur and it's not just an excuse like yeah You know, I wasn't really playing a hundred percent, but you really you don't.

405
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,779
Speaker 0: but when you're at like packs And you're playing a game against a stranger.

406
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,169
Speaker 0: You just feel this desire to win.

407
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:11,706
Speaker 1: Huh, you know, but the thing is like I've noticed that you know, depending on the game You know that we play and depending on the situation like

408
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:12,951
Speaker 0: depending on the game We're playing

409
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:18,288
Speaker 1: like something like Mario Tennis like I'm fucking giving it everything, you know, cuz I can't lose it.

410
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,050
Speaker 1: No Mario Tennis.

411
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,401
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like we played Dominion the other day.

412
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:28,333
Speaker 0: It's just like yeah Dominion, you know Maybe it's the lack of direct attacks or Directed attacks.

413
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:29,880
Speaker 1: It's I don't know what it is.

414
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:33,420
Speaker 0: You know, we have to you'd have to study this more and seed You know different game mechanics.

415
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,630
Speaker 0: I don't think they did anything like that.

416
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:40,790
Speaker 0: I mean look at all the different board games where they're direct attacks versus indirect attacks versus no attacks all that sort of thing.

417
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:46,477
Speaker 0: I'll bet that plays a big role because I think when there isn't a direct attack Maybe you don't get the surge until you win the game.

418
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:58,410
Speaker 0: Hmm, but maybe if you play multiple games against strangers you get the surge Mmm, so maybe you let the person win the first round They get the surge and then you take advantage of their increased risk-taking behavior in the second round.

419
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,598
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll be in you know be an interesting way to study this.

420
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:04,713
Speaker 1: if we we can look at two different sports That would really help us out.

421
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:09,368
Speaker 1: You can look at tennis and golf the individual sports and you could compare right.

422
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:14,790
Speaker 1: for example Let's say someone's buddy buddy with say Tiger Woods and he's playing with Tiger Woods.

423
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:25,975
Speaker 1: You know like on a certain day how they perform in their testosterone levels versus say You know two guys who like are complete strangers playing golf in the same You know foursome or whatever.

424
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:30,494
Speaker 1: and the same thing with tennis like aha you're playing tennis against a guy You've never met before.

425
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,810
Speaker 1: or you're playing tennis against a guy, you know, you know, you're at a certain match.

426
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:38,326
Speaker 1: You know and how they how the games go and how the sets go whatever.

427
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:39,190
Speaker 0: also think about this.

428
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:40,875
Speaker 0: I mean this specific study.

429
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:45,230
Speaker 0: there's a surge of testosterone when you win against a stranger.

430
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:51,937
Speaker 0: There is a drop when you win against a friend Mmm, so maybe you have.

431
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,046
Speaker 0: you have to take into account the surge of winning specifically.

432
00:26:55,106 --> 00:27:04,170
Speaker 0: so maybe games that have Junctures where there's like a scoring ground in the middle like hacienda or you can win a sub game but lose the overall.

433
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz look at like, you know like golf you can win a hole or in tennis You can win a game or a set, you know And that's sort of like a wins.

434
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:12,610
Speaker 1: you can get your toss toss thrown up during the game.

435
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:21,020
Speaker 1: But in something like I don't know what's a game where like this is a surprise score at the end Maybe it actually Dominion is sort of surprise score.

436
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,444
Speaker 1: Yes, you know who's winning them.

437
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:24,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Tikal has that to a degree.

438
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:33,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like surprise at the end See who's winning right and there's not any chance during the game to know and get your testosterone up before the end.

439
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,210
Speaker 0: You know, all I can think this whole time is I'll preposter own.

440
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:40,476
Speaker 0: It's neat.

441
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:57,690
Speaker 0: but also, you know as an aside I Wonder how this plays into gender stuff too because it's hard to tell how much is actually Physical versus how much is just societal in terms of the clear Differences on average and how girls approach games as opposed to how guys approach games.

442
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's and it's really like.

443
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:09,340
Speaker 0: I don't know how much of it is just cultural versus you know hormonal and I wonder if they See, I don't know if that I didn't read the full study I don't know if they did men and women and all I don't know.

444
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:17,554
Speaker 1: but as games become more and more Important in our society, you know, not that they've all never been in, you know, not been important But now they're even there.

445
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:21,990
Speaker 1: it's like they were crazy important and now they're double crazy important and they're gonna be triple crazy important.

446
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:25,170
Speaker 1: We definitely need a lot more study into these sorts of areas.

447
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,919
Speaker 0: Well, I mean look at the the keynote at PAX that they keep.

448
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:36,510
Speaker 0: one of the big points was that we're really the first generation For whom there was never a point in our lives where video games did not exist in mass.

449
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:40,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my mom was playing Atari When I was in the.

450
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:41,870
Speaker 1: you know, the woo she's playing the breakout.

451
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:45,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean people who were born like a couple years before me.

452
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:51,906
Speaker 1: Okay, there was still Atari But we're the couple years before that there was nothing and not only are we the first generation really.

453
00:28:51,946 --> 00:29:00,089
Speaker 0: where you know gaming has always Existed fully in a relatively modern form but gaming is the one of the first new media to appear.

454
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:04,642
Speaker 1: Man, there are kids who grew up with like ps2 instead of NES.

455
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,609
Speaker 0: I know and I wonder what the future holds for them.

456
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:13,612
Speaker 1: I'm lack of skills and not knowing where the door charges are in Zelda 1.

457
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:20,170
Speaker 1: Not being able to beat Megaman 2 so easily Not even coming close to being able to beat Megaman 1. that's what the future holds.

458
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:23,367
Speaker 0: No Human can beat Megaman not even knowing how to play Donkey Kong.

459
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:23,930
Speaker 0: thing about this.

460
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,769
Speaker 0: Maybe you'll get to this point to where there are these lost skills.

461
00:29:27,413 --> 00:29:29,060
Speaker 0: Maybe in the far future, they'll be kids.

462
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,970
Speaker 0: They'll find like this relic.

463
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,865
Speaker 1: They'll find like a nice invaders and they'll have no idea how to get past level one.

464
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,230
Speaker 0: They find Megaman.

465
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,591
Speaker 0: They're like.

466
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:39,241
Speaker 0: you mean Megaman for they're like, no, it just says Megaman.

467
00:29:39,783 --> 00:29:43,981
Speaker 0: There's never been a game without a number before And then it's trying to play it.

468
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:44,768
Speaker 0: they can't beat it.

469
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:54,849
Speaker 0: But they finally could be one level find like an old video of some Prehuman like some pre whatever they are, you know, they're coordinators the new types or whatever and they're like that guy's beaten it.

470
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:23,555
Speaker 0: So things of the day, you know our friends Emily and Alex front row crew people work from use games and they they made a game Elementia and it was pretty good and it didn't really show off though Like what they're capable of is a game studio and nor did it show off the plug-in, you know They're using unity this 3d like game development framework web browser thing and the game didn't really show off What's that cape what that's capable of?

471
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:25,321
Speaker 0: they have a new game.

472
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:30,273
Speaker 0: It's pretty much done and they released the trailer for it and I recommend you check this out.

473
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,598
Speaker 0: I'm for a three month development cycle.

474
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:34,382
Speaker 0: This is a pretty fucking slick game.

475
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:47,777
Speaker 0: I Yeah, one thing I'll say this game is basically there's the seed of a of a long-term like you could take this and make like The biggest MMO awesome game ever.

476
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,162
Speaker 1: Well, I think a good idea.

477
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:51,290
Speaker 1: right if they can turn around something like this, right?

478
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,130
Speaker 1: This game is pretty much the shooting and the repairing right and that's it.

479
00:30:54,575 --> 00:31:01,621
Speaker 1: If you can take a game like this Right every three months turn something out in this in this sort of fashion You get some sort of some way.

480
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:07,147
Speaker 1: combine them all together right, and that's that's where you can actually make some action right.

481
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,977
Speaker 1: look at like Like that Neopets thing isn't it?

482
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:12,004
Speaker 1: I think isn't Neopets a Scientology thing.

483
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:19,408
Speaker 0: I don't even remember but There's I believe someone there's some link or like someone bought that I'll look it up.

484
00:31:19,428 --> 00:31:20,030
Speaker 0: You keep talking.

485
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:29,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, regardless the Neopets I don't even remember like the details of it But it's like they have a bunch of different games in there that you can use to like Upgrade your pets or whatever.

486
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:45,564
Speaker 1: the how the fuck it works I don't even know but it's basically a collection of unrelated games together Somehow form a thing greater than you know the the sum of the parts and you can make Voltron if you can make a game every three months right.

487
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:50,266
Speaker 1: that you know is is On this level and you just keep doing it.

488
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:56,308
Speaker 1: eventually You're gonna have something that is greater than the sum of the parts, you know, as long as you keep it up.

489
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,754
Speaker 0: But check out this trailer.

490
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:00,807
Speaker 0: It's a game our friends made straight up and it's pretty cool.

491
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:01,429
Speaker 0: All right.

492
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,068
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day, what was it?

493
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:05,502
Speaker 0: Good game.

494
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:06,149
Speaker 0: Here we go.

495
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:11,001
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember now this dude went to Japan.

496
00:32:11,422 --> 00:32:13,910
Speaker 1: he went to some sort of urban design center.

497
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:21,090
Speaker 1: It was udck urban design center kashiwa, right and he went there and he was thirsty.

498
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:26,649
Speaker 1: So he goes to get a drink at this cafe and the cafe has a weird sign out front, right?

499
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in like some weird language.

500
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:29,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

501
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,710
Speaker 1: He goes to the cafe and he goes up and he orders orange juice.

502
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,609
Speaker 1: The lady gives him Something else I forget what and he's like what the hell?

503
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,350
Speaker 1: Apparently, this is a special cafe.

504
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:54,429
Speaker 1: the specialness of this cafe is you order something and You pay for what you order, but you get what the person before you ordered.

505
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:57,139
Speaker 1: Huh now the thing right.

506
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,810
Speaker 1: so the next he said he's like, huh?

507
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,290
Speaker 1: He sits down with what he didn't want.

508
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,350
Speaker 1: I don't even remember if he wanted it or not.

509
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:09,470
Speaker 1: The next person comes up and it's some lady and she orders orange juice and she gets orange juice.

510
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,534
Speaker 1: She's like yay.

511
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,264
Speaker 1: And the thing is you can't go up and order twice in a row.

512
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:17,228
Speaker 0: That's not allowed right and I'd go in with a friend.

513
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:23,266
Speaker 1: Yeah Regardless right, you know, there's all these rules so you can't be stupid about it.

514
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:23,930
Speaker 0: It's a cool idea.

515
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:25,335
Speaker 0: So what I want to make?

516
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:27,627
Speaker 0: I want to take this and make a game based on that concept.

517
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,276
Speaker 1: Oh snap So what the dude?

518
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,343
Speaker 1: oh shit you a bidding game would be really good.

519
00:33:32,363 --> 00:33:34,430
Speaker 1: like, you know what the previous order was?

520
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:46,970
Speaker 1: It's like if you want there to be a big order it's like you have to make a big order pay for it and then like Everyone goes again and it's you and everyone else bidding for what you just or what you just picked.

521
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,022
Speaker 0: There's some there's some magic there.

522
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,030
Speaker 0: We got a figure regardless.

523
00:33:50,596 --> 00:34:14,244
Speaker 1: So the dude's like hey So he goes and he basically orders like a ton of shit like a whole bunch of candy and everything right and then he goes and hides around the corner and the next people come up and they're like, you know, uh soda or something and the lady just starts giving him all this stuff and the tooth the lady and her kid who came up and got all this free stuff for like Whoever ordered this.

524
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,933
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh Think about this.

525
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:18,678
Speaker 0: look at he was driven.

526
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:20,202
Speaker 0: There's some mechanism design there.

527
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:23,976
Speaker 0: He was driven to buy all this stuff He normally wouldn't have bought.

528
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,530
Speaker 0: he wouldn't have just bought this stuff for a stranger randomly.

529
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:37,235
Speaker 0: But because there was this little game this little mechanism design He got this at a strange utility of buying more stuff and the store probably sells a lot more than they would if they were Just like a normal shop.

530
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be.

531
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:45,010
Speaker 1: you know, I don't know how this kind of cafe would work in the United States Somewhere but it's definitely it feels like a Japanese thing.

532
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,659
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing you gotta put at like if you've got us.

533
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,393
Speaker 0: if you're at a college and you have like a student fair Or something.

534
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,081
Speaker 0: that is what you need to do.

535
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good place for it.

536
00:34:55,291 --> 00:35:00,869
Speaker 1: But yeah, cool idea cool pictures cool cafe, Japan Japan.

537
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,697
Speaker 1: Okay, so the meta minute.

538
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,264
Speaker 1: metamoment the metamucil.

539
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,550
Speaker 1: we don't want to forget the metamoment.

540
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:09,035
Speaker 1: So the ad contest.

541
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:17,159
Speaker 1: we have received zero submissions since we have started doing the metamoment So it's completely useless to keep announcing it regardless.

542
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:19,907
Speaker 1: I've decided just end it and pick a winner.

543
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,050
Speaker 0: pick a winner.

544
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,600
Speaker 1: I have picked pretty much the entry.

545
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,030
Speaker 1: That was the most polished and photoshopped.

546
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:28,519
Speaker 1: Clearly someone has Photoshop skills.

547
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,363
Speaker 1: So they are the winner.

548
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:33,612
Speaker 1: the winner is the forum name Particulates.

549
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:36,961
Speaker 1: I found out through five minutes of research.

550
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:37,823
Speaker 1: you ready for this.

551
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:38,344
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

552
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,470
Speaker 1: I didn't realize this when I picked the winner.

553
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:43,355
Speaker 1: The guy's name is Chase Gordon.

554
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:49,430
Speaker 1: I think he's the dude who does that comic in which there was the old Rochester whiskey.

555
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:50,877
Speaker 0: Oh, where we?

556
00:35:51,119 --> 00:36:01,332
Speaker 1: oh, yes, so the creator of Rim and Scott's old Rochester whiskey is now the proud owner of six volumes of the Akira manga Which is the whole thing.

557
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:07,790
Speaker 1: I will mail you these six volumes when a you send me your address and B. I'm done moving

558
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:08,840
Speaker 0: Which is

559
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:23,946
Speaker 1: probably a month from now But I promise I will send them because I already have them and I have plenty of boxes in which to mail them And I will be living much closer to a post office And we'll have much easier access to it and more time in the day to go to it.

560
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:25,674
Speaker 1: So Will you?

561
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:25,996
Speaker 1: really?

562
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:31,420
Speaker 1: definitely there's a post office like right down the street from here I know so I go to it off an X out.

563
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:33,790
Speaker 1: I mailed out all those things to sold on Amazon.

564
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,357
Speaker 0: So you're gonna be living closer to one.

565
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's one like right next door in Queens.

566
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:38,692
Speaker 1: I'm not.

567
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:41,182
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's one very close regardless.

568
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,010
Speaker 1: I will definitely mail these to you.

Speaker 0: We don't have all the details on that yet.

594
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:27,609

Speaker 0: the buck stops at us.

606
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,178
Speaker 1: We'll try to find someone else who can do it.

607
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:17,076
Speaker 0: Maybe do I mean if the panels there aren't awesome It's our fault and we'll just blame you.

608
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:20,557
Speaker 1: So yeah Passing the buck.

609
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:23,578
Speaker 0: All right, so I bought an Xbox.

610
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:24,885
Speaker 1: I bought an Xbox 360. now.

611
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:30,977
Speaker 1: The reason that we did not buy an Xbox 360 for the longest time is a few reasons.

612
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:35,106
Speaker 1: number one it cost money Numbers not a reason.

613
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:35,889
Speaker 0: number two.

614
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,291
Speaker 1: I was under the impression that really without an HDTV It wasn't worth it, which is sort of true in a little bit.

615
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:41,953
Speaker 1: which right?

616
00:39:42,536 --> 00:39:42,917
Speaker 1: reason.

617
00:39:42,937 --> 00:39:47,531
Speaker 1: number three I already have more video games than I have time to play.

618
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,520
Speaker 1: I have a pile of unbeaten video games, right?

619
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,300
Speaker 1: So why would I buy a console to get more video games that I have time to play?

620
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,587
Speaker 1: Well, I bought one.

621
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:05,675
Speaker 1: finally and here's the reasons why I bought one number one I'm getting HDTV because I'm moving and a big TV isn't gonna really fit.

622
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,912
Speaker 1: so I gotta buy a flat one and Flat one's gonna be HD.

623
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:09,819
Speaker 1: So there you go.

624
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,439
Speaker 1: Number two the price dropped like a rock.

625
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:21,464
Speaker 1: I was able to get the elite the elite 360 the greatest one with the biggest hard drive the you know It's black.

626
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:24,180
Speaker 1: It's amazing for the price of $300.

627
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:33,240
Speaker 1: but there was a $50 mail-in rebate $250 for an elite Xbox 360, how about that?

628
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,242
Speaker 1: That's the same price I paid for the Wii on launch day and this is for the elite not for the regular or the premium Or whatever.

629
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:40,146
Speaker 1: so hells.

630
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:41,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna pay that.

631
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,203
Speaker 1: Reason number three.

632
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:50,260
Speaker 1: I already had these Xbox 360 controllers and wireless headsets that I was using with my PC for some PC gaming.

633
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:54,435
Speaker 1: So I didn't have to buy any extra controllers or headsets for the 360 really.

634
00:40:54,455 --> 00:41:00,020
Speaker 1: so You know, it was a total, you know, I already paid for these controllers.

635
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:01,667
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna get more use out of them.

636
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:06,481
Speaker 1: So it's actually enhancing the value of things I already owned by buying the 360.

637
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:20,560
Speaker 1: So I bought one and the things I realized when I got it were you know I I thought that you know over these years I kept seeing all these news is about all these great like Xbox Live arcade games and I always wanted some of them that they were just like these awesome indie games.

638
00:41:21,502 --> 00:41:22,306
Speaker 1: Now that I've got it.

639
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:25,824
Speaker 1: There's a lot fewer of those that I Remember.

640
00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:27,251
Speaker 1: they're being over the years.

641
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:28,980
Speaker 1: I remember seeing news about over the years.

642
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:30,831
Speaker 1: I thought they wanted to be like so many.

643
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:33,143
Speaker 1: I wouldn't know what to do with but really there aren't.

644
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:39,365
Speaker 1: and the thing is I look at the list of 360 games out there that are I want and A lot of them are games.

645
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,610
Speaker 1: I already have on Steam.

646
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:43,040
Speaker 1: like the braid game already got it on Steam.

647
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,752
Speaker 1: You know all the valve games got him on Steam and you know what.

648
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:54,222
Speaker 1: if a new game comes out and it's available on Steam And on the 360, I'm gonna pick it on Steam before I pick it on the 360.

649
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:57,358
Speaker 1: You know, I mean it depends actually on the kind of game.

650
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,985
Speaker 1: if it's a game I'm gonna play with the controller.

651
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:01,194
Speaker 1: I might pick the 360 version.

652
00:42:01,274 --> 00:42:02,760
Speaker 0: I guess what really bothers me about that?

653
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,024
Speaker 0: It's a mouse keyboard game.

654
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:12,009
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pick the PC, you know, we're playing Castle Crashers, which we're gonna talk about in a second and There's no reason it shouldn't just be on the PC.

655
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,400
Speaker 0: There's no reason at all for it to be a console only game.

656
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:16,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no reason for it to be 360 exclusive.

657
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:24,233
Speaker 1: I mean the guys who made it who have the source code could probably just push a button and Spit out a PC version that would run on Steam, but they didn't.

658
00:42:24,654 --> 00:42:25,978
Speaker 1: so there you have it.

659
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:35,893
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the two games that I've got are occupying my time our shadow complex Which I'll talk about in the future needless to say by that game.

660
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,859
Speaker 1: It's it's totally awesome and worth every dollar.

661
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:47,516
Speaker 1: And the other game is Castle Crashers Which we have both been playing which is why we can do a show on it because he both been playing it Whereas I've been the only one playing shadow complex.

662
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:54,753
Speaker 1: Yep So Castle Crashers Castle Crashers is River City Ransom plus Ninja Turtles 2.

663
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:55,515
Speaker 0: It's just.

664
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,160
Speaker 0: it's a little bit of Final Fight.

665
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,939
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of Final Fight Streets of Rage, but not much.

666
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:07,710
Speaker 1: You know what it has awesome music like Streets of Rage what it also has a lot of and as choose your character Pirate baby cabana battle.

667
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,784
Speaker 1: it has some of that going on - it has Playing.

668
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,420
Speaker 0: it feels like watching pirate baby cabana battle.

669
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:19,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's a side-scrolling beat-em-up game that has leveling up and money like River City Ransom does.

670
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:28,569
Speaker 1: it's got totally awesome styling and character like River City Ransom and You know Pirate baby cabana battle do.

671
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,760
Speaker 1: it has awesome music like Streets of Rage.

672
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:34,760
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the music in this game is some of the best music I've heard in a game in a long time.

673
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:34,954
Speaker 0: Yep.

674
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:40,108
Speaker 1: But the thing is the actual play of the game like, you know The parts you're standing on an animal.

675
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:42,639
Speaker 1: the part where there's an elevator the part, right?

676
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:46,753
Speaker 0: Where the other literally get on this platform, I think it's in the.

677
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:53,180
Speaker 0: we keep calling it the techno palace But it's the industrial castle right where it's just totally teams with Ninja Turtles.

678
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:57,115
Speaker 1: It's Ninja Turtles the arcade game and there's there's also parts where it's golden axe.

679
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:02,060
Speaker 1: also, you know Like the thieves are stealing stuff, you know as golden axe straight up.

680
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:06,316
Speaker 0: So rarely has a game so well stolen from the Forgotten Masters.

681
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:08,986
Speaker 1: Oh indeed indeed I mean really I mean this.

682
00:44:09,126 --> 00:44:11,676
Speaker 1: it's not really like there's nothing this game does.

683
00:44:11,756 --> 00:44:16,774
Speaker 1: it's incredibly innovative Exciting and really it's just a straight-up walk sideways beat him up.

684
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:24,066
Speaker 0: It's not like a highbrow game I mean, it's got a good set of combos, but pretty rapidly You'll min-max it and I've got like.

685
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:26,294
Speaker 1: I put all my points into magic and defense.

686
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,100
Speaker 0: I put all mine into strength and agility.

687
00:44:28,503 --> 00:44:31,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have infinite air combos that just kill anyone.

688
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:45,580
Speaker 1: I just stand there casting like magic splash attacks that hit every bad guy and do a ton of damage to all of them and then poison them and continue to damage them over time even if I dodge them and then My defense makes it some really hard to kill except for really dangerous bosses.

689
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:47,913
Speaker 1: But yeah, this game just steal it's.

690
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:49,180
Speaker 1: it's a side-scrolling beat-em-up.

691
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:59,280
Speaker 1: But they've taken the best of all the great side-scrolling beat-em-ups over time and made basically the ultimate Side-scrolling beat-em-up game to end all well side-scrolling beat-em-up games.

692
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:00,927
Speaker 0: Well, it does in the sense.

693
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,900
Speaker 0: in the sense of a normal, you know, this kind of beat-em-up.

694
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,450
Speaker 0: We're not talking about the hardcore beat-em-ups.

695
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,695
Speaker 0: This is no God hand.

696
00:45:07,736 --> 00:45:10,300
Speaker 1: No, it's not a God hand It's clearly River City Ransom.

697
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:20,857
Speaker 1: yeah, you Jam the buttons to beat up the bad guys and try to dodge the attacks that they occasionally throw at you and the bosses are Sometimes interesting and have a pattern that you have to follow.

698
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:35,340
Speaker 0: admit though The majority of the fun I get from the game is the fact that it's a well executed game that simultaneously just has Great pirate baby cabana battle stylin to where like the watching and the listening and the playing are all equally good and the three together.

699
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I have no interest in playing this.

700
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:44,120
Speaker 1: for example You can tell when you're playing this game that like you can level up big-time and you know You can do all sorts of crazy attack.

701
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,081
Speaker 0: They're like, you know any different fucking characters to unlock and you have to like be really 30.

702
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can be like the Saracen and the fire elementally alien and the conehead.

703
00:45:52,714 --> 00:45:54,440
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't know that beekeeper.

704
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:59,720
Speaker 0: Oh shit, the way to unlock them all is such grindy bullshit.

705
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:06,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like a million weapons in the game and there's also animals that you can get in the year in your arc.

706
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,694
Speaker 1: You know animal companions.

707
00:46:08,794 --> 00:46:17,980
Speaker 0: the leveling up is fun But the fact that I can't just pick a level is Incredibly annoying primarily because you know we Scott and I played through a lot of the game And then we wanted to show it to Alex.

708
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,600
Speaker 0: So we sit down and we basically all had to be level one or else it just sucked.

709
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:24,853
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Alex could have been level one while we were very high level.

710
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:26,399
Speaker 0: that would have been great for him, right?

711
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,504
Speaker 1: That would have been great for him.

712
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:30,679
Speaker 1: Just getting completely owned by all the bad guys.

713
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,320
Speaker 0: Also the fact that level clearly matters significantly.

714
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,015
Speaker 0: I mean Scott played a little bit and was higher level than me and until I caught up He was just better than me completely and I didn't even need to be there.

715
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:43,287
Speaker 1: Yeah So yeah that leveling.

716
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,339
Speaker 0: the leveling is fun, but why like the grindy bullshit?

717
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,460
Speaker 0: wise They should have made it more like I have all this achievement II grindy bullshit stuck onto an otherwise good game.

718
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,637
Speaker 1: They should have made it just like River City ransom where it's money that matters.

719
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,405
Speaker 1: you can get Techniques and things like.

720
00:46:56,425 --> 00:47:00,140
Speaker 1: you go buy a combo you got buy an animal, but it doesn't actually level you.

721
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,595
Speaker 0: It does in River City ransom, that's why you level up.

722
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:03,360
Speaker 0: you go buy the food.

723
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:05,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

724
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:07,243
Speaker 1: The staff forgot about yeah And that that was.

725
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:11,480
Speaker 0: that was fun because you only you would only play it with like one person all the way through.

726
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,436
Speaker 0: But this is more a game where I might just pick it up with my friends.

727
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:17,230
Speaker 0: the fact that oh I gotta level up my guy to catch up with my friends.

728
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:22,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, your friends can't join it You know, the thing is it does allow you to play online with friends.

729
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:26,100
Speaker 1: So like if I level up myself and my friend levels up we can join together.

730
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:33,500
Speaker 1: Or if like my friend who has the game at his house comes over He can log into his Xbox Live on the and then we can he can bring his characters up.

731
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,956
Speaker 1: I think I'm not a hundred percent sure about that, but I hope it looks like you're able to.

732
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:39,401
Speaker 1: I don't know about that For sure.

733
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:45,851
Speaker 0: I just I don't like the fact that I have to level up all these characters and like we unlock some characters I gotta level them up separately.

734
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:47,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, just to play them.

735
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,234
Speaker 0: No, I want to play it right because I only care about the style.

736
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:51,198
Speaker 0: I don't care about anything else.

737
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:56,220
Speaker 1: It's definitely the kind of game where after I beat all the levels and all the bosses I'm gonna be done with it.

738
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, also the fact that you could buy some of this content with the DLC for real Can you really?

739
00:48:01,843 --> 00:48:04,174
Speaker 0: I didn't know that some of the weapons are like the king's pack.

740
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:07,885
Speaker 1: Oh I Was unaware not happening.

741
00:48:08,227 --> 00:48:10,617
Speaker 1: Nope, not cool not paying for that.

742
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:13,265
Speaker 1: Sorry Yeah, other than that.

743
00:48:13,425 --> 00:48:17,642
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's it's got a lot of funny bits in it You know, like.

744
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:25,440
Speaker 0: there's the part where the deer is rocket poop the rocket poop and there's a lot of Ren and Stimpy styling But not always that and there's also a lot of it.

745
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:31,493
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of parts of the game That are like they mix up the gameplay the same way Ninja Turtles the arcade did like.

746
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:35,759
Speaker 1: there's a sequence of the game where you ride Animals while you're running away from this big monster.

747
00:48:36,001 --> 00:48:38,429
Speaker 1: It's also the right and you stop doing.

748
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:45,880
Speaker 1: you know beat them up and you do like a sort of dodgy Side-scrolling game almost like dodgy in the American almost not the British sense.

749
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,290
Speaker 1: It's almost like the racing part in Chrono Trigger kind of.

750
00:48:49,912 --> 00:48:50,654
Speaker 1: you know, I'm talking about.

751
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:51,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

752
00:48:51,076 --> 00:48:52,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's almost like that.

753
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,915
Speaker 1: So it's not just a side-scrolling beat-em-up, which though, you know what?

754
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:58,784
Speaker 1: It's actually a lot like Battletoads in that sense.

755
00:48:59,305 --> 00:48:59,727
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

756
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:01,853
Speaker 1: It's almost like the motorcycle part in Battletoads.

757
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,940
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that hasn't been remade recently.

758
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:07,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually wish the game had more Battletoads kind of stuff.

759
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,207
Speaker 1: It has a little bit but that's another book.

760
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:09,890
Speaker 1: beat him up that it's.

761
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:12,561
Speaker 0: there is one part when we were fighting the the techno King.

762
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:17,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, where I just I expected it to be that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Battletoads thing.

763
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,920
Speaker 0: I expected to be like throwing stuff at the screen, but that didn't really happen.

764
00:49:21,201 --> 00:49:24,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but you know, we're only we're not even all the way through the game.

765
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:26,880
Speaker 1: We got to go across the river to the rest of the game.

766
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:29,435
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's all kinds of exciting stuff over there.

767
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:41,880
Speaker 0: there is but the fact that there's so much like a lot of people who are playing that are getting really really into the DLC and the unlocking and the leveling in the ground That's I mean, how else can you make big money off a game like this?

768
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:48,520
Speaker 1: If you don't do that kind of stuff You're only gonna make a little money off it and that's why this game probably didn't cost them anything to make at all.

769
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:57,054
Speaker 1: Yet they found a way to market and design the game to basically Get tons of money from people on a huge high margin and that's why they're raking it in.

770
00:49:57,575 --> 00:49:59,645
Speaker 0: so it's a fun game though It is.

771
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,920
Speaker 1: it's definitely it's a good game.

772
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:06,080
Speaker 1: I mean, they wouldn't be make be able to get DLC people to pay for DLC if the core game was poop.

773
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:09,753
Speaker 0: The thing is it's like we said, it's a fun pirate baby cabana battle.

774
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:11,579
Speaker 0: It's not a it's no NS.

775
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:24,010
Speaker 1: I mean I I was playing NS today and Yesterday, yeah This is heavily game where you buy it you play it till completion and then you put it back on the shelf never to be picked Up again, maybe like years later.

776
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,580
Speaker 0: You'll play it through again with some friends.

777
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,332
Speaker 1: Maybe I forget maybe you know.

778
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:32,615
Speaker 1: what happened is, you know Some other friends will come over haven't played it and they'll play it together while you're doing something else.

779
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:34,100
Speaker 1: That's definitely gonna happen.

780
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:40,120
Speaker 1: It's a game that like the same way that mean like we've beaten River City ransom But we'll pick it up and play through a level or two from time to time.

781
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:45,988
Speaker 0: It's one of those games where other people can be playing it and I get almost the same enjoyment watching other people play as I Get playing.

782
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:52,687
Speaker 1: so I could do something Especially like, you know when they see the jokes in the game that you've seen already But you can see them laugh at the joke.

783
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:54,355
Speaker 0: Didn't we talk about this last Wednesday?

784
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:55,460
Speaker 1: We talked about this.

785
00:50:55,621 --> 00:51:00,225
Speaker 0: I think we need to do a Tuesday on replaying cuz there's different stuff to say You think so?

786
00:51:00,305 --> 00:51:01,009
Speaker 1: I don't know.

787
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:02,175
Speaker 1: I don't think this different.

788
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:03,220
Speaker 1: It's it's mostly the same.

789
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's some different though a little bit a little bit.

790
00:51:06,052 --> 00:51:08,060
Speaker 0: if we broaden it to be replayability.

791
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,840
Speaker 0: Maybe why can I play NS and tie fighter over over again?

792
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,238
Speaker 0: But I can't play castle crashes again cuz cash crashes again is the same thing.

793
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:18,185
Speaker 0: again It's the same but I thought is the same.

794
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:19,269
Speaker 1: but NS again.

795
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,537
Speaker 1: each game of NS is a different experience.

796
00:51:21,617 --> 00:51:22,340
Speaker 1: It's it's you're creating.

797
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:23,203
Speaker 1: It's the same reason.

798
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,773
Speaker 1: you can play dwarf fortress actually if you like.

799
00:51:25,813 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 1: it has infinite replayability.

800
00:51:28,344 --> 00:51:29,351
Speaker 0: The exact same game again.

801
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:30,659
Speaker 0: Why can I play it again so easily?

802
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,708
Speaker 0: Because tie fighter you think is.

803
00:51:33,768 --> 00:51:35,858
Speaker 0: I think it's just because there aren't enough of those games.

804
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:44,467
Speaker 0: Yeah It's kind of like if I'm if I'm dying of scurvy something that has a little bit of vitamin C in it I will eat that forever cuz I need it.

805
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:48,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if someone gives me oranges, I don't need it anymore.

806
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:49,830
Speaker 0: Basically, there's.

807
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:51,500
Speaker 1: I should walk to the gas station get some oranges.

808
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,142
Speaker 1: We don't have any.

809
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:54,993
Speaker 0: they're the only sources left of vitamin tie fighter.

810
00:51:55,334 --> 00:52:01,469
Speaker 1: our tie fighter and x-wing alliance vitamin tie fighter Come over and over again.

811
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,160
Speaker 1: The only source of vitamin X calm is X calm?

812
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I mean there's the jagged Alliance.

813
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:07,237
Speaker 1: whatever whatever.

814
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:07,660
Speaker 1: it's not.

815
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:11,271
Speaker 1: Nothing is the same as that X calm alien.

816
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:13,880
Speaker 0: whatever tribes - there's even a penny arcade.

817
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:18,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Vitamin tribes.

818
00:52:18,465 --> 00:52:19,108
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

819
00:52:19,128 --> 00:52:20,856
Speaker 0: I'm so deficient in that.

820
00:52:20,896 --> 00:52:21,639
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna die.

821
00:52:22,824 --> 00:52:25,864
Speaker 1: Die of tribes Scurv scurv drive.

822
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:26,968
Speaker 0: try V tribes II.

823
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,260
Speaker 1: I don't know we're gonna have to come up with diseases for this.

824
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,347
Speaker 0: I think we're winding down here.

825
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:36,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, I guess just in summary right castle crashers.

826
00:52:36,545 --> 00:52:37,959
Speaker 1: It's got sort of this cool.

827
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:38,361
Speaker 1: It's.

828
00:52:38,462 --> 00:52:40,148
Speaker 1: it's basically a medieval styling.

829
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:55,811
Speaker 1: side scroll II beat him up game great music Good gameplay, you know, but it sort of mixes it up with all sorts of you know, aliens and animals and as bears shitting themselves right big monsters Dragon, I don't I really have any dragons yet.

830
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:57,759
Speaker 0: I really like that techno King though.

831
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:00,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's cool because it combines like sort of technology.

832
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:06,940
Speaker 1: There's aliens, but this medieval, you know, you get the pirates They got they got everything coming in all the cool themes rolled into one.

833
00:53:07,442 --> 00:53:10,155
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's it's totally geeking out, but it's a game.

834
00:53:10,617 --> 00:53:12,384
Speaker 0: don't buy an egg You couldn't buy it.

835
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,572
Speaker 0: really good controls for this game.

836
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:16,198
Speaker 0: No, you have an Xbox.

837
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:16,740
Speaker 0: You're 300.

838
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,066
Speaker 1: It's not a $300 game.

839
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:20,276
Speaker 0: If you don't have if you have an Xbox already, you're stupid.

840
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:23,588
Speaker 0: if you don't have this game That's right But it should be on the PC.

841
00:53:23,689 --> 00:53:35,238
Speaker 1: Maybe someday will be yep, you know Especially because it's playable online game could basically be on the DS game could be on the Wii Game could be on everything, you know, no reason to make it 360 Pacific.

842
00:53:35,499 --> 00:53:37,568
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, I do want to say one thing though.

843
00:53:37,588 --> 00:53:43,672
Speaker 1: Is that you know, I originally thought that you know You need an HDTV or else the 360 isn't worth it.

844
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,980
Speaker 1: And I realize that's only partially true, right?

845
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,193
Speaker 1: We're playing these games on a non HDTV with the 360 and it's just fine.

846
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:59,720
Speaker 1: The thing is there are obviously Some few aspects where an HDTV would significantly help right like in the shadow complex game.

847
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,849
Speaker 1: There's some things that are just sort of small and difficult for me to see, you know even with my excellent eyesight just because the TV is not HD.

848
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:15,460
Speaker 1: and also in Castle Crashers like there's small details like When you're looking the wet go into the weapons frog and you look at like the stats and different weapons.
