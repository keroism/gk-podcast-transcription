1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,773
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday December 8th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,519
Speaker 1: We talked about our freshman year in college.

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,538
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,190
Speaker 1: So today was another awesomely boring day.

5
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:20,912
Speaker 0: God.

6
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:30,841
Speaker 0: It was just like yesterday where I had nothing to do at work only I didn't go to the comic book store after work, and I was just God.

7
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:37,360
Speaker 1: yeah, I work late to diagnose a silly problem with a switch that I probably shouldn't had to stay late to diagnose.

8
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,688
Speaker 1: Wow it was awesome.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,960
Speaker 0: I was sitting there doing nothing and I really don't want to go tomorrow cuz I'm not gonna do anything tomorrow.

10
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:47,487
Speaker 1: Oh, you might not have to go do anything.

11
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,496
Speaker 1: tomorrow looks like it's gonna snow a lot.

12
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:56,731
Speaker 0: if it snows enough I'm just gonna be like fuck it, and I'll stay home, and I'll do something cool And maybe I'll just call in sick.

13
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:57,799
Speaker 1: I need a day off.

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,236
Speaker 1: I'm actually really dragging from not sleeping enough the last two weeks.

15
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:08,080
Speaker 0: oh, man You know I can't sleep on the trains so easily cuz I have a thing where I need to lay down.

16
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,599
Speaker 0: That's kind of weird, but I was so tired on the way home on the train.

17
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,776
Speaker 0: I was playing Mario and Luigi and like my eyes.

18
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:20,680
Speaker 0: I couldn't hold them open While I was playing a DS game.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,919
Speaker 1: Why don't you get one of those like neck pillows that goes around your neck because they look silly they work.

20
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:27,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, I might get one.

21
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,698
Speaker 0: actually I just had to find one that I think is good.

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,179
Speaker 1: so uh Neopets is Scientology.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,464
Speaker 0: Didn't see that coming.

24
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:41,456
Speaker 1: Yeah sky was sitting at work today, and Scott sent me a link to this article.

25
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:48,060
Speaker 1: It's about Neopets and He's like Neopets of Scientology, so I start reading the article and it just talks about Neopets.

26
00:01:48,725 --> 00:02:01,880
Speaker 1: and then on the second page is there's one sentence and the sentence pretty much says the CEO of Neopets Doug Doring or Doring is Super super super super Scientologist, and he runs the company on the principles of Scientology.

27
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, you mean there's a lot of people who are just oh, they're a Scientologist like.

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,740
Speaker 0: I think the voice of Bart Simpson is a Scientologist.

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaker 0: Right Isaac Hayes supposedly Isaac Hayes a Scientologist, but you know while that makes you an idiot It doesn't necessarily mean the work you do is bad, so it doesn't really reflect on Neopets, but this guy runs the company with the teachings of L Ron Hubbard.

30
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:39,840
Speaker 1: Quote here Hubbard's companies follow a system of departmental organization called the org board Which he claimed was a refinement of one used by an old galactic civilization that lasted 80 trillion years.

31
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:51,139
Speaker 0: Imagine if you were the CEO of a company, and you said I think we should reorganize the company this way because aliens From an ancient time did it this way?

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh right.

33
00:02:55,083 --> 00:03:08,746
Speaker 1: What's even more interesting is that the primary Aspect of this org method of running a company involves having a corrections division that disciplines other divisions of the company and It says no more than that.

34
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,079
Speaker 0: You know some companies kind of need that.

35
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:22,546
Speaker 1: But at the same time yeah Yeah, so yeah, this may sound silly or like we're making it up, but no Scientology really is.

36
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,760
Speaker 1: they're like hardcore behind the scenes at Neopets.

37
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,827
Speaker 0: Yep, there was another guy who worked at.

38
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,236
Speaker 0: Neopets is like an artist for a short time.

39
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,420
Speaker 1: He got the fuck out of there.

40
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:36,202
Speaker 0: He was smart, and he didn't Scientology, but he pointed out that yeah There's.

41
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:40,580
Speaker 0: you know that Neil the Scientology doesn't get into the Neopets.

42
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:46,860
Speaker 0: So if you're using Neopets you know I would I would encourage you to stop because you're supporting the Scientologists.

43
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:51,540
Speaker 0: But at the same time Neopets isn't gonna turn you into a Scientologist anytime soon.

44
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is it at least okay?

45
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,810
Speaker 0: That's that's good.

46
00:03:54,831 --> 00:04:02,475
Speaker 0: They didn't do that because if Neopets was a Scientology recruitment Well, you know we just have a freaking cow, but yeah, not like a Narcan.

47
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:13,520
Speaker 0: on yeah, but Basically he worked there And he noticed that everyone above a certain level of management basically had to join Scientology and be hardcore.

48
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:20,139
Speaker 1: And I'm sure most of you know our opinions on Scientology, and I don't we're not it's not an opinion.

49
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,400
Speaker 1: well No, I'm talking about our specific opinions on Scientology, but there's also some facts, and I'm sure you guys know most of them.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,239
Speaker 1: But just very quickly Scientologists believe in an alien named Xenu who dropped atomic bombs on earth billions of years ago.

51
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:39,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they think these little magic guys who stick to you and called body thetans, and you have to get them off of you.

52
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:46,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like all inside you imagine if some guy wrote a pulp sci-fi story And you believed it was the history of the world.

53
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,565
Speaker 0: That's what Scientology is.

54
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,649
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much.

55
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,475
Speaker 0: That's not even like a joke.

56
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,700
Speaker 0: We're just dead serious.

57
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:57,297
Speaker 0: This is really a cult that believes that and if you join them they take all your money.

58
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,200
Speaker 1: pretty much.

59
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,953
Speaker 1: They take it all bit by bit not all at once.

60
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,452
Speaker 0: yep That's all there is to it.

61
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:09,019
Speaker 1: Though apparently you get superpowers if you become a Scientologist and go all the way or you believe you have superpowers.

62
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:16,117
Speaker 0: Yeah Tom Cruise, yeah, yeah, I don't see you saving people's lives Alright, so shove it.

63
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:26,116
Speaker 1: Actually the weirdest thing is it seems like a lot of people have pointed out that a lot of Scientologists despite all their magic powers and disdaining you know things that can harm the body.

64
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,480
Speaker 1: a lot of them are smokers.

65
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,364
Speaker 0: Really, there's just clouds.

66
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:34,118
Speaker 1: apparently there's clouds and clouds of them standing outside the Scientology building in New York City smoking every day.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,366
Speaker 1: hmm Just a little tidbit.

68
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:36,808
Speaker 1: I picked up.

69
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,874
Speaker 0: Oh they have a building.

70
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:38,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have a building.

71
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:44,139
Speaker 0: We should go and like we can't get in we could do stuff in front of it.

72
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:45,727
Speaker 1: What just stand there?

73
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:47,899
Speaker 0: We can make a wall of non culties.

74
00:05:49,582 --> 00:06:01,171
Speaker 1: Why don't we just continue to do what we've been doing which is heckle and harass them whenever they're set up in the subways trying to convert people Because that won't draw as much iron.

75
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,276
Speaker 1: It's fun though.

76
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:13,499
Speaker 1: one time I mean every time we pass these guys in the subway We just stop and walk over and start telling people You know this is a cult right these guys are just trying to get you to join their crazy cult that believes in aliens because

77
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,469
Speaker 0: that's what they are trying to do and

78
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,306
Speaker 1: They really don't know how to deal with that.

79
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:24,390
Speaker 1: one time they threatened to call the police on us, and we were like all right Fine call the police officer explain to him what you just said to us.

80
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would have been hilarious if a cop came.

81
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,285
Speaker 0: I would have been like these guys are cultists.

82
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:38,317
Speaker 0: all I'm doing is telling people in the area using freedom of speech that they are cultists and They're calling the police saying we're harassing them.

83
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:45,500
Speaker 0: Here is proof to their cultists, and the only way that wouldn't work is if the cop was a Scientologist.

84
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would have not worked.

85
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,971
Speaker 1: Oh, and they like to sue people.

86
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,583
Speaker 1: so maybe we'll get sued after this but uh Awesome.

87
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,510
Speaker 1: I would love to get sued by Scientology.

88
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:12,160
Speaker 1: Yeah way to give me some publicity Such That would rock Alright, so remember that story We did not long ago about the guy who tried to buy a camera and the company was evil and they tried to screw him.

89
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:25,306
Speaker 0: Yep, well Someone else told that guy a story about a similar experience at another place that's also in Brooklyn named Wawa digital and Basically he had the same story.

90
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,733
Speaker 0: He wanted to buy a camera.

91
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:27,938
Speaker 0: He bought it on the.

92
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,248
Speaker 0: you know It was a good price.

93
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,292
Speaker 0: He called up.

94
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,340
Speaker 0: They tried to sell him all these accessories.

95
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:36,510
Speaker 0: He says and they say you know I get you know.

96
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,554
Speaker 0: and he says fine.

97
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 0: I want to cancel mom canceling my order.

98
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,600
Speaker 0: The guy's like are you really gonna do that and pay the restocking fee?

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,020
Speaker 0: He's like I'm not paying any restocking fee because there wasn't any order and this guy got really pissed off.

100
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:58,180
Speaker 0: I Guess they have big commissions Or I don't know why these salesmen keep getting pissed off that their scam business model doesn't work on smart people.

101
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:05,300
Speaker 0: But he got really pissed off and he left the guy a voicemail saying he was gonna break his neck.

102
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, and fortunately we have the actual voicemail here.

103
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:40,390
Speaker 1: Yep, so let's roll that sucker 9 to receive at 3.22 p.m Yes, you're in a big trouble.

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:54,740
Speaker 1: To erase press... Yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be no legal repercussions of that voicemail.

105
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know threatening physical harm.

106
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,160
Speaker 0: I don't think anything else needs to be said after hearing that.

107
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:08,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess the moral is don't buy cameras that seem like they're too good a deal to be true from shady vendors in New York City.

108
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically don't buy a camera from any small place in New York City.

109
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:19,440
Speaker 0: buy your cameras from like I don't know The company that makes them or yeah a real store or even Best Buy.

110
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,944
Speaker 1: I mean Best Buy is evil in a lot of ways, but they don't directly Steal from you.

111
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,025
Speaker 1: Yep.

112
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,975
Speaker 1: They they kind of like indirectly steal which is I guess better.

113
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:33,284
Speaker 0: Hmm, I guess All right.

114
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,673
Speaker 1: So also the MPAA.

115
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,957
Speaker 0: Oh this story.

116
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:44,580
Speaker 0: Okay, so the Someone made a movie called This film is not yet rated.

117
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:51,780
Speaker 0: It's about the MPAA and how they rate films and it's about the impact of the film rating system on American culture.

118
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,700
Speaker 1: And it paints the MPAA in a really bad light, of course because well, that's the truth.

119
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,100
Speaker 0: So any movie about the truth is gonna make the MPAA look bad.

120
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,784
Speaker 1: So what did the MPAA rate it?

121
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:06,437
Speaker 0: the MPAA gave a movie about movie ratings a rating of NC 17, huh?

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:17,129
Speaker 0: Now there is the of course the conspiracy theory that says all they did that to keep it out of theaters and to keep it Out of blockbusters and no one will see it.

123
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,339
Speaker 0: and blah blah blah blah blah, which is a very see.

124
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,885
Speaker 1: I made it through my tinfoil hat.

125
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:30,732
Speaker 0: It's probably partially true if not mostly true, but also The movie's got some Graphical sexual content in it.

126
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,265
Speaker 1: So yeah But apparently they're.

127
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,713
Speaker 1: they point out a lot of interesting things like.

128
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:46,295
Speaker 1: it seems that the MPAA is much harsher on rating Homosexual sexuality than it is on heterosexual sexuality.

129
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:47,340
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

130
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,230
Speaker 1: So it seems like a movie where a man kisses.

131
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:54,627
Speaker 1: a man is much more likely to get a hard rating Than a movie where a man kisses a woman.

132
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:55,570
Speaker 0: Hmm.

133
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,095
Speaker 1: Yeah fancy that.

134
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:02,726
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe these See the How these ratings are come about.

135
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:15,720
Speaker 1: but basically the MPAA appoints a bunch of people to do it and they're anonymous And they watch the movie and they assign a rating based on what the average American family would think.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:21,477
Speaker 1: Oh great, at least that's their directive, but it's anonymous and there are really no repercussions and they can do things.

137
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:25,710
Speaker 1: however they want Mm-hmm Supposedly it's anonymous to keep them from being bribed.

138
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,457
Speaker 1: But I don't know.

139
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,490
Speaker 0: Yeah I think they get bribed a little bit.

140
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,665
Speaker 1: I I don't really know what to say.

141
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:33,989
Speaker 1: The MPAA is bad.

142
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:37,759
Speaker 1: They're on every front and I'd rather dislike them.

143
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:56,320
Speaker 0: mmm-hmm be interesting to see Like if we could get a whole pile of movies from like different studios to independent and you know such and Compare like movies with similar content versus the rating they got and the years.

144
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:59,470
Speaker 0: You know and see how things changed over time.

145
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,460
Speaker 1: we could you know, actually it's gotten a lot more lenient over time.

146
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:05,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good except with regards to homosexuality.

147
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,213
Speaker 0: Boys kissing Well, I can tell you one thing in Japan.

148
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,440
Speaker 0: They don't give two craps.

149
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,999
Speaker 1: Yeah in a lot of ways they seem a lot smarter than a lot of people here and in other ways a lot more nutty.

150
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:27,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's fine, though Yeah Things of the day.

151
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,064
Speaker 1: We don't have music yet Lazy bums.

152
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, just haven't gotten around to it.

153
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:34,920
Speaker 0: All right, so my thing today.

154
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:43,980
Speaker 0: Well, you may recall rim who had a great story that he seems to go crazy about and keeps referring to often.

155
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:45,051
Speaker 0: Is that uh?

156
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,209
Speaker 0: Most women never had the big O.

157
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,258
Speaker 1: Well most American women American women.

158
00:12:51,823 --> 00:13:01,039
Speaker 0: So someone made a piece of software called Lapis, it's a little rabbit L a P is and It doesn't actually run in the Nintendo DS.

159
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:35,999
Speaker 0: it runs on the computer, but it you know has a little picture of a Nintendo DS because it has the same features of you know touchscreen and microphone and all that and it's kind of like Nintendogs except you have this cute little blue rabbit and You play with this cute little blue rabbit in various ways rubbing him with its stylus and blowing on the microphone and scratching and tickling and all that good stuff and the little rabbit is supposedly stimulated in the same way that a clitoris is.

160
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:48,387
Speaker 0: so if you want to learn how to stimulate women You just stimulate the bunny until it flies around and yeah That's really the analogy to orgasm in the game.

161
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,851
Speaker 1: The bunny starts flying.

162
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:55,602
Speaker 0: Yep, and then you've got it supposedly Fantastic.

163
00:13:55,943 --> 00:14:00,576
Speaker 0: So if you think your woman is faking the big O you can play the lapis.

164
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:11,877
Speaker 0: if you're a woman And you don't know if you've ever had one you can practice lapis and then Go and do it to yourself later.

165
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:21,253
Speaker 0: I'd like to hear someone who like, you know tried it and Determine if it was accurate or something.

166
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:22,299
Speaker 0: That'll be cool.

167
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,310
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see.

168
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Think I might just play this game just to have fun with the game.

169
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:31,114
Speaker 1: Yeah.

170
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to have fun.

171
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:34,992
Speaker 0: And then look at some prawn.

172
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,380
Speaker 1: Oh prawn prawn.

173
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, my thing of the day is not nearly so cool, but I found it very cool until I heard about this thing.

174
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:51,510
Speaker 1: Mmm, but uh Apparently recently very recently there was a semi major archaeological discovery in of all places Battery Park in New York City.

175
00:14:52,921 --> 00:15:01,053
Speaker 1: Those of you who don't live out here Battery Park is the park at the bottom of Manhattan where you know Statue of Liberty and all that stuff is they were digging in Battery Park.

176
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:02,940
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the subway lines go under there.

177
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,020
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, and they were extent they're extending a subway line.

178
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:15,797
Speaker 1: They're just from subway work and they discovered buried along the shore Gun emplacement from before the Revolutionary War a gun emplacement.

179
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:16,720
Speaker 1: a gun emplacement.

180
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,613
Speaker 1: Wow, it was just very good guns in it.

181
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:24,615
Speaker 1: So it has gone Paraffinalia in it and like the foundations for the gun.

182
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:32,160
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool Yeah, and they were absolutely amazed that it sat there undisturbed for so many freaking years.

183
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,019
Speaker 0: Well, it's made of rock and it's underground where no one's touching it.

184
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:43,850
Speaker 1: Yeah so the subway workers about and the the city and MTA have actually agreed to Work around it and leave it there so that people can come in and study it.

185
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,294
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

186
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:47,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all there is to that.

187
00:15:48,402 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 0: It's always nice to see because people don't realize that New York City like if you were here, let's see 300 years ago When New York City was actually just like an island Manhattan was just an island with nothing on it except maybe like some buildings.

188
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,719
Speaker 0: But it was actually that the original dirt and trees and such.

189
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:13,176
Speaker 0: The city we have now is like three or four levels of city above that.

190
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,979
Speaker 0: Oh Really?

191
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:20,640
Speaker 0: It's like, you know over time they built stuff then they built stuff and they built stuff and they built stuff.

192
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,308
Speaker 0: It's like way up now.

193
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,192
Speaker 1: Well, there's all.

194
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,160
Speaker 1: there's lots of cool abandoned stuff.

195
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,860
Speaker 1: There's abandoned subway stations and subway lines and all like basements steam tunnels.

196
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:47,449
Speaker 0: But if you look at say the first floor of an office building now That is like at the level that a roof of a house would have been in like the 17 or 1800s Mm-hmm because of the shit they've piled on Over time.

197
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:48,436
Speaker 0: at least that's what I hear.

198
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:56,040
Speaker 0: Aha, but of course you can see right here the gun emplacement which would normally be you know on land is underground.

199
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:57,910
Speaker 0: So you see how that works out?

200
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,246
Speaker 1: I Just thought it was very cool.

201
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,338
Speaker 1: I'm glad that they're at least taking the time to study it.

202
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Speaker 1: Yep, instead of just you know, running the six line or whatever subways over there through it.

203
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:12,797
Speaker 0: Hey There's not you know, too much stuff left in New York City to study.

204
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,500
Speaker 1: So What about the crazy homeless guys walking around yelling?

205
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,867
Speaker 0: Those are crazy homeless guys.

206
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,619
Speaker 1: You can study them see what they say.

207
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:31,075
Speaker 1: Hey All right, so basically for our main bid we were tired.

208
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:32,620
Speaker 1: we didn't have much to talk about today.

209
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:36,833
Speaker 1: So we figured we'd regale you with stories from our freshman year at RIT.

210
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:42,695
Speaker 1: It's a geek fable Except there's no moral to this one other than have fun in college.

211
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,483
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna make up a moral All right.

212
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:45,850
Speaker 1: We'll see if you come up with one or not.

213
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,210
Speaker 1: All right, I Mean, we're already told about how we all met.

214
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:56,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, and You know some stories about our wag the gaming club and our dungeon master Dwayne We don't need to get into that.

215
00:17:56,938 --> 00:18:00,920
Speaker 1: Nope But our life as freshmen in college was pretty fantastic.

216
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:08,160
Speaker 1: Our IT the dorms are connected to each other by a whole bunch of tunnels.

217
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course I lived in Peterson and our tunnels weren't connected to the other tunnels until like a few quarters in.

218
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:15,477
Speaker 0: yeah.

219
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:22,015
Speaker 1: Yeah But I was in the good dorms So I could spend an entire weekend without even sitting one foot outside in the winter.

220
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,020
Speaker 0: you were in the dorm.

221
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,628
Speaker 0: That was all guys and vomitation.

222
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,980
Speaker 0: I was in the co-ed dorm with no alcohol and no drugs.

223
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:35,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but your dorm was unrenovated and wasn't connected to the tunnel which means my route to which means my rooms were bigger.

224
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:39,127
Speaker 1: Plus despite all the vomitation sis of my dorm.

225
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,852
Speaker 1: No one ever vomited on me.

226
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,676
Speaker 0: You vomited on you.

227
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

228
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,491
Speaker 1: Yeah See, it's funny whenever I get the flu or anything I just like I vomit like.

229
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,580
Speaker 1: that's my primary mode of fighting illness.

230
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:56,540
Speaker 1: And one time when I was a freshman I got real sick and we all right here we have bunk beds.

231
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,044
Speaker 1: Now this is kind of it.

232
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,731
Speaker 1: This is it's kind of a sick story.

233
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:04,226
Speaker 1: Not that I guess we try told worse things But I'm laying there in bed.

234
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:10,700
Speaker 1: I'm sick and I wake up in the middle of the night and then I vomit Bargo.

235
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:14,450
Speaker 1: So I get out of bed and I'm not now.

236
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,895
Speaker 1: my roommate who I never talked to.

237
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:16,176
Speaker 1: I didn't.

238
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,160
Speaker 1: I don't even know this kid's name.

239
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,426
Speaker 1: I never talked to him.

240
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,371
Speaker 0: I never knew his name.

241
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,235
Speaker 1: He was quiet.

242
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:23,651
Speaker 1: He wasn't interested anything I was interested in so we just never talked and we left each other alone.

243
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,520
Speaker 0: He was sitting the chair wear headphones guy.

244
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:33,004
Speaker 1: Yeah I am pretty certain that he awakened and decided to pretend he was asleep to avoid having to deal with what I would ride it Just done.

245
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,204
Speaker 0: that is what I would do also being

246
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:50,140
Speaker 1: basically the story ends with me putting all my dirty sheets in a hamper not having any more clean sheets taking a shower and then Feebly crawling into my like bare mattress covering myself with my last dry towel and trying to sleep.

247
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,089
Speaker 0: That is hilarious.

248
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,280
Speaker 1: I really don't miss living in dorms.

249
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:03,214
Speaker 1: Now if I get sick, I have I have my own bedroom I have my own bathroom and I can just call in sick to work.

250
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:10,360
Speaker 0: I'm glad I Don't vomit and my streak is is very very long of not vomiting.

251
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:15,755
Speaker 0: I'll get some Ipecac and but I but I do diarrhea if I got a problem in the stomach.

252
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,887
Speaker 1: the diarrhea as I am Well aware.

253
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:21,270
Speaker 0: Yep But I'd rather diarrhea vomit.

254
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,359
Speaker 1: I'm a hair trigger vomiter, but only what I'm sick.

255
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,650
Speaker 0: See the diarrhea doesn't really bother me.

256
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,353
Speaker 0: what bothers me is like the pain in the stomach I don't have like a bunch of gas like swelling up and hurting.

257
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,220
Speaker 0: then it's all good with diarrhea.

258
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,939
Speaker 1: So anyway, well get off of this tangent that you probably don't want to hear much about.

259
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:38,993
Speaker 0: bowels.

260
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,329
Speaker 1: Live in the dorms.

261
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,663
Speaker 0: I'd like to buy a stick Aside from that.

262
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:49,766
Speaker 0: Yep, basically because well you've got nothing to do You don't have to go outside.

263
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:50,970
Speaker 1: We're a whole bunch of geeks.

264
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,431
Speaker 0: You can?

265
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:58,017
Speaker 0: you basically would spend entire weekends in Peterson not which was the dorm he was in.

266
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:03,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, because this dorm had a lounge and this is the most fantastic lounge ever at least in terms of our IT.

267
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,453
Speaker 0: Well in our IT now most of the lounges are freaking dorms.

268
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get into that another time.

269
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:17,246
Speaker 1: But this lounge had this hump like this thing in it and it was covered in the carpet and Basically, that was the Dungeon Master throne.

270
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:20,275
Speaker 1: whenever we played D&D Alex our Dungeon Master would sit up there.

271
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,700
Speaker 0: It was perfect.

272
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really had to have been there.

273
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:31,480
Speaker 1: Mmm a lot of weekends We would just sit there and watch an entire anime like eska flown a or cowboy bebop just all in one go.

274
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,270
Speaker 0: We actually met a lot of our friends.

275
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,820
Speaker 1: that way we'd be what we were like one.

276
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,320
Speaker 1: We were watching right her friend Laura who actually she writes for gamers with jobs now.

277
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:51,840
Speaker 1: but we met her because we were watching tenku no eska flown a in marathon form and she walked by with some friends and saw it and Decided to sit there with us and watch the rest of it for the rest of the entire weekend.

278
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:57,740
Speaker 0: See now if I turned on a marathon of I don't know try gun.

279
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,506
Speaker 0: No one walks by here.

280
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,518
Speaker 0: No one would stop by our house and decide to be our friend.

281
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,352
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, they wouldn't see us crying because we all cried when we watched try gun.

282
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:15,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were all standing in Scott's room actually in the unrenovated Peterson dorm.

283
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:27,959
Speaker 1: all of us were standing around like eight people and we're watching a certain episode where a certain person has something bad happen to them as I avoid a spoiler and We're all crying and trying to hide the fact that we're crying from everyone else.

284
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:39,500
Speaker 0: That was a weird time when we were watching that because it was it wasn't in my dorm room Yeah, and like I was sitting there and people were sitting on the floor and then people started showing up randomly.

285
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,988
Speaker 1: Everyone was just standing there kind of crying.

286
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was real weird.

287
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,380
Speaker 0: I think my roommate was actually in the room.

288
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,260
Speaker 1: I remember him giving us a look of like what the fuck he was a soccer guy.

289
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:52,779
Speaker 0: That's all I remember about him as he was soccer guy.

290
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:57,700
Speaker 0: He liked to play soccer and I think he transferred out because he didn't get on the RIT soccer team.

291
00:22:58,861 --> 00:22:59,404
Speaker 1: See it's weird.

292
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,593
Speaker 1: a lot of it seems like a lot of people who went to school.

293
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:09,199
Speaker 1: they immediately at RIT At least they immediately become friends with their roommate and then they become friends with whatever like frat they join or whatever.

294
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:16,940
Speaker 1: We were other than one special exception didn't even really know the names of our roommates and we just found friends and hung out with them.

295
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:22,480
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I remember like, you know, I saw you guys at our way, you know, we talked there.

296
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:32,560
Speaker 0: But then I guess we all went to anime club a few times without seeing each other or noticing Yeah, but like I remember once I saw you in Gracie's and I just came up and I was like, oh those little guys

297
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,959
Speaker 1: I remember thinking hey, it's that guy who was super Jew

298
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:36,990
Speaker 0: Yeah and I went up and I said hey

299
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:38,379
Speaker 1: and I was like hey and

300
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,892
Speaker 0: Then I walked away because I didn't everything to say cuz they were just some guys.

301
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:48,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was you know It's weird to think I mean we're our whole group the front row crew and there's a lot of us.

302
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,197
Speaker 1: We're like family and it's it's amazing to think that it wasn't that long ago that we'd never.

303
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,000
Speaker 1: we didn't even know each other.

304
00:23:54,524 --> 00:24:02,664
Speaker 1: Yep, everyone in the group was just that guy We met like Greg who we used to be really good friends with was just that cool fuzzy-haired guy who like came around every Now and then

305
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,433
Speaker 0: yeah, he didn't Like I didn't even know he lives in the same floor as me until

306
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:07,896
Speaker 1: yeah

307
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:08,680
Speaker 0: a while.

308
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:18,377
Speaker 0: Just I would recognize, you know his face in it like there's a lot of people I don't know their name But like I see them and I go I know you because I see your face and I recognize it.

309
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,599
Speaker 0: and then you know Then Greg was one of those guys for like weeks and weeks and weeks.

310
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:29,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember we talked a lot about a counter-strike and funny otaku military stuff.

311
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,514
Speaker 1: Mmm I remember cop katsu is a kendo guy.

312
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:34,880
Speaker 1: He's another member of the crew.

313
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,315
Speaker 0: I actually met katsu before I met anyone else.

314
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:47,279
Speaker 0: Wow like I went into our wag and I went and I was carrying my battle tech box and katsu was standing there with his funny umbrella and we said something about battle tech.

315
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,187
Speaker 0: and Then Dwayne which you already discussed.

316
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,520
Speaker 0: aha Dwayne, but and then I saw you other fools.

317
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,913
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's all katsu before I saw anybody.

318
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:56,577
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay kind of weird.

320
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:04,534
Speaker 1: I Remember one of the first people I actually met that I was doing anything with.

321
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:05,920
Speaker 1: I was helping duck boy.

322
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:08,430
Speaker 1: We won't get into why he's called duck boy quack quack.

323
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:11,100
Speaker 1: If he's listening you proud doesn't even know that we called him duck boy.

324
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:13,950
Speaker 0: Oh, I am the dog from the land of friends.

325
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:14,513
Speaker 1: I don't know.

326
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,500
Speaker 1: actually I really don't know why we called him duck boy.

327
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:18,991
Speaker 0: You will cook me in the French man.

328
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,880
Speaker 1: Uh, why didn't we call him the Iron Chef?

329
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,195
Speaker 0: I think someone else said he looked like a duck or something.

330
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:24,798
Speaker 1: I don't know.

331
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:29,260
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I was helping him make a third edition Dungeons & Dragons character.

332
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:30,844
Speaker 0: He was a winner.

333
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:32,411
Speaker 1: Yeah winner was him.

334
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:39,153
Speaker 1: as in loser So many we I mean we just we had infinite free time.

335
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:40,279
Speaker 1: none of us had jobs.

336
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,650
Speaker 1: I Held a job for about two weeks and then I quit.

337
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:45,540
Speaker 0: I worked at Crossroads freshman year.

338
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember that it wasn't a bad gig.

339
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:54,799
Speaker 1: I remember when Crossroads opened It was this cafe that they decided to make on the other side of campus that we rarely ventured to.

340
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:09,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't really need to go over there if you're a freshman because it was as far away from the dorms as possible And it was like the farthest away academic building, which you didn't really go to unless you had You know crazy crazy classes out there.

341
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,416
Speaker 0: Yep, and freshman year.

342
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:14,269
Speaker 0: You don't really have crazy classes So they're mostly in the close buildings.

343
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,260
Speaker 1: freshman year classes are pretty much nothing.

344
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,509
Speaker 1: It was pretty much a non effort pass every class without even thinking.

345
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:27,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's I mean freaking freshman year my first quarter I got like a freaking four I think or something crazy like some crazy-ass high GPA.

346
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't do homework.

347
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:40,252
Speaker 1: every day at around six o'clock We'd all congregated Gracie's the giant campus freshman cafeteria aka like pig trough Yep, and we started out like my.

348
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,000
Speaker 0: I remember going to Gracie's in the early days.

349
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:50,411
Speaker 0: I'd be alone and I didn't know there was takeout so I'd sit there alone Yeah, and then it was like two people and then like four people.

350
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:50,872
Speaker 0: eventually

351
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:53,880
Speaker 1: we take up like an entire long table full of people

352
00:26:54,122 --> 00:27:03,067
Speaker 0: And then an entire long table and a half Yeah, and then when we find out the people sucked we kicked them out of the table and we were back down to like You know a half a table God.

353
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,271
Speaker 1: There was one guy.

354
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,580
Speaker 1: I remember he was really big into hentai.

355
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,227
Speaker 1: Yeah So much fans a hentai.

356
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,999
Speaker 0: No, we're definitely the anti hentai fan.

357
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:20,371
Speaker 1: now I don't mind if you like hentai, but I don't want you to tell me about it graphically constantly Yeah, especially if I didn't bring it up.

358
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:24,666
Speaker 0: and I mean like don't Get your hentai on me.

359
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,153
Speaker 1: Yeah, just keep it to yourself.

360
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:27,619
Speaker 1: get it on people who want to get it on them.

361
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:28,247
Speaker 0: I mean like.

362
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:35,700
Speaker 0: I don't even mind Being friends with someone who's like wacky religious or anything wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man.

363
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:40,745
Speaker 0: Just don't get your religion on me But this guy keep it to yourself.

364
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:41,989
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna pester you.

365
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:47,553
Speaker 1: luckily hentai guy was real distinctive real ugly God, it's just painful.

366
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:53,620
Speaker 0: even today I think he's actually lost weight But you see him at conventions now and then I'll point him out to you if you ever find me.

367
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,848
Speaker 0: But you just look at them and you go.

368
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,414
Speaker 0: damn that's an ugly guy.

369
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,120
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't want to look at him anymore.

370
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:08,700
Speaker 1: Our huge group would congregate in Gracie's and we'd be looking around Just to try to spot him and try to head it off and sit where he wouldn't see us.

371
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:12,554
Speaker 1: It was hard to do when you're a group of like 11 people.

372
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:20,522
Speaker 0: It worked a couple times Yeah, and we were often able to escape him like he'd show up and we leave and he couldn't leave because he had a plate Full of food.

373
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:24,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus we had a nice filter of only one of us had a car.

374
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:36,460
Speaker 0: So if we wanted to go anywhere or if we wanted to drop a bunch of people we just say oh Driving somewhere and we pick the people we wanted to keep get in the car drive a bit cover on back.

375
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:46,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't ever actually do that but we we'd like to go to a diner with the people we wanted to keep and then and then we come back and Actually a couple of times though.

376
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,172
Speaker 1: I can his car was great for that.

377
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:57,999
Speaker 1: But a couple of times we would honestly just Say like alright, we're all going to bed Let's go home and we'd all like go our separate ways and then reconvene an hour later somewhere else.

378
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:00,129
Speaker 0: I think we only did that a few times.

379
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,937
Speaker 1: Yeah, but those were critical times.

380
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:15,300
Speaker 0: Yeah Usually what would happen is we would you know, you'd be somewhere like anime club or Gracie's or something And then we'd walk back to the dorms and then we'd stop outside the dorm and talk for like an hour.

381
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,147
Speaker 0: Yep, it's kind of crazy.

382
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still think back to that.

383
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:19,697
Speaker 1: maybe freezing cold.

384
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,460
Speaker 1: We'd be standing out.

385
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,664
Speaker 0: It wasn't freezing cold yet.

386
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:23,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even it was cold.

387
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,672
Speaker 1: We still did it.

388
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:24,876
Speaker 1: We stand in like a lobby.

389
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,384
Speaker 1: No lobbies Yeah, but there was this.

390
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,430
Speaker 1: there's the thing we called it the thing.

391
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:35,855
Speaker 1: it was basically this big concrete thing That you could sit on or stand on.

392
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,879
Speaker 1: I guess it was a sculpture.

393
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:41,247
Speaker 0: imagine if it's like a Like a pyramid but it's got.

394
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:44,940
Speaker 0: you know, the whole thing is a stair but the stairs like two feet high.

395
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,289
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's a very good description or not.

396
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,454
Speaker 1: I don't think it really matter.

397
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:48,594
Speaker 1: Okay.

398
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:48,876
Speaker 0: Okay.

399
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 0: It looks like a diva hat.

400
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:52,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

401
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:55,419
Speaker 0: it's a diva hat a giant concrete diva hat.

402
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:56,723
Speaker 1: And it was weird.

403
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:59,231
Speaker 1: it got to the point where we became those guys.

404
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,920
Speaker 1: the guys were always hanging out at like this place.

405
00:30:02,664 --> 00:30:04,354
Speaker 0: Yep, we were the cool guys.

406
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:05,380
Speaker 1: We're those cool guys.

407
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,765
Speaker 1: We're all just standing there and people walk by like I want to stand on the thing But I can't.

408
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,138
Speaker 1: those guys are always there.

409
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,584
Speaker 0: We're too cool for you.

410
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:15,899
Speaker 1: if other people were there we'd walk over and we just kind of muscle our way in.

411
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,519
Speaker 1: you know with our geek leave muscles.

412
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,667
Speaker 1: No, we didn't well by muscle our way in.

413
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:27,927
Speaker 1: we just kind of stand around there and eventually the non geeks get uncomfortable and leave Suck or they'd be geeks and it'd be awesome.

414
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:28,529
Speaker 0: Yep.

415
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:29,592
Speaker 0: That's how you add people.

416
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:31,999
Speaker 1: it helped that RIT is a real geeky school.

417
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:42,219
Speaker 0: mmm, if you're a nerd or geek and You're looking for a school Even though RIT has its problems just like every other school.

418
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,031
Speaker 0: There's no place geeky or you can go god damn.

419
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,296
Speaker 0: You'll be freaking happy there.

420
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:57,914
Speaker 1: Let me tell you One of our favorite pastimes was we'd we'd wander around looking for places to Continue to hang out.

421
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:03,217
Speaker 1: So we'd be hanging out somewhere and then we'd get restless, but we didn't have anything to do.

422
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:09,960
Speaker 1: We had no money Yeah, so we'd start wandering around campus until we found like another room to hang out in.

423
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,439
Speaker 0: Oh the tunnels are full of rooms.

424
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,851
Speaker 1: Yeah The tunnels had a lot of old abandoned infrastructure like.

425
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:18,120
Speaker 1: there used to be a dance club down there that they shut down.

426
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,239
Speaker 1: There's just a big empty room.

427
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,585
Speaker 0: There used to be an arcade.

428
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,719
Speaker 0: that wasn't there anymore, but you can still see the painting on the wall that said arcade here.

429
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:29,597
Speaker 0: Yep, and there was still like pieces of paper like arcade hours, but there was no arcade.

430
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,314
Speaker 0: It was just a part.

431
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,738
Speaker 1: We busted into conference rooms just to play battle tech.

432
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,150
Speaker 0: Oh Battle tech you've eaten so many hours.

433
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,334
Speaker 0: I wish to play you again.

434
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:41,720
Speaker 1: Oh battle tech is fantastic.

435
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:46,979
Speaker 0: Oh my god, if you haven't played battle tech we should do a podcast on battle tech.

436
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:48,769
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we should.

437
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,540
Speaker 1: we just freakin wander around.

438
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:54,900
Speaker 1: We got caught by campus safety once because we were watered around late at night in the science building.

439
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this campus safety guy comes over.

440
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:58,720
Speaker 1: He's like what the hell are you guys doing?

441
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,580
Speaker 0: Well, the door was open and we just wanted to walk through because it was kind of cold outside.

442
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:06,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this campus safety guy comes in and he's like, what are you doing in the building?

443
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,680
Speaker 0: We're like, well the door was open.

444
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:12,160
Speaker 0: So we walk through the building to you know Go in that door and come out the door on the other side.

445
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,810
Speaker 0: So we'd be warm at least for that distance of the walk.

446
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:20,758
Speaker 0: and he's like, you know, the building's closed You can't be in here and we're like, oh But the door was open.

447
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:27,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know even though they often forget to lock doors and Actually, there were a lot of like.

448
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,755
Speaker 1: basically there were secret ways in.

449
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:38,591
Speaker 1: I don't know if they still work But there was basically a secret ways to get into any building on campus locked or not because of those tunnels Yep, but nowadays they lock the buildings much better.

450
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:41,120
Speaker 0: So yeah, you're not gonna get in quite as easily.

451
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:42,108
Speaker 1: It's actually sad.

452
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,580
Speaker 1: all the campus changed when we were freshmen.

453
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:48,217
Speaker 1: The dorms were open until 11 all the time till 11 the doors was unlocked.

454
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,020
Speaker 1: You could do whatever you want.

455
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,755
Speaker 0: They gave me a key to open like the doors of the whole dorms.

456
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:57,019
Speaker 1: I never used that key Yeah, unless we left late at night and you had to get back in somehow.

457
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:00,613
Speaker 0: Even so I even late at night, but that door was always open.

458
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:04,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you walk into Gracie's and yeah No, I would just walk into my dorm.

459
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,396
Speaker 1: My dorm was usually locked but I could get into the tunnels.

460
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:10,840
Speaker 0: nowadays I think they have like locks in the dorms then on the elevators.

461
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,953
Speaker 1: And yeah nowadays in RIT if you're in a freshman in the dorms You gotta put your key in the elevator to use the frickin elevator.

462
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:17,395
Speaker 0: Wow.

463
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:22,456
Speaker 1: Yeah And we also had our.

464
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:25,746
Speaker 1: we didn't do this that often but when we did it was most enjoyable.

465
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:33,870
Speaker 1: our zeppelin days It was sunny out because there are less sunny days in Rochester than there are in Seattle.

466
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,589
Speaker 0: They're less sunny days in Rochester than there are women at RIT.

467
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:48,141
Speaker 1: So our zeppelin days when it was warm enough out we'd lay on the quarter mile Which is like this path between the dorms and the academic side.

468
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,830
Speaker 0: Well, it actually went through the academic side.

469
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,370
Speaker 1: So yeah, let's say it connected them and then it continued through the academic and that was the extra quarter of mile.

470
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:02,410
Speaker 1: So we'd lay there with a boombox playing zeppelin shirtless just kind of sunbathing or tossing a ball around.

471
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:09,212
Speaker 1: We're really the only ones who did something like that and a lot of people gave us weird looks but no one ever really said Anything to.

472
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:15,882
Speaker 0: yeah, you had if you wanted to be out on the quarter mile, you had to have a frisbee or something You know, you couldn't just lay out there with music.

473
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,678
Speaker 0: people would be like what the hell you're not working You know, what are you doing?

474
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's going on?

475
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,629
Speaker 1: I remember we'd see all those people like furiously studying and we just kind of laugh at him.

476
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,396
Speaker 0: I never understood that.

477
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,789
Speaker 0: I mean look I graduated I didn't furiously study ever.

478
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,389
Speaker 0: What were they doing?

479
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,013
Speaker 0: What were they doing?

480
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:34,542
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

481
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:35,467
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

482
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,833
Speaker 0: Hey, dude Ah Freshman year was good.

483
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:45,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the moral here is don't squander your freshman year of college.

484
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,464
Speaker 1: That's the most fun for the least responsibility.

485
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:49,447
Speaker 1: You're ever gonna have.

486
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:54,909
Speaker 0: I Think the moral is be one of the people who has diarrhea and not vomit when you get sick.

487
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:59,392
Speaker 0: Cuz vomiting really sucks All right.

488
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,060
Speaker 1: So well, we'll tell some more stories another time.

489
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:11,730
Speaker 1: That was a very tiny slice of our life at RIT Mm-hmm, but to move into some meta bits this podcast was kind of blab because Scott's all tired and he won't really talk.

490
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,298
Speaker 0: Hey, I did just.

491
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,404
Speaker 0: you know, what do you want from me?

492
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:19,349
Speaker 0: Don't be so tired okay, so You better.

493
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, what what what?

494
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:22,737
Speaker 1: what are you gonna say?

495
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,181
Speaker 1: You're too tired even argue.

496
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:27,130
Speaker 0: I've has blame on to you with some words.

497
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:31,757
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway We got a little meta bit.

498
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:36,190
Speaker 0: The first meta bit is that we're looking for Audio feedback.

499
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:44,634
Speaker 0: Other podcasts have audio feedback where people call in or send, you know mp3s of themselves Saying something.

500
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:53,006
Speaker 0: so and as opposed to sending us an email with feedback You record yourself saying the feedback and send it to us now.

501
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:53,870
Speaker 1: How does this sound?

502
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:58,576
Speaker 1: We have a specific kind of feedback not really feedback But a specific thing.

503
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:00,688
Speaker 1: if you guys are gonna take advantage of this that we'd like you to do.

504
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:07,350
Speaker 1: We were thinking about doing a show about the podcast or about us like specifically why we do this who we are or whatever.

505
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:13,237
Speaker 1: We decided all these I decided just now Instead of interviewing each other.

506
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,501
Speaker 0: or what a democratic system.

507
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:15,504
Speaker 1: How about this?

508
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,110
Speaker 1: you guys interview us?

509
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,270
Speaker 1: Send us audio questions and we'll set it up to where you the listeners interview us one day.

510
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,203
Speaker 1: Once we have enough questions do a whole show.

511
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:25,169
Speaker 0: that could be pretty cool.

512
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:26,413
Speaker 0: Now there's two ways.

513
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:38,970
Speaker 0: number one you just record yourself make an mp3 or a wav file or something and email it as an attachment or Put it on the web and email a link to that location any kind of technology way.

514
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:43,930
Speaker 0: Yeah to geek nights at gmail.com and in the subject put audio feedback.

515
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:58,863
Speaker 0: The other way you can leave us audio feedback is we have a voicemail box and the way this works is you call this phone number and you leave a voicemail and We will get an email with your voicemail as an attachment and we can use that.

516
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:15,510
Speaker 0: the phone number you can call is 1 5 3 7. that's 206 3 3 3 1 5 3 7.

517
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,133
Speaker 1: Outstanding.

518
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:20,209
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go use that little program on the internet that tells me what words I can make with those numbers.

519
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:27,041
Speaker 1: But Yeah, so interview us ask us whatever you want.

520
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:31,616
Speaker 1: no quite no question is out of bounds though You may not get a serious answer.

521
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:37,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, and If we don't like your question, we are in no way obligated to actually use it.

522
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, or we might just make fun of you.

523
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:40,703
Speaker 0: Like if you just call in and go.

524
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,270
Speaker 0: blaga blaga blaga blaga.

525
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:47,777
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll probably play it but oh Yeah, identify yourself.

526
00:37:47,858 --> 00:38:00,945
Speaker 1: I don't you know in some way like hi, I'm or hi, I'm Fred yeah, and don't make it too long because Yeah, verbosity is not what we're after here.

527
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:07,610
Speaker 0: Yep Not but if your verbosity is high-quality Yes, I go from penny arcade.

528
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:09,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, go for it.

529
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:13,489
Speaker 1: But I had to quote some words of wisdom.

530
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:18,906
Speaker 1: People who don't understand analogy shouldn't make them and people who don't understand big words should not use them.

531
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:19,467
Speaker 0: Mmm.

532
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:20,290
Speaker 0: All right.

533
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:29,689
Speaker 0: In addition, I hate asking for like votes cuz you know They had their web pages where you vote for things and then they go up in the list.

534
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:34,755
Speaker 0: but I kind of Everyone else asks for votes.

535
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:51,970
Speaker 0: So if you go to podcast alley calm and vote for us then that means our link will like appear higher up and people will see it and That's a good way that you can get more people to listen to us Even if you don't have any other people to tell

536
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:53,533
Speaker 1: The girl.

537
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:55,909
Speaker 1: of course only do this if you actually think where we deserve it.

538
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you think we suck don't freakin vote for us.

539
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:04,498
Speaker 0: God Of course In even better ways to just tell your friends.

540
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, or spread the word on other forms.

541
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,354
Speaker 1: I'm very happy.

542
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:17,770
Speaker 1: listenership has been rising steadily from the moment We started at a very steady and predictable rate, which is kind of scary and kind of cool at the same time.

543
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,905
Speaker 0: Yep, also our forums are quite hopping.
