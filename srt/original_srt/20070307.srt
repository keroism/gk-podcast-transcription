1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,288
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 7th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,211
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,358
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,737
Speaker 0: tonight We review our comic book for a change with why are you doing this?

5
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:20,540
Speaker 0: by Jason?

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:23,450
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:30,809
Speaker 1: Say order this laptop, and I ordered it in the middle of February And it finally shipped.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,690
Speaker 0: granted the fact that it took that long even ship I probably would have canceled my order at that point.

9
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:39,346
Speaker 1: They still haven't taken any of my money So I'm not complaining yet.

10
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,880
Speaker 1: I might get a free laptop because they're in so incompetent.

11
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:45,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz well when I went to Katsu card.

12
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:48,214
Speaker 0: They didn't bill me for the hotel until just now.

13
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:49,618
Speaker 1: Oh wow really.

14
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:50,280
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually when I charge something on my credit card.

16
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:56,320
Speaker 1: I see it in like a couple days this I charged on my credit card.

17
00:00:56,822 --> 00:01:00,178
Speaker 1: It shipped, and it's still not on my credit card at all.

18
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,600
Speaker 1: so anyway It came by ups and they gave me no choice in choosing my method of shipping.

19
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,859
Speaker 1: You know they basically said we're shipping it to you.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,140
Speaker 1: I mean I could have paid for super fast shipping or slow shipping, but I didn't have any other choices.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,367
Speaker 1: I couldn't choose US Postal Service.

22
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,510
Speaker 1: I couldn't choose FedEx.

23
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,858
Speaker 1: It was pretty much as ups period.

24
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,688
Speaker 1: they didn't even let me know It was ups it was.

25
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,340
Speaker 1: all I knew is that it was being shipped.

26
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:25,839
Speaker 1: I didn't know it was ups until it you know arrived, and you know what it.

27
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:34,516
Speaker 1: It hasn't arrived because they marked it to be Only allowed to be delivered if it is signed in person.

28
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:40,678
Speaker 0: now that alone I wouldn't really complain about because it is a very expensive piece of equipment in a very small box.

29
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,291
Speaker 0: and well We live in an area where there's almost no crime.

30
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:47,009
Speaker 0: I can think of a lot of places I have lived where I would not want anything.

31
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:48,716
Speaker 0: I had ordered sitting out in public.

32
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:54,680
Speaker 1: that is true You know I even though you know we have never had anything stolen off the porch.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:02,900
Speaker 1: And we get packages very often with very expensive goods in them, and they just sit outside, but until we get home They've never been stolen.

34
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,579
Speaker 1: But I still worry just a little bit that it's not gonna be there when I get home.

35
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,890
Speaker 1: So a laptop that cost almost $2,000.

36
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,919
Speaker 1: of course I would worry about leaving it on the porch.

37
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:27,120
Speaker 1: however because of the way UPS delivers packages and because I Actually go to work and make enough money to buy things There is no way I can get this package without skipping out on work.

38
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,003
Speaker 0: Yeah Think of this.

39
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:38,519
Speaker 0: they'll only deliver between whenever they start in the morning Which is long after either of us would have gone to work and like 630 or 7 Which is pretty much right as we're getting home.

40
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:51,420
Speaker 1: So unless there's a guarantee that they will show up at 7 and I rush home as fast as I possibly can like to get One earlier train there's no guarantee that anyone will be in the house to sign the package.

41
00:02:51,961 --> 00:03:01,419
Speaker 1: not every house in the United States has a family with someone staying at home or a butler or Losers who don't have jobs.

42
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:02,905
Speaker 1: People go to work.

43
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,820
Speaker 1: houses are usually empty on any weekday for most of the day.

44
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,239
Speaker 0: Well even worse is when you call them to try and just drive to the UPS store and pick it up.

45
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:18,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so I can go to the UPS store to pick it up between Monday and Friday 1 p.m.. And 7 p.m..

46
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:20,319
Speaker 0: Wow that's great.

47
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,140
Speaker 1: Yeah I have to do it.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,380
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna have to leave work early tomorrow And then drive like 20 minutes to Poughkeepsie to this UPS place because it's not just any UPS store.

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,260
Speaker 1: They don't just leave it at the nearest UPS store because this is a pretty close UPS store.

50
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,226
Speaker 1: It's like 10 minutes away.

51
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,760
Speaker 1: No it has to be a UPS shipping center.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,446
Speaker 1: You know they can't bring it to a nearby UPS store or leave it at your local post office Which is five minutes away?

53
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:47,900
Speaker 1: No they have to frickin and there's no way.

54
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,874
Speaker 1: I can't tell them I don't care about a signature.

55
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,300
Speaker 1: leave it on my porch anyway.

56
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,828
Speaker 1: I can't tell them that they will not accept that there is no way They will leave it on the porch.

57
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,280
Speaker 0: see if I were you.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,170
Speaker 0: But maybe it's just because when my ire is drawn.

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,920
Speaker 0: I am much more likely to follow through with it.

60
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:15,318
Speaker 0: I probably would have canceled my order and told the laptop company Exactly why I canceled my order because they didn't give me an option in shipping and the company they chose to ship it could not Deliver it to me without me leaving work.

61
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:33,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I that's the reason I chose to go to the UPS place as opposed to just coming home early and scheduling a delivery after I Got home is because number one at least this way I'm guaranteed to you know not have the delivery guy show up five minutes before I get home and B I can raise a stink when I go there like this is BS.

62
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 1: Don't you realize people have fucking jobs?

63
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,846
Speaker 1: What the fuck is wrong with you?

64
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,100
Speaker 1: They should deliver seriously.

65
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:45,007
Speaker 1: UPS should deliver packages to houses between 5 p.m.

66
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,480
Speaker 1: And 10 p.m UPS guy doesn't have to work all day.

67
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,204
Speaker 1: Let the UPS guy stay home and do nothing all day and that he works five to ten because guess what as the only time His job is useful.

68
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,676
Speaker 0: Well unless you're delivering to businesses.

69
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,638
Speaker 1: So the business delivery guys do it during the day so the home delivery guys do it night.

71
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:03,044
Speaker 0: now Why do that?

72
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:14,453
Speaker 0: it costs a lot more money when you could just do what they do now because people like us are still the Minority and they're not gonna make any more money by Catering to you and me and the five other people who care about this.

73
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,140
Speaker 0: most people are gonna use UPS anyway.

74
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,783
Speaker 0: They don't care well.

75
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:30,725
Speaker 1: I can tell you this even though FedEx often costs more money FedEx has never actually given me a problem because even when FedEx has a thing that says We're a signature required the guy has always left it on the porch for me And it's never been stolen.

76
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,196
Speaker 1: and they always get stuff to me a lot faster than UPS does.

77
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:38,074
Speaker 1: so for now on I'm paying the extra money for FedEx if it's an option.

78
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:41,496
Speaker 1: if it's not an option I'm gonna complain to whoever didn't give me the option.

79
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:51,278
Speaker 1: yeah But I just don't see this changing anytime soon because no one cares, but you yeah well It still sucks and there needs to be a solution for it because it's a big problem in that.

80
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,600
Speaker 1: Peep you know the kind of people like not a big problem.

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,769
Speaker 0: It's only a problem for a very small minority of people.

82
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:10,540
Speaker 1: but the thing is the people who are Likely to buy more likely to buy things on the internet and thus more likely to need shipping are people who are more likely To not be home to get those packages, but you know what they keep buying the stuff anyway.

83
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,379
Speaker 0: So there's no incentive for anyone to change their business model.

84
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:29,260
Speaker 0: The worst thing is when we had that old TV And we wanted to get rid of it there was no way for us to get rid of that TV and There were a bunch of people we could pay to come and pick the TV up and not a single one of them would come Outside of the hours of 9 to 5 and they wouldn't come in on weekends.

85
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:39,600
Speaker 0: So there was absolutely no way for us to legally dispose of our television without one of us taking a day off work It's and you know how many days off work am I gonna get here?

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,509
Speaker 0: It's like well I'm not gonna take a day off work for that.

87
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:47,750
Speaker 0: when I can take a day off work to be at the beach I know seriously it's just fucked up in that.

88
00:06:48,111 --> 00:07:04,140
Speaker 1: you know in other countries people get a lot more days off work or they have like siestas or tea or bunches And things like that where they have time off of work often That they can use to conduct the date the business of their personal lives.

89
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,490
Speaker 1: You know go to a doctor's appointment or the dentist.

90
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,991
Speaker 1: or you know take do some maintenance on your car All these things that you have to do.

91
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:12,138
Speaker 0: I get plenty of days off.

92
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:17,900
Speaker 0: for all that I get a month of vacation plus my holidays plus my long-term sip sick, which is totally separate.

93
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:21,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, most people don't get all that in this crazy country.

94
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:25,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, even then that's nothing compared to what you should be getting which is like three months of vacation.

95
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:35,144
Speaker 1: Yes, the problem is that has a lot of ramifications for our economy Except for the fact that you would probably do just as much work no matter how much vacation They gave you.

96
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,414
Speaker 0: no because most people wouldn't?

97
00:07:37,783 --> 00:07:40,837
Speaker 1: Those people don't deserve to work or have money or have houses.

98
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:41,420
Speaker 0: all right.

99
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,658
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into argument with this with you because you probably haven't thought this through at all, but anyway UPS sucks.

100
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:55,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, luckily this doesn't affect me at all because when I buy things that are more expensive than a few hundred dollars I usually buy them in person.

101
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,693
Speaker 1: There's no way to buy this laptop in person or from any other company.

102
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 1: There's only one way to obtain it.

103
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,879
Speaker 0: Well, this problem only affects you so I can't really say that I care very much.

104
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:10,597
Speaker 1: There might be other products you want in the future that are only obtainable from one source.

105
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:14,032
Speaker 0: Not really I'm kind of a skin flint and I don't buy I've.

106
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,860
Speaker 0: I never buy a laptop so it won't matter.

107
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,151
Speaker 1: You don't buy anything so you really don't count.

108
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,739
Speaker 0: I spend all my money on food and books and things.

109
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,587
Speaker 1: yeah I buy food and books and other things also.

110
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:25,851
Speaker 0: I buy a lot more food.

111
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:35,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever okay, so in the news Alright, my news is spoilerific if you care about underwear pervert comics Whatever.

112
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:39,320
Speaker 0: It was on all the main news, so it's not a spoiler.

113
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,697
Speaker 1: This is why it's my news because all the underwear pervert fans were like OMG.

114
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:48,472
Speaker 1: Why is the mainstream news always spoiling our comics?

115
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,160
Speaker 1: for us like don't go to yahoo.com?

116
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,066
Speaker 1: It's on the front page.

117
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:53,134
Speaker 1: everybody don't go there.

118
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:53,920
Speaker 1: There's a spoiler?

119
00:08:54,803 --> 00:09:00,098
Speaker 0: Well, maybe because the comic industry well the underwear pervert industry because indie comics don't do this.

120
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:09,344
Speaker 0: obviously They use character deaths as a means of promoting their products because it means that whenever they kill a big character They'll get into the media.

121
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:12,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz okay, so let's spoil it right now.

122
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,420
Speaker 1: They killed Captain America.

123
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,487
Speaker 0: OMG probably temporarily.

124
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:19,719
Speaker 0: they admitted straight up that it's not unlikely that he won't come back.

125
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:32,084
Speaker 1: We should just start a betting pool Where if you like guess the month where he's coming back you win like a hundred bucks And if you guess the exact comic and issue he comes back you win like the whole Jackpot, but see

126
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:38,079
Speaker 0: no one would bother because there's a much easier way to win a hundred bucks by betting getting Dave and Joel to attempt to beat us at air hot.

127
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:40,391
Speaker 1: Anyway.

128
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,106
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's pretty stupid.

129
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:49,440
Speaker 1: it shows that superhero comics really don't have anything going for them.

130
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:59,799
Speaker 1: You know especially like if you read the stories the mainstream media is writing about it They're pretty like they're showing their contempt for the superhero comics that we also have.

131
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:03,837
Speaker 1: It's like uh most people think this is pretty stupid.

132
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:04,460
Speaker 1: They don't care.

133
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:14,654
Speaker 1: It's just that the there are certain superheroes who are also happen to be sort of these national icons in a way that a lot of characters are like.

134
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:23,460
Speaker 0: you know Snoopy or Garfield or Lots of care Mickey Mouse, and you know see other than the spider-man other than the x-men and a few of the DC guys.

135
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,080
Speaker 0: I really can't name many underwear perverts anyway.

136
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:27,448
Speaker 1: I can't name that many either.

137
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,660
Speaker 1: compared to you know underwear pervert fans.

138
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,208
Speaker 1: I can pretty much name the major guys, and that's it

139
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:36,982
Speaker 0: if I start throwing around semi random combinations of words colors And it's

140
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:43,111
Speaker 1: almost guaranteed you're gonna name something especially if it's like blank man blank woman super something

141
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:46,567
Speaker 0: flash man Bottle man fat man,

142
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,132
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's a fat man.

143
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,700
Speaker 0: There's got to be a fat man captain something.

144
00:10:51,161 --> 00:11:06,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, captain man, but anyway it just shows how shallow and lame Superhero comics are yet again where the only way they can sell anything is by Killing off iconic characters, and then they bring them back because without the iconic character.

145
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:07,859
Speaker 1: They have nothing to sell.

146
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,676
Speaker 0: yeah I mean when died at the end of No there wasn't a press release.

147
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:20,701
Speaker 0: no anime company was like guess who died an episode People just get the story, and there's no media circus.

148
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,950
Speaker 0: anytime a major character dies, or there's a plot development.

149
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,025
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we just we think it's dumb.

150
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:28,929
Speaker 1: We don't like it.

151
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,824
Speaker 1: This is why we don't buy those comics or read them or condone reading them.

152
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, not to say that we don't read comics.

153
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:40,970
Speaker 0: I mean We're finally due to popular demand reviewing a comic again tonight because I finally got rimmed to read one.

154
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:46,310
Speaker 0: Also our friend I don't reminded us when we were talking about how all comic convention on the East Coast suck.

155
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:48,480
Speaker 0: Mocha doesn't suck in fact.

156
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,323
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome.

157
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:50,670
Speaker 1: Didn't we mention mocha?

158
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,017
Speaker 0: I think we mentioned the San Diego comic-con.

159
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,241
Speaker 1: I think I don't know.

160
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:56,650
Speaker 1: I remember saying something about mocha in a recent episode.

161
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,994
Speaker 1: I don't remember what or when.

162
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,345
Speaker 0: probably we were talking about an artist or dr.. McNinja or something.

163
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:01,767
Speaker 0: I don't know.

164
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:02,830
Speaker 1: maybe whatever.

165
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, mocha.

166
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:09,630
Speaker 1: There's the Museum of comics with a car cartoon comics and cartoon art which is in New York City.

167
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:16,181
Speaker 1: I think he used to be in Florida I don't remember But it's a pretty cool museum and every year they have many events.

168
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:19,229
Speaker 1: one of those events is the comic festival.

169
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,369
Speaker 0: granted There's almost no underwear perverts at it and the people who attend and the people who?

170
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,790
Speaker 0: Well attend as guests are generally a very different crowd.

171
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:39,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much all indie comics and webcomics people all hanging out having a good time And you're just gonna see awesome stuff there And you're not gonna see too many underwear perverts.

172
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,150
Speaker 0: it also doesn't cost a lot of money compared to what you get.

173
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:54,755
Speaker 1: It's also of course it does only take a few hours to see everything there But you can spend a lot of time talking to people and hanging out with cool people and not being scared by Nerdy people.

174
00:12:55,156 --> 00:13:01,197
Speaker 0: also, it's in a lively part of New York City as opposed to at the Javits So there's stuff around.

175
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:02,202
Speaker 1: yeah, cuz it doesn't need.

176
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:06,168
Speaker 1: it's not big enough to fit into a Jeff It's it doesn't need to be there.

177
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:17,910
Speaker 0: But anyway speaking of Manhattan last weekend Emily And I went to the children's film festival in New York City where we saw the American premiere of Toki wo kakaru Shojo aka the girl who leapt through time.

178
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:26,300
Speaker 0: It's an anime movie directed by Mamoru Hosoda, and it's very much about what the title Would lead you to believe.

179
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,782
Speaker 0: it is about a girl who for various reasons Acquires the ability to jump a little bit backwards in time.

180
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:35,750
Speaker 0: It was really really cool.

181
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:43,470
Speaker 0: I very much enjoyed it and if any of you live anywhere near New York City I'd highly recommend that you attend the New York Children's Film Festival.

182
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:56,330
Speaker 0: But we only went to see this movie and the short before it just because it was actually difficult to get tickets to anything And we didn't really realize we were gonna go until fairly shortly before just to see this film.

183
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,981
Speaker 1: Well, it's a children's film festival.

184
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,330
Speaker 1: Is this like a children's movie?

185
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,152
Speaker 0: Well, no I mean they.

186
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,476
Speaker 0: it's a children's film festival.

187
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:14,270
Speaker 0: bring your children to it and it has shorts aimed at various ages of children ranging from Little kids to young adults and this is an anime That's light-hearted enough even though it is kind of dark at times to be shown at a festival for children.

188
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:16,009
Speaker 0: It's a just a generally good movie.

189
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:16,954
Speaker 1: How come like?

190
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:20,150
Speaker 1: no one heard about this movie and I never heard of it.

191
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:21,057
Speaker 0: You'd heard of it.

192
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:32,450
Speaker 0: Emily talked about it a lot And then we both talked about it quite a bit when we got back from seeing it and we talked about it when you Went to see it and she told you about it specifically after she saw it over the summer.

193
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:38,010
Speaker 1: I don't remember that all right, but yeah, it wasn't unlike any anime news or anything like that.

194
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,316
Speaker 0: There was brave story.

195
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,561
Speaker 1: really brave story.

196
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,389
Speaker 1: was there a little bit on the news.

197
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,370
Speaker 1: It was just a tiny bit, but this one was like non-existent.

198
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:49,386
Speaker 0: Well, this is very much a better movie than that and I highly recommend it.

199
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:57,870
Speaker 1: Yeah It's kind of weird though how like anime used to be all about anime movies like remember in the 90s like almost every anime You saw was an anime movie.

200
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,610
Speaker 0: Well part of that was that a movie is a lot easier to promote because it's a single unified thing.

201
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,918
Speaker 0: You could throw it as one thing sell it as one thing.

202
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,130
Speaker 0: you don't need people to buy in or continue wanting it.

203
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,623
Speaker 0: You only need them to buy in once immediately and once they've bought it.

204
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:12,527
Speaker 0: You don't care anymore.

205
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:18,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true But nowadays, I mean the rate of anime movie production hasn't really declined.

206
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:23,962
Speaker 1: They make quite a few anime movies every year at least a handful But we're not seeing as many of them brought over.

207
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,710
Speaker 1: I mean the Miyazaki's always make it over.

208
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,029
Speaker 0: What movies aren't we seeing coming over then?

209
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:37,270
Speaker 0: Brave story this one any other anime movie made in recent years And I'm sure that both of these are gonna be released on DVD over here eventually.

210
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,819
Speaker 1: I don't know man.

211
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,610
Speaker 1: There's barely any talk about them.

212
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,675
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, whenever even the lowliest new anime series that's on TV like that's on the two in the morning in Japan It's a shit ton of coverage.

213
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:51,886
Speaker 0: movies probably also cost a lot more to license I'd imagine.

214
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,387
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I wonder what that's a good good point there.

215
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:59,970
Speaker 0: Well too bad We can't find out because the American anime companies will not talk about anything ever.

216
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I would be interested to find out.

217
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:07,890
Speaker 1: you know I mean, you know, we kind of know we're how much it costs to license an episode of an anime.

218
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,218
Speaker 1: I wonder how much it costs to license a movie.

219
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,522
Speaker 1: That's hmm.

220
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,710
Speaker 0: But yeah, this movie is really really good.

221
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:13,931
Speaker 0: The.

222
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,315
Speaker 0: the animation is beautiful.

223
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,381
Speaker 0: The characters are extremely well done.

224
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,410
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it very very much.

225
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,130
Speaker 0: I would probably put it in my top 10 anime movie list.

226
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,529
Speaker 0: I got to think a little bit more and I'd like to see it one more time.

227
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:29,767
Speaker 0: But if you get a chance to see this you find a torrent or it comes out on DVD.

228
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:30,410
Speaker 0: pick it up.

229
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,007
Speaker 0: It is so worth it.

230
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:46,828
Speaker 1: Yeah We should definitely Keep track of what anime movies are coming out so we can spread the word because no one else seems to be doing so things of the day.

231
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:52,550
Speaker 0: So yesterday I had this kind of tutorial video about super dodgeball for the NES.

232
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,020
Speaker 0: Well, I had another thing for the thing.

233
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,270
Speaker 0: today like I often do just before the show I look on dig and I saw something so compelling that I just had to share this with the world.

234
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:07,790
Speaker 0: Now it was a video purporting a trick to pad out research papers or any sort of paper.

235
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:13,109
Speaker 0: You're writing for a class in college high school middle school, whatever, you know, I gotta say something.

236
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:20,250
Speaker 1: I went through elementary school middle school high school and five years of college and I had to write many papers.

237
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:24,670
Speaker 1: I think the longest one I was ever as to write was I think maybe ten pages.

238
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:35,770
Speaker 1: Really yes, and I I never had a problem Writing that many pages or more and I never used any silly tricks to extend the length of the paper.

239
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,216
Speaker 1: You know to be more pages.

240
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,624
Speaker 1: besides, you know writing more I did once.

241
00:17:41,884 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 0: I had a 15 page paper as a research paper.

242
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:50,481
Speaker 0: I forget what it was, but something to do with Propaganda and that sort of thing like controlling the media.

243
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:57,823
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what it was, but I wrote a really good paper Except it was about a page short and there was nothing I wanted to add to the paper.

244
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:05,210
Speaker 0: So I made the margins on 16th of an inch bigger on both sides and that made it the requisite number of pages.

245
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:20,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also don't want to start a big debate about this but it is my opinion that requiring any particular length on papers is sort of silly and Teachers should just read your paper and determine if what you said was intelligent and complete.

246
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,617
Speaker 0: Yes, I might give a guide like.

247
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,827
Speaker 0: I expect this paper to be around 15 pages.

248
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:33,955
Speaker 1: I mean obviously if you hand in one page that you probably didn't say enough or maybe it's you just single-spaced Font-sized forward it.

249
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:34,777
Speaker 0: that's true.

250
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:37,947
Speaker 1: You might have done that in which case I can't read it.

251
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,815
Speaker 1: You better Do something about that.

252
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:44,450
Speaker 0: Well, first off I probably wouldn't accept papers except an electronic format.

253
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:46,376
Speaker 0: Anyway, and an non.

254
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:48,543
Speaker 1: it would be an open format only.

255
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,510
Speaker 1: I wouldn't accept no word doc files.

256
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,720
Speaker 0: Well, if you wouldn't accept no word doc files the I know right?

257
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna be accepting and grading papers sometime in the near future.

258
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:04,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I saw this video the guy purporting like I'm gonna tell you how to pad out your papers.

259
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,150
Speaker 0: I expected this to be some crap, you know make the margins bigger.

260
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:16,521
Speaker 1: I thought it was gonna be some cool thing where Like he has a script that looks at the words in your paper and goes on Wikipedia and grab some random Sentences and tosses a man or something like that.

261
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:25,801
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no no This kid was actually pretty clever and he doesn't just tell you how to do it straight up He tells you how to do it in the same kind of documentary.

262
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,426
Speaker 0: How-to tutorial style.

263
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:28,570
Speaker 0: is that dodgeball thing?

264
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:36,606
Speaker 0: and the actual technique he uses is basically to take all the you know 12-point font periods.

265
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:44,910
Speaker 0: you've got and Up them to 14 and it'll give you quite a bit of padding without making any noticeable change to the paper.

266
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean already there are things.

267
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,750
Speaker 1: see I said I never used any tricks to make the paper longer.

268
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,370
Speaker 1: That's true because you're supposed to have such in like one inch margins.

269
00:19:55,732 --> 00:20:04,087
Speaker 1: You're supposed to have a 12-point Times New Roman font double space You're supposed to double space it and you're supposed to put two spaces after every period.

270
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:14,210
Speaker 0: by the way By the way to all of you in the forums They're only like four or five of you that do this but put two spaces between your sentences not why?

271
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,474
Speaker 1: Paragraphs not sentences.

272
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,059
Speaker 0: No between sentences.

273
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:18,965
Speaker 1: Oh after the periods.

274
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:19,587
Speaker 1: Yeah.

275
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:19,687
Speaker 1: Yeah.

276
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:22,449
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought okay Never mind, not to carriage returns.

277
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,648
Speaker 1: Yes, you want to put two returns between the paragraphs because putting just one makes it hard to read on the Internet's.

278
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:31,901
Speaker 0: of course I've always done that in any paper I've ever written for the most part.

279
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,770
Speaker 0: I never used standard indentation rules.

280
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 0: I always use business style block notation or block paragraphs.

281
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always in debt on you.

282
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:44,570
Speaker 1: normally when I'm writing I do the the block type stuff on like on the Internet's.

283
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,168
Speaker 1: But when I wrote papers for school, I indented the first line by like a half inch or so.

284
00:20:49,858 --> 00:21:00,993
Speaker 1: But yeah increasing the size of all the periods the 14 point when your font is 12 point will Be not noticeable to the eye unless it's a trained Typographical person.

285
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:06,449
Speaker 0: and even then I mean he shows the zoom in and he goes into great detail and there's almost no way this would be noticed.

286
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:18,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a teacher once who claimed that they were like an editor of a newspaper and our printer and they knew all This shit so that if you fooled around they could tell just by looking at it.

287
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:21,438
Speaker 1: I'm sure yeah I didn't really believe them so much.

288
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:28,422
Speaker 1: All right my thing of the day It's actually it's sort of an advertisement for someone that I've never spoken to.

289
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:31,510
Speaker 1: so it's basically I'm just chilling for no reason.

290
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:42,110
Speaker 1: Some company named digital meme who I've never heard of is putting out a for DVD set called the Japanese anime classic collection.

291
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:54,054
Speaker 1: It's coming out April 27 supposedly It's an all region set with you know, it obviously has Japanese dialogue, but the subtitles are English Japanese Chinese and Korean.

292
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:55,798
Speaker 1: it's NTSC only.

293
00:21:55,879 --> 00:22:05,068
Speaker 1: So if you live somewhere with pal, you're probably not gonna be able to watch it without a converter and It's gonna be like a hundred and ten dollars or so and you can pre-order it now.

294
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,338
Speaker 1: now What is on this DVD you ask?

295
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:13,514
Speaker 1: Well, it basically has the oldest anime Possible.

296
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:23,780
Speaker 1: I look the oldest anime on here is from 1928. it's called Tyree Tairiki Taro no mucha Shugyo.

297
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,750
Speaker 0: So basically it's a collection of early Japanese animation.

298
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:35,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, the latest anime on there is like 1950 and there are some that they don't know when they're from and I think there are 55 Anime in total.

299
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,379
Speaker 1: some of them are silent movies.

300
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,510
Speaker 1: some of them have like a narrator like reading things.

301
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,792
Speaker 1: I guess if you I don't know maybe some anime if you went to see them in the theater and like the 30s of the 40s.

302
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:47,816
Speaker 1: there were narrators there.

303
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,830
Speaker 0: I have a feeling we'll be buying this and then reviewing it.

304
00:22:50,913 --> 00:23:04,766
Speaker 1: Yeah They also have some on there that are what are known as Gramophone talkies where in addition to sending the film to the movie theater They would send a record to the movie theater and they would start the film and a gramophone player separately.

305
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:06,110
Speaker 1: at the same time.

306
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:14,410
Speaker 1: They basically what these people have done is taken those gramophone records and the film Synchronized them and now you can watch them on a DVD with the audio.

307
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:19,170
Speaker 0: But see now the P. the purists will be mad because you got to have in the original format.

308
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,930
Speaker 0: You got to have the vinyl and the gramophone and the film.

309
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:30,057
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's not the authentic experience and you have to say you won't get the full panning through the center channel And you have to sit there and play with.

310
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,844
Speaker 1: you have to actually go buy a gramophone.

311
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,349
Speaker 1: a regular turntable won't do.

312
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:40,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just you know, it doesn't look like this is gonna bring, you know hours upon hours of entertainment.

313
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:48,770
Speaker 1: I mean, you know as much as I love steamboat Willie It's really not that entertaining these days even though I really really like it.

314
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:50,013
Speaker 0: I don't know steamboat.

315
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,739
Speaker 0: Itchy is always good to watch steamboat.

316
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:53,564
Speaker 1: Itchy is fantastic with steamboat Willie.

317
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:54,146
Speaker 1: Not so much.

318
00:23:54,948 --> 00:24:07,030
Speaker 1: So watching these watching these is gonna be a lot more entertaining in the Historical documentary type fashion that it will be in the anime watching fashion.

319
00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:20,489
Speaker 1: Yes, but I'm probably gonna get it anyway, and if you are interested in old Oh Incredibly old Incredibly old anime then you should probably buy this as well.

320
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:27,567
Speaker 0: So Scott how many amusing or exciting anecdotes have you lived that you'd be able to relate during an evening with friends?

321
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:29,433
Speaker 0: a lot You see.

322
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,450
Speaker 0: that is the operative question in why are you doing this by Jason?

323
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,348
Speaker 0: Which is what we're going to review tonight?

324
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:43,490
Speaker 0: I'll more than one of you have pointed out that we haven't reviewed too many comics lately Partly due to the fact that I read very few comics.

325
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,122
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the only reason.

326
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:48,648
Speaker 1: if rim read more comics You could have more comics to review than we knew what to do it.

327
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,921
Speaker 0: granted We also realized that in all this time.

328
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:52,490
Speaker 0: We've never talked about Watchmen.

329
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:56,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna do that as soon as whoever borrowed it gives it back.

330
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, or maybe it's in the house somewhere.

331
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,217
Speaker 0: I got to do some searching.

332
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:09,397
Speaker 1: cuz I have piles of books in various place I'm actually considering shelling out the huge pile of money to get the big giant Oversized hardcover edition the absolute one.

333
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:10,520
Speaker 0: Does that come with anything?

334
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,465
Speaker 1: it comes of its big.

335
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,350
Speaker 1: it's better printing better.

336
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,503
Speaker 0: They come with anything other than just being a better version of itself.

337
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,150
Speaker 1: I think it has some extras in it.

338
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,014
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll look it up.

339
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:21,782
Speaker 1: All right, but it's it's huge.

340
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:23,510
Speaker 1: It's like bigger than an Atlas.

341
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:28,713
Speaker 1: It's it's Atlas sized and it's a big thick hardcover and it's almost $100.

342
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:29,762
Speaker 1: But I can get it for like 40% off.

343
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,255
Speaker 0: But why are you doing?

344
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,343
Speaker 0: this is a short comic by Jason.

345
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:34,543
Speaker 0: now.

346
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,977
Speaker 0: Jason who was born in Norway But lives now in France like most can tune it.

347
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,785
Speaker 0: cartoonists his glasses and his balding.

348
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,490
Speaker 1: and that's all we know about Jason.

349
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:46,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's all it says in this book and I looked around online.

350
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:48,509
Speaker 0: I didn't find much more about it.

351
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,354
Speaker 0: granted I didn't search very much.

352
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:56,630
Speaker 0: What I did discover is that much like Cher or Prince Jason's only name apparently is Jason.

353
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:02,527
Speaker 1: He seems to be a creator of comics most of them anthropomorphic but not in the porn way.

354
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:03,670
Speaker 1: in the the Looney Tunes.

355
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:08,829
Speaker 0: Okay way, I hate the fact that when you say anthropomorphic you have to add and not in the porn way.

356
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,898
Speaker 1: Yes It's definitely not in the porn way.

357
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,350
Speaker 1: It couldn't be further from the porn way.

358
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:17,021
Speaker 1: This is less porn than Looney Tunes or Mickey Mouse.

359
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:17,883
Speaker 0: It's almost.

360
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:21,970
Speaker 0: I wouldn't call it noir But it gives me that feeling.

361
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,653
Speaker 1: Yeah kind.

362
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:31,798
Speaker 0: I mean everything's very dark and subdued and all the characters are very expressionless and sad and Everything's kind of melancholy and dark the whole way through.

363
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:33,042
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it.

364
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:36,552
Speaker 1: Is that while it's the art is anthropomorphic.

365
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:39,703
Speaker 1: I mean you got dog people and bird people and rabbit people.

366
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:43,598
Speaker 1: those seem to be the only three and It does see I didn't notice any others.

367
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:44,160
Speaker 1: Do you do you?

368
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,730
Speaker 0: well, I didn't see any others even in the covers of other books.

369
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,152
Speaker 0: He's done.

370
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:51,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but everything and you know, it's drawn in a very cartoonish style.

371
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:58,033
Speaker 1: I mean he only colors with a bucket tool it seems but he's very good at choosing what colors he puts where You know.

372
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:02,410
Speaker 1: so that when it's nighttime, everything's darker and when it's daytime, everything's bright, you know.

373
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:06,049
Speaker 1: but he's only using the bucket tool as far as I can tell to do all the coloring.

374
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:13,579
Speaker 1: and Yet what happens is very real and very gritty and not unrealistic in any fashion.

375
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:21,936
Speaker 1: and it's completely And plus.

376
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:34,270
Speaker 0: while they can I mean the character designs are Incredibly incredibly simple and expressionless and yet they can convey a lot of emotion just for the way He uses them and the way they emote while they talk.

377
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,282
Speaker 1: I mean look at the feet the all these animal people.

378
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:42,410
Speaker 1: their eyes are just white holes And he sort of alters their size and position.

379
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:50,256
Speaker 1: you know to change where the people are looking and he does a lot with the mouths and the hair and Like the bodies like.

380
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,910
Speaker 1: I could pretty almost draw some of these characters that they're so simple.

381
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,442
Speaker 1: But the way like the poses he has them in in each panel.

382
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:59,690
Speaker 1: It's like, you know exactly what's going down.

383
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:05,439
Speaker 1: He doesn't need to make it any more complex to get across the story And at the same time the poses are very natural.

384
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:11,285
Speaker 0: the way the characters walk and act are much more like real people as opposed To a lot of comics where everything's very stylized.

385
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:11,950
Speaker 0: in that regard.

386
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:21,710
Speaker 0: I mean the main character is usually Slouching or sitting kind of looking down or away or generally not standing in any sort of cool or interesting position.

387
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:34,536
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that goes right along with the fact that all of the words in this comic all the writing mostly the dialogue is perfectly natural and Real world dialogue.

388
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:42,934
Speaker 1: Well, it kind of throws you off because you don't see that in a comic like even great Non-underwear pervert comics don't have dialogue like this.

389
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:44,240
Speaker 1: It's like whoa.

390
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:57,890
Speaker 0: I mean the cadences are natural The writing is simple and it's almost Hemingway esque in that the way the characters interact and the things they say to each other are just so short terse cut and dry.

391
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is similar to Hemingway.

392
00:28:59,996 --> 00:29:00,678
Speaker 1: Of course.

393
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:03,487
Speaker 0: Also Hemingway is brought up in during the course of this comic.

394
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,598
Speaker 1: Oh is oh, yes Yeah, I just remember that.

395
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

396
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:06,243
Speaker 0: Yeah.

397
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:14,730
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the thing I said at the beginning is a direct quote that pretty much Tells you what this comic is about in a very broad sense.

398
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:27,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they bring that quote up like two or three times during the story to sort of say Hey, this is what I'm trying to say in sort of you know, except he's not Yeah, it's the only thing he does non subtly I think in the whole book.

399
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,854
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is he's.

400
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,850
Speaker 0: it doesn't appear that he's trying to say anything particular.

401
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:42,590
Speaker 0: It's more that he's brought up an issue and he's explored the issue from about three or four different angles But he doesn't actually conclude with the typical and this is the way you should look at here.

402
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:43,916
Speaker 0: Here's how I feel.

403
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:47,130
Speaker 0: He just says like you end and you think well, isn't that interesting?

404
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I don't.

405
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:49,890
Speaker 1: I think he is trying to say something.

406
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,430
Speaker 1: It's just that the thing he's trying to say is a question and not an answer.

407
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,702
Speaker 1: I don't follow you as in I'm trying to say something.

408
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:04,023
Speaker 1: the thing I'm trying to say is a question mark at the end of It as opposed to saying something like this is the way it is.

409
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,849
Speaker 1: But is this the way it is?

410
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:12,172
Speaker 0: I don't think that's any different from what I just said where basically he raises a question and then looks at it from a few different Perspectives.

411
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:14,159
Speaker 1: this comic is really short.

412
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:15,864
Speaker 1: It's maybe what like 50 pages.

413
00:30:15,904 --> 00:30:17,389
Speaker 1: you think 40 pages something like that?

414
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:25,414
Speaker 0: Well almost I mean they list a bunch of his other works in the back and they all range from 64 pages to a Hundred or so pages.

415
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:27,803
Speaker 0: They're not very one of them's 48 pages.

416
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:28,405
Speaker 0: Wow.

417
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,690
Speaker 0: They're all about the same length.

418
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,966
Speaker 1: I think I'm definitely gonna get some of those other works after reading this one.

419
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:33,448
Speaker 0: Yes.

420
00:30:33,468 --> 00:30:37,233
Speaker 0: They're from Fantagraphics books Fantagraphics.com.

421
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:42,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, all his stuff is published by Fantagraphics who also publishes lots of other awesome things.

422
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:47,968
Speaker 1: But I forget any specifics now, but I know I have some I just don't remember what they are right now.

423
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,866
Speaker 0: Now basically, this is the story of two four.

424
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,193
Speaker 0: It starts out There are two friends.

425
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:56,350
Speaker 0: one of them apparently has been dumped by his girlfriend or has broken up with her there.

426
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,250
Speaker 0: They don't really go into exactly what happened But you can kind of piece together as the comic goes on exactly why he's down in the dumps.

427
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,017
Speaker 0: So he's doing that typical.

428
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,643
Speaker 0: I'm a depressed guy.

429
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,530
Speaker 0: Oh, no his girl trouble thing.

430
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:19,770
Speaker 0: So he's basically schlubbing it living alone in his house not going out not going to a job sitting around watching King Kong Sitting on the couch being a bum and he's got his smart cool friend.

431
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,069
Speaker 0: He was basically trying to knock him out of this slump and get him to get on with his life.

432
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,730
Speaker 1: That's that friend is very smart and very awesome.

433
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,010
Speaker 0: So then the friend goes out of town for a little bit and he's worried about him.

434
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:36,122
Speaker 0: So as a kind of a plot to get him outside doing things again He asks him to water his plants while he's gone.

435
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,406
Speaker 0: So no big deal.

436
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:38,450
Speaker 0: He goes to water his plants.

437
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:47,766
Speaker 0: I can't really say what happens from that point on without spoiling it but something Momentous occurs and the plot takes off from there.

438
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:57,124
Speaker 1: Yeah It's sort of hard with such a short comic to reveal any plot deals Details whatsoever because it's like the first plot.

439
00:31:57,164 --> 00:32:03,220
Speaker 1: detail is like a Quarter of the way through the book and that gives away the whole thing And then there's no point in reading it.

440
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,190
Speaker 0: if I tell you what happened Suffice to say I highly recommend this and I'm actually looking forward to reading pretty much everything else.

441
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:17,476
Speaker 0: This guy's written this comic for as short as it is tells a compelling story from start to finish Very succinctly and very well.

442
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:22,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree with one of the quotes on the back of the book that said it was Hitchcock.

443
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,329
Speaker 0: That is a very good way to describe it.

444
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,682
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you like like Alfred Hitchcock type of stuff where or like likes.

445
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:45,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, where there's sort of a complex criminal element going on where you don't know who's on what side or what people want or You're not sure which character is really doing what but you see them do some things and you get some ideas And maybe there's a twist at the end.

446
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:48,124
Speaker 0: It's definitely a thriller though.

447
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,290
Speaker 0: It's much more subdued than what you might expect.

448
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:59,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like while there were Some things were happening in the comic where in any other comic would be sort of fast paced and high energy.

449
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,219
Speaker 1: But here, you know, even though things were tense.

450
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:05,710
Speaker 1: It wasn't like I didn't feel like I was rushing.

451
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,421
Speaker 1: It was like moving along at the same pace the whole time.

452
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pace of this thing is generally very slow.

453
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,810
Speaker 0: You're kind of drawn from panel to panel at this steady slow rate.

454
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:17,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, the panels are also all the normal square panels.

455
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,283
Speaker 1: He didn't do a lot of you know, fancy manga style weird shape panels.

456
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:28,770
Speaker 0: Everything is very simple spreads I mean from the character designs to the art to the backgrounds to the panel design to the dot.

457
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,550
Speaker 0: Everything is just extremely simple.

458
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:37,710
Speaker 1: So the art doesn't in any way distract you from the story and the story is about as high quality as a comic story can be.

459
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:45,050
Speaker 0: Now before we end this slightly short episode I like to take incredibly short episode point out that we do have a contest running.

460
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:47,770
Speaker 0: We announced it last week and we're going to continue it for a while.

461
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:49,877
Speaker 0: The contest is very simple.

462
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:50,660
Speaker 0: MD.

463
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,410
Speaker 0: Geist is the second worst anime ever made.

464
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,561
Speaker 0: There is no arguing or disputing that.

465
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,230
Speaker 0: I think everyone in the world agrees.

466
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,497
Speaker 0: the UN is ruled.

467
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:04,341
Speaker 0: the United States Congress has passed a bill the Constitution of every country in the world that has a constitution has been amended.

468
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:04,883
Speaker 0: MD.

469
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:05,645
Speaker 0: Geist is it?

470
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:10,219
Speaker 0: the question is What is the worst anime that you have ever seen?

471
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,416
Speaker 0: We're not asking about what is the worst anime ever because that is Nearly as interesting.

472
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:18,489
Speaker 0: is the worst anime that you have personally seen all the way through?

473
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:23,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I mean I could go out on the internet and find out about some hentai.

474
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:29,409
Speaker 1: Where horrible things happen in the animation is blah or I could go out and watch earthy in.

475
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:44,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of bad anime I could go find out about but it's not often unless your name is Dave and or Joel that you sit around watching bad anime on purpose, so There are very few terrible animes that I've personally seen although there are some.

476
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:50,290
Speaker 1: So we want to hear about the worst anime you've actually seen and why?

477
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,889
Speaker 1: Don't just tell us what the anime is because a lot of people are just like oh this anime.

478
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:55,902
Speaker 1: Now you got to tell us all about it.

479
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:57,090
Speaker 1: Tell us why it was bad.

Speaker 1: Yes, and what you did after you watched it.

487
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,298
Speaker 1: I mean even if you finished watching was it?

488
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:27,071
Speaker 0: your parents went to the store knew that you like those animations saw wicked city and decided hey I'll buy this for little Jimmy or Was it?

489
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:33,090
Speaker 0: you're hanging out in college with your friend Scott who decides to bring over some anime that turns out to be porn?

490
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:37,510
Speaker 1: Or were you at an anime convention and they were guy was selling DVDs for a dollar.

491
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,796
Speaker 1: So you figured what the hell.

495
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,686
Speaker 0: Anyway, despite all warnings great digital target.

496
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:59,890
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't think many of our listeners have bothered to watch a great digital target, which is good You shouldn't you know, we've only seen it once even though it was probably the worst anime we've ever seen.

497
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:02,509
Speaker 0: I don't I mean Len mere is right up there.

498
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,439
Speaker 1: The legend of levity are is bad But I don't think it's great digital target or

499
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,403
Speaker 0: the lens min which

500
00:36:07,704 --> 00:36:07,985
Speaker 1: while

501
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:16,509
Speaker 0: I've seen the lens min Seven or eight times over the course of my life I have never seen it all at the same time without falling asleep at some point during it.

502
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:19,837
Speaker 1: Well, the books are really good here at least He's not.

503
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,750
Speaker 0: well, I don't know if the movies that bad.

504
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,199
Speaker 0: I always fall asleep about three-quarters of the way through.

505
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:27,229
Speaker 0: then I wake up at the end and I have no idea what's going on.

506
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,922
Speaker 1: Yeah Anime some anime just bad.

507
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:32,150

509
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,179
Speaker 1: Why would someone want to enter then?

510
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,590
Speaker 0: because as Dave and Joel pointed out the music's actually okay.

511
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:46,674
Speaker 1: Oh, is it really?

512
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:47,377
Speaker 1: I didn't listen to what.

513
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:51,916
Speaker 1: we just kind of ripped the mp3s off of the thing and it's not the best Music ever but it plus.

514
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:55,130
Speaker 0: I mean you get the actual original CD with all the liner notes and fun stuff.

515
00:36:55,572 --> 00:37:05,170
Speaker 0: Now if someone gives us a particularly good entry to where you don't only win, but you super win I'm gonna include the genocidal st as well, which I also have laying around.

516
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:07,410
Speaker 1: We also ripped the mp3s off of that.

517
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,408
Speaker 0: I don't know how the music is because CPM apparently was trying to murder me as you might have found out when we reviewed the New York comic-con.

518
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:15,615
Speaker 1: Yeah way to go CPM.
