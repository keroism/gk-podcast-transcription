1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,669
Speaker 1: It's Thursday November 9th.

2
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:15,952
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and I'm rim and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:18,818
Speaker 1: we discuss bathing and showering.

4
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:21,358
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:26,833
Speaker 0: It took me not one not two, but three hours to get to work today.

6
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:28,097
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

7
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:31,547
Speaker 1: I got to work Today faster than ever before.

8
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:35,879
Speaker 0: yeah, well because you don't really go into a heavily populated area.

9
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,060
Speaker 1: now I go from heavily populated area to a less populated area.

10
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:50,156
Speaker 0: See I would have been okay because the only issue really was that the sawmill River flooded after the torrential downpour the other day Which meant that the primary road I take to work was also flooded.

11
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,769
Speaker 0: of course They closed the road without telling anyone there weren't signs or anything.

12
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,259
Speaker 0: the road was just closed and no one knew what to do.

13
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,608
Speaker 1: What about the workers in the sawmill?

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,499
Speaker 1: did they have any trouble with their logs getting cut up for?

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,263
Speaker 1: Soggy or anything?

16
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:04,584
Speaker 0: you know?

17
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,717
Speaker 0: the sawmill River is like four feet wide right now.

18
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:12,633
Speaker 1: I'm being silly Actually being a sawmill there when there used to be you know 200 years ago.

19
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:20,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah That that was part of my joke though The thing is I would it would have been okay that only added about an hour to my commute.

20
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:24,540
Speaker 0: So where did this magical mystical third hour come from idiots?

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:33,719
Speaker 0: Completely unrelated to that on the way to work some jackass Just hit someone else and spun out and blocked the entire taconic Parkway for an hour.

22
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,254
Speaker 1: Oh, I never would have thought that would happen.

23
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:44,180
Speaker 0: and then later today I was driving around for work going to different places, and I saw three completely independent major accidents.

24
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:51,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, there seems to have been a sudden increase at least anecdotally from my perspective in major accidents on roads on which I travel.

25
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:53,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, just this was it.

26
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:58,759
Speaker 0: this more saw a nun yelling at a guy after she caught him off and got hit.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there was an accident on 52 this morning right in front of the Sunoco station, huh?

28
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,428
Speaker 1: It was either this morning or yesterday morning.

29
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,054
Speaker 1: It's morning, so I don't really remember too.

30
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,520
Speaker 0: Well really you really don't know.

31
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,351
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's today or yesterday.

32
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,720
Speaker 0: What did you eat for dinner yesterday?

33
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:21,916
Speaker 0: I Rest my chicken and potato all right.

34
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,285
Speaker 0: what we have the night before Pasta with sauce on.

35
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:31,142
Speaker 0: uh-huh you sure that wasn't the day before that and then we just crowned that other night I'm sure.

36
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,226
Speaker 0: are you sure?

37
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:35,958
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Captain Alzheimer of the USS something know.

38
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:39,393
Speaker 1: if I had Alzheimer I'd be like what am I doing there?

39
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,659
Speaker 1: What's his microphone here for?

40
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,043
Speaker 1: What's this again?

41
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,208
Speaker 1: talking stick?

42
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:47,720
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyway the interesting part about the whole what's your name, Sonny?

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,622
Speaker 0: was that I was coming in and the road was closed directly in front of me, and there was a traffic light and You could.

44
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,539
Speaker 0: basically the only thing you can do here is turn left, so the light is red.

45
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:03,530
Speaker 0: I cannot legally turn left even though there's no oncoming traffic.

46
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:08,218
Speaker 0: the lady behind me starts getting super pissed off that I'm not turning left now.

47
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,100
Speaker 0: Normally, I probably would have just run the red light.

48
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:18,650
Speaker 0: But if you look where I could have turned left onto the other road Traffic had filled that road all the way up to where I was.

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,680
Speaker 0: I would have run the red light and driven five feet.

50
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:35,331
Speaker 0: Not only was this lady honking continuously, but she started whining and yelling at me through her window come on Come on, just go just go come on come on come on come on Have not gone until she stopped?

51
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,760
Speaker 0: yeah, I did better than that.

52
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,736
Speaker 0: I got out of my car turn around and took a picture of her.

53
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:55,816
Speaker 0: yeah she got super pissed then and she ran around me and cut me off and made that left turn and Sat there blocking the road, and she couldn't get in And then I just pulled up behind her when the light turned green and followed her for the next.

54
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,363
Speaker 0: you know ten miles of this Trip.

55
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:04,760
Speaker 0: just kind of you know Sinking in the fact that she didn't really get anywhere other than frustrated by trying to make that red light.

56
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:09,260
Speaker 0: Why are people so to paraphrase Penn Jillette goddamn stupid?

57
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,806
Speaker 1: Because they didn't get an education.

58
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:13,368
Speaker 1: I don't know.

59
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:15,033
Speaker 0: no she's obviously well-dressed.

60
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,300
Speaker 0: She was on her way to a white-collar job somewhere.

61
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,325
Speaker 0: She probably makes within $20,000 of what I make.

62
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,704
Speaker 1: Probably I don't know.

63
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,450
Speaker 0: she was driving a really nice car.

64
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,433
Speaker 0: well not a nice car.

65
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,340
Speaker 0: She was driving a pseudo nice car.

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,158
Speaker 0: She had some Lexus.

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, car that's you know bit high on the prestige for people who care about that sort of thing.

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,420
Speaker 1: But everyone else goes wow look at that guy just trying to look good, but doesn't actually know shit about cars.

69
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:47,380
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever known anyone that I was friends with who owned a Lexus on purpose.

70
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't think.

71
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:59,580
Speaker 1: is there anyone who owns a Lexus because they think it's a good car and a good value for the money And they don't buy it because it's some sort of prestige icon sort of thing?

72
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:04,581
Speaker 0: See it's kind of like we were talking about the Escalade or the h2 Hummer the other day And how.

73
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:11,500
Speaker 0: basically these sorts of cars are really just the equivalent of the old yellow badges from Nazi Germany only instead of Jewish.

74
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:12,583
Speaker 0: They mean stupid.

75
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,028
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically.

76
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,817
Speaker 1: Hey someone made a purchasing decision because they're trying to Impress other idiots who care about consumerism and whatever.

77
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:23,660
Speaker 1: I don't know.

78
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:25,711
Speaker 1: It's sort of like.

79
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,540
Speaker 1: you know it's sort of weird.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,538
Speaker 1: I I could really see this contrast in my childhood because I was from New York like originally.

81
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:35,530
Speaker 1: well you Don't say you're from that yard.

82
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,820
Speaker 1: I lived there for like a whole year, but then I was in Connecticut.

83
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:43,339
Speaker 0: What you can't remember a single thing from that year can you I?

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,684
Speaker 1: Remember a couple things.

85
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:46,406
Speaker 0: what?

86
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,557
Speaker 0: what do you remember from the ages of zero to one?

87
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:54,400
Speaker 1: When my mom would bring me to that little park next to the the apartment there

88
00:05:54,761 --> 00:06:03,355
Speaker 0: Are you sure you remember that is you're not just making it up because I remember distinctly being bitten by a dog But my parents swear that it didn't happen when I was really really young.

89
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,499
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it happened I'm just saying that's what I remember.

90
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:08,893
Speaker 1: I remember a lot of things and my mom says I went to the park.

91
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:17,480
Speaker 1: so but the point is is I had a bunch of relatives in New York So I was hanging out with New York people in Connecticut people all Jews all had a bunch of money, right?

92
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:23,020
Speaker 1: But the New York Jews like for their bar and bought mitzvahs they would put on the big show.

93
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,878
Speaker 1: You know they would all be all showy with lots of jewelry and lots of fans.

94
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,060
Speaker 1: You know Yeah, jewelry all the all the Jewish ladies in New York were like loaded with jewelry.

95
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,648
Speaker 1: You know everyone really cared about.

96
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,391
Speaker 1: you know this sort of.

97
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,087
Speaker 1: I have expensive things So I'm better than you all showing off.

98
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,692
Speaker 1: and all the Connecticut people.

99
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:45,832
Speaker 1: while they had just as much money Usually even more they weren't so showy.

100
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,560
Speaker 1: you know they were much more utilitarian.

101
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:53,033
Speaker 0: I've pretty much lived my life exactly the same way regardless of how much money.

102
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:53,455
Speaker 0: I've had.

103
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:54,780
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much.

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,760
Speaker 0: I mean the only difference is on the bottom end of the scale of rims economic well-being.

105
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,889
Speaker 0: It got to the point where if it weren't for the charity of some friends.

106
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,747
Speaker 0: I probably would have starved to death, but I Don't think you would have died.

107
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:07,929
Speaker 0: No.

108
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,619
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have died, but it would have sucked.

109
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:13,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might have to eat bad gruel from the homeless shelter.

110
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:13,980
Speaker 0: It sucked anyway.

111
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:29,938
Speaker 0: I mean there were many days in the pretty much right before I went on co-op and made you know like $20,000 which was a lot when you're in college, and you don't have any expenses other than ramen Ramen.

112
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,499
Speaker 0: and I remember there were days where I'd wake up and I'd eat anything I could find in the house Which usually wasn't much?

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,358
Speaker 0: We'd have like one egg so I'd cook it and maybe a moldy English muffin that I toast real good.

114
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,899
Speaker 0: and then he Or actually we had a freezer full of ice cream mochi which lasted about one morning.

115
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:54,955
Speaker 0: I'd be on campus I'd be hungry, and I couldn't afford to buy any food so I'd be hungry until night.

116
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,420
Speaker 0: then I'd come home and eat some ramen Alright, so what's the news say?

117
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,170
Speaker 0: I only get into the news cuz my news is totally uninteresting.

118
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,680
Speaker 1: whatever we got to do a show alright.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,294
Speaker 0: so the thing I actually want to talk about and my news are kind of related.

120
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:18,491
Speaker 0: they involve the Pagan holiday that Christianity co-opted and turned into the birth of their Savior Jesus Mm-hmm you know aka Christmas yep the yule festival and all that yep.

121
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 0: now for a long time bit by bit stores have been not Saying things like Merry Christmas.

122
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,676
Speaker 0: They've been replacing everything with holiday sales and holiday stuff in order to avoid offending people.

123
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:42,754
Speaker 0: and now Walmart The stalwart defenders of everything wonderful that they are decided that they are going to stand up against this tide of Something by doing the opposite thing and they're gonna start saying Merry Christmas again.

124
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,436
Speaker 0: God damn it.

125
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:44,500
Speaker 1: You know what?

126
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,000
Speaker 1: I don't like either one.

127
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,935
Speaker 1: I don't like Christmas because I don't like religion, and I don't like political correctness.

128
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,906
Speaker 1: so no matter what decision They make I hate them either way.

129
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,834
Speaker 1: I basically hate everyone.

130
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:58,480
Speaker 0: I don't celebrate Christmas.

131
00:08:58,661 --> 00:08:59,383
Speaker 0: I haven't pretty much.

132
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:03,880
Speaker 1: You know what I would support them if they just didn't do anything for the holidays.

133
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:12,440
Speaker 1: They just ran their store as normal didn't change their store into Christmas consumer Hell you know around the beginning of November just kept doing business.

134
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:14,247
Speaker 0: Try the middle of October.

135
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:17,400
Speaker 1: I know I know, but they just ignored the holidays completely.

136
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,120
Speaker 1: Then that is the only way to avoid my ire.

137
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:23,750
Speaker 0: Well, it's really not easy to avoid your iris.

138
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,071
Speaker 0: God.

139
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:24,412
Speaker 0: No.

140
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:25,114
Speaker 1: No it is not.

141
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:29,385
Speaker 1: my iris is a Giant blanket covering the entire world.

142
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,668
Speaker 0: you can't avoid ten hours.

143
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:36,240
Speaker 0: Oh, no you can't Hey Scott, but where were you originally born?

144
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,220
Speaker 1: Mount Ireland?

145
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,995
Speaker 1: No, Ireland.

146
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,798
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway, but you see I don't care.

147
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:49,456
Speaker 0: either way I call it Christmas because I grew up in a family that celebrated Christmas in a 100% secular way.

148
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:55,160
Speaker 0: I also went to a Catholic school when I was very young where we'd have to go to church occasionally and pretend we believed in.

149
00:09:56,023 --> 00:10:01,386
Speaker 0: But Christmas was really more just the time when the whole family got together And I always viewed it as such.

150
00:10:01,427 --> 00:10:05,970
Speaker 0: and while I've never celebrated it as a religious holiday Until I went to college.

151
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,919
Speaker 0: I always celebrated it as a family holiday.

152
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:12,535
Speaker 0: Then I went to college and I couldn't exactly travel around so often anymore to my family.

153
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:30,879
Speaker 0: half my family moved to Arizona And then I moved to downstate, New York and last year my Christmas celebrations consisted of talking about our podcast that we were starting Dealing with the fact that Scott set off the burglar alarm on our house And we couldn't turn it off during which time it called 9-1-1 and the police came.

154
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,906
Speaker 1: now I think the next-door neighbor lady called 9-1-1.

155
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:36,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also called in I'm pretty sure cuz I cut a phone line.

156
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows I cut a phone line and a bunch of power cables to it all right.

157
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:43,627
Speaker 1: Yeah I think we ate at a Chinese buffet.

158
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, we ate at a mediocre Chinese buffet.

159
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,080
Speaker 0: That was the extent of my Christmas.

160
00:10:47,404 --> 00:11:02,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty typical The previous Christmas where I decided I was gonna fly home to Detroit and see my grandparents and my dad my brother and then Every single flight I was on was canceled for reasons ranging from mechanical failure to workers striking to a blizzard.

161
00:11:03,048 --> 00:11:11,660
Speaker 0: and I end up spending an entire day all of Christmas at Newark Airport drinking free liquor getting drunk and being bored playing my DS.

162
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:14,380
Speaker 0: Awesome that was an awesome Christmas.

163
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:22,540
Speaker 0: Then I got sick, and I went home And I played more DS while I was laying in bed sick in my studio apartment all alone in Fishkill.

164
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,208
Speaker 0: That was the best Christmas ever then.

165
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,733
Speaker 0: the dinosaurs can't be worse.

166
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,177
Speaker 1: I spent a Christmas once.

167
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:32,060
Speaker 1: I was in Rochester.

168
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,344
Speaker 1: I didn't leave Rochester.

169
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:34,789
Speaker 1: I was living in colony.

170
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,973
Speaker 1: No one was there.

171
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,140
Speaker 1: I think I went to China Gate alone.

172
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:41,880
Speaker 0: I remember that I felt bad for you cuz I went out to do something on Christmas.

173
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,572
Speaker 0: Then I came back and you were still there.

174
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:48,170
Speaker 0: yeah Hey, was that the year we went to Niagara Falls for New Year's?

175
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,497
Speaker 1: it might have been whatever.

176
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,360
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

177
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:57,565
Speaker 1: It's not worse than saying in an airport all day or being sick in a in a box all day Yeah, I was in colony.

178
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:00,635
Speaker 1: I had an OC 3. no one else was clogging up the network.

179
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:01,478
Speaker 1: I had good food.

180
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 1: I had money.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,593
Speaker 1: I was warm.

182
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,505
Speaker 1: It was good times.

183
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:15,079
Speaker 0: the best part was when they canceled my last flight, and I went up to the people I'm like all right fuckers, and I pretty much said it exactly those terms I want my money back.

184
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,820
Speaker 0: They gave me my money back, and then I said I want a ride home.

185
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,539
Speaker 0: And they said we're not giving you a ride home.

186
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:26,740
Speaker 0: And then I said you drove my ass from Stewart Airport an hour and a half to here.

187
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,410
Speaker 0: I don't have a car here.

188
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:29,679
Speaker 0: What do you want me to do?

189
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:31,610
Speaker 0: Pay me a cab.

190
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:32,800
Speaker 0: and they got pissed.

191
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:41,899
Speaker 0: But then they gave me an unlimited taxi voucher and I got in a cab at Newark And I said take me to Stewart Airport, and he said what?

192
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,259
Speaker 0: And I handed him this thing and it was like a hundred and forty bucks by the end.

193
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:51,360
Speaker 1: I didn't care and the guy like the taxi guy actually drove that far.

194
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:55,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only did he drive that far, but I talked to him the whole time about how shitty my Christmas was man.

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,843
Speaker 1: His Christmas even shitter.

196
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:58,465
Speaker 1: He's like man.

197
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:03,400
Speaker 1: I spent my Christmas in this fucking cab driving really really far away talking to this loser.

198
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:08,825
Speaker 1: All right my news Stefan Erickson.

199
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:14,667
Speaker 1: oh yeah, he's gonna join the ranks of Sony and What's his name Jack Thompson.

200
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,595
Speaker 1: in being in the news often?

201
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 0: Yeah except Jack Thompson?

202
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,522
Speaker 0: I don't know.

203
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,068
Speaker 0: They're different levels of absurdity.

204
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:22,779
Speaker 0: this guy is absurd for awesome reasons.

205
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:28,753
Speaker 1: Well, not really, but yeah this I think this guy actually give me the last time He's in the news because this this is the king.

206
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:32,214
Speaker 0: no no no I guarantee He'll be in news one more time, and that'll be when he gets shaved.

207
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:36,581
Speaker 1: it could be All Right.

208
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:47,540
Speaker 1: this is like the conclusion to this epic tale, so there's a guy named Stefan Erickson, and he's a bad Corrupt mafia dude from Sweden all right.

209
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:59,040
Speaker 1: And he decides to pull this big scam and make a video game system called the Gizmondo Which actually had a few interesting ideas and that it was a portable thing with the GPS and there'd be some GPS games.

210
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:00,203
Speaker 1: But no it was just.

211
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,788
Speaker 1: everyone knew was gonna fail.

212
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:02,591
Speaker 1: It was ridiculed.

213
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:03,333
Speaker 1: It was crappy.

214
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:05,700
Speaker 1: No one had any expectations for it.

215
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,200
Speaker 0: It was kind of like the that other fake console that didn't come.

216
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,846
Speaker 1: It's basically a big scam where he ripped off a bunch of investors Or you know the ps3 right.

217
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:17,620
Speaker 1: so this is the guy who he basically ran away to the u.s.

218
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:28,112
Speaker 1: He brought with him a Mercedes like Frickin McLaren or whatever our race car yeah, and an Enzo Ferrari of which there are only 400.

219
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:29,182
Speaker 0: well now there's 399.

220
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:32,356
Speaker 1: I think it's actually 398. someone else crashed one.

221
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,687
Speaker 1: Oh good job yeah, and those are like.

222
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,238
Speaker 1: that's like a million dollar ultra-rare amazing car.

223
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:41,713
Speaker 1: and He got drunk, and he crashed the Enzo.

224
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaker 1: and then weird shit happened.

225
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,324
Speaker 0: We like that.

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,940
Speaker 0: they started saying that someone else was yeah.

227
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:51,940
Speaker 1: He was like said someone else named Dietrich was driving, but Dietrich was never found.

228
00:14:52,543 --> 00:15:05,660
Speaker 1: yeah, and like these guys were posing as Homeland security officers and all kinds of weird shit Someone tried to steal some of the wreckage of the car.

229
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:13,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had a gun that was property of some Sheriff's like assistant like a deputy sheriff in his house.

230
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:20,879
Speaker 1: It was just all fucked up, but now they got him and he pleaded no contest to a bunch of charges.

231
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,372
Speaker 0: now I like the idea of pleading no contest.

232
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:29,593
Speaker 0: you're basically saying I May or may not have done whatever you're accusing me of but I'm not gonna fight it.

233
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,000
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean I'm saying I did it.

234
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,270
Speaker 0: It just means I'm gonna accept whatever punishment.

235
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,138
Speaker 0: I'm not actually admitting to anything.

236
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:37,968
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, that's fine.

237
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:40,160
Speaker 0: No one cool ever pleads no contest.

238
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,679
Speaker 1: So you play no contest.

239
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:59,200
Speaker 1: And he's going to jail for I think three years, and he's paying a lot of money and fines and after the three years He's gonna be deported back to Sweden where they'll probably put him in jail again because he's an evil mafia, dude awesome.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a drunken bad guy, and he ruined a perfectly awesome car.

241
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:05,259
Speaker 1: I could have had that car.

242
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:06,473
Speaker 0: No, you couldn't have.

243
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:07,222
Speaker 1: yeah I could have.

244
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:08,999
Speaker 0: I think you would have trouble with that car.

245
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:12,239
Speaker 0: Well that that car would have spelled bad news all around for you.

246
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,046
Speaker 1: What kind of bad news would have dispelled?

247
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:18,160
Speaker 0: you would have died within five minutes of turning on that car?

248
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,029
Speaker 1: I would have just brought it over to Watkins Glen.

249
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:20,894
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have died over there.

250
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, you would have Right into the wall.

251
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,400
Speaker 1: there is a. I guess there is a wall.

252
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,585
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go into it.

253
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:32,150
Speaker 0: if you go in any direction long enough you hit a wall or an ocean Probably a wall dude.

254
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,820
Speaker 1: I should have had it totally modded.

255
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,457
Speaker 1: So it'd be one of those car boats like the Enzo car boat should have totally had it modded.

256
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,099
Speaker 0: you didn't have it.

257
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:44,787
Speaker 0: That's that's quite a. it's like if I'd had that Enzo I would have totally I should have.

258
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,716
Speaker 0: I did have that Enzo, and I should have done blah to it.

259
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,610
Speaker 0: That's right, okay I said enough news for you.

260
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,418
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna cover the news again.

261
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:01,879

Speaker 0: We don't have a third person here.

266
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:12,474
Speaker 1: Oh, no I Guess that guy over there was just faking it.

267
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:12,999

Speaker 0: There's just a one-up mushroom.

272
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,098
Speaker 1: That's what it is the mushroom, okay?

273
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:36,052
Speaker 1: All right I'm just trying to be randomly crazy, but it didn't work.

274
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,358
Speaker 0: No it didn't work at all.

275
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:40,056
Speaker 0: you suck That was that was pretty piss-poor.

276
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

277
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,120
Speaker 0: I'm really sorry because it could have been funny.

278
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,112
Speaker 0: I don't know maybe if I'd done something different like pretended.

279
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,638
Speaker 0: There was a guy in the room with me.

280
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:49,724
Speaker 1: No, it's not necessary.

281
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:50,066
Speaker 0: Well.

282
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:56,888
Speaker 0: I guess there is a guy in the room cuz you know we've got we've got teller from Penn and Yeah, yeah, actually isn't funny.

283
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:09,832
Speaker 0: actually I thought the joke would have been funny except that I don't listen to the radio and Apparently according to Penn Gillette every radio show he's ever been on ever Has thought it'd be clever to act like teller was there too even when he wasn't.

284
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:14,857
Speaker 0: yeah like every guy ever thought They were being clever and none of them were.

285
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,746
Speaker 0: well No, I guess they all were independently.

286
00:18:16,786 --> 00:18:20,616
Speaker 0: they all discovered it independently kind of like how two people discover the light bulb at the same time.

287
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:23,248
Speaker 1: All right, what's your thing of the day?

288
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:26,040

289
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,727
Speaker 0: Orbit.

290
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:28,151
Speaker 1: I played it.

Speaker 1: It's good.

00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:29,020
Speaker 0: It's fun.

293
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:32,650
Speaker 0: I played it for about five minutes And I could have played it longer if I had.

294
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,800
Speaker 0: you know no life and nothing better to do.

295
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,640
Speaker 0: It's one of those games that you just play a little bit.

296
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,377
Speaker 0: It's not as fun as that drag sand around and then put oil in it and set it on fire.

297
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:42,240
Speaker 1: That's not really a game.

298
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,299
Speaker 1: That's more of a sandbox.

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,304
Speaker 0: Sandboxes are games.

300
00:18:45,465 --> 00:18:46,489
Speaker 0: games are sandboxes.

301
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,638
Speaker 1: I guess not really kind of.

302
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:49,000
Speaker 0: yeah.

303
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,258
Speaker 0: I made races between two trees to see which one would flourish.

304
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,122
Speaker 1: well That's that's.

305
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,970
Speaker 1: you created a game within the sandbox.

306
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, the game was making a game.

307
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:01,577
Speaker 1: I guess it doesn't have to be yeah.

308
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,828
Speaker 0: anyway It's a little fun game.

309
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:12,822
Speaker 0: where you take a comet you give it a little bit of velocity And there's a bunch of planets on the board and your goal is to make it orbit or generally avoid these planets for as long As possible.

310
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:17,335
Speaker 0: the planets thereby well during which are exerting gravity upon your little comet.

311
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,747
Speaker 1: a lot of it is trial and error You know try a vector doesn't work.

312
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:22,093
Speaker 1: try a vector doesn't work.

313
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:22,736
Speaker 1: try a vector.

314
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:30,911
Speaker 0: we it worked though I thought I was all smooth because the first time I played it the first three levels one I got the bonus skip a level bonus because I was so awesome.

315
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:35,476
Speaker 0: kind of by luck mostly by luck but to entirely by luck.

316
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:46,837
Speaker 0: I Wanted my comment to do really like cool things like go between two planets and a figure eight kind of thing and I Pulled that off a lot a whole bunch of times, and I thought I figured this out.

317
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,765
Speaker 0: then I realized that now It was totally random.

318
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 0: there was no amount of skill involved in that whatsoever.

319
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, you tried to find a lagrange point, and it you totally didn't find one.

320
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:58,504
Speaker 0: well as we determined the lagrange point was between two Pixels.

321
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,372
Speaker 0: so fuck that game.

322
00:19:59,554 --> 00:20:01,124
Speaker 1: yeah All right.

323
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:14,080
Speaker 1: my thing today is video from the Wii factory Where they make Or at least where they package the Wiis and where they also package the Wiimotes and the Zeldas.

324
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,048
Speaker 1: It's pretty impressive.

325
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,643
Speaker 1: if you look at the rate at which they make Wiis and Zeldas It's literally.

326
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:22,054
Speaker 0: it's like we are we are we are we?

327
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,232
Speaker 0: Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda Zelda.

328
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,100
Speaker 1: well, it's more like Zelda Zelda Zelda.

329
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:29,870
Speaker 1: It's like a Zelda a second.

330
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:34,388
Speaker 1: alright if I did the math They got ten days until this thing is out in stores.

331
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:48,319
Speaker 1: if they continue to keep this factory running and they actually are Manufacturing things at the rate at which you see them manufactured in the video They're gonna make 800,000 plus more Wiis between now and when it comes out.

332
00:20:48,883 --> 00:21:00,292
Speaker 0: I just like I mean you see this line this conveyor belt And there's so many Wiis coming off of it at such a rate, and then you know I kind of picture What's the ps3 line looking like.

333
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:01,417
Speaker 1: it's probably like the s3?

334
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,923
Speaker 0: Broken ps3.

335
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:08,807
Speaker 0: a ps3 missing apart Just like an empty box is a ps2.

336
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:13,531
Speaker 1: I Really a gamecube.

337
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:16,607
Speaker 0: they're making what not like 200,000 ps3s.

338
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:20,140
Speaker 0: they make that many Wiis in like a day or two in a few days.

339
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, at least if the rate of this factory in the video is to be assumed I'm sure there's like issues getting enough chips.

340
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,840
Speaker 1: You know eventually this factory is gonna run out of chips and they'll have to wait for another shipment.

341
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,003
Speaker 1: Maybe who knows.

342
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:45,980
Speaker 0: cuz I'll say when I worked at IBM, and you know the factory pretty much was going at full steam 24/7 all the time nothing ever really got hold held up because there weren't enough of a chip because they plan that shit out.

343
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:51,900
Speaker 0: I mean you plan I could go and actually I could go into really cool detail about how factories plan.

344
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,017
Speaker 0: You know the way They'll figure out their inventory and how to track things through the factory in different pads.

345
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:01,534
Speaker 0: yeah all the fun stuff I learned at IBM that is in no way applicable to any job.

346
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:02,540
Speaker 0: I'll ever want to have again.

347
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this video might not even be the factory.

348
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:08,682
Speaker 1: it might just be the packaging and warehouse because that's the only parts you Actually see.

349
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,713
Speaker 1: like you see people taking wiimotes that are already made and packaging them.

350
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,625
Speaker 0: you see all the minimum wage workers Drop in that's.

351
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,594
Speaker 1: this is the hilarious part of the video.

352
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:17,960
Speaker 1: is the minimum wage workers?

353
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:23,937
Speaker 1: Because this is one guy who has the saddest job in the world and his face is so sad.

354
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:32,899
Speaker 1: all he does is Weaves in cardboard boxes come down a conveyor belt and the conveyor belt is wide enough for two We boxes side by side.

355
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:44,600
Speaker 1: But the weeboxes come down one at a time and now they could easily make some sort of little Mechanism to put the weeboxes side by side in rows of two in a two by two instead of one by one.

356
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:52,005
Speaker 1: This guy is using his hands to move the wee boxes to make them two by two Instead of one by one.

357
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:52,567
Speaker 0: see now.

358
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,012
Speaker 0: That's a big thing in factories.

359
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:57,525
Speaker 0: Oh well first off this guy looks really Really sad.

360
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:02,937
Speaker 1: he is so sad like I just feel bad looking at him like oh, man Where did your life go wrong?

361
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,180
Speaker 0: Well it harkens back to when I had that factory job working for what I think was Pillsbury.

362
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I say I had a factory job.

363
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,420
Speaker 0: I worked there for exactly eight hours.

364
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,111
Speaker 0: Total it's one shift and my job.

365
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:20,437
Speaker 0: This is what I was really poor at RIT And I took a whole bunch of temp jobs.

366
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:31,300
Speaker 0: I was a Jewish caterer a bunch of times which was actually kind of fun Yeah, but I had to stand there, and there's this giant machine that was making a cinnamon apple pie.

367
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,896
Speaker 0: It's like frozen apple pies like full-size pies that would be put up by Pillsbury.

368
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:41,359
Speaker 0: at a rate It was literally pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie.

369
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,191
Speaker 1: And it was that's quite a bunch of pies for a full eight hours.

370
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:45,813
Speaker 0: Just pies.

371
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 1: are people eating pies at that rate?

372
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:49,363
Speaker 1: That's insane I don't even know.

373
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:53,880
Speaker 0: but it was literally was like all these different shoots at the end and all these people ready to box them.

374
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,955
Speaker 0: So the pot one pie would come down one slot and be the pie pie pie pie pie.

375
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:04,662
Speaker 0: down all these different slots and by The time it got back to the first slot the first guy had just boxed one of the pies Man.

376
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:09,260
Speaker 0: like if anyone fucked up at all they blow a whistle the whole thing would stop.

377
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,579
Speaker 0: They'd yell at someone and then it would start again.

378
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,350
Speaker 0: My job was that there were.

379
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,375
Speaker 0: there were these tins.

380
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,320
Speaker 0: you know the pie tins.

381
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:25,098
Speaker 0: I would load up thousands and thousands of them like by ripping them out of boxes stacking them up Carry them over and dump them in the top of this hopper.

382
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:31,169
Speaker 0: That was my hopper that was my entire job, I got a hopper Hopper.

383
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:40,298
Speaker 0: hey Jerry Yeah, so for eight hours one day with a half-hour break for lunch and two 15-minute union mandated breaks for whatever.

384
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:43,660
Speaker 0: I carried Pie tins and dropped him in a hopper.

385
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,387
Speaker 0: Wow yeah factory jobs suck.

386
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:51,640
Speaker 0: anytime I see a factory job it reminds me not to complain about my job at all.

387
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:57,619
Speaker 1: You know the thing is for someone out there for a lot of people out there They probably could have fun with a factory job.

388
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:13,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz once you get used to that you can just hang out with the people in the factory and all the Really really poor people working in this Pillsbury factory because they were making Like the bare minimum wage at this place, and I think I was making ten cents above that because I was a contractor.

389
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:20,460
Speaker 0: Yeah for that one day, but they really seem to enjoy themselves running around yelling at each other.

390
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,909
Speaker 0: They had this whole kind of camaraderie thing going.

391
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:24,656
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean just today.

392
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:26,506
Speaker 1: I was listening to Like.

393
00:25:26,707 --> 00:25:26,908
Speaker 1: it was.

394
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,633
Speaker 1: it was a pot.

395
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,660
Speaker 1: It wasn't really a podcast.

396
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:37,120
Speaker 1: it was a recording of a radio show, but they podcasted it of My band Doug Rushkoff and someone's interviewing about his book his newest book about.

397
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,715
Speaker 1: You know think inside the box instead of outside the box.

398
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:41,860
Speaker 1: I forget what the book's called.

399
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,724
Speaker 1: I have the book.

400
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:43,849
Speaker 1: I want it from him.

401
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,432
Speaker 1: He signed it.

402
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:45,497
Speaker 1: I haven't read it yet.

403
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,746
Speaker 0: Yeah You wrote that essay.

404
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:48,929
Speaker 1: I didn't write an essay.

405
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,775
Speaker 1: it was just I. it was a little contest.

406
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:55,352
Speaker 1: I answered a question, but anyway The he was talking about that.

407
00:25:55,493 --> 00:26:08,920
Speaker 1: there was a guy who was a trash man But he really enjoyed being a trash man And he optimized his trash truck so much and the way he picks up trash That the Union got pissed because he was doing it is making his route too quickly.

408
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,940
Speaker 1: See I'm not gonna get out of rent here, but you could think the rant we would make about that is obvious.

409
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:17,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I think it can.

410
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:23,964
Speaker 0: I mean Otacon has the same problem pretty much every a lot of things I run into more and more.

411
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:27,014
Speaker 0: I'm running into Union problems, and I don't like it.

412
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:27,355
Speaker 1: No.

413
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:34,380
Speaker 1: I don't all right Yeah, so yeah this Wii factory pretty cool with all the Wii's and all the Zelda games.

414
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:37,308
Speaker 1: Minimum wage workers hilarious.

415
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:40,020
Speaker 0: I hope that guy at least gets a Wii.

416
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:43,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy looked like he looked different from all the other people.

417
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,059
Speaker 0: I think he made a little bit more money.

418
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:48,905
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz there was only.

419
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:53,200
Speaker 0: he was the only guy doing his job, but there was a gaggle of people doing the other jobs.

420
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,977
Speaker 1: I don't know, but they weren't making much plus.

421
00:26:55,997 --> 00:27:01,556
Speaker 0: his badge I think was a different color was like yellowish, but that might have just been your monitor who knows okay?

422
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:06,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, so You kind of picked our topic for today, so I think you can introduce this okay?

423
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,952
Speaker 0: Cuz I had a different idea about what to talk about.

424
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,660
Speaker 1: no idea what to talk about today.

425
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:18,397
Speaker 1: So suddenly we came up with the idea of talking about showering and bathing in an entirely non-sexual way.

426
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:25,577
Speaker 1: yes But cuz you know apparently there's a lot of geeks out there who don't know how to shower and bathe properly.

427
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:35,117
Speaker 1: however and also Even if you do know how to shower and bathe properly and you do so there are many hilarious Anecdotes that can go along with such a simple everyday task.

428
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:45,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think back to an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer was talking about how it takes him forever to get ready like in the Morning like they're gonna go somewhere, and they're like Kramer.

429
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:45,956
Speaker 0: Just go take a shower.

430
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:53,547
Speaker 0: We'll go when he's like What I need like two hours, and they're like what and it turns out that Kramer Just didn't actually know how to shower.

431
00:27:53,868 --> 00:28:09,860
Speaker 0: so he asked Jerry for help and they get in the bathtub With or the the shower with bath bathing suits on and Jerry shows him how to shower like Don't wash each part of the body and rinse it wash the whole body then rinse the whole body And it was actually a really funny episode.

432
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:17,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's many other things talk about too like water pressure and Hard water and soft water.

433
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,311
Speaker 1: remember the episode where they had the hair was on.

434
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:24,247
Speaker 0: Seinfeld actually talks about this topic quite a bit Because it's a really important topic in New York City.

435
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it is low flow.

436
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:30,326
Speaker 0: I don't like this one bit Plus.

437
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:32,019
Speaker 0: we got that new technology to talk about.

438
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:35,640
Speaker 1: I think that's how we came up with the idea for this episode.

439
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:45,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though I wanted to talk about bad professors and teachers But we we Scott decided and I kind of agree now that we should probably think on that because I got to make sure I Remember I'd

440
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:49,859
Speaker 1: have to go through it grade by grade writing down teachers and what they did.

441
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,798
Speaker 0: well I had a lot of nuns as teachers.

442
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,880
Speaker 0: oh And one of them was a millionaire gave up her fortune really wow and you know what she didn't look very happy.

443
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:04,087
Speaker 1: Okay So Showering and bathing.

444
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:05,796
Speaker 1: how do you take a shower?

445
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:06,420
Speaker 0: well Scott?

446
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:14,488
Speaker 0: And I have very different shower procedures in ways that the more I've lived with him the more I've learned that we're very different in that way.

447
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:25,240
Speaker 0: one aside from all that I have very long hair so Showering is a 15-minute deal for me, and then another half hour at least worth of dealing with my hair.

448
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:28,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, and sometimes you don't even deal with the hair.

449
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,199
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if I need to take a quick shower I wash all of my body except the hair.

450
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, I shampoo every time.

451
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:38,797
Speaker 0: see I can't because once my hair gets wet I either have to do stuff to it or put on a hat.

452
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:46,520
Speaker 0: yeah Plus if I want a shower at night, and I get my hair wet I can't really go to bed with wet hair, and I can't quickly dry my hair.

453
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,287
Speaker 0: It takes a long time for my hair to dry mmm.

454
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I just shampoo every time.

455
00:29:50,636 --> 00:30:07,039
Speaker 1: the thing is my showers Can either be like one-minute affairs in which I clean myself in the shortest amount of time possible Or they can be like five to ten minute affairs where I wake up in the morning in the shower Or they could be longer where I spend a lot of time just relaxing in the hot water going.

456
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,479
Speaker 0: ah Yeah, I've often taken very long showers just for the fun of it.

457
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:27,865
Speaker 0: Yeah But I mean if the only consolation I guess I could ever have if I got cancer and I had to go through Chemotherapy was that if I lost all my hair, and I ended up being bald Showering I could wake up an hour later and still make it to work on time I could.

458
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:30,720
Speaker 0: I could shave and shower inside of five minutes.

459
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,211
Speaker 1: See like I kind of want to be bald for the comfort.

460
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:37,260
Speaker 1: the only reason I don't I'll shave your head.

461
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:41,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll shave your head is because then there would be problems in the hair.

462
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:41,880
Speaker 1: grew back.

463
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:42,929
Speaker 0: No, you just keep shaving it.

464
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:43,857
Speaker 0: What if you look like Yasu?

465
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,279
Speaker 1: I don't think I look like Yasu.

466
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:52,880
Speaker 0: You could probably pull it off if you shaved all the hair from the neck up and your dark sunglasses and smoked black cigarettes.

467
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:56,534
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna happen, and we're awesome, and we're in a rock band.

468
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,120
Speaker 1: I'm awesome, but I'm not in a rock band.

469
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,310
Speaker 1: Okay, so my shower procedure is pretty simple.

470
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,597
Speaker 0: I didn't actually tell my shower procedure.

471
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:05,440
Speaker 0: I guess you can do yours.

472
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,493
Speaker 1: Mine's real simple, so I'll go first right yeah, cuz captain doesn't use a washcloth.

473
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,560
Speaker 1: Just hey I use a sponge.

474
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:14,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a recent development for most of your life.

475
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,700
Speaker 0: apparently you just take a bar of soap and rub it all over your body.

476
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,644
Speaker 0: What's wrong with that?

477
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:20,990
Speaker 0: It's not how you shower.

478
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:21,914
Speaker 1: That's how they shower.

479
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:23,080
Speaker 1: and all the commercials on TV.

480
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:23,802
Speaker 0: You know what.

481
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,368
Speaker 0: that's not how humans shower.

482
00:31:25,488 --> 00:31:27,274
Speaker 0: Why not supposed to shower that way.

483
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,980
Speaker 0: Why not doesn't it work so well?

484
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,884
Speaker 1: It works just fine.

485
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:30,588
Speaker 1: I'm very clean.

486
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:37,544
Speaker 0: see I was the opposite tech in that I Rarely use soap My whole life.

487
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,671
Speaker 0: I never really use soap.

488
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,320
Speaker 0: when I showered you know what I smell just fine.

489
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,567
Speaker 1: Anyway, I get in the shower.

490
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:50,040
Speaker 1: I turn on the bathtub part, and then I turn on the shower part But I sure to aim it away from me, so I don't get wet right away.

491
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,149
Speaker 1: I got to make sure the temperature is just right.

492
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:57,100
Speaker 1: you know cuz sometimes you turn the water on right away And it'll be the first time the showers been turned on in the morning.

493
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:59,970
Speaker 1: So it'll be cold cold cold cold warm warm warm warm.

494
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,980
Speaker 0: the worst is when you're taking a shower in an unfamiliar bathroom.

495
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:13,068
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz every bathroom has its own little like mystery of how it works like the spots where it is and the thresholds and How hot the hot water is now cold.

496
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:18,593
Speaker 1: the cold water is and the worst is if you can't Like it used to turn the shower on then it blasts you.

497
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:24,140
Speaker 1: I always jump even though I know it's coming and that's why I have to have the handheld one so I can aim it away for myself.

498
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:27,540
Speaker 0: The worst is you know like some are real loose.

499
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:32,060
Speaker 0: You know like you turn the thing half a turn and the temperature barely changes.

500
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:37,257
Speaker 0: And then there's some where you just kind of tap the top it with your pinky, and it's 10 degrees hotter.

501
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:40,752
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, cuz it also doesn't help that our house.

502
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,500
Speaker 0: We have a somewhat small water heater.

503
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:51,749
Speaker 0: It's a mini water heater so in order to have and also the water heater is hooked in with our heat because we have gas Heat that heats water and pumps it through radiators all around the house.

504
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,160
Speaker 0: modern good radiators, not old shitty steam radiators.

505
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a it's an okay system.

506
00:32:58,388 --> 00:32:59,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually a really good system.

507
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:07,807
Speaker 0: It saves us a lot of money in the winter yep, but as a result our hot water is Just shy of boiling.

508
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,479
Speaker 0: you can just use our tap to cook ramen.

509
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,076
Speaker 0: Probably our tap will scald you if you just turn on our hot water and get it on your skin.

510
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:17,280
Speaker 0: It is dangerous.

511
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like that way.

512
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:22,240
Speaker 0: I like it that way too because we've never run out of hot water.

513
00:33:22,721 --> 00:33:24,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I get in the shower.

514
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,393
Speaker 1: I get I get all you know.

515
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,620
Speaker 1: I let the warm water heat me up.

516
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,343
Speaker 1: It feels good.

517
00:33:29,685 --> 00:33:32,419
Speaker 1: I get my hair wet, but I what hair I have at the time.

518
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:45,447
Speaker 1: And then I get some shampoo, and I go Rinse it out and then depending on what kind of a rush I'm in if I'm not in a rush I take out my sponge and I put some soap on it and then I go Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo.

519
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,880
Speaker 0: See I'm glad that you have added the sponge to your repertoire.

520
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:50,984
Speaker 1: I don't know what the sponge feels nice But I don't see how it.

521
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,272
Speaker 1: you know that much different because it scrapes your skin it exfoliates it pulls off Just a bunch of womanly whatnot?

522
00:33:57,313 --> 00:34:02,511
Speaker 0: no Yeah, are you saying that exfoliation doesn't actually happen.

523
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:03,233
Speaker 1: No.

524
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,580
Speaker 1: I'm saying is it's all a bunch of BS crap.

525
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:13,829
Speaker 1: They used to sell shit at the bed bath and whatever Scott you can exfoliate with your hands and water anyway.

526
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:19,574
Speaker 1: So and then if I'm in a rush though I just take a bar of soap and I rub it on myself, and then I run away.

527
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:20,600
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

528
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:23,739
Speaker 1: It works just fine, and then you know I'll.

529
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,286
Speaker 1: You know I'll take the.

530
00:34:25,406 --> 00:34:28,719
Speaker 1: if I have a shower massaging thing that I can take off the hook which I do.

531
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:30,559
Speaker 0: I don't want to hear about what you do with that.

532
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,743
Speaker 1: Just clean down.

533
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,467
Speaker 1: see you gotta have one of those cuz.

534
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:38,460
Speaker 1: how else can you clean down under where the shower can't hit you know?

535
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,710
Speaker 1: I don't understand like you go it.

536
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,880
Speaker 1: They just have a shower head mounted on the wall.

537
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:47,165
Speaker 1: There's no way to get that to hit you in the taint Like stand upside down in the shower.

538
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:54,906
Speaker 0: actually what I've done on numerous occasions is I'm actually kind of flexible for the kind Considering that I'm a 24 or 25 year old.

539
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:55,367
Speaker 0: I'm 24 right?

540
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:56,089
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah 24 year old.

541
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,352
Speaker 0: You're gonna be 25 real soon.

542
00:34:57,412 --> 00:35:06,020
Speaker 0: Yeah I am but I can pretty much lift my leg high enough and stand at an angle to wash my tank.

543
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,952
Speaker 1: No, I don't die if I can't get water to blast into the taint.

544
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,260
Speaker 0: I'll just I'll kind of go like this.

545
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:13,513
Speaker 0: I'm doing it right now.

546
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:17,575
Speaker 0: Oh I'm wearing clothes, but see you can't do this shit.

547
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:21,090
Speaker 1: I could do that shit You couldn't but I don't want to do that.

548
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,520
Speaker 0: what I'll do is I'll do what I just did.

549
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,619
Speaker 1: I'll just take soap and rub it down there, and then I'll cup water with my hands and splash it or I'll get down like this.

550
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:30,403
Speaker 1: That's no good.

551
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:31,988
Speaker 0: It works really well.

552
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,800
Speaker 1: another option is to just you know get the sponge and rub it down there.

553
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:46,900
Speaker 1: Or you know I could turn the tub on and then like get down into the the tub Blaster like just lay down in the shower, but that's kind of gross if the shower isn't clean which it's kind of dirty in there.

554
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the tub part is still really clean.

555
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:49,730
Speaker 1: No.

556
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,131
Speaker 0: It's not.

557
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,717
Speaker 0: there's stuff growing down there again.

558
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:52,600
Speaker 1: It's nothing growing on.

559
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,126
Speaker 0: There's a big stain.

560
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:54,628
Speaker 1: No it's.

561
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:56,856
Speaker 1: it's better than it ever has been it's not.

562
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:57,760
Speaker 1: it's right back to the way.

563
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:58,965
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not.

564
00:35:59,005 --> 00:35:59,206
Speaker 0: yes.

565
00:35:59,246 --> 00:35:59,627
Speaker 1: It is.

566
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:00,029
Speaker 1: It's not.

567
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:02,117
Speaker 0: I'll bring in two objective witnesses tomorrow.

568
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:02,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

569
00:36:03,681 --> 00:36:06,193
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, so I just cleaned my hair.

570
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,600
Speaker 1: I cleaned the rest of my body.

571
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,800
Speaker 1: I make sure I clean my feet like in between the toes behind the ears and all that.

572
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,720
Speaker 0: That's something that bothers me because while you've had a couple of fungus on your feet your feet are pretty good.

573
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,173
Speaker 0: They don't smell bad usually.

574
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:25,556
Speaker 1: they don't Smell bad if I'm wearing sneakers all day and running around and sweating in my socks And then at the end of the day I go.

575
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:36,210
Speaker 0: ah But I saw statistics a while ago that apparently like 80% of Americans have Moderate to serious fungus problems on their feet and their toenails.

576
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:37,534
Speaker 1: whoa look at my.

577
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,980
Speaker 1: my toenails look clean clear white.

578
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's white and pink.

579
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:41,693
Speaker 1: those the only colors.

580
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:44,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, I go step further And I'm dead serious.

581
00:36:44,746 --> 00:36:51,837
Speaker 0: my feet almost never smell at all and numerous people have pointed this out to me Like they just never smell like anything.

582
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:59,036
Speaker 0: Hmm, I blame mostly the fact that I'm always barefoot and I wash my feet But I can't understand how so many people have such disgusting feet.

583
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,324
Speaker 0: wash them Yeah, that's all.

584
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:10,660
Speaker 1: you get soap on the feet rub them a little bit get soap between the toes And then take your handheld shower massager and blast your feet so that they get all the shit off.

585
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,220
Speaker 0: Well, I think that one of the other big keys is to not really paint your toenails.

586
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why.

587
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:17,000
Speaker 1: I don't understand why women do that.

588
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,040
Speaker 1: I don't want to turn the topic of the show into toenail painting, but do you think toenail painting is attractive?

589
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,820
Speaker 0: I am mostly indifferent.

590
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,580
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying is that most guys are completely indifferent to toenail painting like they don't care if they're painted or not.

591
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:30,724
Speaker 1: There's a few guys.

592
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:35,060
Speaker 1: I'm sure that have like a toenail painting fetish, but most guys that I know are indifferent.

593
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:39,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, women insist on doing it some paying a lot of money for pedicures.

594
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,723
Speaker 1: You know what though?

595
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:40,929
Speaker 0: a lot of awesome women don't.

596
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:48,939
Speaker 1: yeah, pedicure is a lot different from painting And I know but I like that usually pedicure followed by nail painting and all kinds of craziness.

597
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,123
Speaker 0: actually I should go get a pedicure.

598
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:54,858
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't even like hand fingernails, you know, see I'm just generally.

599
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:57,210
Speaker 0: I Generally dislike makeup.

600
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,040
Speaker 0: I like yeah made on makeup.

601
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,207
Speaker 0: Granted makeup is cool.

602
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:08,929
Speaker 0: You know, like if you're going to a formal ball like a fancy party It's cool to get all dressed like we're gonna be on TV or on stage.

603
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,560
Speaker 0: I have worn makeup on a several occasions.

604
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:16,086
Speaker 1: Wow, I know I know you're gay.

605
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:18,914
Speaker 0: No, but way back when the RIT Anime Club.

606
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,420
Speaker 0: I was pretty much I was guaranteed to be president.

607
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:32,080
Speaker 0: I've been on the eboard everyone knew me everyone loved me But I was actually living way out of town during the elections So I couldn't give a speech or anything and it didn't matter because I was running unopposed.

608
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,959
Speaker 0: But then someone decided to run against me.

609
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:47,620
Speaker 0: So I there was no danger of me losing but I had to give a little speech and videotape it and mail it back to Rochester so they could show it to the club where I basically said All right, everyone vote for me and I actually put on some makeup.

610
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:54,379
Speaker 0: So I'd look better because my camera was kind of shitty and the light was really shitty and I recorded it once and I looked Kind of a bit shit.

611
00:38:55,541 --> 00:39:01,041
Speaker 0: So I powdered my face and then I put on a little bit and I looked a lot better and then I did it take Two.

612
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:03,750
Speaker 1: So what's your shower methodology?

613
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,071
Speaker 1: Mr.

614
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:04,874
Speaker 1: Fancy pants.

615
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:05,375
Speaker 0: All right.

616
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,359
Speaker 0: All right fancy pants.

617
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,219
Speaker 0: now I've been all right, so I get in the shower.

618
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:18,631
Speaker 0: Well first I lay in my room and I do as many sit-ups as I can until I shower because then I get all sweaty And it wakes me up real quick.

619
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:22,371
Speaker 0: So I don't wake up in the shower All right, and then, you know, I go into the shower.

620
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:23,174
Speaker 0: I set up.

621
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,159
Speaker 1: I wake up in the shower.

622
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:27,952
Speaker 0: I Usually brush my teeth first before I get in the shower.

623
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:28,655
Speaker 0: Huh?

624
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaker 0: That way I'm done with it.

625
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,443
Speaker 0: I was out of the way.

626
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:34,519
Speaker 0: It's done that taste that you wake up with in the morning is already gone.

627
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,206
Speaker 1: Mmm, see in the shower.

628
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,395
Speaker 1: I let like because they blast pretty hard.

629
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,824
Speaker 1: I'm all about high water pressure So I blast.

630
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:49,390
Speaker 1: I let the shower blast into my mouth and then I brush the teeth, you know Cuz all that fungus growing in that nasty busted old showerhead?

631
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,054
Speaker 1: no, it's not fungus growing in there.

632
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:54,343
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah there is it's fine It's there.

633
00:39:54,363 --> 00:39:57,253
Speaker 0: There's a lot of mold and other things growing.

634
00:39:57,314 --> 00:39:58,237
Speaker 0: Whatever.

635
00:39:58,337 --> 00:39:58,939
Speaker 0: I'll show it to you.

636
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:00,509
Speaker 0: You want me to show it to you?

637
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,200
Speaker 0: Do you believe it's there but you five bucks is there?

638
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,425
Speaker 1: It's not gonna hurt you?

639
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,040
Speaker 0: not probably not but I'd rather just brush my teeth.

640
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:12,540
Speaker 0: Anyway, and then you know while I'm brushing my teeth about halfway through I turn on the tub on hot.

641
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:16,120
Speaker 0: That way all the cold water in the pipe gets rushed out like a bum.

642
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:21,345
Speaker 1: So my problem is I go in and I pee and I flush and then I jump in the shower right away And now I got away.

643
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,730
Speaker 0: Oh, see I just pee in the shower.

644
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:23,775
Speaker 1: I don't do that.

645
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:24,980
Speaker 0: I always pee in the shower.

646
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:28,145
Speaker 0: If I shower I probably pee.

647
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:28,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

648
00:40:29,248 --> 00:40:29,589
Speaker 0: All right.

649
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,095
Speaker 0: I'll make the Seinfeld argument the George Costanza argument.

650
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:33,799
Speaker 0: It's all tubes.

651
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:46,560
Speaker 1: so, you know what the thing is is If I go into the bathroom to shower I have an urge to pee like if I go in I pee then I just walk out of the bathroom and walk back in Immediately like I'm gonna shower.

652
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:52,302
Speaker 1: I'll have to pee again no matter what really and like a one drop of pee will come out and then I can get in the Shower.

653
00:40:52,623 --> 00:41:06,820
Speaker 1: Wow, it's like my body knows when I go into a bathroom and the pee sensor just turns on automatically How it works, but it must be some connection there like entering a bathroom gotta pee.

654
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:13,363
Speaker 0: See I pretty much just I saw the hot waters going and then I finished brushing my teeth and right about then is when the scalding Water comes out.

655
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:16,757
Speaker 1: It's like if I was running away from the police and they chased me into a bathroom.

656
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:18,701
Speaker 1: I'd have to pee Huh?

657
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:19,243
Speaker 1: Yeah.

658
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,205
Speaker 1: All right continue.

659
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:25,660
Speaker 0: See I wonder though if you had that urge and the police could you would you just pee your pants?

660
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,519
Speaker 1: I might be the police Because I guess if I'm in a bathroom, it's probably a dead end.

661
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,225
Speaker 1: So it's time to give up.

662
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:34,172
Speaker 1: but if I'm gonna give up I'm gonna pee on the police.

663
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:36,600
Speaker 0: I cannot pee my pants.

664
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,631
Speaker 0: Furthermore I cannot like I could.

665
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:46,142
Speaker 1: if I and just sat there and held it in forever And I was in a car on a long trip and there's nowhere to stop It would.

666
00:41:46,162 --> 00:41:54,019
Speaker 1: I would eventually no longer be able to hold it after a long period of time or if I've got punched in the gut Of course that would immediately spill it out.

667
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,280
Speaker 0: But no there were a couple times where I'd be driving in a long road trip and I'd have a large empty water bottle or Something and I'm making good time.

668
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:02,198
Speaker 0: I don't want to stop.

669
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:18,939
Speaker 0: So I'd try to pee into something and I found that I simply could not Bring my body to open that little orifice and let my dragon drain When I was in a car or in any place other than a place for peeing.

670
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:20,928
Speaker 0: Now a tree is a place for peeing.

671
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:23,159
Speaker 0: pretty much any open space is a place for peeing.

672
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I'm sitting down and a car can't pee I've never tried it.

673
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:32,670
Speaker 0: It's actually it takes a little bit more logistical planning.

674
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,760
Speaker 1: did I imagine the hardest part would be continuing to drive safely?

675
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:38,595
Speaker 0: No, really easy actually because it was Canada.

676
00:42:38,615 --> 00:42:39,560
Speaker 0: It was a straight flat.

677
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,328
Speaker 1: That'll do it with cruise control.

678
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:44,276
Speaker 0: Like there wasn't even a chance of deer.

679
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:45,200
Speaker 0: It's just nothing.

680
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,130
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe I'll run into a Tim Hortons.

681
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:49,134
Speaker 1: How do you shower?

682
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:50,760
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah showers.

683
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:58,259
Speaker 0: So I get that water pretty much one step away from burning me to death and I stand there for a good five minutes.

684
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,400
Speaker 0: just.

685
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:02,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love that.

686
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:05,774
Speaker 1: it's like the best feeling except for drinking orange juice, which is a better feeling.

687
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,952
Speaker 0: and of course see sometimes I'll drink orange juice and do all that before I get in the shower.

688
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:12,096
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I can't do that.

689
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:15,248
Speaker 0: I'll run downstairs I'll drink a giant glass of orange juice.

690
00:43:15,268 --> 00:43:15,870
Speaker 0: Then I'll come up.

691
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:16,633
Speaker 1: No, I can't do.

692
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:20,627
Speaker 1: I gotta drink it right before I leave the house All right, so

693
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:30,718
Speaker 0: then I'll be in the shower hot water and I you know rub my body down relax a bit And then I take the shampoo of which I have three different kinds that I thought that I alternate

694
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:31,500
Speaker 1: whatever.

695
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,884
Speaker 1: It's all the same shit.

696
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,366
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

697
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:38,319
Speaker 0: cuz I actually in about two and a half seasons out of the air I'll get dandruff.

698
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:45,286
Speaker 0: so I use Selsun blue once or twice a week because that is like Fucking dandruff death right there.

699
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:46,611
Speaker 0: that kills all the dandruff.

700
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:56,974
Speaker 0: all the tea gel kills the dandruff but that gives you cancer also Yeah, because it contains I forget what it can do coal tar Whatever it's called Selsun blue actually works better than that stuff.

701
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:58,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah according to several stuff.

702
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,028
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on there's different causes of dandruff.

703
00:44:01,048 --> 00:44:01,550
Speaker 1: It depends.

704
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,400
Speaker 0: Well, the most common cause of dandruff is a fungus.

705
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:07,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you got the fungus one the Selsun blue works great.

706
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,439
Speaker 0: If you have the other kinds you should go to a doctor because you've got problems.

707
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, so I use the Selsun once or twice a week.

708
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:19,751
Speaker 0: I use head and shoulders most other days and about once a week I use this other shampoo just to wash it just to kind of balance it out.

709
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:26,493
Speaker 0: and also see I say that but it's mostly Just because that's my travel shampoo and it's a big thing.

710
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:28,239
Speaker 0: So I just kind of use it occasionally cuz.

711
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:31,235
Speaker 1: yeah I forgot to mention what soaps and shampoos I owe.

712
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,120
Speaker 0: you can get to that later.

713
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:33,788
Speaker 0: All right, cuz you wanted to know how I shower.

714
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:38,766
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz and that's how I know you're gay Asking rim how we showers.

715
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:42,920

716
00:44:45,504 --> 00:44:46,052
Speaker 0: I don't know.

717

00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,880
Speaker 1: I know but that's those are the important bits.

728
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:23,877
Speaker 0: Yes armpits asshole crash and teeth and for the vast majority of my showers for my whole life.

729
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:24,820
Speaker 0: I didn't use any soap.

730
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:27,740
Speaker 0: I just rub myself down with really hot water and a clean washcloth.

731
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:36,277
Speaker 0: Now lately, I'll use shampoo because it acts more as kind of a fragrance and I smell nice for the rest of the day as opposed to smelling like nothing.

732
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:51,439
Speaker 0: and also lately because I've been exercising a lot and I've been doing anaerobic exercise since I'm lifting weights now and I found that when I lift weights, my sweat is a quite a bit more foul than when I do anything else.

733
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:52,363
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

734
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,849
Speaker 0: It seems to be the way it rolls.

735
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:59,672
Speaker 0: So if I lift weight, I get some smelly sweat So I use soap then to make sure that all goes away.

736
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:03,005
Speaker 0: But if I go running I smell normal I just happen to be sweaty.

737
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:03,608
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

738
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:10,674
Speaker 0: Then I rinse all that off of me Then I rinse out the shampoo then I dick around for a while.

739
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:11,617
Speaker 0: Enjoy the hot water some more.

740
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:12,420
Speaker 0: rub myself down again.

741
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,720
Speaker 0: You know, I enjoy my showers rubbing yourself down not in that way.

742
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,453
Speaker 0: I can't really masturbate in the morning if that's what you're getting at.

743
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:19,900
Speaker 1: No, I can't do it in the morning either.

744
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it's there.

745
00:46:21,426 --> 00:46:22,169
Speaker 0: It's ready to go.

746
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:24,920
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's like if it is a morning wood and you go for it.

747
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,502
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

748
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,630
Speaker 1: I mean it works, but it doesn't work in a good way.

749
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,413
Speaker 0: It just sucks.

750
00:46:28,594 --> 00:46:30,220
Speaker 1: Yeah morning wood is not useful.

751
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:31,344
Speaker 0: No, it's useful.

752
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:34,935
Speaker 1: Well, it's useful for pleasuring women, but not for pleasuring yourself.

753
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:38,773
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah Then I load up on the conditioner.

754
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,119
Speaker 0: I use like eight different kinds.

755
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:43,895
Speaker 0: Okay, not like all at once like I'll use one until it runs out.

756
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,180
Speaker 0: then I buy a different one till it runs out.

757
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,304
Speaker 0: I buy different till it runs out.

758
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:50,259
Speaker 0: I have this kind of random cycle where I buy whatever one smelled nice at the time.

759
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,507
Speaker 1: That's usually my judgment is which one smells.

760
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:54,089
Speaker 0: so recently.

761
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:57,660
Speaker 0: I bought some suave conditioner for men and it totally sucks.

762
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,274
Speaker 0: Alright, it's just it's terrible conditioner.

763
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,440
Speaker 0: It seems to be this wave.

764
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is not like the world's wave.

765
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:11,853
Speaker 0: Then I leave that in for a while and I enjoy the hot water again at that point usually wash my face and start Soaking my stubble in preparation for the shave.

766
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:19,020
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if I'm gonna shave I totally just stand with my face like getting blasted by hot hot water from the shower for like a whole minute.

767
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:28,665
Speaker 0: But and then I jump out and shave and then here's the trick I set it to cool or coldish water and I rinse my hair Mm-hmm real.

768
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:34,140
Speaker 0: and then I do this occasionally because it's it's a really awesome adrenaline rush.

769
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:36,839
Speaker 0: I'll just turn that full-on cold water and stand under it.

770
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:52,065
Speaker 1: Yeah If you need to wake up Like in the morning the best thing to do I only do this like if I'm super sleepy and I have to wake up real Quick is you just go in there you stand in the nice warm water and just take the knob and you go Cold normal like

771
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:52,587
Speaker 0: wait what?

772
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:53,691
Speaker 0: No, no.

773
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:55,517
Speaker 0: No, you're a goddamn pansy.

774
00:47:55,557 --> 00:48:05,051
Speaker 0: if that's what you do You stand there in the water on hot and you deliberately put your hand on the dial Jerk it all the way to cold and don't move your ass.

775
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:06,857
Speaker 1: You know in like five seconds later.

776
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:07,680
Speaker 1: You're like fuck.

777
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:22,298
Speaker 0: In fact, you know what I have never not yelled fuck when I've done Because I don't do it often because I think this will feel really good after I get over what I've just done to myself but without fail.

778
00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:31,549
Speaker 1: Shit see the thing is it's so much worse if you're if you have it done hot and then cold and then hot as Opposed to if you just turned it cold in the first place.

779
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:39,848
Speaker 1: you ever done that experiment where you have like a bucket of warm Water and a bucket of cold water like go do this If you're if you're curious take two buckets.

780
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:45,325
Speaker 1: fill one bucket with perfectly lukewarm tap water Like room temperature water.

781
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:50,880
Speaker 1: take another bucket and put cold water with a bunch of ice in it like freaking freezing cold water, right?

782
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,986
Speaker 1: Put your hand in the warm water.

783
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:54,351
Speaker 1: it will feel warm.

784
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:57,400
Speaker 1: then put that same hand in the ice water.

785
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,646
Speaker 1: It will feel freezing cold.

786
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:04,460
Speaker 1: now take your other hand that you didn't use yet and put it in the ice cold water.

787
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:08,119
Speaker 1: It'll be cold but not as cold as it felt with the other hand a minute ago.

788
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:11,509
Speaker 1: Now take that hand and put it in the perfectly lukewarm water.

789
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:19,160
Speaker 1: It will feel hot like ow your temperature sensors are all relative They're not absolute, you know, which can get you into trouble sometimes.

790
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,933
Speaker 1: But in the shower, you said it's a hot and then cold.

791
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:27,280
Speaker 0: Oh, man, though I gotta say it's weird cuz in the summer like I'll often take a cool shower.

792
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:30,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but even then I have to start with a hot shower.

793
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:36,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't start with cold water unless it's a hundred degrees and I'm in the Sun.

794
00:49:37,403 --> 00:49:41,219
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is if it's a hundred degrees and you're in the Sun the water is actually heating up.

795
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,356
Speaker 1: So you need the cool water.

796
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:44,764
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

797
00:49:44,784 --> 00:49:46,632
Speaker 1: So what do what shampoos do I use?

798
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:47,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll wrap this up.

799
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,560
Speaker 0: We've got a while.

800
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:57,775
Speaker 1: So most recently I've been using all this suave like for men Shampoos and soaps and things but I think they discontinued most of them.

801
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:02,299
Speaker 1: I was buying them because they were cheap And they smelled okay, they smelled kind of manly.

802
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:10,897
Speaker 1: But now I think most recently I bought like suave completely normal shampoo that smells like apples Which is cool because I like apples, huh?

803
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:17,100
Speaker 1: And when I need a bar of soap, I always get coast and if coast is not available I get Irish spring.

804
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:21,653
Speaker 0: See it's weird because I actually really prefer lavender or lilac.

805
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:23,820
Speaker 0: I really like anything that has lilac smell.

806
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they're a woman.

807
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:25,787
Speaker 0: Okay.

808
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:29,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just get apples or maybe like strawberries or melons.

809
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, and apples and strawberries are so much more manly captain man fruit.

810
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:39,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, root is more manly than flowers, I don't know.

811
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,176
Speaker 0: lilacs are awesome.

812
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:42,418
Speaker 1: they're not manly.

813
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:42,999
Speaker 0: yeah, they are.

814
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:44,000
Speaker 0: they're so manly.

815
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:48,459
Speaker 0: Yeah to use my favorite phrase it's like two Vikings having sex.

816
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:50,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

817
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:52,594
Speaker 1: Are we done talking about showers?

818
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:54,200
Speaker 0: I think we're done talking about this.

819
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,228
Speaker 0: Hopefully next time we'll do.

820
00:50:56,248 --> 00:50:59,380
Speaker 0: I don't know my idea where we're talking about bad professors.

821
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:06,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I need to do is spend like a half hour Maybe not even a half hour just like a few minutes to think about all the teachers have had throughout the years.

822
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:08,826
Speaker 0: See I haven't had so many bad teachers.

823
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,880
Speaker 0: I've just had really really mediocre teachers.

824
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't had anyone who was evil like.

825
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:21,270
Speaker 1: I've had some teachers who were like good, but there was a bad aspect I dropped out of like four classes.

826
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,038
Speaker 0: just cuz I didn't like the cut of the teachers.

827
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:25,381
